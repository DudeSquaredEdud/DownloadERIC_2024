The model is framed within the perspective of conflict theory, and includes consideration of the roles which both elites and leaders play in the formulation and dissemination of collective reality. Additionally, consideration is given to the emergence and legitimation of alternative realities and ideologies, and the ways in which these alternatives find their way into the mass media. (Author)",

This relationship may be affected by the subordinate's level of communication apprehension. This study hypothesized a main effect for participation permissiveness and an interaction between that permissiveness and communication apprehension. Dependent measures include supervisor and work satisfaction, supervisor competence, character, sociability, composure and extroversion, task and social attraction, power and quality. Findings supported the main effect hypothesis. No support was found for the interaction prediction. A post hoc explanation for the findings suggests a general negative evaluation of the high  apprehensive supervisor. (Author)",

        "description":"The primary purposes of this paper are to describe the basic tenure system in higher education, to identify the sources of dissatisfaction with this system, and to make some recommendations about an Association for Communication Administrators (ACA) position on the subject of tenure policy and procedures. Four basic elements of the tenure system are outlined and discussed. The criticism of the tenure system is widespread and comes down to two basic arguments. First, the system interferes with the ability of an organization to adjust to the economic and social constraints which govern its operation. Second, the system can serve to only maintain the status quo. It is argued that the only serious alternative to the basic system is a scheme which includes periodic review and term  contracts. Seven recommendations for an ACA position on tenure are outlined and include: the current financial problems of higher education should be dealt with in such a way so as to not restrict the tenure system of protecting academic freedom; and in the case of an unfavorable tenure decision, the candidate should be provided with a full statement of the justification of this decision.

        "description":"Unlike most of the regulatory constraints which have impact on the media, libel, slander, and invasion of privacy are common law concepts developed from the precedents of previous court decisions and from reasoning employed in the written judicial opinions of appellate courts. Since common law is thus both traditional in nature and subject to rapid changes, the courts' handling of these concepts in relation to the media is complex, as may be seen in several specific court cases. Basically, the American system protects individuals who might be seriously damaged by irresponsible abuse of the first amendment freedoms (free speech and free press). That is, you can say it, print it, or broadcast it, but you must be prepared to face the consequences of your actions. No society has  developed a better system in terms of freedom with responsibility for the media and protection for the individual. (JM)",

        "description":"Circular reasoning is often employed in comparative advantage debate cases when only a plan and advantages are articulated without adequate reference to the resolution which inspired the proposal. The advancing of such subtopical analyses as debate cases is deleterious to the long-range interests of educational debate because the practice jeopardizes debate programs when witnessed by people outside the college debate fraternity, and the practice is often a waste of time because of fallacious reasoning, analysis, and argumentation. It is time to reexamine the concept of prima facie and to redefine burden of proof. It is recommended that a logical test be imposed by any critic to determine whether circular reasoning is present and that debate practices make sense to lay persons.  (TS)",

        "description":"Based on the rationale that improved literacy skills in children can be most effectively obtained by first improving their oracy skills (auding and speaking), a special oracy instructional program was developed consisting of a workshop to train teachers in teaching oracy skills, sets of structured stimulus materials for use by teachers in teaching oracy skills, and an oracy test to assess the oracy capabilities of students. The program was administered during the 1974-75 school year to selected primary level teachers and students of the River Rouge, Michigan, School District. An oracy test was administered to project and control students before program implementation and as a posttest upon completion of the program. Oracy test results showed that the instructional program was an  effective means for improving oracy skills of students. (Author/JM)",

However, because it is easy for thrusts toward racial and ethnic consciousness to degenerate into racial and ethnic hate, it is necessary to define the ethnic self in ways that will not conflict with the needs of a world community. In searching for ethnic identity, one must achieve a world view which understands and appreciates the integrated set of primary, philosophical, and intellectual assumptions that bind humans together regardless of their ethnicity. Then, in a true search for self-identity, one is left with the basic questions about the universe, the earth, and man, for which George Washington Carver, Martin Luther King, Jr., and the N.A.A.C.P., among  others, have sought answers.

        "author":["Barbatsis, Gretchen Schoen"],
        "description":"The history of research concerned with the use of television for instruction has been replete with statistically non-significant and inconsistent results. Studies for almost two decades have focused on the comparative effectiveness of television with other mediums of teaching. The research focus of the Children's Television Workshop provided a contrast to the great bulk of the existing instructional television studies. This paper examines the two bodies of research from the point of view of theoretical progress achieved by two different approaches to scientific inquiry: summative and formative. Examination of the historical and research context indicates that the approach of summative research has been premature in the field of communication research regarding instructional  television. Formative research, on the other hand, demonstrates the need for the preparatory, exploratory type of study necessary in a field where the testable variables are yet to be discovered. (Author)",

This is an especially effective method of conducting leadership training because it allows each individual to integrate the cognitive, behavioral, and effective levels of learning within any of a variety of educational settings. Videotape is employed in two ways during training simulations: to provide feedback to participants about their own behavior, its consequences and effects, and the process of their group and to provide input of new material into the simulation. The most impressive aspects of simulation are the facilitation of participants' acquisition of cognitive learning occurring elsewhere in training sessions and the depth of  participant involvement.

Standards of professionalism for speech communication personnel vary according to the specialization in this diverse field. Since guidelines can not prescribe accurately what a person trained in speech communication should know or perform in many different areas, speech communication will probably continue an advisory versus a prescriptive approach to professional standards. The author presents five standards which he considers appropriate for speech communication: (1) Have a strong sense of identity with professional colleagues. (2) Have a sincere concern for the development of young professionals. (3) Be active in professional organizations; attend meetings and conferences; read  and contribute to professional journals; serve on committees, commissions, and task forces; and vote, nominate, and communicate approval or disapproval on matters of policy. (4) Assume a personal and continuing obligation for maintaining and augmenting professional knowledge and skills. (5) Accept high ethical standards in all professional relationships.

Achieving these objectives entailed performing a comprehensive literature search; reviewing--by correspondence and telephone--the experiences of 11 other school districts that had had recent similar experience; interviewing key KCSD administrators; reviewing the extensive and comprehensive study of the KCSD done in 1973; interviewing all current members of the school board; assembling 10 objective criteria for ranking the elementary  schools; formulating a model policy statement; and developing and specifying procedures for implementing consolidation policy. The decision model, proposed board of education policy, and policy implementation steps are included here. The 10 objective criteria on which the decision model is based are the following (in order of adjudged importance): achievement levels, facility cost per pupil, space per pupil, teacher load, racial or minority balance, age and general condition of the buildings, auxiliary facilities, commuting distance, number of pupils, fuel requirements.

Curriculum development should also reflect that humans have being only as they maintain themselves in an environmental setting. Curriculum developers can no longer behave as though the school was outside the mainstream of life.

Within the current political-educational policy structure, prospects are dim for solutions to such complex issues as state funding of schools and equalizing educational opportunity. Political and educational feuds prevent creation of a new educational policy structure and eliminate any possibility of solutions to these problems. It is also doubtful that the controversial issue of educational decentralization will be resolved. The impact of teacher negotiations and unionization should be described as illusory, since it is difficult to verify either  harmful or beneficial results from such negotiations. Most benefits that can be documented seem excessively costly to unionized teachers, though nonunionized teachers in neighboring districts enjoy a beneficial spillover effect. (Author/JG)",

The key features of the system are objectivity, minimum transportation impact, minimum transportation cost, proven application, availability, responsiveness, and economy. In implementing the plan, institute representatives meet with school district representatives and key school board members to determine the implementation schedule and to describe the school redistricting planning process; the district supplies basic information concerning the location of schools, the location of students, the ethnic  group to which the student belongs, and certain policy information; the institute puts this information into a form that can be read by the computer and modifies the computer programs that will process the data; all information and programs are computer processed; the institute reviews outputs to determine compatibility with the school district requirements; and computer-generated plans are provided to the school district.

        "description":"The change in the equality of per-pupil expenditures of 22 metropolitan Milwaukee school districts before and after the implementation of the Wisconsin new power equalization formula for school finance is investigated in this study. The equality of per-pupil expenditures for line items that compose the current operating expenses of a school district is computed using the traditional standard deviation statistic and the Gini coefficient. The values of these statistics are compared for the two years that straddle the implementation of power equalization, 1972-73 and 1973-74. The results demonstrate that the equality of per-pupil expenditures increased for most of the line items and for total current operating expenses after the implementation of district power equalization. An  extensive bibliography is included. (Author)",

        "description":"Competent school administrators should keep up-to-date on areas of information relating to their field and might find useful the following 12 most important elements in a performance accountability code for school executives: strive for fair and equitable treatment of the staff; make competence and performance the key to promotion; make decisions without undue delay; be consistent and do not vacillate; delegate responsibility and support those to whom you delegate; be understood; keep your word; find time to show concern for misfortune, to commend excellence, and to offer encouragement during stress and difficulty; be warm and human and operate with the smallest possible ego; follow through and remember significant details; admit your errors; and hear all sides when a big  decision is coming up. Perhaps the most crucial test of a superintendent.s competence today is his or her ability to resolve issues in the face of hostility ranging from innuendo to threats of physical violence. There are three steps that can be taken to cope with hostility. (Author/IRT)",

That is, most needs assessments are topic-oriented; consequently, little beyond the topic of concern is ascertained and decisions as to all other details of the program are made on the basis of distinctly limited knowledge as to what participants will find most attractive and/or educationally profitable. Under the belief that the scope of needs assessments should be widened, the questionnaire appearing in Appendix A was constructed. The results of the  survey are not presented so much to guide action as to portray the nature, scope, and usefulness of information that can be made available to the designer of an inservice program. The questionnaire deals with the following areas: the climate of receptivity for programs, factors that have hindered participation in programs, the scheduling of programs, the program site, the kinds of learning activities included, the topic, and the rewards and motivations for attendance.

The two hundred years of our country's history demonstrate that in the past the schools have met new needs and have responded well to growing demands for education. An examination of several of the problems schools are now encountering finds bases for confidence regarding the future. The experience with Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act demonstrates that schools can, albeit slowly, devise new programs and new ways of working with disadvantaged children. A number of high schools have already worked out with various persons and agencies in their communities ways by which youth can work constructively with adults to render  service, to obtain firsthand experience with the wider world, and to gain assurance that they are becoming responsible adults.

First, the professional administration that runs our schools, led by superintendents and their management teams, is in the best position--perhaps the only position--to implement improvements in education. Second, school boards (and the individual members who make up the boards), as now designed, are more likely to impede than to implement change. Third, teacher unions are politically unable and, of necessity, too self-serving to bring about internal reform. Fourth, parents and student groups do not possess professional judgment and without an effective, innovative, and aggressive school administration to implement their concerns cannot bring about the kinds  of reform required to make our system of education work. The speaker proposes action that would strengthen the role of the superintendent, more carefully define the board's role as policy-maker, and change the current model of school governance.

This plan restores the principalship to its rightful place in the line of authority, power, and responsibility. Under the plan, the principal assumes responsibilities such as classroom visitation and conference and is paid a percentage bonus for these tasks. The restructured job description for the building administrator encompasses three basic areas: public relations, improvement of instruction, and management services. The implementation of the model would, over time, produce a school organization with a more open climate and  encourage collaboration in decision-making. The model would produce concomitant increases in personal respect and commitment among and across disciplines and grade levels. The model is a comprehensive plan suitable for inservice and preservice modes, and could be used in its entirety or in bits and pieces. (Author/IRT)",

Included are examples of ideas, timeliness, surveys, news releases, and other practical, use-tested details. All levels of educational organization--state departments to local staff-should be involved in the dissemination process. Although state departments can offer strategic advice and encourage media support, it's the action of the local districts that most critically influences students, parents,  taxpayers, and staff. Suggestions are included for briefing staff and media so they can reinforce, rather than undercut, the program's purpose. And, finally, how a specific school handles the facts and figures in its own report to parents and the community is examined in detail. (Author)",

Since no sampling procedures were used, generalizations presented in the report do not relate to a specified population of educational systems, and no inferences can be made about the relative distribution of specific practices. Following a brief introductory chapter, chapter 2 examines the organizational structure of educational systems in various countries. Chapter 3 outlines some categories of  educational administrators, their major functions, and the distribution of personnel in selected educational systems. Chapter 4 discusses policies and practices governing the qualifications of administrative personnel. Chapter 5 examines approaches to the preservice and inservice training of administrators. Chapter 6 considers various issues related to the training of administrators, and chapter 7 presents a number of proposals and recommendations for future consideration. (Author/JG)",

The theoretical model that emerged from the study indicates that first-year elementary school principals without previous experience as an elementary school vice principal or assistant principal generally come to the principalship with the expectation of being able to effect change by means of their personal involvement in the classroom. Several hypotheses developed from the study relate to the initial perspective of these first-year principals, the major problematic situation they encounter, and the new  perspective toward which they move during their first year. The study indicates that this change in perspective is effected primarily by the requirements of the job itself rather than by interaction with alter role occupants. (Author)",

Easton's political systems theory serves as a conceptual framework for the study. In addition, Lindblom's leadership model, Truman's interest group theory, and Wahlke's legislative role theory model are also used to focus on different aspects of the school finance policymaking process. System inputs responsible for the new finance formula are categorized as changes within the legislature's environment and changes within the legislature. Identified environmental inputs include citizen's demands for property tax relief, judicial pressures for school financing changes, and the  state's revenue windfall. Major demand articulators include Wisconsin's governor, the Democratic party, and several organized groups within the state. Legislative inputs include the Democratic majority in the assembly and the Democratic majority on the joint finance committee. In conclusion, six hypotheses are formulated and discussed based on what actually occurred in Wisconsin. (Author/JG)",

The authors' topic is curriculum development, centering on the opportunities for growth and development for all who are influenced or affected by the guidance of the school. These opportunities and activities are provided through the various forms and arrangements for instruction. That these supportive forms and arrangements for instruction have varied through the years of our independence as a nation is evident in the several contributions included here. Curriculum development, though relatively young as a science, has nevertheless shown much vitality in schools and schooling since our founding. Even a  casual look at the record shows that many curricular practices have been adopted and abandoned, readopted and reabandoned. A historical work such as this might help us keep from being swept off our feet by every \"new\" panacea. The major chapter titles are \"Education for All: The Triumph of Professionalism,\"\"Building Curriculum: Influences and Mechanisms,\"\"Schooling and Control: Some Interpretations of the Changing Social Function of Curriculum,\"\"Diversity and Conformity in American Curriculum,\"\"Sisyphus Revisited,\" and \"Sources for Curriculum History.\" (Author/IRT)",

The closed system of operating allows externalities to impact on it, and there is a continuing emphasis on reacting. With the benefit of modern technologies in communications, science, educational techniques, and data processing, the closed operational system can move to an open sociotechnical system that allows for more responsiveness to externalities and changes from a reactive to an active planning mode.

The administrators and staff of the organization had participated in a feasibility study that was developed and conducted to prepare the subsets of the organization for the change. The purpose and objective of the study was to review all the operational systems of the school district and to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing computer capability to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of these operational systems.

In the 1960's education seemed particularly vulnerable to a realignment of forces because it has traditionally had some elements of localism and a degree of separateness as a governmental service based on the nature of its clientele, children, and the indirectness of its results. Two studies of the responses of political parties to realigning forces and the impact on intergovernmental relationships are summarized. The first is about the decentralization of New York City schools and the role of state government. The second is about the changing role of the English local authority and control of education.

Additional hints that can help get the job  done include: (1) plan budget cuts each year on a descending basis; (2) consolidate and tighten programs while you have the time; (3) commit yourself to specific high-priority programs; (4) consolidate teacher needs gradually each year; (5) evaluate the value of all tasks and programs; (6) involve staff in all aspects of planning; (7) establish a planning priority for budget cuts; (8) search out innovative and valuable organizational patterns; and (9) create an opportunity for teachers to participate in the program evaluation process.

The policy designates a maximum of 12 absences per semester as the maximum allowable for each student under normal circumstances; after 13 absences from any class, students risk forfeiture of credit and can be dropped from class enrollment. The policy also provides that after a student's fourth, eighth, and twelfth absences from any class, his parents will be sent a written form indicating the dates of the student's absences. During the first year under the new attendance policy, absenteeism at Napa High School was reduced approximately 50 percent, from an average of 8 to 10 percent for  1972-74 to 4.5 percent for 1975.

Even indepth studies attempting to establish a ranking of jobs for compensation purposes have not found general acceptance by school systems. Instead, a school corporation is more likely to study the salary structure of other similar corporations and make comparisons and adjustments on this basis. Such studies usually result in the establishment of a base salary, which then may be adjusted by factors relating to experience, size of school, level of education, and responsibility. Organizations of local school administrators have a role to play, but this role should be determined by  professional people acting in a professional way. (Author)",

Perhaps the best known example of open education is Chicago's Metro High School: the city is its curriculum; the community is its learning laboratory; and its lesson is freedom, choice, and responsibility. Open space schools are designed to allow evolution in educational philosophy and to accommodate the vast variety of instruction relevant to present and future world conditions. However, teachers and principals must begin to consider open space in terms of the potential manipulation of many subspaces, a manipulation directed by  innovative learning activities. Flexible design alone cannot guarantee flexible use. (Author/MLF)",

The evaluation strategy had three phases: documentation of all field  activities as well as participating schools' followup activities, pre- and posttesting of teachers and principals as to knowledge of and attitudes toward evaluation, and external evaluation through the Auditing and Advisory Committee as to feasibility of implementing the model, instruments, and procedures on a statewide basis.

Suggestions are given on how to use the media and the services of the school system's communication specialists. The third part helps to complete the process by giving suggestions on how to communicate effectively in face-to-face situations and how to obtain feedback from various groups. (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to provide some background to the school finance problem in Connecticut, to digest parts of three financial reports, and to provide a framework for further discussion. The reports were sponsored by the Connecticut Education Association, the Governor's Commission on Tax Reform, and the Education Finance Study Commission of the Connecticut State Legislature. Each group studied the problem for many months, issued its report, and then awaited governmental action. The findings, conclusions, and recommendations of each study were very similar. No action has yet been taken. Two concepts supply the background to the discussion: equal educational opportunity and fiscal neutrality. The concept of equal educational opportunity, though always fuzzy, is the  concept of educators and implies that more money be spent on children with special needs. Fiscal neutrality, the standard of lawyers, would guarantee to every town the same number of dollars per pupil for any school mill rate that town chose to levy. It is judicially manageable and does not destroy the concept of local financial control; however, it addresses itself strictly to finance problems and not to educational problems. Each of the three studies mentioned proposes something like the fiscal neutrality plan. (Author/IRT)",

The committee's solutions to &quot;senioritis&quot; focus on three areas: the school, the school and the community, and the school and colleges. The school itself can take certain steps to improve the senior year such as providing independent study, student-managed courses, early graduation, and varied courses. Within the community, work-study programs, student intern programs, and student volunteer programs can be provided. Schools and colleges can work together to provide early admission, advanced placement, and credit for college courses. The committee recommends maintenance of the senior year, maintenance of current high school diploma requirements, focus on optional programs,  articulation of high school and postsecondary education, the sharing of course evaluation and planning with students, and the encouragement of equal opportunity for non-college-bound students. Appendix A provides an extensive list of sample programs for enriching the senior year. (Author/IRT)",

Data for the study were gathered from questionnaires completed by 342 male and female elementary and secondary teachers from four New England school systems. In addition to certain personal information, data were obtained on measures of role preference, projected time commitment to a career, commitment to teaching, expectancy of professional support, perceived likelihood of recruitment, self-role congruence, achievement motivation, and aspiration level toward administration. Findings of the study indicate that although the percentage of female  teachers with administrative aspirations is much lower than for male teachers, a much greater percentage of women aspire to those roles than is indicated by their representation in the profession.

Several components make up a sound program of financial management. Resources are basic, and these vary from district to district. Before asking for additional support, school administrators must be sure that all available resources have been fully utilized. Enrollment must also be considered. Without good data about expected enrollment, sound financial management is impossible. Another important component is staffing. Staffing a school system is a complex matter, and its cost factor is the largest in the school budget. Careful planning is another component of sound financial management, and a budget calendar is absolutely  necessary in planning. Also vital is a careful followup to ensure that various departments stay within their budgets. Federal funds are available, of course, but qualifying for federal money is a mixed blessing if a school system goes broke in the process. In conclusion, sound financial management can be summed up in one word--responsibility. (Author/JG)",

The first study dealt with turnover in the superintendency subsequent to defeat of a single incumbent board member; a significant relationship was found between incumbent defeat and involuntary turnover in the superintendency. The second study focused on the selection of new superintendents following incumbent defeat. This study showed that &quot;new&quot; school boards selected &quot;outsiders&quot; to replace superintendents who left their positions subsequent to changes on the board. The third study dealt with predictors of incumbent defeat. The strongest predictors identified were (1)  percentage change in assessed valuation eight years prior to the first defeat of an incumbent, (2) percentage change in average daily attendance in the three-year period prior to incumbent defeat, and (3) the ratio of votes against incumbents to total votes cast in the school board election immediately before the election in which an incumbent was defeated.

In addition, the author discusses several other expected demographic and social changes that will have important implications for educational policy planning. These changes include a long-term change in the labor market resulting in a teacher shortage sometime during the 1980s, an increasing trend toward mid-life career  switching, and a possible decline in college attendance due to a rising incidence of families with several children of college age at the same time.

Using a survey instrument developed through pilot study application and factor analysis techniques, data were collected from 1,030 registered voters in three Kansas school districts that had held recent bond elections. Regression analysis revealed significant predictive relationships between socioeconomic variables and voting behavior in each district and for the combined sample, using both actual past and hypothetical future voting patterns. However, attitudinal variables were found to have limited predictive power. From a synthesis of variables with significant beta weights in the regression equations,  a quasi Personalistic Socioeconomic Status Voting Theory was proposed as a partial way to explain and predict variations in voter responses to school financial referenda.

Much of the content is based on a model for setting educational objectives that was developed in Indonesia in 1972. The booklet consists of three separate chapters prepared by different authors. Chapter 1 presents a simplified self-instructional module for setting educational priorities based on the Indonesian model. Chapter 2 describes the Indonesian model in detail. Chapter 3 reviews various techniques of priority-setting and examines a number of basic constructs leading to the value contribution method on which the Indonesian model and  self-instructional module are both based.

The efforts to provide an information base were organized into four tasks: to determine the nature and extent of the problem of school violence, to determine what efforts are being undertaken in schools to reduce school violence, to determine what kinds of help schools need, and to determine how other federal programs help schools solve specific problems. The federal programs examined are Right to Read, Drug Abuse Education program, the Civil Rights Training and Technical Assistance program, the Dropout Prevention program under the  Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) Title VIII, Teacher Corps, and ESEA Title III. The recommended program emphasizes the provision of technical assistance to local agencies by regional staffs of experts.

        "description":"When parents in Cupertino, California, became dissatisfied with the nontraditional, unstructured education offered in their district's elementary schools, they created the Academics-Plus alternative program. This account of the history of the 3-year-old A+ alternative school is written by one of its original promoters. The elementary level A+ program is a back-to-basics program, utilizing traditional curriculum that emphasizes reading, writing, and other language skills, in addition to math, history, and other standard subjects. The classroom environment is structured, with one teacher in charge of a mixed-abilities group of students. Student conduct and appearance are more stringently controlled than in nontraditional classrooms. Although the program has received strong support  from parents and endorsement from the school board, it has encountered criticism and resistance from some teachers and administrators who regard the alternative program as an insult to their professional performance. However, the program's proponents believe that its conventional, basic education approach is only one style of education, not necessarily appropriate for all students, and that the district should continue to offer more than one educational alternative.

        "description":"Although some critics of public education are now questioning the value of compulsory schooling for all children, this concept is deeply ingrained in American history and social values. The first compulsory education law in this country was enacted in 1642 in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The Puritan notion of education as a moral, social obligation was thus given the sanction of law, a pattern later followed by nineteenth century crusaders for free public education. By 1918, all states had passed school attendance legislation, although until the 1930s, many were unsuccessful in enforcing their compulsory schooling laws. However, as the population increased, and as the demand for well-trained labor grew, the bureaucratic machinery for enforcement was created. Of course, not all  elements of American society have supported compulsory public school attendance. Court cases dealing with Consitutional issues have arisen from the opposition of some groups to mandatory schooling. For example, the 1972 Wisconsin v. Yoder ruling by the Supreme Court granted Amish parents exemption for their children from laws compelling public school attendance past the eighth grade. (DS)",

        "description":"Private education (both church-related and nonsectarian) has been an integral part of United States history since the colonial period. Until late in the nineteenth century, the concept of public, government-supported education was far from widespread. The notion that the government is responsible for providing free education for every child developed very slowly and did not gain general acceptance until after the Civil War. The transition from the idea of education as an extension of church and family, to the idea of education as a function of government and society as a whole, was very gradual. But once the concept of public education took root, conflict arose between private and public schooling. Often this conflict took on ugly racist and anti-parochial overtones. However, the  conflict between public and church-related schools did not mean that public education was free of religious bias. Public education is still characterized by Protestant values, though their influence has progressively diminished. Public and private schools must solve complex problems arising from their frequently uneasy partnership. Both types of schools are essential in educating the nation's youth. (DS)",

        "description":"Louisiana's sabbatical leave law for public school teachers and state college faculty is one of the most liberal in the nation. Teachers are granted the right to sabbatical leave for purposes of professional or cultural development, and for rest and recuperation. While on leave, they receive partial salary compensation. The state of Louisiana spends approximately $5 million annually on sabbatical salaries. However, state law does not presently require that teachers on sabbatical leave return to the school system that granted them leave. Statistics indicate that only slightly more than half (59 percent) of the teachers granted leave for professional improvement returned to their original schools, while only 51 percent of those on rest and recuperation leave returned. Thus, in many  cases both students and the public fail to benefit from the teacher improvement that sabbatical leaves are intended to nurture. The Public Affairs Research Council recommends tightening the sabbatical leave law to require, for example, that persons on leave return for one year to the school system granting them leave, or be compelled to refund salary pay received during the sabbatical. A survey of leave policies and laws in other states is included. (DS)",

In response to what was learned from the surveys, the authors designed and conducted an informational workshop for substitutes in the elementary schools in Eastern Henrico County (Virginia), devised and developed a handbook for substitutes, and ascertained whether the information workshop,  procedural suggestions, handbook, and evaluation guidelines helped improve the performance of the substitutes.

Indications from measuring the gestural communication of 5 dysfunctional Ss following communication training include that there was considerable variability among Ss' level of communication; that spontaneous communication lagged behind both receptive and reproductive communication; and that gestural communications involving verbs of action and nouns were the easiest to teach. A study involving eight autistic, eight normal, and eight retarded children is cited as an attempt to assess the children's ability to distinguish basic elements of human speech.

Among findings revealed are that police officers in Illinois do not have the training to detect symptoms of developmental disability; that judical  personnel support community based programs and special institutions as alternatives to prison for developmentally disabled offenders; and that community agencies tend to provide developmentally disabled offenders services such as referral and recreation rather than more expensive services such as special living arrangements or training.

Results of studies dealing with effects of mainstreaming or special class services are reviewed in terms of social acceptance by peers, self concept, and attitude toward school. Four models to improve delivery of services to handciapped children are compared. Also reviewed are effects of socioeconomic influences on school achievement and adjustment and followup studies on the effects of special education. Identified and discussed are new directions such as more process oriented (rather than outcome oriented) evaluation approaches, a decrease in the categorization of children using  medical and psychological terms, attempts to match students to teaching systems, and prevention of later disability through early identification and intervention.

Cited is the need for more discussion on a theoretical basis in order to design constructive research and develop more effective teaching strategies based on examination of optimal learning conditions for handicapped children. Compared are two theories of treatment: the simple integration theory (in which handicapped students are taught together with nonhandicapped pupils), and the intensity theory (in which handicapped students receive individualized teaching in any type of special education arrangement). The author suggests that the indensity theory is the more promising  one. (Author/CL)",

Prevention efforts are noted to proceed along three distinct levels: promoting healthy development for all youth, focusing on youth who appear to be on the road to delinquency, and reaching youth who are already juvenile offenders. Two sections include descriptions of small-scale (such as individual services, special education provisions, and work experience) and large-scale (area intervention in cities including Chicago, New York, and Washington, D.C.) intervention programs. Results from action-oriented and research-oriented delinquency projects are reported and the research methodology used in  evaluation of programs is examined. Studies on the problems and evaluations of youth service bureaus are cited. Outlined are three models for prevention (including a model for developing a community resource system) and proposed policy directions (in such areas as deinstitutionalization and school responsiveness).

The paper is reported to be based on personal observations during private piano instruction, published and unpublished literature, and a summer workshoP on teaching learning disabled children to play the piano; and some of the technical terms from the fields of music, psychology, and learning disabilities are defined. A survey of related research covers the topics of the functions of the central nervous system during piano playing and the processes and problems involved in reading music from the score. In a third chapter, the data from teaching experiences is presented in the form  of case studies to illustrate the implications of topic areas from the previous chapter for learning disabled children (7-15 years old). Among conclusions were that the processing of the verbal language used in music is probably similar to that of verbal language processing in other subjects; therefore, to be successful in understanding musical language, the child probably needs language integrities; and that there is need for further research in the area of music and the learning disabled child.

The findings include field research related to (1) prevalence of exceptional children in Idaho school districts and communities; (2) services presently available, including Child Find, and services for which need is indicated to meet state legislated mandates; (3) manpower available and adequacy of potential training resources; (4) consumer satisfaction with present services for exceptional children and possible satisfaction with new alternatives; (5) present and alternative finding patterns for special services and educational programs; and (6) identification of legislative considerations  necessary to implement training, programing, and finance patterns. It is noted that the needs assessment format applied to Idaho's special education services has replication potential for other states.

The test contained 22 subtests covering seven major syntactic structures: relativization, conjunction, complementation, pronominalization, question, formation, negation, and the verb system. Although results showed gradual improvement of deaf Ss' performance, the improvement was slight and the retardation in comparison to hearing Ss was large. Developmental stages for deaf Ss on the structures tended to parallel the stages reported for hearing children. Certain distinct structures, apparently rule ordered, were found to appear consistently in the language of  the deaf Ss but rarely or never in the hearing Ss. Comparison of the deaf Ss' knowledge of the various structures with the appearance of those structures in a series of reading texts analyzed during the project revealed differences so large as to make it unlikely the deaf subjects could read the texts. It was concluded that instruments for the assessment of syntactic structure, and curriculum materials tailored to the language of deaf children, need to be developed. (Author/LS)",

        "description":"Thirty deaf children admitted to an auditory training program before age 2 were studied longituninally to age 40 months in an investigation of the effectiveness of early intervention, the relationship between mother-child interaction and language acquisition, and the effectiveness of new devices developed for auditory training. Among findings were that Ss admitted prior to 16 months old showed greater language competence and that mothers of Ss with better language skills were less coercive and more sensitive and accepting to their children. Affective aspects of mother-infant interaction were more highly correlated with the child's language aquisition than were technical aspects of the mother's language. Devices developed to reinforce vocalization and to stimulate receptive  language in Ss from deaf homes included a sound activated mobile and a Teddy bear. Problems such as technical difficulties and insufficient child interest led to the conclusion that the devices were of limited value. Subsequent experiments which provided direct auditory and speech training services to deaf parents seemed more promising.

In a section on assumptions and issues, the teacher's role is discussed in terms of classroom innovation and development of attitudes, skills, and abilities in students; and alternatives for teacher training programs are outlined. Two criteria necessary for teachers of the gifted are noted to be an ability to relate effectively to the group of youngsters being taught and an openness to change; and suggestions for assessing teacher competency are given. Presented is an analysis of various preservice training programs and a comparison of the major methodological differences in them, as well as a review of past and current practices.

        "description":"The purpose of the study reported in this paper was to investigate the effectiveness of music as a mediation factor in the learning and retention of lexical units in German language sequences. The main question to be considered was whether or not the addition of melody and rhythm would constitute an aid or a hindrance to the Ss in learning the body of a text, as measured by retention of individual items within the sequences originally presented. Thirty-eight subjects, nineteen boys and nineteen girls, were selected from seventh grade beginning German classes in a midwestern junior high school. Two media consisting of four songs and four dialogs were used. Tests for retention of items in the original context were of four types: German-cued recognition, English-cued recognition,  uncued recall, and English-cued recall. A German-cued recognition test was used to retest all items in a different context. The results indicate that music is an effective mediating factor in the learning and retention of lexical items in German language sequences, and that boys in particular appear to benefit in learning such materials with addition of the kinesthetic and sensory experiences afforded by listening to and singing songs.

        "description":"Children who speak the black dialect usually are low classroom achievers. Teachers must understand differences between Black English (BE) and the reading text. This paper shows how black children experience difficulties with reading programs. Three basal reading series are analyzed. Initial Teaching Alphabet - phonics; Scientific Research Associates - spelling patterns; and Scott Foresman - look-say. Reading comprehension involves external cues, cues within words, cues in the flow of language and cues within the reader. There is abundant evidence that a reading program succeeds as it relates to students' language habits. The phonology, morphology and syntax of BE are analyzed here. The three methods of teaching reading are analyzed, and the Initial Teaching Alphabet method is  seen as least valid for teaching black children because of its phonological inconsistencies. It attempts to set up a correspondence between phonetic and orthographic segments of English, without providing for language cues outside this correspondence. The SRA method emphasizes mastery of sound-symbol correspondence, and many exercises require phonetic distinctions not in the black dialect. The Scott Foresman series uses all reading cues and emphasizes comprehension while allowing linguistic freedom. Whichever system is used, teacher skills, attitudes and dialect understanding are crucial to black reading success. (CHK)",

As teacher educators, we must teach students a humane approach in the classroom. Through a sensitive examination of the target language and culture, students can sense the reality and authentic meaning of the foreign language. Language study permits new self-awareness and a larger perception of the world. Teacher trainees can be made aware of the use of human development techniques in language education. Teacher education must consider the needs of the student teacher, to enable him to discover the teaching behavior that best suits his needs and  goals. To answer some of these needs, a seminar is run concurrently with practice teaching to explore problems and experiences among instructors and student teachers. By discussing feelings and anxieties students may understand their own reactions to teaching, with group support. Guest speakers lecture on communication skills, simulation techniques and group dynamics; field trips are taken to drug rehabilitation centers and resource centers. An extensive bibliography of resources in humanistic teacher education is included. (CHK)",

Psychological data on memory span is cited to demonstrate that advanced ESL students differ from intermediate ESL students and from native speakers in processing capacity of a particular type. Linguistic discourse analysis findings are cited to demonstrate the types of clues and continuities ESL listeners must attend to if they are to adequately comprehend spoken English discourse. A three-phase approach of listening instruction and practice for advanced ESL students is proposed to meet the discourse processing needs  discussed. Phase One consists of practice aimed toward increasing students' familiarity with and accuracy in processing intrasentential items and thus toward reducing the processing time devoted to intrasentential items. Phase Two pushes students to expand the time they have left over for processing discourse relations by requiring them to perform operations beyond those necessary for processing individual sentences. Phase Three consists of instruction in the types of discourse clues and continuities available to listeners and practice in attending to such clues and continuities. (Author)",

        "author":["Ilyin, Donna"],
        "description":"Even though modern methods of teaching emphasize listening and speaking, seldom are students of English tested in a standardized way on their ability to communicate through these skills. Many people learn to communicate well enough to conduct daily affairs in a new language, yet are unable to read, write, or speak any educated form of it. They are often required to take tests designed for native speakers or for foreign students entering colleges and universities in the United States. Such tests are inappropriate and too difficult for most students enrolled in adult school ESL (English as a Second Language) courses. These students need tests designed and developed on adult school ESL students. They especially need tests that measure their ability to understand and communicate  orally--even if inaccurately. This paper describes the development and field testing of an oral interview designed to assess oral communication in a contextual setting. While the test is easy to administer, examiners must become familiar with its uniqueness. It is hoped that the interview will be useful to ESL programs, basic education programs, industry, and employment agencies in more objectively assessing foreign and second language speakers' oral levels of English proficiency.

        "description":"A conservative analysis of simple declarative sentences in Lummi is given in order to clarify the role of the morpheme &quot;ng&quot; (a phonetic approximation of this morpheme) and the order and form of pronouns. In Lummi the combination of the transitivizer and &quot;ng&quot; acts as a passive marker on the verb. However, there are cases where the passive cannot be formed as well as cases where it is optional or obligatory. The interaction of the passive and the irregularity in the pronouns is discussed. In Lummi there are at least two kinds of pronouns in matrix sentences: subject pronouns and object pronouns. These cliticize onto the verb in all cases. The interesting irregularity is in the third person subject pronoun &quot;-s&quot;. Here it is proposed that &quot;-s&quot; is in some cases a third person pronoun  and in others an agreement marker on the verb. (Author)",

        "description":"The Market for Foreign Languages Study was begun in South Carolina to ascertain both the state's projected needs for modern foreign language competencies and the state's foreign language resources over the next five years. Questionnaires have been sent to industrial plants, secondary schools, and junior and senior colleges. Of the plants responding, 21.48 percent presently use or expect to use foreign language skills. Such firms engage in business abroad and use the languages in manufacturing or marketing. Staff members speaking foreign languages do needed translations or use the language in overseas business or with foreign businessmen in South Carolina. Most businesses would like to employ engineering or management graduates with foreign language skills. Languages that will be  needed most in the future are German, Japanese, Spanish, French, Chinese, Portuguese, Russian, and Swedish. Of the schools questioned, most teach some foreign language, chiefly French, German, Russian, and Spanish. Enrollment in high school language classes is constant or growing; in college it is tending to decline. Schools also gave their activities and plans in regard to dropping or adding foreign languages and their policies on foreign language requirements. Reasons given by the educators indicate that languages are generally selected because they are traditional, rather than because of community needs. The future outlook is that the business community will develop a substantial demand for people fluent in Japanese and Chinese before schools can meet the need. Copies of the survey  forms and accompanying letters are appended. (CHK)",

        "description":"The oral interview may be viewed as a criterion-referenced test for making either/or decisions about functional use of spoken language. Speech production can be tested by either the oral interview or the Valdis (1972) &quot;Performance Objectives for Speaking,&quot; and dialogue between the two systems can be profitable. Current literature on criterion-referenced testing and performance objectives suggests that the major problem in previous speaking tests lay in not specifying the test's parameters. A book by Vallette and Disick and the Defense Language Institute's Handbook both suggest specifying what the task is designed to show, the nature of the task, how the task shall be tested, conditions under which the test will be taken, and criteria used to determine performance. The U.S.  Government regularly conducts language proficiency tests by means of oral interviews. The Civil Service Proficiency Definitions rank ability in five levels from elementary to native or bilingual Proficiency. At the CIA Language Learning Center, additional guidelines for assigning proficiency levels and language grammar grids are also used. Guidelines cover speaking ability in subject matter and quality, as well as understanding. Oral interview tests are conducted to determine if a candidate communicates well enough in the target language to perform his job abroad, and how his performance compares with that of an educated native speaker.

On the basis of that experience, it is suggested that classrooms employ situations similar to total immersion in language teaching. Teaching and learning for communication depend on three factors: (1) meaningful use of language, (2) understanding what words mean and how patterns operate, and (3) a feeling of success in the learner. The free learner immersed in a foreign language environment learns language in a situational context. In the classroom, if actions and picture are associated with vocabulary, listening comprehension is developed. Creative use of the language should be encouraged, as students express original  sentences. Situational contexts help clarify vocabulary and grammatical structures. Use of the native language to explain structures is helpful in understanding language patterns, and helps particularly the older learner acquire the language faster. Success and a positive attitude may be generated by presenting material in short lessons, which are less discouraging and easier to master. Creative review and communication also lead to a warm atmosphere and a sense of accomplishment. (CHK)",

The program described involves the use of recreational activities for language instruction, based on the theory that the nature of and motivation for recreational activities make them an effective vehicle for language learning. It is believed that a recreational situation enhances the learning process because no artificial motivation is required; activities are enjoyable, interesting and purposeful to the individual; and the highly emotionalized nature of recreational situations gives them a potential for learning. The principal focus is on oral comprehension and fluency in the ancestral  language in question. The four basic steps in the development of a local LaRec program are discussed in detail. They are: (1) the preparation of a proposal, including identification of objectives, expenses, sources of income, and local variables; (2) preparation of a general scheme, including identification of objectives for one season, organization of appropriate activities, fund raising, and obtaining supplies and personnel; (3) carrying out the LaRec program for a season; and (4) evaluation of the program. The appendices provide references, instructions for building tables for a preschool play group, and number and counting activities for language practice. (CLK)",

        "description":"In speaking a child sometimes makes constructions in which a sequence of separate utterances expresses a semantic relation not expressed by either utterance. These &quot;vertical constructions&quot; are the main point of this study. Previous studies of construction in child language have largely dealt with sentences. In this study, sentences are called &quot;horizontal constructions&quot; to distinguish them from vertical constructions and to point up the constructional nature of senquences which are not sentences but, rather, discourses, i.e., vertical constructions. The importance of vertical construction is demonstrated on the grounds that these constructions are the developmental basis for horizontal constructions. Once horizontal constructions are developed, vertical construction continues as  an active process, resulting in more complex constructions. The second point of this study is methodological. Despite the importance of vertical construction in the development of language, investigators have not discussed this phenomenon because their research has been limited to the study of phonology or sentences. This study, by including one-word utterances, repetitions, unintelligible utterances and discourses, points out the developmental continuity from early conversation to later sentences and proposes that language is learned, primarily in the communicative interactions between the child and other speakers in the speech community.

Recent work has involved various correlational studies and factor analyses to determine what factors correlate most with success in foreign language learning. Approaches include: (1) correlations of several language aptitude tests with the U.S. Air Force Schools English Comprehension Level Tests to study English learning ability in foreign students; (2) a predictor study using the vocabulary and paragraph reading sections of the Pennsylvania State College Academic Aptitude Examination, and (3) a study involving work-sample tests and artificial languages. Factor analytic studies seem of greater relevance now, to analyze and measure  abilities constituting language aptitude. A study by Gardner and Lambert analyzed 24 variables of language skills and mental abilities and identified four as indices of second language skills. A study by Pimsleur, Stockwell and Comrey concluded that verbal intelligence and motivation were the main success factors. The Modern Language Aptitude Test consists of five subtests concerning number learning, phonetic script, spelling clues, words in sentences and paired associates. Reviews of the MLAT indicate that it is probably the most effective available, but criticize certain aspects. (CHK)",

They must analyze why students are in the course, determine what their individual reading backgrounds are in their native language and in English, and adapt class activities and reading materials to students' expectations and needs. The adult ESL reader's main problems involve: (1) working with English in its written form, (2) reading about an unfamiliar culture, and (3) lack of English language competence. The student's native language may not use the Roman alphabet and may have a different writing, punctuation or organizational system. The teacher must sort out students' language backgrounds and identify particular reading and pronunciation problems  deriving from that background. Comprehension problems may arise from vocabulary pertaining to American culture, which must be explained. Problems in English language competence often depend on the student's literacy in his native language. Texts for ESL adult courses should be geared to students' interests, whether comic books, sports pages, newspapers or professional literature. Students often are blocked by unfamiliar vocabulary; therefore they should be encouraged to skip the word or to try to glean its meaning from the context, to avoid constant dictionary searching.

        "description":"Each culture has its own nonverbal as well as its verbal language. Movements, gestures and sounds have distinct and often conflicting interpretations in different countries. For Americans communicating with Japanese, misunderstandings are of two types: Japanese behavior which is completely new to the American, and Japanese behavior which is similar or identical to American behavior, but which carries a different meaning. An American constantly uses eyes, eyebrows and forehead to express his feelings during conversation. Japanese are taught not to show their emotions in this way, so Americans think of them as uninterested or untruthful. Americans smile with their mouths and eyes during friendly conversation; Japanese widen their mouths to form certain vowels and this may seem like  an insincere smile. When an American nods his head, it signifies agreement; for Japanese, it merely means attentiveness. Japanese bow politely; Americans may interpret this an insincere fawning. Japanese hand gestures may also be misunderstood by Americans. As for seated posture, an American may sit in a casual, relaxed position and interpret the stiff, polite Japanese pose as unfriendly. Similarly, proximity, odors, environmental temperatures and the uniform colors of Japanese clothing will puzzle or put off Americans. International relations require an examination and understanding of such cultural nonverbal communication. (CHK)",

Along with learning the language, the student is expected to acquire a knowledge of the country and Ukrainian cultural history and social structures. The teaching method should be a balance of the aural-oral concept and the classical grammar approach. The course should comprise the study of grammar and idioms (from texts and selected reading), reading, conversational practice, dictations, free composition and vocabulary study. Texts for Ukrainian 1 and  2 are listed, but any suitable text may be used for level 3.

        "description":"Support for bilingual education continues to grow nationwide. Increased support for the concept of using English with the non-English mother tongue (NEMT) resulted from several factors. The total population of NEMT children in the U.S. grew to 5 million in 1973, while the number of Spanish-speaking children rose to 3.2 million in 1970. The Northeast, particularly New York City, has a heavy concentration of Spanish-speaking children. The Bilingual Education Act, the Fleishmann Commission Report and New York and California studies all acknowledge the numbers of NEMT children, their educational problems and the failure of the educational system to serve their needs. It is agreed that bilingual education will strengthen the child's educational progress, enhance his self-concept and  aid reading in both languages. Several studies show that bilingual education is effective; however, there is now an acute shortage of bilingual teachers. The State University of New York at Albany has a successful Master's program for bilingual education administrators and coordinators who could train other bilingual teachers. The program features a strong bilingual staff, a helpful advisory group, access to all SUNY resources and field experience in bilingual schools. (CHK)",

The entries include mostly  German, English, French and Russian titles. The publication is composed of three main sections: (1) an alphabetical author/title listing of items, giving full bibliographic information and including subject index terms; (2) abstracts of the items in German; and (3) a subject index developed from the descriptor terms assigned to each entry. These three main sections are preceded by directions on the use of the bibliography and lists of sources cited--periodicals, publishers and institutions.

        "description":"Experiments in teaching language or language-like behavior to chimpanzees and other primates may bear on the problem of the origin of language. Evidence appears to support the theory that man's first language was gestural. Recent pongid language experiments suggest: (1) a capacity for language is not solely human and therefore does not represent the human end of a basic biological discontinuity; and (2) since chimpanzee experiments have involved manual language, perhaps early human language also employed gestural signs. Early Greek, Roman, Moslem and Christian writings supposed language to be a gift from various gods. Descartes saw language as the distinction between man and animals. During the 17th and 18th centuries the debate continued as Europeans learned more about  chimpanzees and apes. The 1859 publication of Darwin's &quot;Origin of Species&quot; rekindled the debate, among such writers as Thomas Huxley, Edward B. Tylor and Wilhelm Wundt. In this century primate experiments with manual and vocal language were begun. The experiments of the Gardners, Premack, Rumbaugh and Fouts with chimpanzees demonstrate language abilities in these animals. Molecular biology shows a close link between man and chimpanzees, but experiments do not explain how human language developed beyond the apes to vocal-auditory language. (CHK)",

An important objective in the development of LCS has been to develop instructional and assessment procedures that will help integrate the program into extant bicultural, bilingual programs that will strengthen and extend the Hispanic cultural characteristics. During the five tryouts of LCS, the instructional, training and assessment systems of the LCS program have been developed and tested. In the early tryouts,  the program format was in the developmental stage. In the last three, the components covering all 15 units were available for the year-long tryouts. Schools were selected to represent various demographic situations. A total of 7,100 children, ranging from kindergarten to grade 8, have been involved. Teacher comments, observation reports, and assessment scores were used as data sources. (Author/KM)",

        "description":"The hypothesis of the research described here was that nine-year-old second language learners would improve their linguistic skills through the method of peer tutoring. Four tutors were selected from a group of fourth grade volunteers. The four tutees were second language learners having difficulties with acquiring sufficient English language skills to succeed in the grade. The skills for the lessons were culled from known texts in second language learning and developed into two sets of lessons, one for the tutee and one for the tutor. Ten lessons were taught over a period of two months. However, it could not be determined whether the improvement was due largely to the effects of peer tutoring. Peer tutoring enabled the second language learners to learn in a non-threatening  atmosphere, to obtain individualized instruction and to receive immediate feedback to their learning needs. For the teachers of second language learners, the results imply that there is a need to reexamine their roles, methods and techniques in aiming for individualization of instruction. The evidence suggests that the method of peer tutoring for second language learners warrants a more systematic and detailed study. (Author/CLK)",

The prototype is an English test, totally oral, for use in grades K-4, designed to: (a) determine the child's ability to (1) understand and produce the distinctive characteristics of spoken English, (2) express known cognitive concepts, and (3) handle learning tasks in English; and (b) provide placement and instructional recommendations for alternate programs such as special English instruction and bilingual education. Comparable tests with similar objectives were then developed in Cantonese, Mandarin, Tagalog, Ilokano, and Spanish, reflecting some of the largest of the forty  non-native-English-speaking groups in Seattle schools. Development of the tests was based on identifying basic learning concepts that children must handle in order to perform in a school setting. These concepts include identifying, classifying, quantifying, interrogating, negating and showing spatial, case and temporal relationships. The grammatical manifestations of a language that a child must handle to perceive or to communicate these concepts were then determined. The construction of the tests and the scoring methods are discussed, as well as cultural and linguistic differences encountered in the preparation of the tests. (Author/CLK)",

It was concluded that language requirements at the federal level include the diplomatic agencies and various other agencies. Approximately 25,000 federal employees need foreign language skills. A survey of over 6,000 business firms was conducted, and respondents identified 60,000 language-related jobs. The government is more cognizant than business/industry of the benefits  of having personnel with foreign language skills. Language training and rating methods are more efficient in government. Some companies benefit from a policy that rejects English as the \"Lingua franca\" and supports multi-linqualism among its employees. Consultants, theorists and many practitioners believe this would be a highly beneficial policy for all multinational companies, but they also recognize that most American firms do not take advantage of hiring language-skilled and culturally sensitive personnel. Methods of industrial and business training for these purposes are by and large inadequate. (Author/CLK)",

(2) Know how interference from the physical product affects sound assessment. The attractiveness of a set of books or other materials may blur an educator's judgment. (3) Know how interference from human factors affects assessment; nice teachers or appealing children can distort analysis of real  issues. (4) The relationship between claims and reality must be carefully assessed. The innovation's purpose must be identified and its performance of that goal evaluated. (5) Know the theory or knowledge base underlying the structure or program. It must be determined whether the program successfully fits its theoretical teaching and learning framework.

        "description":"Types of hierarchies of pronunciation difficulty are discussed, and a hierarchy based on contrastive analysis plus informal observation is proposed. This hierarchy is less one of initial difficulty than of error persistence. One feature of this hierarchy is that, because of lesser learner awareness and very limited functional load, errors involving allophones are more persistent than errors involving phonemes. Phonetic difficulty and suprasegmental and spelling interference are aggravating factors that increase the relative difficulty of particular problems in the hierarchy. To test the proposed hierarchy and three other hypotheses, a thorough pronunciation test was administered to 50 English-speaking students of Spanish (almost all of whom also knew some French). The test was  given at the end of 45 hours of mostly oral instruction, which included 4 to 5 hours of specifically pronunciation instruction. The resulting data formed the basis for error analysis. The results generally confirmed the proposed hierarchy; they also showed the \"sacredness\" of word boundaries for speakers of English, the negative effects of spelling on pronunciation, greater frequency of errors in cognate than in non-cognate words, evidence of suprasegmental interference, and more frequent errors with known words than with unknown words. Conclusions include several suggestions for the teaching of Spanish pronunciation. (Author/CLK)",

        "description":"The self-instructional language program (SILP) allows students to learn, through a guided individualized study program, a foreign language not offered in the regular university curriculum. A director for the program offers the facilities and materials necessary for administering such a program. A tutor, who is a native speaker of the target language, serves as a monitor and drill master for small groups of students. An outside examiner, who is a professional language instructor and an expert in the target language, examines the students at the end of the term and evaluates their achievement and assigns grades for the course. The examination procedures must be an integral part of SILP that is accepted by the students as a proper evaluation of their newly learned language skills  and is not looked at simply as a mechanism by which grades are given on the basis of a single impression. The choice of a qualified examiner, consultation of director of SILP with the examiner, and a clear explan'ation of the function and procedures of the examination to both students and tutors, are necessary preliminary steps to ensure a successful completion of the individualized language study course. A sample of an examination in Modern Hebrew is included in the appendix to the paper. (Author/CLK)",

Unfortunately, translators know only too well that most FL teachers are not competent translators, and FL Departments generally consider translation as an activity beneath the dignity of scholars. This mutual contempt must be overcome so that translators can obtain the benefit of formal training and an academic degree, FL Departments the benefit of increased enrollments, and the overall quality of translation in this country raised to the level found in most other nations. Close examination of the translation process shows that it can be described justifiably as scholarly, intellectual, artistic, and even  creative, quite apart from its obvious career aspects. There are many cogent arguments for awarding undergraduate or graduate degrees in translation, as is the practice in most other countries. (Author)",

        "description":"Some of the problems involving language education and the employability of translators are discussed here. (1) The selling of translation, when compared with the more marketable skills in areas such as accounting, physics, etc., is an issue in the translator's employability. It is more difficult for a translator to measure quantitative contributions to a corporation. It is the responsibility of language schools to demonstrate translators' monetary value to prospective employers and to prepare students to use quantitative tools to prove their effectiveness. (2) Interaction between education and industry can further the process of giving quality education. A liaison between faculties of language schools and sciences and the industrial staffs of companies that may need translation  could assign outside professionals as part-time teachers to give language students a view of developments in business and technology. (3) Acquaintance with modern tools of communication, such as overhead projectors, microfiche, automatic typewriters, remote time-shared computer terminals and automatic information processing systems, is necessary for the translator. The language education field has been slow to recognize and teach about these developments, but some affiliation with departments of computer or information science would be helpful in establishing communications curricula for translators.

        "description":"An investigation questioned whether the words and gestures &quot;cut-eye&quot; and &quot;suck-teeth,&quot; evident in Guyana, represent African survivals, and how widely these are recognized in the Caribbean, the United States and Africa. Caribbean data were drawn from observations, dictionaries and interviews. U.S. data came from questionnaires administered to both blacks and whites. African students were also questioned. In Guyana, &quot;cut-eye&quot; is a visual gesture indicating hostility or disapproval. A glare is delivered followed by a vertical or diagonal sweep of the eye over the other person. &quot;Cut-eye&quot; insults by visually invading another's territory and turning away contemptuously. The gesture was familiar to all West Indians interviewed. In the U.S., nearly all black informants were familiar with  the term, but few of the whites. All African informants recognized the gesture. &quot;Suck-teeth&quot; refers to the gesture of drawing in air through the teeth to produce a sucking sound. It expresses anger, exasperation or annoyance, and is stronger and ruder than &quot;cut-eye.&quot; It is known throughout the Caribbean, by black Americans, though not by whites, and by Africans. The study provides evidence that Africanisms persist in the New World even in commonplace expressions and gestures. (CHK)",

The use of &quot;doz&quot; is not widely noted among creolists, however, possibly because it often occurs in phonologically reduced forms such as &quot;Iz&quot; or &quot;z.&quot; The reduction of &quot;doz&quot; is more than rapid speech; it helps approximate the prestigious standard dialect or acrolect. The process achieves linguistic progress without sacrificing expressive value. The removal of the &quot;d&quot; from &quot;doz&quot; in this reduction is part of a general rule affecting initial voiced segments in creole auxiliaries or tense-aspect markers. The &quot;d&quot; is retained l00% of the time after a pause, 69% after vowels and 60% or less after consonants. The removal of &quot;d&quot;  following nasals, liquids, stops, fricatives and vowels is examined. Other creole dialects and black U.S. English are searched for similar examples of deletion. The deletion of the vowel in &quot;doz&quot; occurs after an immediately preceding vowel but never after a consonant. If the &quot;z&quot; is also deleted, use of the remaining verb stem for habitual aspect is indistinguishable from Standard English use of present tense. (CHK)",

This instructional set could form the basis for CAI lessons in which the student is presented images identical to those on the video tapes and lessons are tailored to his particular need. A study of the logical concepts underlying transformations teaches the student how to transform sentences to alter emphasis or meaning and shows the relationship between the transformation and the intonation of the spoken sentence. The student's goal is to understand transformational process and thereby develop competence. The writing of the visual material was under computer control.  The computer wrote on the screen of the terminal and moved phrases in a predeterminated manner and with the desired timing. The blanked write mode permits storing phrases in the terminal memory so that the entire phrases can be made to reappear instantly. The result of the informal student evaluations of this program revealed that the students found the course more interesting and easier than they expected and that they believed the audiovisual definitely aided their learning the necessary material.

The paper provides a blueprint for the teacher of Italian on any campus who wishes to strengthen the position of his Italian program in this era when dwindling federal, state and university support forces us to look for resources which can come only from the community. The three basic steps in Tulane's program development plan include: (1) attracting the community to the program by means of a guest lecture series, a film festival, and a book exhibit; (2) encouraging community support in the form of book donations, the awarding of fellowships and merit prizes, and other fund-raising activities; and (3) reciprocal efforts by  the teacher of Italian to serve the community's needs in the area of instruction. These steps are fully detailed and can be employed without modification by the Italian program of any high school, college or university. (Author/CLK)",

At Sauk Valley College in Dixon, Illinois, language instruction must extend beyond the traditional Spanish-for-anglos classes, because there is a large population of Mexican-Americans living within the school district. This paper enumerates methods used at Sauk to aid both anglo and Mexican-American students. Those methods include a Bilingual Teacher Aide Certificate program, special Spanish courses for nurses and law enforcement personnel, and a trade-of-languages-program in a nearby ESL school. Efforts are also made to assist local high school and church Chicano youth groups. The two-way street of language instruction in the community college  encourages the traditional course of study in Spanish for anglo students. It also encourages them to use their language skills to work toward meaningful, career-oriented goals. It encourages Mexican-Americans to take advantage of their unique bilingual qualifications in school aide work. (Author)",

        "description":"A group of Mexican-American children living in a small Illinois town were observed to study the acquisition of communicative competence. The children's spontaneous and elicited narratives showed combinations of Spanish and English. If three stories represented here are considered syntactically, none involves random alternation of codes. Almost all switches involve entire sentences. In spontaneous narratives, there is much less code-switching than in the elicited stories. English stories contain almost none, Spanish only a little switching. Switching primarily involves nouns, or marks quotations. Asides to the audience or expression of special ideas may cause a language switch. Code-switching seems to follow a pattern, and language dominance may explain why switching to find the  right word is more prevalent when speaking Spanish than English. (CHK)",

A set of CVCV utterances was read by speakers (5 males and 5 females) and analyzed using predictive coding techniques. The consonant consisted of voiced stops, unvoiced stops, nasal consonants... while the vowel V was one of 4 nasal French vowels. Vowel acoustic features such as formants and bandwidth frequencies, intensity, fundamental frequency and duration are studied. Most of the results obtained are in accordance with the acoustic theory. Differences between nasal and nasalized French vowels seem significant and the French nasal vowel characteristics seem as stable as those of the oral vowels.

        "description":"From the perspective of a reading consultant, the processes of thinking and reading apply to efficient learning. Language teachers should know: (1) the difference between surface structure and deep meaning of an utterance, (2) the importance of \"affect\" on learning: the reader's personal involvement with the material and with its presentation, colored by prior knowledge of the subject and attitude toward it; and (3) theories regarding cognitive patterns in analysis of material, vocabulary load, and repetition interval. Teachers should be aware of linguistic differences between written and oral communication which cause writing to be variously interpreted by readers, since surface structure available to the reader is merely a representation of deep meaning. Discrepancies between  teacher impressions and student mastery, arising from inaccurate perceptions, can be expected and eradicated. Recent studies suggest: (1) teaching idioms and larger units of meaning; (2) teaching multiple uses of vocabulary from the outset, and teaching relational words such as prepositions first, because of their frequency in patterns; and (3) subsequently teaching content words in context through synonymy. Ambiguity must also be provided for. Noting patterns of comprehension, based on what the subject is, what the opinion about the subject is, and how it is presented when reduced to a single unitary meaning, is one approach to improving reading efficiency.

It has been suggested that a learner formulates successive hypotheses about the nature of the target language at least partially on the basis of his knowledge of the native language. A deep contrastive study of the two language systems will reveal the areas which need to be focused on in a teaching situation in order to discourage the learner from setting up &quot;false&quot; equivalences between the two systems, or rather, to lead him to set up valid equivalences. The paper advocates a view of contrastive analysis which is based on meaning rather than structure, and also takes into account areas such as pragmatics and conversational implicature in establishing equivalences. The method of such  an analysis is illustrated by a detailed discussion of some of the properties of the causative constructions in English and selected South Asian languages. (Author)",

When such activities are employed in the foreign language classroom, several prominent factors can be indentified: on a psychological (affective) level, integrative and transactional motivation; on a linguistic (cognitive/affective) level, active listening comprehension and creative language use. No concrete psycholinguistic evidence has been established for the effectiveness of the enumerated factors; but support can be found in current psycholinguistic theory and research in their application to second language learning. A psycholinguistic framework accentuates the need to include human development tasks into objective research as well as to make them part of successful foreign language  programs. (Author)",

Many language games are kept going by communication and break down if communication itself does so. Four types of game are described to illustrate this point: guessing games, certain number games, games affording practice of the use of a piece of syntax, and \"Alibi.\" In such games the language learners are eager to communicate with one another. Not all useful language games are of this kind, nor is communicative practice obtainable in this way only. Some games appeal to adults, others to children. Adults prefer to see the linguistic point of a game. In a foreign language learning situation, communicative games can play a very important  role, but even in a second language learning situation (in which the language is met with in daily life outside the school) they can be valuable.

However, there is no convincing evidence that young children are inferior language-learners. Various investigations are mentioned, and a critical examination is made of certain aspects of the research project into the primary school teaching of French in Britain. An early start may be made, with language teaching as with other subjects and activities, in recognition of the mind-broadening and personal developmental effect a well-run foreign language course can have on the  children taking part in it.

Private institutions serve a vital role in higher education in this country because they are a check and a balance to a sometimes overwhelming governmental presence in the governance of public higher education. What then is the appropriate public policy? It is not a question of whether we should support private higher education, but how. Problems involved are: (1) how to narrow the tuition gap; (2) providing access for middle-income students; and, (3) tuition-offset grants tie institutional aid to students. A solution is to provide a state subsidy that is large enough to keep the Private institution in business and  attractive to students. The best way to demonstrate that politically is a tuition-offset formula. It is possible to put pressure on the federal government to correct the geographic inequities that are evident and to demonstrate that it is a good bargain for the taxpayers in the state.

The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) won the election in 1972 to be the faculty bargaining representative. One of the first issues that faced the faculty was to reorganize the structure of its AAUP chapter along lines more suitable to its role as collective bargaining agent. A revised constitution was adopted in May 1974. Particular features of the contract were: (1) that outside arbitrators are not utilized; and (2) that a discussion session is held each semester. Implementing the contract involved a great deal of cooperation between Temple University administration and the AAUP. The AAUP contract has proven an invaluable tool to resolve problems.  Evidence indicates that there is a better working relationship at Temple between the administration and AAUP than exists at many other institutions under collective bargaining. (Author/KE)",

        "description":"The incentive grant approach in higher Education is a resource allocation strategy that may have significant positive impact on educational performance. This document covers: (1) the incentive grant approach to resource allocation; (2) the evolution during the past 15 years of types of incentive grant programs and the contrasting roles played by state higher education agencies and multicampus systems in that evolution; (3) major patterns inthe administration of incentive grant programs; and (4) a directory to 55 incentive grant programs administered by higher education agencies and multicampus systems. Findings indicate that the incentive grant approach may: (1) provide incentive for participants to rechannel both efforts and resources into activities that support the new goals  of universal access; (2) stimulate initiative for improvement within existing resources; and (3) yield the dual economic benefits of increased productivity and more effective targeting of resources. To these potential assets of the incentive grant approach must be added flexibility. Given these potentially positive impacts and the technique's potential adaptability to a variety of resource allocation situations, the central question becomes: How well does the approach, both generally and in its concrete variations, actually work?

This is particularly evident in the field of psychology. In conducting an undergraduate course in the psychology of personal adjustment, if one views the class as a potential demonstration laboratory in human relations, it becomes possible to adopt an experiential approach to the subject through the use of a workshop format. This technique has been developed and employed with considerable success in one college setting. The first phase of the project is presented as a highly structured sequence of events. The second phase is conducted much more flexibly, allowing both the class and  the instructor considerable latitude for exercising spontaneity and inventiveness. Based on student feedback the laboratory apProach to the teaching of the psychology of adjustment and effective interpersonal relations possesses considerable appeal. (Author/KE)",

Salary increase proposals were submitted for faculty by department chairpersons. Among other items of information, the proposals contained three categories of data treated in this report: (1) recommended salary increase; (2) workload assignment; and (3) chairperson's evaluation of performance. Correlation analysis was applied to the variables for total faculty and for faculty clustered by discipline categories. Correlations between merit salary increase for teaching and evaluation of teaching and evaluation of overall quality were about the same--moderate  (positive). Correlation between salary increases for activities other than teaching and evaluations of those activities differed somewhat from teaching. Merit increase for research correlated (positively) with evaluation of research to a considerably higher degree than was the case for teaching. In general, there was higher correlation between the different variables with respect to evaluation than between salary increases and evaluations of the merit increase categories. The conclusions is that correlations are weak enough to cast doubt on the value of a chairperson's evaluation in granting salary increases. (Author)",

The new admissions standards, which are based on a multiple correlation and regression approach using first quarter freshman year GPA as the criterion, permit applicants to submit the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test (PSAT) or the aptitude tests of the American College Testing Program (ACT) for both admissions and placement purposes. This research project was originally organized into three parts: (1) preliminary research on 1972 university freshmen; (2) the development of new admissions standards on 1973 freshmen (for whom some PSAT scores  were available); and (3) the establishment of cutting scores on the new admissions standards. After cutting scores on the new admissions criteria were developed, a fourth stage of research, best described as a process of double-checking earlier results, was undertaken. Table 1 of this document summarizes each phase while the remainder of the document discusses the phases in more detail, presenting supporting data at each stage of research. (Author/KE)",

An MIS exists to provide information for management and operating purposes. The MIS must meet the information needs of management and operating users. The MIS consists of two components--a processor and a data base. Packaged systems have gained a strong foothold, but users are often not sure enough of their needs to take control of their MIS's and many are not \"systems oriented.\" To get help in systems design and interpretation of information often raises organizational and resource issues that are not easily resolved. Thus, users will need to make a concerted effort to move MIS forward. (Author/KE)",

The approach results in two types of output documents: (1) a planning procedures manual, and (2) a planning book consisting of college plans, unit plans, and regular planning information. If the approach is successfully implemented, an institution should have less crises oriented management, more effective resource utilization, and a better means of adapting to its environment.

        "description":"Most college administrators are anxious to make use of management science techniques to assist them in operating their organizations. Despite their positive attitude, however, these administrators seem to lack a systematic method of approaching their specific organizations to decide which areas of application and what techniques should be introduced. This is due to a lack of understanding as to what is available, as well as the inability to assess what benefits and costs will be derived from the various efforts and what interaction exists between different applications. Also, there is the question of how the responsibility for analysis effort should be placed within the organization. Faced with these deficiencies, administrators in education have shied away from endorsing  applications of management science in their organizations. This paper provides academic administrators with (1) a critical review of available tools, (2) a structure for considering possible analytical projects to be undertaken, and (3) the steps that should be taken by administration to ensure proper organization, planning, and control of management science efforts.

To answer this question three types of information were examined: (1) opinions of the president or delegate representative; (2) data on actual costs that are a result of the institutions' membership in a coordinating or governing systems; and (3) the situation in large-scale systems as compared with a parallel study of business organization of multicompanies. It was found that the trend toward the establishment of coordinating boards or commissions of higher education appears to be halted, at least temporarily. At the same time, the 1202 Commissions have expanded the state definitions of  postsecondary education and emphasized statewide planning for higher education. All these conflicting trends indicate clearly the need to develop well understood assignments of levels of decisionmaking and distribution of authority to the institutions and to each of the centralized regulatory agencies. In addition, institutions need to determine the essential local functions that are basic and needed at each institution. (Author/KE)",

        "description":"The goal of this study was to describe and assess the impact of collective bargaining on the management of conflict in higher education. Bargaining and nonbargaining institutions were matched and their grievance processes compared on a number of dimensions. It was concluded that although collective bargaining has had a distinct effect on the way conflict is managed in colleges and universities, a number of other variables have had an effect as well. These include control patterns, organizational patterns, region of the country, and level of educational offering. (Author)",

The purpose of the test was to determine how congruent were the values held by the members of the college community with those implied by the goal statements of the college. It was discovered that while the faculty and administration held values relatively in accord with the stated democratic, egalitarian, and innovative philosophy of the college, the students demonstrated a tendency toward passivity and an authoritarian value system. Recommendations for faculty orientation and curricular development for dealing with the situation were made. (Author)",

Thus, other criteria, usually judgmental in nature, have formed the basis of efforts to evaluate teaching. A widely stressed admonition is that one should never rely solely on a single source of data, but should use several or all of these forms of judgment. The sources of first-hand data that have been most often suggested (and which are discussed in this document) are faculty self-evaluation, peer evaluations without visitation, and the student's  evaluation of teaching.

Essentially three issues faced Congress at this time: (1) Did Congress have a clear rationale for involvement in campus affairs? (2) How could Congress respond to the public's desire to halt campus disruptions? (3) How could Congress deter such disruptions? A related issue is the effectiveness of the federal aid cutoff riders in curtailing campus disruptions and punishing student demonstrators. Punitive legislation of the type represented by the cutoff riders appears both unwise and unworkable. Disciplinary procedures and sanctions should be left to the  educators. Three actions Congress can take are: (1) to stipulate in all student/faculty financial aid legislation that federal aid may be terminated if, after a hearing, campus authorities deem such termination an appropriate remedy; (2) to consider enacting measures that can lessen forms of extreme violence; and (3) to recommend that the Executive branch take certain action to assist local police and campus officials separately and in concert to develop effective strategies to cope with escalating violence on and off campus.

        "description":"In what way are peoples' future self-concepts affected by thoughtful appraisal and study of the sex-role literature in psychology? A 10-week course taught by a feminist psychologist stressed the harmful effects to both sexes of sex-role stereotypes. Traditional sex roles were presented as stifling, restrictive, false, and inappropriate if the goal is to maximize human potential. As a result of the instructor's bias, it was expected that the class would have even greater respect for traditionally valued female traits, and less admiration for such traditionally male valued traits. The self-concept scale employed not only had high social desirability values associated with them, but the items represented traits highly valued in only one sex. The course had its intended effect of  female-valued personality traits, that is, greater valuation. It had the opposite effect than intended on male-valued personality traits. Male competency items were far more valued now by both sexes. The ideal adult of tomorrow, sex unspecified, will be more \"masculine\" in many ways than the college men of today. (Author/KE)",

Some findings were: (1) faculty members in Maryland's institutions of higher education reported workloads similar to those reported by faculty members in other states; (2) the percentages of time devoted to different activities vary according to institutional missions; (3)  total workloads of the University faculty members appear to be within the recommended guidelines of the American Association of University Professors; (4) nearly constant amounts of time expended in preparation and administration per credit hour were taught regardless of course levels; (5) product of student credit hours per full-time equivalent faculty member varied greatly by segment, by level of instruction, and by field of knowledge; and (6) by enabling each institution to compare its own data with statewide averages, efficiency or its absence may be recognized.

A portion of these activities and services is formalized in the Summer Orientation Program, which attempts to introduce students to life in the U.S. in general and the academic scene in particular. This document describes and discusses an Orientation Program held from July 25 to September 10, 1975. It was a component part of a joint program that included a separately administered Intensive English Language Program. Findings are that: (1) the goals of the program need to be more clearly defined to include the implication of adding participants who are not new arrivals; (2) the juxtaposition of this program with IEL  places it in competition for the participants' time with the student opting for the acquisition of a knowledge of English over American culture; and (3) that the Home-Stay Program is seen as vital but desires and motives of the participants need reexamination. Attempts should be made to utilize, for communication purposes, natural groups that emerge from the students themselves. (Author/KE)",

Such generalizations, while historically accurate, do not take into account factors that are bringing older, married, or financially independent people into the classroom. Demographic characteristics of commuting students at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNC-G) revealed that most UNC-G commuters have established a household apart from their parents. Many are employed full time and are married, with families of their own. They are a diverse group compared to the relatively homogeneous resident students. Three types of commuters  were found: (1) commuters living with their parents; (2) married commuters; and (3) commuters maintaining separate residences apart from their parents. The demographic data provides a clearer picture of just who the commuters are and how they differ from the resident students traditionally served by UNC-G. (Author/KE)",

Awareness is identified with items that express concern and emphasis upon three sets of meanings: personal, poetic, and political--self-understanding, appreciative relationship for the arts, and concern about the world and welfare of mankind, respectively. To test this hypothesis, forty students were grouped as either participants (members of the student senate) or nonparticipants in the college governance structure at York College, Pennsylvania. Both groups were administered the Awareness Scale from the College and University Environment Scales Pace (1963). Results  indicated that there is no significant difference in awareness between student participants in college governance and student nonparticipants. (Author/KE)",

Discussed are: (1) the important components in state subsidies for higher education--institutional subsidies, need grants, scholarship grants, and educational loans; (2) the relative effectiveness of the different types of state subsidies and suggested shifts of funds among them that could produce superior results; (3) alternative mix of subsidies that could be implemented successfully in Oregon; and (4) the means and ends in state subsidies to postsecondary education. In conclusion, it is found that if the interaction between the demands for educational services and  the supply were more realistic--in a system that was more akin to the marketplace, with consumers more at liberty to direct their demand to any product they prefrred--greater flexibility and economy would result. Increased competion among alternative institutions could lead to greater responsiveness, an increase in educational quality, and lower costs. (Author/KE)",

If a group of freshman students preidentified as exit prone is provided with more advising time from a member of the ranked faculty, then the rate of attrition from this exit-prone group will be less than the attrition rate for the rest of the freshman cohort. Is there a difference between the attrition rate of exit-prone students and of the freshman cohort. The group tested was segregated on the basis of low test score performance on the ACT and SAT test, low rank in high school class, and their score on a device reputed to identify exit-prone students. The rate of attrition from the exit-prone group was significantly lower than the withdrawal rate from the cohort group during the academic year. The  exit-prone group received regular counseling from advisors who were part of the humanistic advising-training program while the cohort group did not. The overall effect of concentrated advising for exit-prone students appears to be two-fold. It prolongs the enrollment of students who might normally be expected to withdraw during the freshman year. It also improves the return rate at the beginning of the sophomore year for the class as a whole. (Author/KE)",

Toward this goal, four diverse institutions participated in pilot test attrition studies during 1975. In each case, NCHEMS staff and the institutional administrators in charge of the survey worked closely together to resolve problems as they arose as well as to ensure that the questionnaire met the needs of the individual  institution. This manual was written as a guide for institutional practitioners to conduct their own attrition studies, and was based on a year of pilot test effort and the successful completion of four attrition studies.

Comparative studies could be enhanced by more rigorously defining the methods that are being investigated and by standardizing the laboratory techniques and observation schemes that are employed. In addition, the studies could be made more usable to the layman by spelling out what standards of educational effectiveness the researcher has employed. To obtain an answer for a specific  comparison in a designated milieu, carefully controlled studies can be mounted using similar populations aimed at similar instructional goals and exposed to two differing treatments.

Results showed: (1) in most institutions, the person in charge of cable television is the media specialist; (2) cable television is financed mostly through already existing operating budgets; (3) cable television is used more in elementary and secondary institutions than in higher education; (4) cable television is used for a variety of  purposes only some of which are instructional; and (5) only half the respondents reported using cable television for direct teaching.

First background information was gathered on the expressed needs for the study and on activities at the national and regional levels as well as in library schools and other professions. Then a questionnaire was administered to a sampling of state library agencies, library associations, library schools, and individual libraries. The questionnaire was designed to help determine patterns of existing continuing education activities, identify major needs, and develop a program to meet regional needs. Analysis of the data showed that continuing library education programs were fragmented and without coordination. Specific needs were identified, along with some  barriers to effective coordinated programs. The major recommendation growing from the study was that the Southwest Library Association assume responsibility for developing a continuing education program for the library community in the Southwest cooperatively with state, regional, and national groups; library schools; employing institutions; and individuals. This program was developed in great detail and many of its components have been put into operation. Appendixes contain working papers for the study and information on existing programs. (Author/LS)",

        "description":"A summative evaluation of the final form of the first four episodes of Big Blue Marble, a television series for children, was conducted. Researchers examined children's perceptions of similarities and differences between themselves and children in other parts of the world; their opinions about the well-being of other children; their opinions about work and responsibility relative to children in other parts of the world; and their sense of ethnocentrism. Subjects were fourth, fifth, and sixth grade children. It was found that viewing the program influences children to perceive greater similarity between themselves and people from other parts of the world. The program affected viewers' perceptions of the well-being of children in other parts of the world such that, after viewing,  those children were rated better off. There was a reduction in ethnocentrism after viewing the program, and children were less positive in attributing superiority to things which are American. Children's attitudes toward work and responsibility were affected by the program, but the effect varied depending on age and pre-viewing attitudes. The general response of the children to Big Blue Marble was positive. (CH)",

Suitable content areas were chosen, and a mechanism to integrate various skill areas was designed. Training materials for this integration of skills were developed and coded into the PLATO IV system. A sample of experimental and control company commanders was tested and trained. Data about their on-the-job performance in the skill areas, as well as their companies' performance were collected and analyzed. It appears that the training had an effect on skill performance of company commanders, and indirectly on the attitudes and beliefs of their recruits. Less effect on company performance was observed, but there is evidence that the skill areas trained are related to  success criteria used. The report includes 2 illustrations and 11 tables.

Following a brief analysis of the general demographic and economic situation in Ireland, the OECD examiners defined the major STI achievements in the areas of access to documents and information dissemination services. They found that, in the absence of a coordinated national policy, individual industrial firms and government agencies set their own policies. A national STI policy was found to be particularly needed for industrial development, science, education, and social development. The responsibilities of the government in establishing the STI policy were developed, and the content of  such policies was proposed for the library, information and documentation service, and national government levels. The organization of boards and committees to implement the proposals was also outlined. A meeting between the OECD examiners and Irish officials, set up to discuss the policy proposals, centered around discussions of access to documents; information services to industry; and elements, substance, and institutional arrangements of a national information policy.

These characteristics must be weighed against the costs of the required development, production, transmission, distribution, software, and hardware.

        "description":"A study was conducted to investigate the complex influences which converge on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The literature revealed that in the past, most attempts by individuals or groups to have a voice in the renewal of a broadcaster's license met with failure because the FCC generally abandoned both its formulated policy and its evaluated standards in favor of a general bias toward the licensee. During 1963-1973 there were over 250 petitions filed with the FCC, but the bulk were either dismissed or withdrawn. In this study, a questionnaire was completed for 230 cases brought before the FCC by individuals or groups outside the broadcasting industry, and economic information was collected for each licensee involved. The analysis produced support for the  hypothesis that the FCC will generally favor those parties who have the greatest financial investment at risk as a result of the commission action and will generally be more responsive to the appeals of organizations with high national visibility in areas other than broadcasting. A bibliography of 19 items is included. (Author/DS)",

Satellite ground stations permitting both transmission and reception of black and white television were installed at clinics in Fairbanks, Fort Yukon, Galena, and Tanana. Receive-only television capability was installed at the Alaska Native Medical Center in Anchorage. As part of the project, a centralized, computer-based, problem-oriented medical record system, called the Health Information Systems was introduced. Satellite video consultation was shown to be useful for practically any medical problem, crucial to some cases, and usable by health care providers at all levels of training. The Health Information System was judged valuable by all  participants in the demonstration, and it was recommended that it be established permanently and expanded to the entire state of Alaska.

Other accomplishments were: passage of the 1921 county library law; codification of state library laws; increased state aid to public libraries; and creation of a voluntary librarian certification program. Various MLA divisions, committees, and round tables also have had positive influence on the library situation in the state. MLA has had an active publishing program since 1936 and has cooperated  with other agencies on surveys, recruiting, education programs, and many other projects.

        "description":"Cognitive dissonance theory assumptions were used in a formal program of attitude change. The objective was first to improve subject attitudes toward an instructional activity, then subject achievement in this instructional activity was measured to determine if achievement was influenced by subject attitudes toward instruction. Two hundred eighteen college students were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. Analysis of variance tests were used to evaluate experimental hypotheses. Results demonstrated that it was possible to improve, experimentally, subjects' attitudes toward the instructional activity in the short term and the long term by a camouflaged treatment requiring subjects to commit themselves on videotape. Achievement differences were not significant, but  trends of scores supported the experimental hypotheses. (Author/CH)",

The three stages of growth in education are characterized by: (1) class teaching, (2) group teaching, and (3) independent study. Stage 1 is teacher-dominated. At stage 2 the instructor is more passive in the control of a group. Stage 3 is the most meaningful because there is student involvement in the learning process and feedback is provided to the instructor. A model such as this can contribute to a rationale for decision-making in education, showing that growth toward a technology of instruction requires a pattern of change and is not just a matter of changing a number of discrete and isolated factors.

Innovative programs using instructional radio have been initiated around the world. Of special interest is an elementary mathematics instruction program used in Nicaragua. Broadcast curriculum can be made more interesting to young audiences by introducing  such formats as quiz shows and news broadcasts. (EMH)",

The panel was composed of representatives of seven information centers which process machine-readable bibliographic data bases and provide selective dissemination of information and/or retrospective searches. In order to obtain comparable data and avoid differences in terminology, an advance questionnaire had been completed by the panelists. The questions centered around seven topics: selection of data bases, data base reformatting, system features, data base costs, profile costs, center costs and accounting, and charges and pricing. After each topic was introduced by the  moderator the panelists presented their answers. (Author/LS)",

Fifty percent (1,467) of the expected associate degree recipients from public institutions, and all 623 of the expected reciPients from independent institutions received the survey instrument. Overall, there was a 47 percent response rate (919). In addition to information elicited on student characteristics and backgrounds, the findings were these: The most commonly chosen major area of study was health service and paramedical technology. Only 31 percent of the respondents expected that the associate degree was the highest degree they would complete. Approximately  two-thirds of the respondents indicated general fields of study they hoped to pursue in the future, the most popular being health related programs. Sixty-one percent expected to be employed in career jobs in the fall following their graduations, and 79 percent expected that their long-term careers would be related to their major fields of study.

Thirty-nine of the 54 agencies responding indicated that they employ human services paraprofessionals. A large number of currently employed paraprofessionals are high school graduates with no formal education related to their occupation. Thirty-six of the respondents thought that Kellogg Community College should offer an associate degree human services technician program; 22 thought that the college should offer courses that would permit skill upgrading of employed paraprofessionals. The survey also revealed that a relatively large employment market for  associate degree graduates exists. Based on the results of the survey, and evaluations of resource, facility, budget, and curriculum requirements, a human services technician associate degree program is proposed. A core curriculum emphasizing work experience with options for specialization in one of the seven human services areas is recommended for adoption. The survey results are appended, along with a proposed curriculum outline and course descriptions. (NHM)",

Results indicate that most students were  satisfied with the present class time scheduling pattern, most were not confused by either irregular day patterns or irregular hour patterns, and most were opposed to the idea of scheduling more classes in the afternoon to avoid conflict. About 42 percent of the respondents indicated that they were unable to take courses because they were offered at the same time, and about 49 percent indicated that too many courses were concentrated in the morning.

In 1975 the Board of Representatives unanimously recommended that this be raised to six units of credit. This credit would be awarded on petition after completion of 12 units, for periods of service exceeding 181 days. The request was approved by the Academic Senate, but rejected in a referendum vote of the faculty. This study was conducted in fall 1975 to determine if faculty opinion was still against raising the military credit and to determine faculty opinion on each of the arguments for or against the credit extension. The questionnaire was sent to all 274 certificated faculty members; 144 (52.6 percent) responded. Results indicate that the respondents were overwhelmingly  against the measure. Reaction to four of the five arguments in favor of granting the six units was basically negative. Only the argument that military service is an educational experience received more favorable than unfavorable responses. The general feeling was that automatically granting six units would lessen the value of the A.A. degree granted to veterans. Many faculty, however, would accept a plan which grants the two units and then will allow additional units for formal documented training offered in the service. (DC)",

This paper compares social science instructors in the sample to the total group of faculty. Social science instructors represented the second smallest of the 11 selected subgroups--46 people, or 3 percent of the total. A variety of teaching responsibilities were represented in the subgroup, including general social science, geography, cultural geography, ethnic studies, and political science. College majors of the sample also varied, including social studies, geography,  education, history, and political science. Although only 25.9 percent of the total sample had been students in two-year colleges, 32.6 percent of this subgroup had been. The ratio between male and female instructors was about the same for the total sample and for this group, but a larger percentage of this group represented ethnic minorities.

The colleges included in the sample were carefully selected in terms of locale, control, emphasis, size, and age, and the faculty sample included proportionate numbers of full- and part-time faculty members. This paper compares political science instructors in the sample to the total group of faculty. Nine percent (139) of the total sample indicated law/government as their field. Most of these people predominately taught political science or administration of justice, but in many cases, they also taught history and even social science courses. Most of these instructors held their highest degree in political science (61.9 percent), but significant numbers had majored in history,  education, and law. As a group, the political scientists were fairly similar to the total sample. Almost all (89.2 percent) were white/Caucasians, and the largest percent--87.8--were males, compared with the ratio of 66 percent males in the total sample. Many (23.7 percent) said they were working on their doctorates. Information of age, research, professional development, affiliations, and teaching duties is also summarized, and compared to the characteristics of the total sample. (Author/NHM)",

Terminals are available for student use every weekday from 8:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. The Career Exploration subsystem of CVIS permits a student to explore and receive specific information about 450 occupations. Three College Planning subsystems provide general and specific information about various four-year colleges and their programs. The Technical Specialized School subsystem enables the student to identify local technical and specialized schools. The Apprenticeship subsystem uses a tutorial approach to inform students about  apprenticeships in general and about local apprenticeship opportunities. The Employment Opportunities subsystem provides computer assisted instruction to inform the student about the process of making decisions related to job selection. A Military Information subsystem provides students with a teaching script about draft obligations, deferments, enlistment, military academies, and ROTC units. The Transfer Planning to Illinois Schools subsystem assists students in planning their OCC programs. Results of various surveys indicate that CVIS is well-received and well-utilized by students and counselors alike. (DC)",

They felt that Community, Vocational Preparation, Individual Personal Development, Freedom, and Democratic Governance should be OCC's most important goals. Administrator responses tended to be similar. They felt that Individual Personal Development, Vocational Preparation, Community,  Innovation, and Freedom were the current goals, and that Community, Vocational Preparation, Individual Personal Development, and Democratic Governance should be the most important goals at OCC. Faculty and administrators agreed that Social Criticism/Activism, Public Service, and Off-Campus Learning were and should be the least important goals at OCC.

The pre-test asked for demographic information and data on how each liked to learn and how each believed he/she learned best. The post-test asked for evaluations of the specific learning techniques used during the semester. Results indicated that (1) although only 2 percent indicated on the pre-test that they learned from and enjoyed lectures, lectures were ranked on the post-test as the most effective way of learning (lectures still ranked only third on the list of methods enjoyed, however); (2) although 50 percent  indicated on the pre-test that small group discussions were the most enjoyable and efficacious way to learn, such discussions ranked last on the post-test both in terms of material learned and enjoyment; (3) although only 25 percent had assessed medium sized lecture-discussions as the most enjoyable and efficacious, on the post-test these ranked second in terms of learning and first in terms of enjoyment. The conclusion is that early student perceptions of learning and enjoyment may not effectively foretell how successful a particular teaching technique will be. (DC)",

First, to examine grade distribution and drop-out rate, the records of students enrolled in language courses were compared with the records of the total student body. During the spring, summer and fall sessions of 1973, there was a much greater percentage of A grades awarded in language courses than in all college courses. The drop-out rate was, however, approximately the same. Second, the scores of German and Spanish language students on nationally administered language competency examinations was compared to the national norm. In all cases, OCC class averages exceeded national averages; this success is attributed to programmed  instruction and small class size. Third, to assess student interest in language courses, a questionnaire was administered to all classes taught by full-time foreign language faculty. The only language not currently offered for which there appeared to be considerable committed student interest was Italian. Students additionally indicated an interest in taking courses in Latin American culture, advanced Spanish conversation, and French conversation. (Author/NHM)",

The Mid-Management program described in this document combines formal classroom, group, or individual instruction with on-the-job, coordinated training. It is designed to develop fundamental skills, competencies, knowledge, attitudes, and experiences which will enable graduates to function in positions as supervisors, department and division heads, and other post-entry level  positions in business, industry, institutions, and government. Essential characteristics of Mid-Management programs are divided into four categories: (1) the development of a broad base of background knowledge and practices pertaining to Mid-Management; (2) the development of personal attributes necessary for successful employment; (3) the development of management skills; (4) the development of specialized technial skills.

Essentially, the objectives of the project fall into four major program areas: community outreach, student services, curriculum development, and institutional renewal/staff development. The first year objectives in each area are identified, and the degree to which the objectives were realized are evaluated on the basis of relevant criteria. In most cases, objectives were met at least in part, though in some cases, priorities changed or unanticipated complications were encountered. Many faculty members showed skill and energy in  their individual pursuit of AIDP project objectives. However, some faculty members appeared indifferent to the project.

Data were gathered by sending questionnaires to all the colleges and universities, vocational-technical schools, and proprietary schools in Arkansas, and to a random sample of all senior and junior students in Arkansas high schools. In addition, personal contacts were made to various student aid resource agencies, and a number of published reports and research papers were referenced. The assessment of the kinds of aid received are grouped as grants, loans, employment, and scholarships. The four main resources were found to be: Basic Educational Opportunity Grants, Supplementary Educational Opportunity Grants, National Defense Student Loans, and the College Work-Study Program. All postsecondary  students (65,748) consumed an estimated $20,000,000 during the 1973-74 school year. The greatest number of consumers were four-year public university and college students (18,185, using $11,016,695). Community college students consumed less student aid than any of the other groups (485 students using $176,644). Projections of Arkansas. future student aid needs are made, along with recommendations on how the needs can be met.

It presents: (1) a list of the objectives identified by each participating college for the 1974-75 academic year and the respective evaluation reports reflecting the level  of attainment of each objective; (2) a description of each of the major innovative cooperative education programs addressed in 1974-75 and a collection of sample forms used in those programs; and (3) a discussion of research projects conducted by consortium members, their efforts to train co-op educators, and their impact on federal legislation.

This course will deal with the role which science and technology have played in the events which have shaped the past, and what the application of science and technology can do to provide alternative futures. It will offer credit in either science (with laboratory experience) or humanities (without). Its objectives are to make the student more scientifically literate, to have the student learn about the role of science as a cultural influence, and to have him/her observe the trends of our post-industrial society and extrapolate its future. The report describes  the procedures used to develop this course. It also includes a literature review and an extensive bibliography. A questionnaire distributed to the science and humanities faculty at CPCC to obtain their feelings about the need for such a course, what its objectives should be, and for whom its should be designed is appended. Also appended are a recommended reference list for the course, a flow chart of the procedures to be followed in initiating a new course at CPCC, a tentative course outline, and a sample course evaluation form.

In all, 1,744 completed surveys were returned, a 92 percent response rate. The data are sub-grouped into three regional categories by which summary data are reported so that regional differences may be identified. In addition, where appropriate, data from a national survey conducted by the Educational Testing Service are provided for comparative purposes. Findings report demographic characteristics of the survey population, including sex, family size, family income, and employment. The relationship of the variable of &quot;income level&quot; to the  variables of &quot;college intending to attend&quot; and to &quot;reasons for not attending college&quot; is examined, along with the respondents' receptiveness to the establishment of a community college in the area. Finally, students indicate specific community college programs which would be of interest to them in the general areas of business administration, health services, human services, liberal arts, and miscellaneous. Data are tabulated, and highlights of the ETS survey used for comparison are appended. (NHM)",

        "description":"During the spring semester of 1975, Leeward Community College conducted an investigation of student class schedule changes. A survey instrument was designed, and its completion was made a requirement for students requesting schedule changes. The resulting number of cases analyzed was 2,227, representing a decline of 1,873 from the number of schedule changes in the fall semester. The overwhelming majority of changes, 85.4 percent, involved adding courses. Most course withdrawals, on the other hand, appear to be initiated by faculty members. Over 25 percent of the requests involved a shift from one section of a course to another. Twenty percent of the respondents listed &quot;inconvenient time&quot; as their reason for initiating a change. This was the most frequently mentioned reason.  However, many respondents said that they were unable to register for the courses they wanted during the initial registration period. In fact, 25 percent of all the students changing had registered late in the initial registration period. However, since 17 percent of the changes were initiated by students registering on the first day possible, insufficient or inadequate advisement evidently is also a factor in producing schedule changes. Demographic information on the survey population is provided; data are tabulated; and the survey instrument is appended. (NHM)",

This report details their reactions to academic counseling and registration assistance. The 96 responses represent a 76 percent response rate. Seventy of the respondents had received the associate degree, and 26 had received a certificate. The vocational areas that were most heavily represented were secretarial science and accounting. About 20 percent of the students felt that they did not need counseling, but over 40 percent reported that they could have benefited from additional counseling. Most of the respondents were not veterans, but those who were felt that the  veterans' counseling program was either good or bad improved subsequent to their graduation. About 13 percent of all respondents felt that the quality of academic counseling was excellent, and 30 percent rated it as good. However, about 10 percent of the respondents said it was poor. Most of the students felt that the college was meeting their registration assistance needs, but many noted a need for more vocational offerings in the evening. Data are tabulated, and the survey instrument is appended, along with comments of the respondents. (NHM)",

In all, 273 institutions provided information on 340 business communication courses taught by 404 instructors. All geographic regions of the United States were included in the survey population. Fifty percent of the participating institutions had introduced business communication courses within the past 10 years. In the fall of 1973, there were 6,253 students enrolled in business communication courses in 217 of the institutions reporting. Enrollments in business communication courses have increased in the last 5  years at 90 percent of the institutions. The normal procedure for conducting classes seems to be a combination of lectures and discussions, supplemented by laboratory-workshops. More time is spent on business letters and memoranda, and less time on report writing and oral communication. Textbooks, workbooks, course outlines, and other teaching aids were used with varying degrees of flexibility in the courses reporting. A profile of the typical business communication teacher is provided, and recommendations for further study are made. (Author/NHM)",

This study compares the performances of 180 part-time EOP students enrolled for the fall 1971 semester (experimental group) with the performances of a randomly selected group of 47 part-time regular students (control group). During the years between 1967 and 1974, the experimental group attempted an average number of 5.46 credits per fall semester, and passed 4.06, a 74.46 percent pass rate. The control group attempted an average of 5.8 credits and passed 4.7, an 80.49 percent pass rate. Since course load is generally considered to affect passing, this study suggests that EOP students register for fewer courses. The experimental group attended  Rockland for an average of 5.32 semesters, completing 22.69 degree credits. The control group attended an average of 5.37 semesters, completing 23.20 credits. Twenty percent of the experimental group, and 24.5 percent of the control group had earned degrees by fall 1975.

Improving motivation was  also in the top five, a psycho-social information item, but obviously related to academic matters. Insufficient preparation in various academic skills areas was the most frequently mentioned deficiency mentioned by the respondents. vocational information deficiencies followed closely, and the least expressed concerns were the items in the psycho-social information areas. The survey instrument is appended, and a list of some of the open-ended comments is provided. (NHM)",

        "description":"Although public community colleges have a better enrollment future than other institutions of higher education, the rapid growth rates of the past will not continue into the future. Furthermore, higher education can no longer expect the same increases in its share of federal monies that it enjoyed in the sixties. Considering these facts, and the fact that educational costs rise faster than the economy as a whole since there are no increases in productivity accompanying increases in salaries, it is evident that community colleges face a great challenge to cut expenditures in an attempt to do more with less. Through its participation in CAPES (Council for Area Planning of Educational Services), Waubonsee Community College (WCC) has attempted to do more with less by avoiding  unnecessary duplication and encouraging shared facilities and programs. CAPES includes educational institutions at all levels, from elementary schools to a university; it also includes public and private institutions and formal as well as informal educational institutions. This document reviews the founding, organization, successes, and failures of CAPES. It also reviews enrollment and financial projections for higher education in general, and for community colleges in particular, for the remainder of the twentieth century. (DC)",

The survey instrument used was Student Reaction to College which consists of 150 items which students rank on a three, four, or five point scale. WCC added an additional 14 locally generated items, and eight items designed to elicit descriptive characteristics of the sample (age, race, number of credits, etc.). The item generally fell into 10 categories: instruction and classroom experience, studying, student goals and planning, counseling and advising, administration  regulations, class scheduling and registration, student activities, living, faculty contact, and library and bookstore. The instruction and classroom experience category contained the greatest number of items (47). Although students were generally pleased with the presentation of class material, some said that teachers do not gear their instruction to student interests and abilities. Overall the college received a favorable rating. Tabulated data are appended. (NHM)",

Sixty-six (80 percent) of the two-year contracts contained such clauses, as opposed to 23 of the four-year contracts. This paper catalogues the provisions of the clauses in the two-year college contracts. Fifty-five of the 66 contracts guarantee access to the file for the individual faculty member. Thirty-eight specifically give faculty members the right to respond to material in the file. Twenty-two give faculty the right to reproduce documents found in the personnel file. Nine attempt to specifically list material to be included in the file. Twenty-eight require that any material  concerned with grievance activity by faculty members must be kept separately from the file, and that the file may not record any information about grievances. Eight contain provisions which allow faculty members to apply to have reprimands removed from their files after a specified period of time. Twenty make reference to the establishment of one central filing system. Data are organized into three tables, which also specify the agent affiliation of the 66 contracts. (Author/NHM)",

        "description":"In 1974, the California legislature directed the California Postsecondary Education Commission to develop a plan for establishing independent postsecondary education counseling centers to serve California residents not enrolled in a college or high school. On the basis of interviews, a review of the literature, and site visits to existing counseling centers, the Commission developed three alternative plans for pilot advisement centers. Each center would provide: (1) a comprehensive testing program to enable clients to assess their educational strengths and weaknesses, career skills, and interests; (2) current information and advice on all public and private postsecondary education opportunities in California; (3) information and counseling about career options, requirements, and  opportunities in the state; (4) information on costs of education and opportunities for financial aid; (5) current information about special programs (such as child care) or services of educational institutions and agencies in the community; and (6) a referral service to help clients obtain needed counseling information not directly provided by the center. Included in the proposal is a plan for an information system which would help coordinate and disseminate existing information about local opportunities, programs, and services. (Author/DC)",

The methodology employed in producing this self-study is intended to form the framework for a continuous learning-oriented short and long-range planning process. This document presents the history and present status of WACC, and develops a new philosophy and mission statement, institution and unit goals and objectives. It recommends that WACC make its educational programs more accessible to all citizens within its ten-county service area by decentralizing services to three main regional centers. Four different enrollment projections are made, for each of the major college programs.  Overall, assuming the initiation of the three campus approach, it is estimated that WACC could offer services to over 13,000 people (4,789 FTE) by 1985, a 30 percent increase over 1975. A major goal is to develop as a statewide career education model, coordinating career development and preparation through secondary, postsecondary and community education services. Also reviewed are WACC's educational programs and services, support services, staff development programs, and physical and financial resources. (Author/NHM)",

Since the demand for new community college faculty is dropping off, and since many persons already holding two-year college teaching positions desire further preparation, universities should design their doctoral programs for the latter group. Greater success will be enjoyed if the program allows its students to retain their positions by studying in their home area and at their own pace. It is also important that doctoral programs for community college instructors attempt to straddle disciplines wherever possible. It is further  recommended that such programs: (1) offer classes, workshops, modules, and lectures on the community college campus itself, (2) involve community college faculty members as clinical professors, (3) appoint a program head to take responsibility for all aspects of the program, (4) provide a component to assist two-year college division and department chairpersons to be supervisors and coordinators of curriculum and instruction, and (5) provide courses for those faculty interested in professional upgrading but not in the degree.

        "description":"In order to determine if there are differences in the work values of two-year college students among various vocational/occupational majors, Super's Work Values Inventory was administered to 391 freshmen entering Middlesex Community College in the fall of 1973. Among the 127 males and 268 females surveyed, there were 178 liberal arts majors, 73 secretarial majors, 53 allied health majors, and 87 business administration majors. Altruism was shown to be positively related to being female, perhaps due to the dominance of females in allied health programs. Economic Return was positively related to being male, especially for those in the business administration program. Liberal arts males tended to be more altruistic and security minded. The secretarial group showed a high value  orientation to Surroundings, but also rated Economic Return and Supervisory Relations as important. Another aspect of this study examined the effectiveness of the Work Values Inventory in predicting college grades, as compared to the predictive effectiveness of high school grades. For a majority of open-admissions programs, measurement of work values is a better predictor of community college success than high school grade point average, since work values are an important dimension of the motivation variable.

        "author":["Gordon, Dennis"],
        "description":"Students in intensive two-year college accounting programs often encounter difficulties in trying to transfer to four-year college accounting programs. Courses such as auditing and taxation, which according to American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) standards, should be taken in the third or fourth year of a four-year program, are not usually transferrable. The most effective resolution of this problem occurs on the local level, where the two-year colleges meet with the universities to which their students transfer, and reach a mutually satisfactory agreement. Where appropriate, proficiency examination should be given to validate credit. The goal should be to minimize these examinations once the four-year school knows the quality of the students it  receives. Other possible solutions to the problem include: student transfer to a related department such as finance or management, rather than to an accounting program; counseling potential transfer students to avoid intensive specialization in accounting, choosing instead a related major, such as data processing. While the national professional accounting associations have been highly influential in establishing standards for four-year accounting programs, they have shown little regard for the needs of two-year college transfer students, or for the professional development of two-year college accounting teachers.

A control group, composed of 20 children who attended private nursery school and subsequently attended kindergartens in their own neighborhoods, was also used. During the day care program and through the middle of the first grade year, data were collected in seven time periods for three areas of motivational/cognitive interaction: (1) changes in the relationship between personal interaction variables, (2) changes in  intrinsic need to interact effectively and competently with the environment, and (3) changes in the impulsivity/reflectivity dimension. Comparison of the data from the two experimental groups showed little indication that the kindergarten program had produced significant effects; the small effects shown late in the year would have required an extension of the program for verification. However, there were no indications of fade-out effects of Head Start for either group.

Each visit consisted of three segments: two play episodes of 10 minutes each and an intervening segment of approximately 40 minutes in which each child performed on standard cognitive tasks. During the play episodes each child was presented with high prototypical toys and less prototypical toys. An observer continuously tracked the child's activities on a tape recorder with a 10-second time base and a coded observation schedule; the tapes were transcribed to obtain for each play episode measures of \"pretend frequency,\"\"variation on pretend,\"  and \"total play activity.\" Results indicate that (1) although pretending with less prototypical toys was depressed when children were 20 months of age, it increased with age for both sexes; (2) with highly prototypical materials, girls' pretending increased between 20 and 26 months of age, whereas boys' pretending decreased; and (3) pretending increased as children became more familiar with the situation. These findings are discussed in terms of theoretical formulations which interpret early pretending as an index of the child's acquisition of mental representations which code objects, activities, and social rules.

The second paper outlines those factors which affect preschool expansion, defines 'preschool program', and describes the parameters of the preschool program. Possible errors which emerged as a  result of the emphasis on 'enrichment' are discussed, and it is suggested that a major goal for preschool education is to help children make sense of their own everyday experiences.

        "description":"This project describes the proposed design and management of systems for supplying child care and supportive services in the East Metropolitan Area of St. Paul, Minnesota, and addresses the general problem of the increased need and demand for formal child care services. The stated goal of the project is to assure child care services which are conducive to the optimal growth and development of all children needing such care. The attainment of this goal is seen as involving the development of dual service systems, one system supplying formal child care services and the other system supplying supportive child development services. Objectives for the child care service system are to be met in two phases: Phase I, establishing a child care service unit, involving essential public,  private, employer, union, parent and professional interests, establishing baseline data for use in forecasting demand, and recommending the implementation of a tested system for supplying formal services to meet parent demands; and Phase II supplying the formal services needed and assisting other areas in replicating the system. Objectives of the supportive child development system are to identify the needs of parents, children, and caregivers, and to plan and secure funding for a system capable of supplying the comprehensive and consultative services required.

        "description":"This paper, presented by the Black Advisory Task Force to the Child Development Associate (CDA) Consortium, reports on the development of the &quot;collaborative process&quot; approach to the examination and credentialing of CDA candidates. The collaborative approach was designed to be free from racial bias, to be predictive of job performance, and to be a relevant and workable assessment process. The fundamental assumptions underlying collaborative assessment are outlined, and three essential features of the collaborative assessment process are described: (1) evaluation of the candidate's performance with children in the child care center where she or he works, (2) responsibility and control by the CDA candidate over some parts of the process, and (3) development of a community assessment  team incorporating perspectives of parents, center professionals and external professionals to provide continuing feedback to the candidate and finally to judge the candidate's competence. It is concluded that collaborative training and collaborative assessment on this model should proceed together, and that this training assessment method can be proposed as a viable alternative to traditional methods.

        "description":"This study examines serial habituation in a sample of 54 infants aged 2, 3, and 4 months to determine whether age changes are partially a function of different \"strategies\" rather than simply different rates of habituation. The serial habituation hypothesis proposes that attention and habituation of attention proceed in order of the relative saliencies of cues. This hypothesis was examined cross sectionally, longitudinally within subjects, and longitudinally between subjects (by cohorts) using a traditional habituation paradigm. Individual components of the standard stimulus were displayed before and after successive exposures of the standard for familiarization. Relative saliencies of the individual components for each child were indexed by measuring the degree of response  produced by the initial presentation. When pre- and post-exposure fixation times were compared, it appeared that for all ages habituation was underway to the parts of the stimulus in order of the relative saliencies in agreement with the serial habituation hypothesis. The data were also found to be fairly consistent across methodologies, suggesting that results were not a product of a particular experimental design. In addition, it was found that while the order of interaction with components is in agreement with the serial habituation hypothesis, apparent differences between groups of \"fast habituators\" and \"slow habituators\" lend some validity to the idea that rate of habituation may be an index of information processing or efficiency.

The Kohlberg procedure of presenting problems and dilemmas to children was adopted, but the Kohlberg dilemmas were found to seem remote to children younger than 10 years of age, and incomprehensible to children younger than 6 years of age. Adaptation of the dilemmas was approached by first determining the central features of a young child's social life and then designing problems accordingly. Four central concerns were distinguished in the social-moral universe of a young child: (1) concerns of &quot;positive justice,&quot; including problems like why and how one should share with others; (2) concerns of authority; (3) concerns of responsibility and blame; and  (4) concerns of social convention and custom. A distinct sequence of stages is described through which each of the conceptual concerns develops in children between ages 4 and 10. The measurement of social-conceptual development in preschool and elementary school children is discussed, and it is suggested that engaging children in a real situation with practical consequences for them may be more meaningful than instructing them at the hypothetical-verbal level.

Pre- and post-questionnaires were administered to all students before and after the film session to determine any changes in acceptance of beliefs contained in the commericials, in attitudes, or in behavioral intentions. The posttest included recall items to indicate whether children attended to the commericals. The pretest for the older children also included items designed to measure family communications. Results indicated high recall of brand for  all age groups and little if any relationship between program liking and reaction to the commercials. The children were influenced to change their levels of acceptance of the beliefs contained in the commercials; this effect was weakest in children who came from families which stressed questioning in family communications. Younger children showed shifts in beliefs produced by both deceptive and non-deceptive ads, but older children were persuaded only by one deceptive commercial. No direct impact was found on brand attitudes or on intentions. (GO)",

Subjects, 3- to 5-year-olds from 13 Head Start classes, were assigned in class groups to one of four experimental treatments: (1) viewing neutral films and playing with irrelevant play materials (i.e., materials as devoid of prosocial content as possible), (2) viewing prosocial television and playing with irrelevant materials, (3) viewing prosocial television and playing with relevant materials (those with prosocial content), and (4) viewing prosocial television and playing with relevant materials under the supervision of specially trained teachers. Baseline data were collected on classroom organization and  student-teacher affective relationship, and classes were categorized as &quot;high structure&quot; (high organization/low teacher warmth) or &quot;low structure&quot; (low organization/high teacher warmth). Following experimental treatments, observations of children's natural behavior in ongoing class activities were made using four observational categories: positive social interaction with peers, verbal interaction with peers, imaginative play, and nonverbal interaction with peers. Results indicate that the most consistent effects on positive social interaction with peers and imaginative play occurred in the condition that combined prosocial television, related play materials and teacher training and involvement. Low structure classrooms were the most conducive to obtaining positive effects on social  behavior. (GO)",

        "description":"A total of 211 kindergarten children, aged 63 to 81 months, were classified into two groups according to the risk of failure in first grade predicted for them on the basis of their performance on the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) and the Draw a Person (DAP) test. According to prediction, Group I children without intervention would probably fail at learning to read, and Group II children would read with no unusual difficulty. A diagnostic/prescriptive program was designed for each child in each group and implemented through the kindergarten year; however, Group I children received more intensive individualized attention than Group II children. At the end of the year the children were reassessed and reassigned to risk groups, and the data were compared to data obtained in  other kindergartens. Results showed that risk status is related to level of development, but not to age or sex. There is tentative evidence to suggest that readiness for success in Grade 1 depends upon development as well as kindergarten training. Correlation between development and risk may point to reasons why (of the \"at risk\" children who profited most from prescriptive education in kindergarten) the boys performed at levels below those of their female classmates at the end of the year. Little variance in risk status was explained by DAP, which was negatively correlated with reading readiness and fine motor control. (GO)",

The study already conducted had two parts. The first part examined whether a series of inserts into Sesame Street programs depicting children of other races in ethnic and integrated settings would result in more favorable attitudes toward children of other races. It was found that the English Canadian subjects preferred to play with nonwhite children rather than whites following the insert viewing. The second part of the study examined whether favorable attitudes toward French  Canadian children would be achieved by depicting an attractive French Canadian child as central character in the inserts. Again, favorable attitudes were found following viewing. The planned study attempts to overcome a previous weakness in the research, which by using captive audiences gives results of limited generality. The plan is to assess the level of interest that 9- to 12-year-olds have in a prosocial documentary-type program which is intended to familiarize them with children of other races. Measures of attitude change will be taken after viewing as well as after discussion and writing about the film, to find out whether attitude change is enhanced by students' active involvement and rehearsal.

The ICPS skills have been demonstrated to indicate good or poor behavioral adjustment, defined in terms of the reflectivity/impulsivity dimension of behavior. The training was intended to teach children how to think and help them develop a problem-solving thinking \"style\" for coping with everyday interpersonal problems. Subjects were 69 entering kindergarteners who had received ICPS training in nursery school and 62 kindergarteners who had not. The trained group was divided into a retraining group (N=39) and a control group (N=30), and the previously untrained group was divided into a  training group (N=35) and an untrained group (N=27). Each group was administered the Preschool Interpersonal Problem Solving Test (PIPS) at the end of nursery school and kindergarten. Children trained in nursery school but not in kindergarten conceptualized a significantly greater number of solutions to interpersonal problems than untrained children after nursery school, and showed no significant loss over the following year. One year of training was found to be as beneficial as two with respect to behavioral adjustment, and findings suggested that early nursery intervention is optimal.

Words were presented over three trials within one of the presentation modes and one taxonomic category, followed by a fourth trial in which the six experimental groups received a shift in either taxonomic category, modality, or both category and modality. For the two control groups presentation modality and taxonomic category were the same on all four trials. The stimulus materials were 12 words from the taxonomic category of animal and three words from the category of clothing. Results indicated that auditory and visual presentation of stimuli produced a significant release  effect with a shift of taxonomic category. This suggests that young children are able to use taxonomic category efficiency as an encoding dimension in both modalities. In the modality shift conditions, a shift to a visual presentation after three auditory trials produced a small amount of release, while a shift to an auditory presentation after three visual trials produced a large decrement in recall performance rather than a release from proactive interference. Possible causes of this asymmetrical release effect are discussed. (GO)",

For each test, a comparative analysis was made of results from each sample population. Findings indicate substantially similar patterns of response to test items at each age level across cultures. This commonality is attributed to the fact that middle class Puerto Rican and New York children share many cultural elements. In each culture, school practices, television programs, stores and job roles are closely  comparable. The paired associate task did results in discrepant results across the two cultures; however, reasons for this are not understood and it is noted that the processes of memory do follow similar developmental trends in each population.

Three major variables are examined: academic performance, motivation for school, and security development. Differences in school marks, teacher assessment, I.Q. scores, sex and grade level are also explored. Four classes of grade 7 pupils and three classes of grade 8 pupils (a total of 210 subjects) are included in the study. The tests employed were the Institute of Child Study Security Test-Elementary Form, the Canadian Tests of Basic Skills, the Frymier Junior Index of  Motivation, the Dominion Group Test of Learning Capacity-Intermediate Form, and a pupil rating scale. Results from these tests are discussed in detail. (ED)",

Program participants were children, ages 3 months to 17 years of age living in foster homes in Chicago and East St. Louis, Illinois. Some of the children had serious emotional and/or physical problems, but all were free of significant ties to their parents and relatives. The major components of the program were: (1) finding children who could benefit from adoption, (2) providing direct services to children, (3) locating and developing adoptive homes, (4) effecting adoptive placements (with and without subsidy), and (5) research on all phases. Permanent nonfoster homes were found for nearly 70 percent of the children; about 12 percent were assigned to  remain in planned, long-term foster care because of strong ties with foster parents who would not adopt. Adoptive homes could not be found for 8 percent of the children. An extensive recruitment program for adoptive parents was initiated, incorporating advertising, door-to-door recruitment in black neighborhoods, and interaction with foster parents. A discussion of the role of adoption subsidies is included. Appendices provide data tables and a casefinding schedule. (BRT)",

Inadequate health screening, improper selection methods, and crowded and unsafe aircraft are cited as major problems with the airlift of the children. It is noted that many observers have viewed the airlift as a political ploy and/or a tokenistic effort to divert attention from the greater problem of all displaced Vietnamese. The airlift is also criticized for portraying American disrespect for Vietnamese culture and for catering to Americans who had previously been unable to adopt children. A comprehensive plan for providing Vietnamese  children with social services is presented. Specific recommendations include: (1) separation of humanitarian aid to the Vietnamese from all other aspects of U.S. Vietnamese policy, (2) an extensive mobilization of Federal bureaucracy to meet Vietnamese needs, (3) the designation of an individual and a federal agency other than AID to take charge of such a mobilization, and (4) provision of assistance to the 2,000 Vietnamese children brought here during Operation Babylift as well as to the many more children remaining in Vietnam.

The curriculum was used in a preliminary pilot study and in a formal 8-week intervention program with 14 second and third grade classes. The social intervention procedure used in this study consisted of situations in which children received feedback which allowed them to experience indecision and exposure to slightly more adequate reasoning. A series of 16 filmstrips showing hypothetical conflicts were developed, and follow-up activities (small-group discussions, role play and debates) were planned to ensure children's active participation. Program evaluation indicated that little structural  change had occurred and the view is expressed that process rather than stage changes more adequately reflect program effectiveness. Such process variables were incorporated into the evaluation tests by introducing a group interaction measure, videotapes, and tape recordings. Results obtained tentatively suggest that considerable change occurred in individual children and in interaction of the groups. (GO)",

Society regards the family unit as a sacrosanct system open to inspection and intervention only when there is tangible evidence of physical child abuse. The recent upsurge of interest in the problem of child abuse may be attributed to heightened awareness rather than an increase in abuse occurrence as it was not very long ago that many abusive child rearing practices were accepted procedures for socializing the child. The definition of cruel and unusual punishment should be extended to all forms of punishment which leave negative consequences for the growth and wellbeing of the child. Literature is  reviewed on: (1) patterns of parent punishment practices, (2) effects of physical and psychological punishment practices, (3) alternatives to physical and psychological punishment which serve the functions of socialization while furthering the cause of children's rights and welfare, and (4) implications and implementation of the proposed alternatives. It is suggested that making child rearing practices more open to scrutiny would not only protect children's interests and rights but would encourage parents to discuss their problems, ask for guidance and take advantage of available resources.

Observations were made of 16 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds in many settings within a university laboratory preschool classroom over a period of 6 weeks, using a 7-category observation schedule. The schedule comprised social interactions, materials interactions, both social and materials interactions, and no interaction; each of the interactions was also judged positive or negative. In general, it was found that environmental supports (activities or equipment) which might have  set the occasion for, and strengthened social behavior were not available. High levels of social behavior, however, occurred in areas where there was an ample supply of materials and no apparent \"need\" to interact. The results of this study suggest that the rate of social behavior was low. At best, the level of social behavior was more comparable to that of younger children. When social behaviors occurred, their distribution among the settings was consistent with data obtained in samples having higher overall rates of social interaction. (GO)",

White lower class parents  were found to base performance expectations on their child's IQ, but for black parents, IQ played no part in determining initial expectations. All correlations between absences and first grade reading and arithmetic marks were highly significant. Parents and teachers were found to &quot;play it safe&quot; in expressing expectations and awarded mostly &quot;Bs&quot; in estimating children's future marks. Lower class parents were found to be far less involved (as measured by response in this research) than middle class parents.

        "description":"This paper elucidates the implications of life-span developmental psychology for theory and method in the field of child development. Emphasis is given to three theoretical issues: (1) historical-evolutionary versus ontogenetic components of change, (2) the role of chronological age, and (3) continuity versus discontinuity in the description and explanation of behavior development. Two methodological issues are discussed: (1) the conceptual and methodological distinction between developmental change versus developmental differences and (2) the problem of examining historical, distal relationships among variables. While none of these is completely novel in developmental psychology, lifespan research and theory has led to propositions and arguments which accentuate, clarify, and  articulate important developmental issues. It is concluded that child development researchers need to recognize these issues and that such recognition should lead to a heightened understanding of the unique aspects of a developmental approach to the study of behavior and to novel questions, interpretations, conceptualizations, and methods of study.

A total of 48 3- to 5-year-olds in three day care centers participated in the study. A 10-item questionnaire was administered to each child individually in a location separated from the other children but not out of the day care center. The first two questions were directed at whether the children thought boys could play with dolls and girls could play with trucks. The next seven questions pertained to sex role stereotypes of adults and their work. The 10th question was, \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" In this study, a high number of affirmative responses was taken to imply an absence of sex role stereotypes while a high score of negative replies was taken to  signify a rigid sex role concept. In the 4- and 5-year-old age group only slightly over half of the responses were affirmative while among 3-year-olds 86 percent of the answers were positive. On question 10, there was no significant difference between the variety of choices of males and females. It was concluded that the majority of 4- and 5-year-olds have begun to form more rigid sex role stereotypes in comparison with 3-year-old children who still show flexible sex role concepts. (JMB)",

A total of 18 male and 15 female infants aged 22-48 days watched a film in which the circular elements and inter-element spaces of the projected image alternately expanded and contracted. A display containing 800 black circles elicited significantly more head responses directed away from the screen than displays having either one or three circles of the same size. The differences were only found in the expansion trials. Infants thus processed depth information provided by the expanding spaces between elements or movement of the elements toward the peripheral visual field. The results were in agreement with Gibson's  (1966, 1968) description of the adequate stimulus for perceived movement in depth. (Author/BRT)",

Following an aggressive act by the target child and punishment administered by the adult subject, the adult saw the child react to being disciplined in one of four ways (plead, reparation, ignore or defiance). The adult subjects were given a subsequent opportunity to reward or punish the child again by offering or taking away points that the child could ostensibly trade for free play time. The child who reacted to adult discipline by being defiant or by ignoring the agent was most harshly dealt with by the adult subjects. The child who  pleaded for lighter punishment was less severely treated, and the child who reacted to punishment by apologizing and promising to behave was generally rewarded by the adult subjects. These findings are discussed in terms of a bidirectional model of childhood socialization wherein recognition is given to the active role the child plays in controlling the disciplinary practices of socializing agents.

        "description":"This study explored the developmental changes in children's effective utilization of verbal versus pictorial stimuli in forming connections between stimulus and response elements in a paired-associate task. A total of 112 children (56 males and 56 females), half of them 4-year-olds and half 8-year-olds, were tested under eight conditions involving three variables. The first variable was mode of study, which was either a pictorial or a verbal original presentation of the items. The second variable was mode of test, which was either a pictorial or a verbal presentation of the test items. The third variable was the presence or absence of a mnemonic on the original trials. The mnemonic was either a sentence or an interaction picture combining the elements of each pair. In all  conditions, each pair contained an animal as a stimulus term and a common object as a response term. Within-list and extra-list distractor pairs were used on the test trials. Results showed that 4-year-old and 8-year-old children performed significantly better with a mnemonic than without one. After a visual study trial, younger children had difficulty performing on a verbal recognition test but performed better on a pictorial recognition test. The performance of 8-year-olds showed no significant differences for test mode or study mode. (Author/BRT)",

A total of 24 sixth graders participated in the study, 12 in the training group and 12 in the control group which received no training. The training group met twice a week, once to lead dilemma discussion groups with first graders and once with the experimenters to discuss their experiences as discussion leaders. The training program lasted for 22 weeks. Pretesting and posttesting was done in the areas of interpersonal conceptions, moral reasoning, means-end social problem solving, and referential communication. Posttest analyses of variance indicated significant treatment differences favoring the experimental group on the interpersonal conceptions  measure, but no significant group differences on means-end social problem solving on referential communication. Results also indicated that the experimental subjects were significantly more sure than the control subjects that they did not want to accept lower level moral reasoning responses. There were no sex differences for any measure. It was concluded that the results of posttesting in both interpersonal and moral development areas support the notion of increased complexity in social-cognitive developmental thought for the experimental group.

Attending behavior (defined as &quot;eyes oriented towards the teacher and/or teaching materials for a full 5-second interval&quot;) was measured for each child during a 10-minute story period on four consecutive days. During each story period, cassette recordings of two stories were played while the teacher showed corresponding pictures. Between the two stories, the teacher performed a number of distinct motor behaivors (i.e., arms raised over head). These motor behaviors were used to test children's recall of model behavior. After each day's storytime, children were individually questioned about the material presented during the second story and  were asked to perform the same motor behaviors that the teacher had done between the two stories. Children were asked questions to which answers could be obtained: (1) only by looking at the pictures or (2) only by listening to the story text. Half of the subjects (the experimental group) received praise for orienting their eyes towards the teaching materials and not talking to other children. Results showed that the mean level of attending on treatment days for the experimental group was 70.25% compared with 46.2% attending for the control group, a statistically significant difference. It appears that reinforcing visual attention does facilitate learning in the classroom for most children. (BRT)",

Observations of children (ages 2 to 11) and their supervisors at 26 preschools and primary schools were recorded. Analysis of the observational data revealed marked Polynesian - Pakeha differences in modal patterns of interaction. Two contrasting principles for the formation of social units with implications for cognitive functioning were observed; (1) the Polynesian &quot;inclusive&quot; style promoting the formation of integrated groups, feelings of social solidarity and cooperation, and (2) the  European &quot;exclusive&quot; style resulting in parallel activities by individual units or intensely associated pairs. Variations by setting and ethnic mix were also reported. The relation of this study to recent research on group problem-solving was discussed, and the possible value for all children of introducing more group problem-solving techniques in the classroom was raised.

Attention is given to several kinds of cognitive and perceptual tasks in which sex differences in spatial ability have been shown to exist; among these are tasks involving: (1) recall and detection of shapes, (2) geometry and mathematics, (3) directional sense, (4) Piagetian skills and (5) the game of chess. A neurological model for sex differences in spatial ability is discussed, which suggests that some brains are further specialized (lateralized) for spatial analysis than others, and that these \"further specialized\" brains are more frequently male than female. Medical research with war veterans who have suffered brain injuries, data  from anatomical and clinical studies and results of testing of normal individuals are cited to suggest that the left hemisphere of the brain seems primarily organized for verbal function, the right hemisphere for visual-spatial functions. An alternative model for sex differences in spatial ability suggests that women prefer to code information phonologically (due to their earlier language development) and that men prefer to code information visually. Data are presented which support this view. The possibilities of evolutionary selection for male spatial superiority and the effects of sex steroid hormones on brain specialization and nervous system activity are considered. (BRT)",

According to this overview, developmental theory and empirical research, which had been the focus of attention in the early 20th century, experienced a complete decline during and after World War II, with a slow recovery during the 60's and 70's. Anglo-Saxon research and social demands have shaped this recovery, and today, German developmentalists appear to be especially sensitive to theoretical, methodological and meta theoretical issues. They also prefer to study more complex units of behavior within a broader scope  than their American counterparts, considering this kind of research closer to socially and educationally relevant real-life situations.

This investigation focused on episodic prospective remembering (memory for actions performed either infrequently or on an irregular basis ) rahter than habitual prospective remembering (memory for actions routinely engaged in). Subjects included 41 5-year-old and 41 7-year-old children. Each child was asked to take an envelope when returning to the classroom, and was then distracted for seven minutes. Remembering was compared in three different conditions: in the cue condition, children were provided with an appropriate picture to use as an external retrieval cue; in the elaboration condition, children were also coached in the use of the cue; a third  condition was a control. No significant differences were found among these conditions. A greater number of 7-year-olds than 5-year-olds remembered (p less than .001). Thus the results suggest that young children do not take advantage of external retrieval cues to facilitate episodic prospective remembering, at least when the task and conditions are those of the present investigation.

        "description":"Preschool children were presented with conflicting cues in order to assess the importance of pointing, verbalizing, and looking by adults in directing the attention of children. The study involved two procedures: first, the experimenter indicated by pointing, verbalizing, or looking whether a big or little bead was to be put on a string by the child; following this, the child indicated for the experimenter which beads he should put on the string. Seven girls and 16 boys, ranging in age 3 to 6 years, were included in the study. Results indicated that children were most likely to attend to pointing cues of adults and least likely to attend to the adult's eyes as a cue. These results are contrary to suggestions that speech is of primary importance in the development of attention,  and further suggest (1) the necessity of considering attention as a factor in investigations of various modes of representation; and (2) that the importance of nonverbal means of instruction for preschoolers should not be neglected.

The study employs a reciprocal model which analyzes effects of the caregiver on the child and of the child on the caregiver by comparing the interaction of the same caregiver with &quot;own&quot; and &quot;other&quot; children. Similarly, interaction of &quot;own&quot; and &quot;other&quot; children with the peer group in family day care is compared. Interaction in 19 family day care homes was observed. In each home, direct observations were made of two focal children: the caregiver.s own child and the day care child closest in age and of the same sex. Six 10-minute observational segments were collected for each focal child over two half days. Comparison of caregiver's &quot;own&quot; and matched &quot;day  care&quot; children indicated that: (1) &quot;own&quot; children engaged in more negative social-emotional behaviors and received more discouragement from others; (2) &quot;day care&quot; children played more with peers and alone; and (3) caregivers interacted more with &quot;own&quot; children, watching them more and giving them more affection, while peers participated more with &quot;day care&quot; children.

A total of 72 children from kindergarten, third grade, and sixth grade, and an additional 24 college students were tested individually on a set of six realistic pictures. The task was to reconstruct the depicted scenes on a flannelboard using reversible felt pieces that were asymmetrical left to right. Three instruction conditions were used: copying, rotation, and perspective or self-rotation. The type and number of errors in orienting the felt pieces were recorded. It was found that errors declined with increasing age. Subjects were found to make more left-right than top-bottom orientation errors, particularly in the younger age range and in the more  difficult rotation and perspective conditions. It is suggested that the systematic nature of left-right errors at all ages is consistent with a hypothesis that biological factors contribute to greater difficulty in learning left-right than top-bottom.

        "description":"This paper presents a review of the literature concerning the infant Apgar scoring system and its relationship to later mental and motor development. Since 1952, the Apgar scoring system has provided a viable means of assessing the infant's immediate postnatal condition. Researchers have demonstrated that while the 1-minute Apgar score is a useful indicator of the infant's postnatal condition, it does not seem to have the same strength as the 5-minute Apgar score which appears to provide a more sensitive indicator of the newborn's condition during the neonatal period. In addition, the Apgar system of assessment has been tentatively accepted as a basis for the prediction of later mental and motor development. The 5-minute score appears to be a more accurate predictor than the  1-minute score in regard to later development of the child. Further research (such as the ongoing Educational Follow Up Study) will help to determine the extent to which neonatal Apgar scores may be predictive of later language development, academic achievement, and school behavior.

Decrements produced by concurrent performance were compared for the three age groups. When the timeshared tasks were presented as equally important, timesharing produced significantly greater proportional decrements in the tracking performance of the younger children. In all age groups, tracking task decrements were directly related to matching task difficulty. Subsequently, the children were instructed that one or the other of the tasks was more important and that they were to improve their performance on that task. All  three age groups showed a significant improvement on the task emphasized by instructions. The relationship of the results to two models of information processing is discussed. (Author/BRT)",

For example, science activities reinforce cooperative skills black children acquire in play, aid in the development of concepts about the world, offer opportunities for parental involvement, and should provide the black child with an acceptable avenue for questioning adults, as well as an avenue into adult/child discussions. However, teachers frequently do not implement science activities with such children due to a lack of motivation for teaching science, goals, materials and equipment, and knowledge of appropriate teaching techniques. Reasons for teaching science additionally include cultivating children's curiosity; developing a questioning, logical mind; and promoting the capacity for  imaginative reflection. Science activities should aim toward developing children's skills through the process of manipulating materials and reasoning to conclusions. Outdoor resources for science activities are numerous even in the inner city, and most classrooms have much of the equipment needed for many basic science projects. In teaching science, teachers should change their role from answer-giver to question-asker, begin with black children at their individual levels and within their familiar environment, facilitate children's development with concrete materials, and encourage them to talk about their discoveries.

        "author":["Rowe, Bobby Louise"],
        "description":"This study established a controlled instructional procedure for visual concept learning in a school setting and investigated the possibility that an ability trait difference could affect visual learning of the concept. A total of 84 high visualizers and 84 low visualizers were selected from 629 fourth grade children according to their scores on two tests of visualizing ability. Subjects were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: (1) the sequenced learning group viewed a sequenced filmstrip containing instruction on the concept of symmetry; (2) the trial-and-error group viewed a trial-and-error filmstrip presenting the same concept; and (3) the control group saw no filmstrip. Following treatment, each group was given a test of concept mastery and a test of the transfer of  that mastery to identifying symmetry in works of art. Results indicate that: (1) differing degrees of visualizing ability can be identified; (2) visualizing ability is strongly related to success in acquiring the concept of symmetry in visual arts; (3) the ability to identify symmetry in examples of visual art can be learned by both high and low visualizers; (4) a greater degree of transfer of this ability is achieved by high visualizers; and (5) the sequenced presentation was more effective than the trial-and-error presentation.

Subjects were 15 directors, 30 teachers, 524 children in 30 classrooms. Interview schedules and a classroom observation scale were the two instruments used. The findings indicate that: (1) the percentage of parents who are board members is not a determinant of parent influence; (2) there is a relationship between the amount of parent involvement in administrative areas such as fiscal control, hiring and firing, and personnel practices, and the amount of influence in curriculum/teaching areas; (3) this influence is mediated primarily through the director; (4) the amount of parent  involvement is related to whether classrooms will be child-centered or adult-centered; and (5) this relationship varies with the social class status and educational level of parent policymakers.

        "description":"This dissertation investigates the effect of an individualized remedial reading and mathematics program (the Philadelphia Checkpoint Center Program) on the self concept of low achieving third-grade children. In the program, children received individualized, diagnostic and prescriptive instruction for 40 minutes daily in groups of 15 or fewer. In an effort to assess the effectiveness of Checkpoint on self concept, and experimental group of 184 third-grade pupils was identified and exposed to the program for 50 days. A control group was composed of children who were identified as low achievers but who did not participate in the program. The Reading Section of Form A of the California Achievement Test was administered prior to the 50-day period and Form B was administered at the end  of the study interval to children in both the experimental and control groups. Three independent self concept scales were administered to both groups before and after the treatment period. Two of the self concept measures were self reports while the third, an inferred self concept assessment scale, was completed by classroom teachers. The teacher scale and one self-report form are included in appendices. Results indicated that positive changes in the self concept and in reading achievement of children exposed to the Checkpoint Program during the experimental period were significantly greater on all measures than changes experienced by the control group.

        "description":"North-Central New Mexico has many of the problems common to other rural areas. Unemployment and underemployment rates tend to be high and per capita income relatively low. This study evaluated regional economic performance over a 19-year period (1949-1968) as compared to other regions and the nation. Shift analysis (a means of examining regional growth through study of relative shifts in economic activity) was used. This method of comparative-growth analysis measured regional performance against national standards by attributing regional employment growth to 3 basic effects: (1) national growth effect (the number of employees gained or lost by a local sector if employment in the sector grew or declined at the national total employment growth rate); (2) industry-mix effect (the  region's commitment to either fast or slow growth industries); and (3) competitive effect (the differential rates of growth by industry in various regions in the country). Employment data by industry were obtained from the Bureau of Business Research &quot;Income and Employment in New Mexico&quot; reports. Missing data due to disclosure regulations were estimated according to U.S. Department of Commerce County Business Patterns statistics. Among the findings were: total regional employment increased more than expected (i.e., at greater than the national rate) and the most profound influence on regional employment was the increase in government employment.

        "description":"Located on the Pecos River in San Miguel County, El Cerrito (New Mexico) was a culturally stable rural community. Almost a cultural island, its inhabitants were of native or Spanish American stock, descendants of conquistadores who mixed their blood with that of the indigenous population. Religion and the Catholic church had a profound influence on the people. This was shown in their thinking, attitudes and values, and day-to-day activities. The family had a strong influence on the community. When the village was first settled, it was completely surrounded by enough grass land to support sheep and cattle to afford the people an independent livelihood. The community was almost a complete and independent socioeconomic unit, depending on the outside world for a market for its wool  and to supply certain material items not produced or made at home. However, over the last quarter-century, El Cerrito had suffered severely due to loss of a large portion of the land which supported it. Loss of local resources failed to disturb the village or its people while outside employment offered a substantial wage. It was only after this resource also gave way that continued existence of the old way of life was threatened. Its preference for cultural isolation and its lack of technological knowledge did not allow El Cerrito to meet the competition of other producing areas. (NQ)",

Linking education to overall development objectives requires new thinking to incorporate: (1) a curriculum that grows from the community; (2) &quot;classrooms&quot; at any point where learning takes place' (3) schools that are integrated into the community; (4) highly flexible educators who can respond to the immediate needs of the community; (5) respect for and inclusion of the &quot;noneducated&quot;; (6) heavy emphasis on skill implementation and follow-up procedures. This workshop will be  working with the concept of the &quot;community practicum&quot; which embodies the following: (1) a practical and community orientation emphasizing application via total community availability; (2) participation by both trainees and trainers; (3) response to expressed community needs; (4) utilization of existing skills and resources in an effort to promote self-employment and increased levels of income; (5) practical skills related to local productivity. Questions to be considered at this workshop should focus on how the community practicum concept can be implemented and how to best guard against bureaucratic suffocation. (JC)",

        "description":"The second largest group of minority women in the U.S., Mexican American women share multitudinous histories, vast differences in lifestyles, experiences and realities. A Chicana may have recently arrived from Mexico, or her ancestors may have been in the Southwest since 1520 (or before) or in the Midwest since the 1880's. She may be rural, urban, poor, middle class or Ph.D., a high school dropout, a teacher, or a migrant. She does share some basic, and heterogeneous, roots in the development of Indian and Spanish culture and history. She also shares the history of involvement and participation which has been a way of life for the Chicano community in the U.S. since 1848. Documenting the development of Mexican American women in Mexico and the U.S., this monograph discusses: the  Chicana's historical legacy during Mexico's Pre-Columbian and Colonial Periods, its War for Independence, the 1910 Revolution, and during the United States Colonial Period and history between 1840 and 1960; Chicanas in the U.S. today--their education, employment status, income, health, housing, roles, and attitudes; the Chicana and her family; today's Chicana and her achievements in education, literature and journalism, political activities, and labor; Chicanas in the feminist movement; and the Chicana and the future. Appended are a 119-item bibliography, addresses for 35 Chicana organizations, and various resolutions passed between 1970 and 1975 in 10 Chicana conferences. (NQ)",

With the help of migrant children attending a summer school program, the 16 workshop participants created several Zip Paks, ranging from the reading readiness level through the third level. Each Zip Pak has an accompanying teacher's manual to assist in its use. This teacher's manual is to accompany the Zip Pak for the reading readiness level. It presents: (1) the pak's objectives; (2) behavioral objectives; (3) directions  for administering and scoring the Child's School-Home Environmental Test and the Children's Self-Social Constructs Test, Preschool Form; (4) 15 daily lessons; and (5) 15 picture cards.

Since the speaking vocabulary of these children tends to be normal while their reading and writing vocabulary tends to be low, an attempt was made to reinforce their reading vocabulary, using words already a part of their speaking vocabulary. The Zip Pak's objective is to improve the child's word recognition by at least 10%. Two types of lessons are provided. The first type provides a student's book, in which all lessons are presented. These lessons consist of such activities as flash cares, reinforcement activities, drawing, writing, poem reading, magic word puzzles, and a crossword  puzzle. The second type is located almost entirely in this teacher's manual. These lessons involve following directions, writing about an experience, reading their own sentences, and putting the story in their books. The various parts of these lessons may be used as single lessons or combined to make longer lessons. A word list to be used as pre- and posttest is also included. (NQ)",

Ten institutionally-related propositions were presented by resource person for purposes of general and small group discussions. Derived from the institutional propositions, the following property-related research areas were analyzed: (1) the land market; (2) parcelization through easements; (3) farm corporations; (4) population distribution patterns (suburbanization) caused by local parcelization of government; (5) change from production to market domination; (6) the effect of the  welfare state on the need for an individual estate; (7) the quality of resources available (fixed vs infinite). The analytical approaches to property research (also presented by a resource person) included: (1) the property rights approach (definition of incentive structure, behavioral assumptions, and conclusions); (2) research models (incentives framework development, model development specifying interactions, variable starting values, behavioral assumptions, model run, and results); (3) hypothesis testing (hypothesis validity).

The variables employed in data analysis were: (1) socioeconomic status, (2) occupational aspirations, (3) occupational expectations, (4) educational aspirations, (5) educational expectations, (6) success values index. Findings indicated: (1) there was a common value system relative to success which was operative  across class lines; (2) lower class youth who valued success highly were more likely to exhibit lower-status expectations than their higher class counterparts but were not likely to exhibit corresponding differences in their aspirations. It was concluded that aspirations appear less indicative of an individual's value hierarchy because selection may come from other than &quot;available&quot; ends of action, while expectations denote a desired level of attainment realistically pursued. The data were collected in a study of nonmetropolitan youth from Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas. (JC)",

Strategy employed to avoid community resistance involved: (1) an intensive literature review; (2) use of a stratified cluster sample to permit a representative sample at a minimum cost and eliminate the possibility of creating the impression  that only certain residents were chosen; (3) development of a non-threatening title for the study via elimination of words such as &quot;poor&quot;, &quot;black people&quot;, etc.; (4) preliminary visits to local officials explaining the research project; (5) a pretest to determine whether local or outside interviewers were better received (results indicated outsiders were more successful, but tensions prevented whites from applying).

        "description":"At the request of the Alaska Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Alaska State Office of Alcoholism, the Alcoholism Rehabilitation Center at Fairbanks which serves Alaska Natives was evaluated in 1971. A three-member evaluation team evaluated the center's: (1) administrative structure and organization, (2) treatment program, and (3) relationship with the community and other social service agencies. Based on personal interviews held during two, week-long site visits, the evaluation team's recommendations were: (1) separation of facilities for rehabilitation feasible and rehabilitation nonfeasible alcoholics, (2) alteration of the treatment program to include careful client screening prior to feasible or nonfeasible assignment, (3) coordination of agency involvement under a broad  policy-making council which would include various agency representatives, (4) formalization of the treatment program and facility remodeling to accommodate a more formalized atmosphere; (5) full time commitment by an actively involved director, (6) reduction in staff size, (7) development of an inservice training program for staff development, (8) development and utilization of a more simplified accounting system, (9) development of a financial statement indicative of individual client costs, (10) development of a one-fee system which could be broken down into service categories, (11) implementation of the quarterly report to aid funding agencies.

Respondents (N=558) represented Anchorage, Fairbanks, Southeast Alaska, Bethel, and Nome; ranged in age from 10 to 21 years (mean average age was 17.1); came from large families; and included 294 males and 261 females. Survey results indicated: (1) school facilities, teachers, and courses were generally satisfactory; (2) there was a preference for attending school in Alaska (40% attended school outside Alaska); (3) there was some evidence of  teacher discrimination (55% of the sample wanted more Native teachers; 36% did not care; and 8% responded negatively); (4) 91% of the sample wanted more Native culture and history in the curriculum; (5) there was evidence of intragroup conflict among American Indians, Aleuts, and Eskimos (85% felt such conflict caused problems); (6) language arts, social studies, and work experience courses were the most important subject areas; (7) future plans included finishing high school (3.2% did not intend to finish; 28% planned to go to college; 12% planned to attend a vocational school; 20% planned to get a job after high school; and 30% had no definite plans).

        "description":"When it commenced operation in 1971, the Nacimiento Copper Mine provided 135 new jobs. This was about half of the 278 new permanent jobs created in Cuba, New Mexico, from 1970 to 1974. Concurrent and independent development of the Checkerboard Health Clinic and expansion of the school system accounted for most of the remaining new employment. Population of Cuba and the immediate surrounding area increased some 55 percent from 819 to about 1,270. Average personal income increased substantially over the period. Gross business receipts increased from an average of $125,000 per month in 1969-70 to more than $300,000 per month since 1971. A few new businesses were established and many were expanded or improved their appearance with new facades. Most community services handled the  increased population with minimum strain. Exceptions were the water and sewage systems. Municipal revenues increased rapidly enough to allow the city to operate in the black every year. Municipal officials, school administrators, mine officials, businessmen, ranchers, teachers, clergy, students, retirees, civic groups, and others were almost unanimous in their favorable reactions to the Nacimiento Mine operation. Some relatively minor reservations and concerns were expressed. Most Cuba residents favored development on the scale of that since 1970. (Author/NQ)",

        "description":"In view of the recent migration turnaround in the U.S. (1970 to 1974), relevance of size of place of residence was examined. Analysis was based on questionnaire data collected from 1973 Arizona household heads (N=2,410). Incorporated in the questionnaire, the following categorical variables were analyzed: (1) size of present place of residence (categories included: large metropolitan; medium metropolitan; small metropolitan; semi-urban; and rural); (2) size of preferred place of residence (same categories); and (3) level of satisfaction with present place of residence (4 levels). Analysis utilized the Goodman multivariate contingency table analysis procedure. A parsimonious model depicting how the three variables were related was not found, for the variables interacted with one  another. Further analysis of the three-way contingency table produced findings which indicated that size of place of residence was important, particularly when dissatisfaction with present place of residence was high. It was found that over half of the respondents preferred places smaller than their present place of residence and that 14% prefrred smaller places of residence and were also dissatisfied with their present place of residence. It was argued that in addition to preference, satisfaction with place of residence would impact on migration behavior. (Author/JC)",

        "description":"The purpose of this monograph is to examine changing perspectives of rural development in an effort to better understand change in rural social systems via analyzation of interactions between social systems in general and between the U.S. and Asian countries in particular. Initially, an analytic framework is presented which describes intersystem interactions in terms of: (1) Professional Intersystem Interaction (interaction operative at the human, administrative, and political levels and taking place in some kind of inter-system diplomatic milieu); (2) Thrid Culture Enclaves (an international elite operating outside the constraints of recognized social systems); (3) The Superiority Syndrome (paternalism). Presenting a definition of rural development, the second section suggests:  (1) use of indicators (comparative measurements) and descriptors (environmental illustrations) in social system analysis; (2) a development cycle for analyzing social systems in terms of their components, the linkages between these components, and the milieu in which they operate; (3) the interaction between rural development stimulation and acquisition systems. Employing the analytic framework, the third section analyzes 6 time periods in the U.S./Asia involvement. The final section suggests social systems adopt the doctrine of interactive reciprocity to facilitate rural renaissance (change born from within). (JC)",

        "author":["Hanks, Gary Arlin"],
        "description":"Characteristics and attitudes of Alaska Native high school dropouts were studied in an attempt to answer questions relative to: (1) parental influence; (2) dropout dependency; (3) parental dependency and its effect upon dropout students; (4) dependency as a major reason for dropping out. Data were synthesized from several studies concerned with comparisons of Alaska Native dropouts and persistors during the period 1968-71. Conclusions were: (1) a major portion of the Native students may dropout because of dependency upon parents (students: felt that being needed at home contributed to dropping out; felt being a Native held them back; were homesick; showed a greater need for help than persistors; felt whatever they did had little effect; had a low self-image; needed support; were  nonagressive; had permissive parents); (2) the Native Alaskan may be struggling for independence of parental control (dropouts: married earlier than graduates; suppressed emotions toward parents; did not persist at school as long as non-Natives; were more often male; did not admit to family problems; recognized school difficulties early; had more siblings who had also dropped out; resented authority); (3) the reason Alaska Natives dropout may be due more to dependency than dislike for school (dropouts: valued education; lacked occupations and direction while in school; were interested in school; expressed need for more social relationships and structure).

The intrastate programs primarily served migratory children whose home-base was South Carolina during the regular school year. During the summer, the interstate programs served children primarily from other states. During fiscal year 1974-75, 1,656 interstate and 94 intrastate migrant children were served. Two centers, serving both intrastate and interstate children, operated during the regular school year in Allendale and Dillon Counties, providing primarily tutorial services in the basic skills. During the summer, 14 education centers for migratory children, located in 10 school districts, served 1,421 migrant students. These students,  ages 3-21, were from 21 home-base states. Approximately 75 percent of the students enrolled in the interstate programs were of Spanish American descent. This evaluation report presents data prepared by utilizing data from the Migrant Student Record Transfer System and data submitted by the migrant centers, and by monitoring reports by the South Carolina Department of Education personnel. Topics covered are: exemplary projects, teacher/pupil ratio, coordination with other programs, inservice training, dissemination, community involvement, interstate cooperation, and supportive services.

Information is given by migratory status, ethnic group, earning, and region. Data were obtained from the annual Hired Farm Working Force Survey conducted for the Economic Research Service by the Bureau of the Census as a supplementary part of its regular Current Population Survey made in December 1973. In 1973, there were 169,000 farm wageworkers eligible for the CETA program. These workers, representing 6 percent of the total 2.7 million farm wageworkers, resided in 122,000 households (1.4 farmworkers per  household). Farmworkers had 191,000 persons under 18 years of age in their households (1.6 per household) also eligible for the program. Approximately 14,000 eligible farmworkers lived in migratory households and 155,000 lived in nonmigratory households. Forty-seven percent of the eligible farmworkers were white, 17 percent Spanish American, and 36 percent black and other. Eighty-nine percent of the eligible farmworkers lived in households where the combined annual earnings of members were less than $5,000. Most of these were located in the South--109,000 or 72 percent. (Author/NQ)",

        "description":"Since today's education is strictly white middle class with little diversion to other ethnic cultures, the Mexican American student finds that it is not relevant to his being or his present day situation. Compounding the problem is that the Mexican American has to deal with the existence of two cultures--one of his parents which he maintains at home and in all his social encounters, and his own, the American one, which he has to learn in order to keep up with the school system. According to Dr. George I. Sanchez, \"there is a lack of motivation which originates in the schools 'where the child, in the process of gaining an education, internalizes attitudes of inferiority, futility, and frustration'.\" Robert Theobald sees today's education as a training experience instead of an  educated one. He says education is \"the process of providing each individual with the capacity to develop his potential to the full\". The education process must then involve students in decision making, in choosing what type of learning experience they will become involved with. However, the Mexican American will not be able to enter the world designed by Theobald until educational systems recognize the problem and work to help them meet the future. Educational systems have to meet them halfway in humanistic terms, culturally aware of what the Mexican American can contribute to the society. (NQ)",

Seventeen clinics offered year-round general medical services, and in 12 counties free medical and dental care was available to farm worker families under fee-for-service project arrangements. The 26 California migrant health projects also offered nursing clinics, public health nursing, aide and environmental health services, maternity service clinics, and health education. Of the $1.2 million from the U.S. Public Health Service, nearly $1 million directly supported medical and environmental services. The State provided another $100,000 for local project activities,  and the counties subsidized about 50 percent of the services to migrants within their areas as a local contribution. Nearly 100,000 men, women, and children received medical care under the program during its 10 years of operation. Some 132 dedicated professional and paraprofessional health workers staffed the 26 projects. This report discusses the conditions which made the program necessary, the families who received its services, and the daily routine of the nurses, aides, sanitarians, and doctors. The 26 projects, their sponsor, location, services and operation seasons are listed. (NQ)",

Among the major issues presented in the text are: (1) elements involved in the land planning process (goal vs. limitations); (2) the need for cooperative community planning and the means by which compromise can be affected for the following land needs: private and public buildings, open space recreation, resource exploitation, scenic and historic settings, and community revenues;  (3) the special environmental, governmental, and economic problems of Alaskan land use (permafrost, a poor water supply, flooding, waste disposal, and air pollution when coupled with high labor and equipment costs and governmental problems of land ownership and planning authority make Alaskan problems unique); (4) the influence of the Settlement Act on community planning (village land bases must be joined with others to maintain subsistence; Native capital needs seed money which may subvert Native control; and Native goals are divided between maintaining and selling resources).

While this particular booklet does not include vocabulary or questions, others in the series present both which are relevant to this article and are designed for an advanced secondary or adult level of education. The alternatives for future land use planning which are presented in this article include: (1) planning which will accomodate inevitable interrelationship between the functional aspects of land management (watershed, fish and game, natural resource, and  recreational management); (2) creation of a single central agency to control all Federal land managment and regional planning efforts (to result in policy, planning, and budget coordination at the five-year, prior-year, and present year level); (4) increased responsibility for the Federal-State Land Use Planning Commission established under the Settlement Act; (5) utilization of the State of Alaska as the base for cooperative management so that Federal agencies would be partially responsible to State and borough planning powers.

Criteria for selection of the groups were: they entered first grade in the fall of 1969, had been in the same school for three consecutive years, and were approximately the same age. Instruments used were the &quot;Harper and Row Pre-Reading Test of Scholastic Ability to Determine Reading Readiness&quot; and the &quot;Metropolitan Achievement Test, Primary Battery, Form F&quot;. Data were recorded for a three-year period, 1969 to 1972. First grade test scores were used as the dependent variable and the third grade test was used as the independent variable in the analysis  of covariance. Findings revealed that at both the first and third grades, the kindergarten group placed above the non-kindergarten group in differences in means. The kindergarten group was primed for first grade, showing a higher mean on the first grade test than the non-kindergarten group. A higher mean on the third grade test was revealed for the kindergarten group. However, there was no significant difference at the 0.05 level of significance between the two groups. (NQ)",

Divided into two sections, the first section of this report describes seven land-use planning techniques (comprehensive planning, zoning, subdivision, capital programming, the official map, codes, and private restrictions) and includes abstracts of New Jersey policy and legislation  associated with each. The second section presents results of the New Jersey Municipal Planning Control Survey--a survey designed to determine how many New Jersey municipalities have adopted five selected planning controls (planning boards, master plans, zoning ordinances, subdivision ordinances, and building codes). Presented in tabular form, the survey results indicate that of the 567 New Jersey municipalities: 69.8 percent have master plans; 94.2 percent have planning boards; 95.4 percent have zoning ordinances; 82.5 percent have subdivision ordinances; and 97.2 percent have building codes.

The first year was of an exploratory nature aimed at elucidating the various forms that adoption and rejection of innovations could take, the characteristics which were likely to distinguish teachers who adopted innovations from those who did not, and communication aspects which might have influenced diffusion and adoption. The next phase covering the second year dealt with data collection mainly by means of postal questionnaires. A third phase involved the analysis of data with emphasis on comparisons of samples of adopting and non-adopting teachers and qualitative analyses of  communication activities. A complete report of the results, including data tables and findings, is presented. (Author/CP)",

Food processing firms were requested to respond to a questionnaire which asked for examples of their use of various operations research tools and information on the number of operations research people employed by them. Replies came only from large firms--with sales volume above $300 million annually. Another questionnaire, addressed to Directors of Industrial Engineering in food related companies, yielded responses from businesses with annual sales ranging from $85 million to $2.4 billion. Results of the questionnaire show a variety of approaches are being utilized in attacking the problems associated with food costs and  availability. Although most of the work cited has been done by large businesses, the basic principles and techniques of methods improvement, work simplification, cost reduction and logical methods of problem analysis and development of solutions are applicable to small businesses as well.

The responsibility of the utility is to provide a high quality of service at a reasonable cost to the consumer. The paper concludes with an examination of the employment patterns of Commonwealth Edison and discusses the traits and qualities  young prospective engineers seeking employment with a utility should possess.

The approach consisted of examining four aspects oF technological transfer and impact: the colonial background, agents of change, process of change, and case studies. The author believes these kinds of studies are particularly relevant to the liberal education of engineering students. Central to all such courses is analysis of the engineer's role in the process of social change and development and examination of ways in which engineering impacts on the social values and institutions of society. The diversity, political factors, economic factors, and psycho-social factors of the developing countries are studied. A course outline is  included. (LS)",

Where analysis of defects and failures was once of interest to the enlightened company, it could well become a necessity for survival of all in the future. The materials engineer is likely to find many opportunities for displaying his prowess in this field. A course in Analysis of Defects and Failures was started in the fall of 1970 for senior mechanical engineering students at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (Massachusetts). Students helped prepare the course outline, which is included. The course presents unique opportunities for drawing together all of a student engineer's talents and training. A separate course in microstructure analysis has been developed  and is recommended as background for the one in \"defects.\" Students are given a list of the course objectives.

It was readily apparent that students could not be left to their own devices without being seriously impaired by taking unsatisfactory packages of electives. A pilot program was established by the Civil Engineering Department, with the assistance of the Office of Curriculum Guidance, to establish faculty mentors for all civil engineering students from upper freshmen to upper seniors. A primary objective of this program was to help improve the retention of  engineering students. Faculty members were charged with the task of aiding the students in the task of selecting a program for successive terms which would lead to the successful completion of a Bachelor of Engineering program. He explains to the student the procedure for electing liberal arts electives, the restraints on the scope of the student's alternatives and the selection of the alternative civil engineering elective packages.

A model two-year Associate Degree was planned and courses specific to the teaching performance of the driving school instructor were developed and lesson material written. Individual courses with driver-trainer content attracted inservice driving school employees. There was  little response to the two-year program from full-time preemployment students. A shorter &quot;certificate&quot; program was recommended for the occupation of commercial driving school instructor.

        "description":"The methodology and design implemented for the Continuing Education/Community Service Projects of the Gerontology Center at Pennsylvania State University was the first attempt to train a diverse body of service providers in aging. Identification of the population for training was a matter of exclusion rather than inclusion, with the direct service provider within the community setting as the prime target group. The implied exclusion of service providers from the institutionalized setting allowed for focused discussions on community and familial responses to aging persons rather than on institutionalized ones. Based on the assumptions gleaned from project objectives and from the limitations of short-term training with the described audience, the development of an evaluation scheme  was oriented toward providing useful information for program planning and determination of increased transferability of the information provided at the sessions to field experience. The evaluation of the Social Gerontology Project workshops included gathering information from participants at three points: just prior to every session; immediately following the session they attended; and approximately six weeks after sessions had been completed. A majority of participants reported being able to use workshop information in their daily work. Appendixes include: county participation rates, session topics, and registration and evaluation forms.

The process of program planning, the second topic discussed, is illustrated by Houle's model, showing the various decision points in the design of an educational activity. The author then focuses on resources for curriculum development. The use of resources can alleviate some problems posed by lack of direct participation by adult learners in designing content-centered learning activities: human resources include advisory groups, composed of both labor and  management representatives, to provide curriculum design input; material resources include books (some useful titles are cited) and data bases. The Educational Resources Information Clearinghouse (ERIC) data base is discussed in some detail and other data bases are cited as sources for curriculum development. Searches of data bases give access to the names of individuals, institutions, agencies, and other organizations creating curriculum materials. The paper concludes with an explanation of how to utilize the ERIC Clearinghouse in Career Education (ERIC/CICE). (AJ)",

        "description":"A road safety study was conducted by the University of Salford, Great Britain, in order to evaluate the effects of secondary level driver education in reducing the occurrence of accidents. It examines the feasibility of using accidents and traffic offenses as criteria for evaluating courses in driver education. To achieve this objective, 1,800 boys and girls between 16 and 17 years old were recruited and divided into control and experimental groups. The participants were observed over a period of three years on various factors related to driving accidents. The relationship of various factors to driver education is examined based on their effects on accidents and traffic offenses. Driving experience and exposure to risk are important variables in determining the relationship  between driver education and accident frequencies. Involvement in accidents by boys and girls were analyzed based on forms of training, driving experience, and interaction with the car. The results of the study reveal that driver education reduced traffic offenses in the short term and was replaced by experience in the long term. It also showed that the cognitive factor is important in determining accident reduction. The discussion is supplemented with extensive tables and charts. A list of references is included. (EC)",

Major sections deal with instructional materials development and pilot testing. The program was planned in two levels: MP (model program, with full parental participation including meetings with instructors) and MO (materials only program). Due to limited response from parents in an inner city school, the MP was implemented only in an affluent suburban school. The MO program was implemented in the suburban school and in both an inner city and a middle class urban school. Two problems in the study were: low percentage of parents willing to participate and no statistical results showing differences in knowledge or performance for students whose  parents did participate. Both programs found the instructional materials useful and easy to understand. A comparison of MP, MO, and control subjects on tests of driving knowledge and on-road performance was planned but inadequate samples precluded meaningful analysis of the data. Appended material (199 pages) includes: summaries of other similar programs, a review of State regulations and statutes, parent handbook, instructional cards, implementation guide for instructors, and the driving knowledge test. There is also a 15-item reference list. (Author/MS)",

The contract outlines future inmate performance in the areas of skill training, education, institutional behavior, treatment, and work assignment or employment. It also establishes a definite parole date contingent upon successful completion of the contract terms by the inmate. The concept relies on the philosophical base that the Paroling Authority can relate positive performance in these goal areas as an indication of parole readiness. The manual is intended to provide a practical guide to correctional agencies contemplating using the MAP process. The over-all MAP process is described in detail from  orientation, through contract negotiation, and up to parole follow-up. Descriptions of role changes in Parole Boards, Correctins, and inmates are contained as well as the role of the MAP Coordinator. The manual also provides a description of educational voucher services for MAP inmates.

        "description":"Collected in the document are eight presentations which were made before a national invitational conference of Chief State School officers at Pinehurst, North Carolina, in April, 1974, taken directly from tapes of the conference. In his introduction, &quot;The Quest for Unity and Understanding,&quot; John K. Coster enumerates conference goals: (1) to achieve fuller understanding of the great issues which confront vocational education; (2) to examine the system of education's goals, curriculum, personnel, and personnel development delivery system in light of the system's mission; and (3) to ask questions from which an indigenous philosophy of American education will eventually emerge. The speakers and the titles of their presentations are: Sidney P. Marland, &quot;The Problem&quot;; Albert Quie,&quot;Governance, Legislation, and Budget&quot;; Eugene B. Sydnor, Jr., &quot;National Exceptations&quot;; Willard Wirtz, &quot;Alternatives for Action&quot;; Terry Sanford, &quot;Leadership for Education&quot;; and John R. Ottina, &quot;Implementation Steps: Where Do the Chiefs Go From Here?&quot; A summary of the conference by John K. Coster concludes the document. Coster cites four points of concern emerging from the conference: a re-examination of American educational philosophy, and concerns for legislation, for bringing vocational education into the system's mainstream, and for developing State and Federal governments' partnership. Participant lists are appended. (Author/AJ)",

The administrative summary outlines the project's methodology for evaluating police diversion. The project assessed police arrest discretion based on an evaluation of current literature and interviews with random samples of police officers in selected departments. The collected literature was reviewed for internal validity, study strengths and weaknesses, internal consistency, external validity, and police relevance. The interviews revealed a degree  of inaccuracy found in police diversion literature. Some policy implications derived from the study are listed. The police training script consists of three segments, providing situations which illustrate police arrest diversion techniques. The segments are titled: (1) adult vagrant, (2) stolen car, and (3) warehouse burglary. The scripts are provided in two forms. One is a completely written script which officers may read or memorize for presentation. The other is a detailed outline for spontaneous improvisation. (EC)",

Data sources were the Iowa Department of Health, United States government documents, the Iowa Department of Public Instruction, and others. The compiled data pertinent to each  area's K-12 enrollment patterns were discussed with area administrators. Additional data were collected from students in each area school in the arts and sciences and in vocational-technical education. The report reflects a synthesis compiled in September 1973 and revised in February 1975. Collection instruments and bibliography are appended. (Author/MF)",

Placement standards can be developed for each individual labor area using statistical techniques to represent the effects of these constraints, and a comparison of actual performance with the standard used for evaluation and budgeting.  For input standards, 13 functional activities were defined. Time ladders and questionnaires were developed for use with secondary data sources in a sample of labor areas to establish initial input standards. These standards would be based on the patterns of resource utilization, service, and quality characteristic of high-performing areas within each type of labor area.

Classrooms which vary in architectural settings, grouping procedures and pedagogical techniques are seen to place differential constraints on student interaction and to produce different patterns of relations. A number of hypotheses are tested in cross-sectional data from 51 classroom groups and longitudinal data from 9 groups. The results show that a more uniform distribution of choices with fewer isolates and sociometric leaders is found in the open classroom. Asymmetric dyads and intransitive triads occur less frequently and are less stable in the open setting. No clear differences in patterns of mutuality or group cohesion are detected in the two kinds of classrooms.  (Author)",

Because marriage is an interactional system and leisure activities vary in their interactional requirements, a theory is proposed linking leisure activity patterns to marital interaction. The hypotheses generated by the theory were tested on a random sample of 223 husbands and 228 wives. The results indicate that interaction in leisure activities is related to interaction in marriage but that this relationship varies over the marital career. Also, it was found that the hypothesized relationship was greater when openness of communication was used as the marital interaction indicator compared to  household task sharing. The theory is then reformulated in light of the data analysis. (Author)",

Data from a National longitudinal survey of young women are used to examine changes in expectations for lifetime births from 1971 to 1973. These young women decreased their birth expectations substantially over this two-year period from an average of 2.7 to 2.4 births per woman. The relationship of changes in birth expectations to social and demographic characteristics of the woman were explored. The analysis of these longitudinal data showed that expected family size fell dramatically for all women regardless of age, marital status, educational levels, race, age at marriage, current family size, or labor force status.  Attitudes toward women's role and family financial status as measured in this research had no significantly systematic impact on young women's family size expectations. Concern for population growth did show a substantial effect on reducing expected family size. The evidence in this paper suggests that a strong consensus has developed that families in the United States should be limited to two children. (Author)",

Eighty undergraduates subjects, 40 male and 40 female, were interviewed for 10 minutes by either a male or a female experimenter who orally administered a specifically designed Attitude Towards Homosexuality Scale. In the treatment condition, the experimenter wore a \"gay and proud\" button and was introduced as working for the Association of Gay Psychologists; in the control condition the same experimenter wore no button and was introduced as a graduate student working on a thesis. A 2x2x2 completely randomized design was used with button-no button, sex of experimenter, and sex of subject as the three factors. An analysis of variance indicated  significantly greater social distance when the experimenter was perceived to be homosexual in orientation. A significant three-factor interaction effect was also found (p<.001). The greater distance result was almost entirely a function of same sex pairings rather than different sex pairings of experimenter and subject. Male subjects reacted with greater social distance in interaction with a male experimenter perceived to be homosexual than did female subjects in interaction with a female experimenter perceived to be homosexual. Results are discussed in terms of Weinberg's theory of homophobia. (Author)",

The differences in findings and hypotheses can be interpreted by either the theory of role strain or the theory of role accumulation. The purpose of this investigation is to determine which of these theories best approximates the influence of the working status of the wife on marital companionship roles. The data were collected by means of a stratified area probability sample of upper-middle class intact households in a Southeastern city in 1973. There were 233 wives included in the investigation. The work patterns were divided into household, professional-managerial, and clerical as well as part-time and full-time.  Leisure participation rates were determined by the proportion of time spent in individual, parallel, and joint activities with the spouse and with others. The results support the role accumulation theory at lower levels of role expansion. Marital compansionship is generally higher among the employed wives when children are not present in the home. Support for role strain theory emerges at increasing levels of role accumulation, most notably when children enter the home. (Author)",

        "description":"Questionnaires were sent to 56 senior colleges, universities and junior colleges, both public and private, in the state of Georgia, seeking to answer the following questions: (1) What are the general characteristics of developmental reading programs in Georgia's colleges? (2) In developmental studies programs, what reading skills are emphasized and what instructional techniques are used? (3) What is the general philosophy of the program? (4) How well has developmental studies been accepted by students, other faculty, and college administrators? Answers to these questions are summarized in the report. Some of the conclusions reached were that the reading skills which were heavily emphasized, vocabulary development, comprehension in content areas, silent reading, and study skills,  received similar emphasis in all schools; most institutions indicated they made wide use of supplemental materials, programmed materials, and machine-based materials instead of using the lecture as an instructional method or using machines such as tachistoscopes and pacers; and a majority of the institutions agreed that developmental studies courses are an integral part of the college program.

        "description":"The major purpose of this experiment was to examine the effects of format (bar graphs vs. tables) and organization (by year vs. by brand) on the speed and accuracy of extrapolation and interpolation with multiple, nonlinear trend displays. Fifty-six undergraduates enrolled in the College of Education at the University of Delaware served as the data source. Subjects were assigned randomly to four format groups, varying in trend direction (increasing, decreasing) and acceleration (low, moderate, high). Interpolation was relatively fast and accurate and was unaffected by experimental variables. Extrapolated values were overestimated with decreasing trends and underestimated with increasing trends; this effect was greatest with highly accelerated trends. Response time was lower, but  accuracy unaffected, when data were clustered so that trends were perceptually salient. The format and organization of visual displays of quantitative data should be investigated further, since both seem to play an important role in extrapolation performance. (Author/KS)",

        "description":"This paper reports on an innovative approach to the teaching of reading. The thrust of the approach lies in application of findings from Meeker's research which since 1963 had identified certain clusters of Guilford's Structure of Intellect and intellectual abilities found to be necessary in the process of learning to read. Several programs are cited in which teaching the intellectual abilities to children who could not previously read has produced excellent results. The premise that intellectual abilities are prerequisite to learning to read seems well founded, but learning to read does not appear to be a function of a global mental age maturity but depends on various abilities not all of which children have experienced. It is concluded that when the lack of specific  intellectual skills is causative in reading failure, then those skills can and should be taught using a method which identifies, diagnoses, and remediates intellectual abilities in children who have not learned to read with traditional methods.

Criterion-referenced tests, designed to measure specific goal mastery, can provide valuable information that standardized forms cannot.

Caution must be exercised to ensure that testing reflects the instructional emphases of the school's reading program, and that objectives are written at an appropriate level of specificity. Issues of teacher support, test reliability, and integration of separate skills with sustained reading must also be considered. (KS)",

Four postulates from the theory are tested in relation to student newspaper demands: Play elements are involved in demands made on an ideal student newspaper; a factor, or factors, reflecting the demands of mature newsreaders will emerge through factor analysis of ideal newspaper demands; a factor, or factors, reflecting the demands of pleasure readers will emerge through factor analysis of ideal newspaper demands; and a factor, or factors, reflecting the demands of nonpleasure readers will emerge through factor analysis  of ideal newspaper demands. It was found that if the absence of play among potential newsreaders is positively correlated with nonreadership, then play's primacy as an exploratory construct is supported. Recognition of the utility of play could provide media practitioners with a perspective from which to evaluate demands for entertainment, mature play, moral responsibility, and social utility. The theory deserves further exploration. (RB)",

Seven hundred and eight-one racially and economically mixed respondents from Chicago and Atlanta provided the data source. Telephone interviews attempted to assess viewer opinions of the reality of characters portrayed and racial attitudes assumed, entertainment value of the programming, and presence of a moral lesson. Frequency of viewing, identification with a specific character, and levels of cultural estrangement, powerlessness, and meaninglessness were also assessed. Findings suggest that high frequency viewers of both programs find the programming to be entertaining and revealing of actual behavior of the groups portrayed. These  individuals are inclined to agree with the authoritarian views of the major characters in the two programs, &quot;Fred&quot; and &quot;Archie.&quot; In addition, a high correlation existed between high frequency viewing and viewer self-perception of alienation and estrangement from the outside world. The researchers perceive frequent viewing of these programs to be influential in determining authoritarian attitudes, and suggest further investigation of media effects on social learning. (KS)",

During the drafting stage, the basics are those skills and attitudes necessary to release the students' powers of expression. It is basic that they learn how to start and maintain a flow of words and ideas, how to use various techniques to keep their minds occupied with a topic long enough to produce the quantity of draft necessary to work out their private meanings, and how to make use of their own sources, those inside their own heads. Students must learn how to generate comparisons and analogies, and must analyze the language they use to talk about a topic so that they can make their ideas about the topic orderly and clear. Students must learn how to edit so  that their thoughts are in a clear, organized, and coherent form. After students have learned to draft and edit, they should become concerned with the problems of preservation, of making a public text. In this stage, correctness is basic. The techniques of word-study are suggested as a method for helping students develop these basic skills. (TS)",

The basic elements of social psychologist Albert Bandura's modeling theory are outlined. Then specific derivations from the theory are applied to the problem of television advertising effects. These derivations from Bandura's model include techniques for the analysis of advertising content, investigation of the effects of advertising on attention processes, and surveying preadolescent behavior for changes resulting from television commercials. For each application, new research evidence is presented and interpreted in terms of social learning principles. (Author/RB)",

It is increasingly impossible for schools to function as custodians of their student, given changing social attitudes toward both youth and authority. Therefore, schools must respond to students' needs by curricular revision, for example, in order to cut down on absenteeism. Hazell summarizes New Jersey's school attendance legislation and the court cases bearing on compulsory education, absenteeism, and truancy. He suggests that state law should be updated and clarified to allow for proper enforcement of compulsory attendance. Local school boards should adopt regulations consistent with state attendance laws. Parents should be fully apprised of district and state policy. (DS)",

Three topics are then treated in some detail: participatory planning with unrestricted participation; the use of open and flexible problem definition in a planning  process so that all problems or topics within the school system are open for consideration; and the use of the &quot;collateral organization&quot; strategy as a specific model for planning.

Five of the most central themes and their relevance to recommendations for PIP revisions are discussed. These themes are (1) the motivational issues in replicating a compensatory education project developed outside of the replicating district, (2) the impact of federal funds  on a replication project, (3) the identification of an appropriate context for replicating a project, (4) the timing and scheduling of the replication effort, and (5) the importance of the project director in the replication mechanism.

The framework was first developed on the basis of an extensive review of the literature and then validated and refined on the basis of data collected from over 75 school districts involved in systematic planning efforts. The framework is organized around three categories of variables, including techniques and methodologies, process variables, and local application variables. Basically, the framework attempts to focus  attention on three questions about a planning model: (1) What are the specific techniques and methodologies of the model? (2) How does the model gain legitimacy and effectiveness in the school system? and (3) How is the model adapted and used in the school system? (Author/JG)",

Path analytic techniques are used to answer the first question and two-stage least squares the second.

The analysis is guided by the hypothesis that local resources, social structure, and values can and do have significant supportive and perverse effects on participation in mandated federal programs. Multiple regression analysis relates class structure variables (middle class, coalition of poor, and power elite) with the covariates of poverty rate, family size, and total lunches served. Inflation and, in particular, increased food prices  since 1972 underpin the increasing explanatory power of the class-structure variables. Most important for the benefit of the poor is the fact that participation corresponds more closely with poverty rates in 1974 than in 1972. (Author/IRT)",

The schools are suffering from a confusing array of expectations and a crippling overload of functions. Our present efforts to improve the schools appear to be unproductive because we are almost blindly caught up in a single model of change that stems directly from our Western rational bias. The rational bias of our highly technological culture places purposes before activity in a linear fashion and has produced the research, development, dissemination, and evaluation (RDD&E) model of change that serves rather well when we have a purpose in mind,  when we know what it is we want to do or produce. The responsive view embodied in the League of Cooperating Schools model that involves staff dialogue, making decisions, taking action, and endeavoring to evaluate both the process and its outcomes (DDAE) is conducive to probes, open-ended inquiry, and the kind of exploratory activities designed more for finding a course of action than for reaffirming directions already preceived.

Noted is the training of eight successful classroom teachers and three beginning teachers as SLD teachers. The second program involving the  Virginia Polytechnic Institute, the State University, and the Virginia Appalachia Educational Cooperative is explained to have followed the Roanoke program and to have included graduate courses, technical assistance to school divisions by project personnel, three guest lectures, a film festival on SLD, and a 2-day administrators' workshop. Results of program evaluation are reported to show both training programs to be meeting specified objectives such as increasing services to SLD children.

Two general ways, the &quot;linguistic&quot; and the &quot;non-linguistic,&quot; are distinguished. Linguistic explanations explain the effects of bilingualism on cognition as a direct result of the fact that the bilingual has access to two verbal codes. Non-linguistic explanations account for these effects by reference to factors which are extrinsic to, or by-products of, the fact that the bilingual has access to two verbal codes. For example, the greater amount of social interaction which is presumably involved in learning two languages at an early age has been invoked to explain the bilingual's higher level of concept formation. The validity of Macnamara's (1970) theoretical analysis of bilingualism  and thought is considered in the light of this distinction. (Author)",

Concepts are learned according to simple rules, and the network grows as new concepts are learned. Part II considers the growth and structure of language. The growth of language within the network follows the same rules as the growth of perceptual ability. Labels are attached to some concepts for syntactic transformations to others. Perceptual syntactic relations tend to have syntactic programs as their expression in language. In Part III some problems of bilingualism are considered. The simultaneous growth of two languages presents special problems to an infant. Instead of linking labels and syntactic  programs directly to concepts in the network, the infant's linkages must be conditional on extraneous factors. The bilingual infant should have early difficulty with language, but should eventually derive a richer concept structure than a monolingual. Second language learning is seen as a process of breaking down structures that have stabilized in order to replace them with new and more complex structures. Linguistic relativity is real, but occurs primarily in the more abstract realms of thought, not at the perceptual levels. (Author/CLK)",

The paper acknowledges the deficiencies of the \"phonetic approximation\" and the \"phonemic approximation\" hypotheses in meeting this end, and discusses the shortcomings of Hyman's (1970) generative phonology model. The model presented here is derived from Stampe's (1968, 1969) natural phonology theory, and hypothesizes that incoming foreign segments will be inserted into the lexicon without change unless they are inadmissible underlying segments, in which case they will be analyzed by the native rules until some admissible representation is obtained. If a segment cannot be  analyzed as an admissible form in the native system, it will be represented in the lexicon as it is and eventually will be restructured by the dominant native rules. Within this paradigm, certain English loans in Japanese are examined, and at the same time properties of the system of Japanese phonology which are revealed in the process of borrowing are discussed. Among the areas discussed are: palatalization, vowel insertion, gemination of consonants, and glides. (DB)",

Students learned both inductively and deductively and acquired primarily oral-aural competence, with reading and writing as secondary goals. Not until the late 1950s did the audiolingual method become dominant in the academic world, with tapes, new textbooks and language laboratories and the support of the 1958 National Defense Education Act. FLES (foreign languages in the elementary schools) programs enrolled two million children by 1964. By the late 1960s, the cognitive-code approach to foreign language teaching took over, with the goal of equal competence in oral-aural, writing and reading skills. The number  of workshops and inservice training programs for language teachers increased. The 1970s show a shift toward more humanistic education and individualized instruction, although the need for continual and diligent study, pronunciation instruction and the supportiveness of group learning may dictate against individualized study. Foreign language study has declined sharply in the past several years. To counteract this trend, schools should emulate the relevance of schools like Berlitz; content courses taught in the foreign language, which some colleges offer; and courses that train students for careers that involve foreign languages.

They fail in that they are limited as linguistic models which have consistently overlooked the sociological importance of the distinction between speech communities (the Gemeinschaft model) and language societies (the Gesellschaft model). The family resemblance model with its communicative chains of dialects is offered as a viable model of language and society. This model enables speakers to bridge the disparaties among their linguistic communities. Even this model, however, has a problem in that it is not fully able to explain how linguistic units  function within political structures. The implications of this model are discussed, and suggestions for strengthening it are offered. (Author)",

Being a Vietnam veteran tripled the likelihood of a male's attending college.

The nature of conflict is defined as a struggle over values and claims to scarce status, power, and resources in which the aims of the opponents are to neutralize, injure, or eliminate their rivals. The university administrator who wishes to perform effectively must be cognizant of the potential sources of conflict, identified as communication, structure, and personality and behavioral factors. The three sources are interrelated and conflict situations usually involve elements from all three. Methods for avoiding or resolving conflict are discussed and a model for university management outlined. It delineates five main sub-divisions of  managerial work: statement of the goals; design of an appropriate organizational structure; design of a reward system based on the goal system; use of available technologies to help the unit meet its goals; and building of good interpersonal relationships with subordinates, peers, and superiors. Each of these sub-divisions is examined in detail. It is suggested that mutual commitment to conflict management between faculty and administrators should result in a more centralized decision making process and increased cohesion of the university community.

At the same time, the state is confronted with serious policy issues relating to support of research, public services, and adult education, to falling enrollments in some public institutions, to the probable closure of some private liberal arts colleges and perhaps some public ones, to the continuing oversupply of doctoral graduates, to competition with the collegiate sector of new forms and new institutions offering postsecondary education, and to additional issues relating to finance in a period of high inflation and severe recession. These related situations are discussed, and it is suggested that the lack of direction or focus is causing concern among legislators and governors,  although there is a sense of optimism among college and university presidents. It is concluded that institutional research staffs and policy analysis groups can contribute substantially to the well-being of an institution by aggressively pursuing with state agencies objectives and goals backed by data-based realism and imaginative analysis.

        "description":"The Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE) received a year's grant from the Council on Library Resources to design and develop a library network for the 17 western states. Major activities of the first quarter included: (1) hiring a systems analyst, cost study investigator, research assistant, and secretary, and selecting a project director; (2) setting up the project's administrative organization; (3) reviewing recent automation and networking developments likely to affect the project; and (4) initiating review of potential components for a western network. The concept for a western network was based on &quot;internetting&quot; two developing bibliographic utilities--BALLOTS (Bibliographic Automation of Large Library Operations using a Time-sharing System) and the  Washington Library Network--and three major bibliographic centers offering location information for holdings of western libraries--the Bibliographic Center for Research, the Pacific Northwest Bibliographic Center, and the California State Library Union Catalog--to provide technical processing and interlibrary loan products and services to libraries in the West.

The goals of the project were: (1) to determine representative costs of present library services in the West; (2) to estimate future costs of library services in the West with proposed network support; (3) to evaluate and compare the impact of a network on costs of library services; and (4) to examine equitable programs of financial support for the proposed network. The first quarter of the project was devoted to scheduling, staffing, planning, and research design. Milestones achieved during the quarter included selecting the sample design and making final arrangments for a pretest of the instruments in Idaho. Additionally, all staff necessary to fulfill  project requirements were contracted. The appendixes which form the bulk of this report include a proposed time schedule for the project, data gathering instruments, a preliminary bibliography of costing literature, and a financial statement.

The aim of the course was to help students to use various logical tools in the analysis of everyday arguments by giving drill-and-practice sessions, testing, and grading examinations. Part of ENIGMA is the propositional argument program which is able to abstract the relevant syntactical form from the student's natural language response and check the response for logical mistakes, gross spelling errors, and violations of propositional integrity. This program can be used in a test as well as a tutorial format. A program for categorical syllogisms has a feature offering the capability of using Venn diagrams to determine validity. The programing language  for ENIGMA is Coursewriter II; it is timeshared on an IBM 370/158. It is expected that by spring of 1976 approximately 1,000 students per quarter will use the program. (JY)",

The first system would be most appropriate for business-to-business deliveries, but the most lucrative portion of this market will probably be captured by independent competitors. The second system requires a massive capital investment, and it would probably still require hand-carried deliveries, the most expensive component of mail handling. If customers are willing to accept electronic output,  impressive economies of scale can be obtained through the use of electronic systems. (EMH)",

Three-year old children gained the most from watching the program, and disadvantaged children who watched a great deal surpassed middle-class children who  watched only a little.

The show's educational goals have changed from teaching numbers, letters, geometric forms, relationships, classification, reasoning and problem solving to include affective goals which relate to helping a child to learn to cope with failure and obstacles and to participate in social groups. The production has moved from its original rather frenetic pace to one which is softer and gentler in tone and more relaxing in effect. Research has been and continues to  be an integral part of the planning process at CTW, concentrating in recent years on the specific needs of bilingual and bicultural children. The audience that Sesame Street attracted in the U.S. lead to other versions of the show for Latin America, Germany, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. A number of studies has confirmed the show's ability to teach and to attract large audiences composed both children and adult. (JY)",

        "description":"With the pervasiveness of television, especially for children, visual literacy is a growing concern. Television should be regarded as part of a potential solution to the country's need for improved education. &quot;Sesame Street&quot; has proved that children do learn from television, that active interaction is not always necessary for learning, and that children have developed different expectations about learning. Children's acquisition of the basic cognitive operations may be changing due to television, particularly when animation is used. &quot;The Electric Company's&quot; method of teaching reading, for instance, uses animated cartoons to show the connection between the written and spoken word, a concept not so easily explained in the classroom. Abstractions may also be communicated without the  use of language. Given the influence of television, certain issues need first consideration: a reevaluation of cognitive growth in young children; an analysis of the nature of visual literacy acquired from television; and an examination of exactly how television communicates, influences, and causes change, and what its long-term effects are likely to be.

Brief videotapes, 15-20 minutes long, will be made from material taken primarily from Sesame Street. They will vary in the explicitness of the prosocial behavior message. Baseline data will be gathered for each child which measures stage of cognitive development, their level of positive social behavior, level of cooperative behavior, and previous exposure to Sesame Street. Before and after viewing the videotapes each child will be observed in the school setting.

Eye movements, for instance, are markedly responsive to differences in presentation, especially to such factors as the placement on the screen and the amount of animation used. The effectiveness of production variables depends on visual processing, and the processing style is, in turn, both the modifier of and modified by cognitive structure. Research using the children's program &quot;The Electric Company&quot; has shown that certain cueing techniques are powerful determinants of &quot;looking&quot; behavior. Future research will probably focus on the production techniques  which most effectively modify the viewer's attention. (EMH)",

The Bedford Stuyvesant study was designed to establish a reliable reading on the penetration of Sesame Street in low income areas and to determine whether or not the program was achieving its prime objective of servicing preschool, ghetto children. The results left no question that Sesame Street had achieved this goal. The East Harlem study, based on a smaller sample, was undertaken to see to what extent the program was equally successful with Puerto Rican children. Penetration of Sesame Street in East Harlem was 78%, compared to 91% in Bedford Stuyvesant. In both New York communities, penetration and a high  level of daily viewing were aided by the availability of the program on more than one channel and numerous daily showings. In Washington, D.C.,the results further testified to the extraordinary performance of Sesame Street but also indicated how viewing is limited when the program is available only on one UHF channel.

The program's success was demonstrated by continued growth in audience, high frequency of viewing, and recognition of the program's contribution by ghetto mothers.

It was possible to compare programs as a whole and to see how individual film segments fared when viewed in different program contexts. A high degree of consistency was observed from group to group. The children lost interest when a program spent too long on one subject. Once they were distracted, it took a fairly strong film to get them back. The children responded well to computer animation films. They responded positively to anything that allowed them to recite the alphabet, and tended to keep reciting the alphabet after it was over. Lists of sequences, characters, songs, and films that received  good-to-excellent reactions from the children are included. (PF)",

        "description":"It is a widely accepted fact that community and junior colleges have a special commitment to serve students who in other types of higher educational institutions would be considered high risks because they are less likely than other entrants to complete their chosen programs of study. Professor Moore makes clear that the commitment, though well accepted, is ineffectively accomplished. Whether the community college is really able to define or cure academic deficiencies has not been confirmed with hard, unequivocable evidence. The current popular ideas about what causes low achievement in specific groups of students, such as the belief that the students are culturally disadvantaged, have negative self-concepts, and lack motivation; and the current correctives--remedial instruction  and therapeutic counseling--are often inappropriate and ineffective. As corrections for the problem, Moore recommends an emphasis on community college teacher preparation, institutional reexamination of selection and admissions procedures, increased faculty advising of high risk students, and increased policy flexibility. A bibliography is appended, and a chapter identifying research needs in this field is included. (Author/NHM)",

Pre-existing subgroups such as sex, ethnicity, and curriculum offer an easily identifiable and theoretically meaningful source of moderator variables. Tests for intercept and slope differences in a multiple regression analysis offer a convenient and reliable way to test the significance of these moderator variables. Using this improved statistical methodology, this paper analyzes data on 32 cognitive and non-cognitive variables collected on the Bronx Community College freshman class at the time of their entry in fall 1972. The 32 variables include measures of personality, family background, attitudes, aspirations, and academic  ability. At the end of one year, the 984 sampled students were classified as dropouts or persisters, and the variables were examined to determine their effectiveness as predictors of persistence. The categories of sex, ethnicity, and curriculum were selected to test for their moderating effect. Complete statistical data are included, as are separate tables listing significant predictor variables for the 12 curriculum sub-populations. Definitions of the predictor variables are appended.

Recommendations based on the examination placed students about equally in the three English levels, and the number of students who actually enrolled in English the first year after taking the examination was approximately equal for each level. The significant but rather low correlations of the examination with English grades and GPA in the higher two levels, the  non-significant correlation with grades in the remedial level indicate that the examination is not a good predictor of English grades or of GPA. Also, there was no significant difference between students in the recommended level English class and those in non-recommended classes in passing the course.

A review of the literature indicates that substantial increases in enrollment were experienced in all institutions in 1975, but enrollment over the next three decades will fall short of earlier projections. The regional enrollment picture for New York City Community College (NYCCC) does not parallel the national trend, since headcount enrollment for fall 1975 decreased 3.7 percent from 1974. Eight aspects of the enrollment distribution at NYCCC are examined in this document, including: (1) comparative enrollment summary; (2) matriculation status; (3) division enrollment; (4) program enrollment; (5) program demand; (6) average credits;  (7) credit attrition; (8) geographic origin. The drop in enrollment is thought to be due to the financial crisis in New York City. This report suggests that institutional efforts will need to be directed to the development of new or additional resources for college programs. At the same time, renewed efforts must be made to insure the continued viability of the College and its programs through a meaningful program of evaluation. (Author/NHM)",

Even those who did not complete their programs were frequently employed in occupations related to their  programs. Individuals still in school were generally in educational areas related to the program they began in 1970, and most expected to obtain program-related jobs. Individuals employed in program-related occupations felt they could not have obtained their present jobs without education beyond high school.

        "description":"In order to determine the biographical characteristics of Connecticut community college graduates, to identify their educational and career objectives and experience, and to investigate the attitudes of graduates toward their community college experience, a survey instrument was designed and administered to 2,911 June 1975 graduates in transfer, occupational, or general curricula. In all, 1,405 graduates responded (48 percent). The age distribution and enrollment status of the respondents indicated that the colleges are serving a diversity of students. The graduates' initial reason for enrolling varied from obtaining a degree and transferring, to job retaining. Nearly 10 percent indicated that they had originally planned to take only a few courses of interest, but instead had  remained to complete their degree requirements. About 75 percent were currently employed, most of these were employed full-time, and 60 percent were employed in jobs related to their community college programs. Job satisfaction was rated superior or good by nearly half of the respondents. Half of the respondents indicated that they had transferred to a senior institution. Overall, the graduates had a very favorable attitude toward their community college education. The survey instrument is appended. (Author/NHM)",

The program included two components: a training component (short courses, seminars, speakers bureau) and a resource center (library, publications program). Because of declining use of the program's services, a questionnaire was designed and mailed to 574 schools and other institutions which were identified as potential users of the program's facilities. Of the 105 valid responses, 53 or 50.5 percent had never used any of the available services. Over 60 percent of these were not even aware that the services existed. Of those who had made use of the services, the greatest number had made use of the  speakers bureau. The next most popular services, in decending order, were the film library, the newsletter, publications, the reference library, the referral service, and exhibits. For the most part, users' evaluations of the services were in the very good to good range. On the basis of these findings, recommendations for future operations are made, primarily concentrating on advertisement of the services. (NHM)",

First, the 4,895 students enrolled in the 52 career education programs at Miami-Dade Community College in 1972-73 were carefully screened on the basis of several different criteria to arrive at a survey population of 2,039. A total of 1,312 of these were matched with Department of Commerce employment records and the records of a previous graduate survey to obtain a printout of employer names and addresses, weeks worked, and earnings. To collect program evaluation data, two basic survey instruments were designed and mailed  to former students with predetermined employment address information, and to those without such information. In addition, 915 surveys were mailed to the employers of respondents who had given or implied consent for their employers to be surveyed. In general, respondents to both the student and employer surveys gave favorable ratings to the career programs and to the academic and career preparation given to students at Miami-Dade. Tables of survey data are included, and the methodological limitations of this type of study are discussed. (MHM)",

This document examines various approaches to conducting large-scale faculty surveys, and describes a suggested procedure to mitigate methodological problems. In developing the recommended procedure, six pilot tests were conducted to determine the feasibility of the methodology, the types of letters that should be sent, the person to whom these letters should be addressed, and the anticipated response rate. The pilot tests indicated that the college president is the best initial contact point, and that a high individual response rate could be achieved through the use of an on-campus  facilitator. The procedures for sample selection and questionnaire administration are described, as is the application of the procedure to a nationwide survey of two-year college humanities instructors. The procedure described allows for cross-tabulations among respondents in various types of institutions while maintaining an accurate representation of the universe of institutions. (Author/NHM)",

        "description":"This paper presents a structural-developmental model of social cognition and discusses the implications of this approach for social intervention research. This model of social development is concerned with social reasoning and judgment. The basic assumption of this model of social cognition is that the structure of social reasoning develops through an invariant sequence of 4 stages: (1) the \"egocentric level,\" at which a child assumes that others feel or act as he does in similar situations, (2) the \"subjective level,\" at which a child recognizes that others' thoughts, feelings, and intentions are distinct from his own, (3) the \"self-reflective level,\" in which the child becomes aware that perspectives of self and others exist reciprocally, and (4) the \"third person perspective  level,\" at which a person, in a dyad, is aware of each other's subjectivity. These levels of perspective-taking are considered necessary, but not sufficient for parallel stages of interpersonal reasoning. Examples of this relationship, based on childhood friendship concepts, are provided. A hierarchical model of social cognition as it relates to interpersonal and moral stage theories is developed. Implications for social cognition intervention programs, derived from a study comparing the cognitive development, perspective-taking, and interpersonal and moral reasoning of 24 boys between the ages of 7 and 12 from special classes with that of a matched normal group of boys were discussed.

        "description":"This paper discussed a stage theory of childhood, preadolescent, and adolescent concepts of role-relationships and social reasoning in friendship. It was hypothesized that these concepts develop through levels of perspective-taking, within which individuals view and structure interpersonal relationships. At level one, relationships are based on one person's subjective evaluation of interpersonal acts and on that person's perception of the consequences of others' actions for his own expectations. At level two, relationships are based on situation or context-specific, reciprocal expectations of both parties. At level three, relationships are based on the generality or temporal continuity of mutual expectations of each party across situations or contexts. At level four,  relationships are based on the underlying deeper meaning each party gives to the other's behavior and on the underlying understanding each party has of the complexity of the other's values and beliefs. The horizontal correspondences among perspective-taking level, level of persons conceptions, and level of relations conceptions were examined at levels two and three. A series of open-ended, standardized questions was used to elicit preadolescent, adolescent, and adult solutions to commonplace interpersonal dilemmas. Some of the data from preadolescent subjects were analyzed and related to the proposed stage theory of role-relationship perception. (Author/BRT)",

English mothers' teaching style and reinforcing patterns were observed as they asked their children to perform five cognitive tasks. Questionnaires which measured maternal stress were administered to these mothers. Kuwaiti mothers were asked to teach their children four tasks, and mother-child interactions were observed. Data  were analyzed for material social class differences in: (1) verbal behaviors such as negative statements, imperatives, information-giving statements, and questions; (2) nonverbal behaviors including handling the materials and using physical guidance or restraint; (3) response consistency over the different tasks. In the English sample, the relationship of maternal stress to negative maternal behaviors was also investigated. Performance, as a function of social class, was compared between the English and Kuwaiti children. (BRT)",

Nine pictorial paired-associates and 9 verbal paired-associates were formed from pictures or names of familiar objects. At each age level, 8 male and 8 female subjects were assigned to one of 4 presentation conditions: (1) auditory, (2) visual sequential (subjects were shown the stimulus picture of each pair for 2 seconds followed by the response picture for 2 seconds), (3) visual simultaneous-2 seconds exposure (subjects viewed each stimulus response pair simultaneously for 2 seconds), and (4) visual simultaneous-4 seconds exposure (subjects viewed each stimulus-response pair simultaneously for 4 seconds).  Following presentation subjects were tested individually for recognition in 3 trials. Results showed that the overall performance of 8-year-olds was significantly better than that of 3-year-olds in all conditions; however, the initial performance of the two groups did not differ significantly. The 8-year-olds showed improved performance only on the second and third trials. Only the visual-simultaneous conditions produced a significant difference in the mean number of correct responses when compared with the auditory mode of presentation. It is concluded that the influence of mode of presentation on learning is a complex phenomenon. (BRT)",

        "description":"This longitudinal study investigated mother-infant interaction patterns and infant social and emotional development as influenced by maternal and non-maternal infant care and by selected maternal and infant characteristics. Extensive data (including maternal attitude scores, demographic infomration, infant care observations, developmental test scores, stranger-approach responses, and separation behavior observations) were collected and analyzed for 181 mother-infant pairs at the infant's birth and 8 weeks, 3 months, 8 months, and 12-12 1/2 months later. Results showed that the employment status of the mother and the related use of non-maternal child care did not influence mother-child interaction patterns. The mother's caregiving behavior, attitudes, and role perception were  found to affect infant social-emotional growth. Results of the study also showed some support for the existence in infants of a temperament-like behavioral style. Maternal attitudes reflecting beliefs in exclusive maternal caregiving and characteristics portraying infant-centered, adaptive approaches to child rearing showed considerable stability over the months of study. Interview instruments used in the study are reproduced in their entirety in the appendix. (Author/BRT)",

A total of 91 public schools, regional service centers, and Head Start centers throughout the state responded to the survey. Respondents were asked to indicate the extent to which they used each developmental test. They also delineated their population as: (1) Black, (2) Anglo, (3) Mexican-American (tests administered in English), or (4) Mexican-American (tests administered in Spanish). Results showed that the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, followed by the Stanford-Binet and IPAT Culture-Fair Intelligence Test, were used by the largest number of sites. Of  the tests administered to Mexican-Americans, almost twice as many were given in English as in Spanish. Few schools reported using observation techniques for diagnostic purposes. A number of sites indicated that they adapted or developed tests for individual diagnostic assessment of learning problems. Brief descriptions of 20 tests are provided in a Test Reference List.

        "description":"This paper describes and discusses three studies concerned with the representation of children's knowledge as revealed in the ways that children, ages 5 to 17, perform a scientific induction task. A variant of Piaget's balance scale prediction problem was chosen as the experimental task; a formal model for different levels of children's knowledge about how to do the task was constructed. Experiment I was conducted to assess the validity of this model. Experiment II examined some instructional issues and revealed some limitations of the initial representation. The results indicated that older and younger children who were initially classified by the model as having identical task-specific knowledge, showed a striking difference in responsiveness to instruction. This finding led to  revising the original representation by analyzing the problem-by-problem performance of two children during a training sequence and using this information to formulate a detailed production system model of one child's knowledge. This model was then run as a computer simulation and a comparison of the computer results with the child's performance suggested that the initial encoding of the stimulus may account for the performance differences between older and younger children. Experiment III was conducted to test this encoding hypothesis. Finally, the types and levels of knowledge that might be important in instructional investigation were discussed. (Author/JMB)",

Major components of the ISP model are identified as: scenario negotiation (mutual efforts to determine the purpose of the evaluation, search out program goals and criteria, and identify needed evidence for judgment making); evidence collection (derived from the Context, Inputs, Process, Product Model, emphasizing techniques established via scenario negotiation); judgment (description and  evaluation of what occurred via the group process approach, encompassing both summative and formative evaluation). Specific Title V evaluation is described as involving judgments about the organizational adequacy of the overall Title V delivery system and/or the attainment of individual Title V project goals/objectives in terms of required judgments, criteria, evidence, and evaluation procedures. Providing a systematic framework for answering specific questions and structuring the evaluation process, the ISP model is presented as a guide for future Title V evaluations. (JC)",

Standardized test results show an increase in academic achievement. Other successful outcomes include improvements in communication, program expansion to meet diagnosed individual needs, improvements in pupil self-image and attitudes, and supplementary assistance to students through paraprofessional support. Among the problems listed are student frustration resulting from failure to achieve in a group situation what is successfully  gained in an individualized center; problems in scheduling, especially for grades 7 and 8; and below average mean grades despite general growth. Recommendations include staff orientations to clarify programs and to improve scheduling, a reevaluation of services offered in grades 7 and 8, and selection of new test measures in language arts specifically for grade 1 students, for foreign background students, and for the high school center.

Results indicate a strong relationship between occupational advancement and formal vocational training for both racial groups. Structural factors represented by initial industry and region of residence are found to have little or no effect on advancement. A more important factor is considered to be the white-black  difference in endowment of education. No evidence for a racial differential in the impacts of industry and geographical shifts on occupational mobility is found. No evidence to support the hypothesis that black turnover fails to result in upgrading because of their confinement to secondary sector jobs is indicated. (Author/AM)",

Two specific hypotheses are tested which propose (1) large and systematic racial differentials exist in the effect of mobility on occupational advancement between firms; and (2) differentials in intrafirm occupational advancement exist for workers of equivalent endowments within firms. A model of occupational advancement along with empirical variables from two sources of longitudinal data are discussed. Results indicate that neither the young nor the old men in the sample provide evidence of a systematic racial differential in the effect of mobility between firms on occupational advancement. The evidence on advancement within firms is said to be  less unequivocal. Given the racial differential in initial occupational levels, however, small black-white differences in advancement are shown to appear within internal labor markets. (AM)",

The following topics are included in the analysis: enrollment and retention, demographic characteristics, academic background, major subject area, supportive services, academic progress, student costs and financial aid, and expenditures. Cited among the findings are the following: that academic dismissal is the most important reason for leaving opportunity programs, followed by personal reasons; that given educational and economic disadvantages, educational opportunity program students remain in college at high rates as compared to the average retention rate for all students in the nation; and that opportunity programs serve as a  major vehicle for minority group enrollment. Certain practices concerning degree requirements, financial aid, and definitions for defining economic disadvantage are said to lack consistency across the programs. Stated in the recommendations are the need for comprehensive supportive services and the need for timely and accurate accounting of program activities and expenditures as the law provides.

These components are informal and formal on-the-job inservice training in child development, provision of services such as consumer and legal education, physical exams, nutrition information, and formalized training in child development. Two hypotheses are tested as part of the program evaluation: that the work training experience is beneficial to the trainees, and that the day care children will identify with the youth and benefit from the cross age relationships. Results obtained from interviews with trainees, agency  staff, and children are considered to indicate that the program is beneficial to both youth and children, that the children relate positively to the youth, and that the program expands the life chances of all the participants. Criticisms of the program center around the quality of service provided to the youth. Both staff and youth agreed on the need for increased counseling and the need for followup at the end of the program. (Author/AM)",

It updates indicators for 9 of the 14 categories and employs the indicators to develop charts and tables which use the Washington, D.C. area as a illustrative example. Central cities and suburbs of the 18 metropolitan areas are examined with respect to five of the quality of life categories. There is a tabulation and summary of these five indicators as they reflect conditions for the central cities and suburbs, ratios between city and suburban areas, and rates of change in these factors. Summary charts presenting city and suburban conditions in Washington, D.C. are used as examples. The paper  provides sources and limitations of all indicators used, tabulations of all data presented in the initial report, and rationales for the revision, addition, or deletion of the various indicators.

Program objectives, administration, facilities, instruction, supportive services, and parental involvement are described. The preschool, kindergarten, and primary programs, along with curriculum materials used are described. Data from a comprehensive longitudinal evaluation design indicates that growth in readiness and achievement tends to be uniform across classrooms, grades, and centers. The data are considered to  show that this program operates in a manner that uniformly raises the readiness and achievement levels of all children. Several components of program success--among them early intervention and the need for consistency--are identified. A brief discussion on ripple effect resulting from the program's impact on the community, and a followup of program graduates, is included. (Author/AM)",

The first paper, Focusing on the School to Work Transition: Problems and Elements to Be Considered in Developing a Work Experience Program (David H. Hampson), introduces a historical/philosophical perspective of work experiences as well as practical considerations for developing work experience programs. The second paper, A Model of Career Guidance (JoAnn Harris-Bowlsbey), focuses on career guidance and presents a model, currently under development, of a computer-based guidance system, DISCOVER. The third paper, Work Experience and Placement Programs (Grant Venn), presents a model for work experience programs, outlines areas of focus at elementary through  postsecondary educational levels, and suggests models for placement programs--one school-based and one community-based. The final paper, Five Easy Pieces of Free Advice on Curriculum Strategies for Career Education from a Relatively Disinterested Curriculist (Decker F. Walker), presents five pieces of advice for curriculum strategy makers involved in developing career education programs. (Author/JR)",

The first paper, the Introduction (David Goodwin), deals with program implementation. The second paper, Priorities in Career Education (Alonzo A. Crim), describes the historical origins of career education in the Atlanta school system with a strong emphasis on the incremental nature of significant educational change. The third paper, Priorities in Career Education R &amp; D: A Federal Perspective (Lois-ellin Datta and Corinne Rieder), discusses the role of research and development and the obligations of researchers to make their results useful for practitioners. The fourth and fifth papers, Organizing for Planning and Implementing Career Education in Ohio (Linda Pfister  Keilholtz), and The Development, Implementation and Administration of Career Education in Florida (Margaret E. Ferqueron), highlight such themes as the role of State leadership, establishing State linkages between State departments and local school districts, and using State funds as a means of building organizational commitment at the local level. The final paper, Educational Linkage--Suggested Rules and Techniques or the Synaptic Aspects of a Partnership Plus Other Common Trivia (Robert A. Sampieri), discusses ways to build working relationships between educators, businessmen, labor unions, and politicians. (Author/JR)",

An advisory committee under the auspices of the National Research Council was established to conduct the assessment. The six laboratories studied were: (1) Colorado State University Experimental Manpower Laboratory, Denver, Colorado (disadvantaged individuals); (2) Experimental Manpower Laboratory for Corrections, Draper Correctional Center, Elmore, Alabama (correctional rehabilitation); (3) University of Michigan Experimental Manpower Laboratory, Ann Arbor, Michigan (disadvantaged individuals); (4) Mobilization for Youth Experimental Manpower Laboratory, New  York, New York (hard-to-employ youths); (5) North Carolina Manpower Development Corporation, Chapel Hill, North Carolina (improving State capabilities for planning/delivery manpower services); and (6) Training and Technology, Oak Ridge, Tennessee (upgrading skills in an industrial setting). The advisory committee found the concept of manpower laboratories valid and useful and has presented recommendations to assist in the planning and organizing of more effective laboratories in the future. Findings and recommendations are categorized according to: (1) planning for laboratory effectiveness, (2) requirements for effective management, and (3) utilization.

Although the report describes unique program features of various States, statistical information is provided only on the 12 States which included their total number of youth participants in the State progress reports--Alabama, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Virginia, and West Virginia. The main approaches to launching programs were through regular 4-H programs and interorganizational involvement. They focus on specific problems or geographic  areas. Ten suggested definitions of program areas include: leadership development; public affairs; taxation and local government; housing; manpower and career development; recreation and tourism; environment and ecology; business, industrial, and economic development; cooperatives and credit unions; and community facilities and institutions. About half of the report consists of various State program examples of: workshops, community planning, citizenship programs, a model city council, job and career programs, county clean-ups, Main Street beautifications, a blood donation campaign, hunter safety program, and a cultural heritage presentation.

The report contains 25 specific recommendations grouped under three broad headings: (1) a positive policy for working life, (2) an integrative policy for education, and (3) more options for the individual within a free-choice society. The experts found the quality of working life not keeping pace with individuals' capacities and  aspirations, and recommended a policy that involves better jobs, more flexible working arrangements, more chance for participation, and more equity in advancement; found too many disadvantaged persons in the labor market, and recommended measures to create greater opportunities for these persons; found unwise separations between education and work, and recommended recurrent education; found too many rigidities imposed on individuals' lives and recommended more options; found inequities in educational opportunities, and recommended comprehensive schools; and found little communication among educational and labor market authorities, and recommended mechanisms for joint consultation.

The reassessment course is offered through the Extension Division of the university, with the campus Learning Assistance Center participating in a supportive role. Course activities include: group sharing, interest/aptitude testing, writing a life diary, role perception, study skills, test interpretation, career opportunities, interviewing and resume information, discussion of opportunities for academic experience, and a concluding personal interview. Several aspects of the program in which the Learning Assistance  Center can be especially helpful to the reentering woman involve time management geared to the student/wife/mother role, tips on note taking and improving verbal skills, and the availability of informally structured support groups. Learning assistance centers can be a valuable component in programs for reentry women by assisting in recovering skills for effective learning. (EA)",

Our nation is on the threshold of an age of scarcity, and the impact on education will be the accelerated demands for educators to justify their use of resources based on impersonal objective criteria. Education's favored past status in the resource allocation process will continue to deteriorate as shrinking funds are allocated to education. However, educators can objectively justify the use of scarce resources by applying economic theory and method. Some standard economic models adaptable to education are: (1) production function (the relationship between input and output), (2) production possibilities model (relationships between  alternative products), (3) economies to scale (relationships between cost and the size of the producing unit), (4) labor to capital ratio (amount of labor relative to capital used in the production process), and (5) multiproduct production (simultaneous production of products by the producing unit). Progress in resource allocation problems is evident in needs assessment programs, accountability studies, criterion-referenced instruction, performance objectives, the Coleman Report, and similar studies. Continued and expanded efforts are necessary to immunize education from \"future shock\". (EA)",

Established by law December 15, 1967 to lower the illiteracy rate in Brazil by improving educational opportunities for the population, it has established four main programs: (1) functional literacy teaching, providing six months of primary education; (2) integrated education, a year-long supplement to primary education; (3) community development, two months of community oriented education; (4) cultural MOBRAL, reaching Brazilians through mobile libraries, radio, correspondence courses, and cultural posts. Background is given on the educational and economic problems of  Brazil and their interrelationship. Literacy teachers, by the end of 1972, had involved one out of every six Brazilians aged 15 or over in MOBRAL activities. Initial success has been attributed to: government interest on the local, State, and national level; technical and financial independence; and the availability of educational materials and teachers. Tables give illiteracy rates in terms of region, age group, and sex. Five appendixes provide texts of the law establishing MOBRAL, regional and municipal agreements, a list of teaching materials used, and a bibliography. (LH)",

Students enrolled in vocational agriculture classes in 19 randomly selected California high schools were the target population; FFA advisors at each school randomly selected two vocational agriculture classes for participation. Data were collected by classroom administered questionnaires from 504 students and by local FFA advisor questionnaires. Five vocational agriculture teachers reviewed the  data analysis, providing interpretation, discussion, and subsequent recommendations. Data showed significant differences in FFA member and nonmember responses on some topics as well as similar responses to a number of topics. No single statement appeared indicative of reasons for low membership percentages. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 provide in-depth coverage of findings, discussion, and recommendations.

Dissatisfaction led to a reorganization in 1974 along geographical divisions for region, area, and district levels, necessitating a managing staff. New organizational problems presented themselves: (1) the need for training management personnel and community physicians and (2) decision-making based on consensus rather than authoritative hierarchical status. The Department of Health entered into agreement with eight educational centers in various parts of England to sponsor four types of training: multiprofessional integration courses for all types of senior staff, courses for  voluntary members of the new health authorities, programs for clinicians to prepare them for management roles, and courses for Medical Officers of Health and their medically qualified staffs in preparation for their role as community physicians. The costs of the residential courses were to be borne by the Department of Health. (The program at the University of Manchester is described in detail.) An evaluation of the program arrived at a positive assessment. (Outcomes of the program are viewed from three perspectives: the National Health Service, the universities, and the government.) (AG)",

Employee turnover received particular research attention in the first category; indexes of employee motivation, organizational commitment, and job satisfaction received particular attention in the second category. Dependent variables considered were job attitudes, turnover and absenteeism, and job performance. The major findings  of the specific studies which comprised the project are presented in the context of these categories, in terms of the variables' relationships. The implications for organizations are: focus on pre-entry expectations of new members, monitor their early organizational experiences, determine where commitment to the organization is most crucial and concentrate attention there, develop suborganization attachment, create jobs with greater scope, discover job dimensionality, and individualize incentives.

Additionally, the relationship between collective bargaining coverage and racial differentials in these dimensions is explored. Sections deal with: gross union-nonunion differences in labor market experience; union-nonunion differences in personal (including educational background) and situational characteristics; net effects of collective bargaining on earnings and labor market  experience; and comparison of racial differences in the union and nonunion sectors. Data on the five dimensions are presented according to major occupation group and race. Two major conclusions are: (1) collective bargaining coverage has considerable net impact on earnings of all workers studied, and (2) unionized blacks experience less unemployment than nonunionized blacks.

Data revealed that reading materials had little effect on the child's views of various occupations as measured by correlation between knowledge and preference.

Participants showed gains in making helping responses and using counseling skills as measured by a pre-post test, Sanford's anecdotal Counseling Questionnaire. Responses to an open-ended questionnaire administered at the end of the project are tabulated item by item with appropriate discussion, indicating that participants felt the project was generally successful. Implications for counseling in rural areas are considered briefly along with eight specific recommendations for future programs. (MS)",

        "description":"In order to provide for comprehensive career education needs with appropriate models, it is first necessary to assess the present situation. The purpose of the study was an assessment of the status of career education on the University of Maine's campuses at Augusta, Farmington, Fort Kent, Machias, Orono, Portland-Gorham, and Presque Isle. The methodology (tape-recorded interviews employing a questionnaire format) and interview analysis (campus vignettes and system-wide analysis) are briefly discussed. A survey of related literature deals with the period from 1968 to the present, with emphasis on the post-1970 years. Vignettes for each of the seven campuses provide: a brief description of the institution, administrative responsibility for career education, past perspective,  rationale, current programs, academic relationships, and future perspective. The final section, analysis and recommendations, presents eight operational principles relating to career development education which were selected as quasi-criteria in evaluating the Maine system and from which the conclusions and recommendations are drawn. The document concludes with a four-page bibliography and a list of the interviewees. (BP)",

        "description":"The findings reported and discussed in the document are part of a larger study concerning female vocational faculty members in several types of educational institutions. The third of four substudies, the research report deals with female faculty in randomly selected postsecondary proprietary schools. The study identifies the perceptions of female vocational faculty members in the three broad areas of dual-role conflict, career aspirations, and career expectations, and compares their perceptions with those of proprietary school directors in order to identify differences and similarities. Several important discrepancies were found and documented and important status components in vocational education were identified. Analysis of the findings suggests that neither administrators nor  female faculty view female faculty as being equal to male faculty; among the many findings are these: over half the administrators and just under half of the female faculty surveyed agreed that, in their institutions, women are not as likely to achieve positions of leadership as are men. More than half the administrators feel, however, that women successfully compete with men at their institution, while more than half the female faculty disagreed. (Author/AJ)",

The present study focuses on public comprehensive secondary schools and the identification of the perceptions of female vocational faculty members in the three broad areas of dual-role conflict, career aspirations, and career expectations. These are compared with the perceptions of comprehensive high school administrators to identify differences and similarities. Several important discrepancies were found and documented; several important status components of female vocational faculty members were identified. The discussion of the study is in two parts; the first centers on the biographical characteristics of the respondents, the second, on the  respondents' perceptions. Among the many findings related to perceptions are these: concerning dual-role conflict, a greater percentage of directors than female faculty agreed that a woman's first responsibility is to be a feminine companion of men and a mother; concerning advancement possibilities, a greater percentage of directors than female faculty agreed that women successfully compete with men at their institution; and concerning professional aspirations, a greater percentage of female faculty than directors believe that a woman's career should be subservient to her husband's.

        "description":"The report, in assessing regional prospects for business and management and accounting graduates at all degree levels through the rest of the 1970's, arrives at several estimates. The estimated 52,000 degrees to be awarded in 1980 in the Southern region represents a 16 percent increase over the number awarded in 1972. Adjusting the figure to allow for those not entering the labor market immediately and those already in the labor market, new entrants are estimated at 41,000 in 1980. Demand was estimated on the basis of projected employment in the 24 occupations deemed most relevant to a business and management educational background. &quot;Managers and administrators&quot; was the area with the largest employment. Total estimated openings are more than double the estimated number of  graduates, constituting a favorable employment market in the Southern region. The outlook favors opportunities for minority (black) and women graduates. The number of blacks in business and management curricula has increased, while the number of women remains low. The projected figures from several surveys for accounting degrees and positions are in conflict, perhaps because of differences in definitions of accounting degrees. However, the overall outlook for accounting graduates appears to be favorable. (Author/AG)",

Six lessons are designed to assist learners in understanding how present experiences relate to past and future ones by comparing the cultures of Europeans in New England, and of Spanish soldiers and Indians in the Southwest, in the 1600's, with contemporary American culture. Dependency on products and interdependency among workers are emphasized. The lessons are broken down into several parts; before the main body of the lesson is described, key items are presented: the concepts, estimated lesson-time, the vocabulary, required resources, and instructor-preparation tasks. Instructor procedures are presented in three sections: the introduction, which  provides continuity within the unit; the tasks, which provides a detailed description of the content and activities used to deliver the specified outcomes; and the summary, which provides closure and a culminating activity. Many instructional resources, designed to require minimal operation time, are included in the lessons. The unit contains several types of instructional strategies: demonstration, discussion, and questioning. Instructor guides for these strategies are appended, with specific references given in the lessons. Supplemental reading material is also appended. (Author/AJ)",

Data sources, which included Federal and State agencies, and the procedures used to collect and analyze the data are presented in the introductory chapter. Chapter 2 (42 pages) provides manpower supply and demand tables presenting statewide totals arranged according to: clusters of occupations, demand, vo-tech supply (secondary, postsecondary, and adult), other sources (Federal, private schools, and descriptive registration), and clusters of programs. Chapter 3 (39 pages) presents additional tables providing a descending rank order of program clusters by demand  minus vocational-technical supply. The program cluster with greatest net manpower demand is ranked one and is followed in order by the program clusters with lesser demand. The rank ordering provides a simple analysis of the tables and is useful to quickly identify program clusters by vocational and technical divisions in which training is needed on a statewide and/or regional basis. Appended are a sample student status form, OTIS procedural flow chart, and an index of statewide totals and descending order of program clusters. (Author/BP)",

The sample was assessed to determine the relationships among isolated variables (collective bargaining, State legislation, Federal legislation, communication with members, intradisciplinary affiliations, accreditation, certification, and current policy components) and certain demographic data (type of bureaucratic structure, level of academic education, number of professional organizations an individual belongs to, membership in union-type educational organizations, amount of work experience before entering education, annual salary, attendance at a national convention since 1970, and the  number of State educational activities attended). Congruencies and discrepancies, determined through statistical analysis, are reported.

        "description":"It is important for leaders of volunteers to examine their attitudes toward their group, particularly their way of defining their group, and to bring a diversity of experience to their work. Three steps that should be taken to develop extension volunteers who are from low income groups and who will work with low income groups are: get them involved in your program, give them the support they need to succeed, and let them know they are appreciated. The first step involves interesting the prospective volunteer, identifying the job to be done, and recruiting the individual. The supportive step requires a lot of flexibility and variety to be successful. One of the most successful methods is to present limited amounts of information close to the time the information is to be used. The  final step, appreciation, can be accomplished in a variety of ways: use symbols of group identity; present roles which will enhance the volunteer's self-image, but present them in a nonthreatening way; and extend verbal expressions of appreciation.

The bases for instructional materials development must relate to the curriculum. Curriculum development is a moving circular process involving horizontal and vertical articulation-diffusion of materials between educational programs. Beginning in the 1920's and continuing until the present date, the materials produced have been widely used. An eight-step procedure is used in materials development: (1) determination of material needed, (2) preliminary planning, (3) information acquisition and analysis, (4) preparation of first draft, (5) refinement and field testing, (6) printing, (7)  distribution-diffusion, and (8) appraisal and updating. Materials development is an integral activity and responsibility of the faculty involving three major interrelated functions: service, research, and instruction. The faculty has access to numerous supportive services in instructional materials development and participates in supportive associations.

        "description":"The study examines the kinds of education and training that women have been receiving from institutions of higher education in the Cleveland area and particularly in Cuyahoga County. Records of degrees conferred in 1973-74 by program study were secured from nine colleges and universities in Cuyahoga County (Baldwin-Wallace, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland State University, Cuyahoga Community College, Dyke, John Carrol University, Notre Dame, St. John College, and Ursuline College) with total enrollments of 52,855. The percentage distribution of degrees granted by field of study in Cuyahoga County and the number of degrees granted per 100,000 population are compared with national average figures (1970-71) from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The survey  data showed that most women receiving degrees in Cuyahoga County have been trained in traditionally &quot;female&quot; fields of specialization; few women have received degrees in traditionally &quot;male&quot; fields; and the absence of women in education and training programs leading to male occupations is true of all types of postsecondary education and training. The report further discusses possible factors accounting for the small number of women in traditionally &quot;male&quot; programs of study. The study concludes with a list of priority areas for further investigation. (BP)",

The task force produced a list of 54 competencies in 10 broad domains. With the checklist of competencies as a common stimulus, 20 homemakers, 25 human service agency administrators, and educators from 19 postsecondary institutions responded to different sets of questions relating to their own work roles. Responses for each group are presented with  detailed analysis. Important findings were that home management competencies and domains: (1) are valued by homemakers, (2) are creditable and part of the curricula in postsecondary institutions, (3) are perceived by agency administrators as desirable for agency personnel, and (4) are valued differently by educators than by homemakers and employers. Appended materials include: report of task force activities, the questionnaire used and tabulation of responses for the three groups, statistical analysis of the data, and the first draft of the home management competency list.

The program is a voluntary, flexible one in which students learn about careers at &quot;career sites&quot; in business and industrial establishments according to the following alternatives: observation, internship, released time, holiday and vacation period employment, or part-time employment. The report includes a review (with commentary) of the program's five objectives: identifying creative work experience approaches with business, industry, community, and civic organizations; improving student and employer satisfaction; identifying alternative work experience programs; developing procedures to utilize employment information; and  providing inservice activities and services. The report includes a timetable for the implementation of the program from June 15, 1975 to May 1, 1976. It also includes six recommendations for expanding the program and reassessing its objectives in light of potential expansion. The report closes with a brief summary and conclusions. Almost three-fourths of the document is comprised of the following appendixes: map of Cass County, promotional material, letters and forms, appointment reminder card, legislative documents, questionnaire results, school participation chart, status report, letters received from community participants and school administrators, and lawyer's opinion of school liability.

        "author":["Brant, Elaine E."],
        "description":"The paper states and proves three propositions regarding the usefulness of the ITED (Iowa Tests of Educational Development) in preparing adult basic education students to take the GED tests. The first proposition, that the ITED can be a useful practice test for GED candidates, is supported by the fact that the ITED tests are designed to measure the same skills as the GED and that the philosophy, objectives, subtest titles, and formats are similar in the two tests. Proposition 2, that performance on the ITED correlates positively with performance on the GED, and therefore can be used to predict scores on the GED, is supported by a series of investigations which demonstrated that the ITED Reading Comprehension test scores can be used to predict (with 75 percent confidence and  within five points) an individual's average score on the GED in science, social studies, and literature. Proposition 3, that various criteria levels of GED performance are identifiable for various student goals, is demonstrated by the construction of two grids, one an item analysis and the other an individual profile sheet, which together can help students and instructors graphically analyze individual students' needs to attain skill levels meeting their chosen criteria levels.

The system is based on the use of the 1,500 most frequently used words in business communications (as established by Mellinger), and words are coordinated with the theory lessons in beginning Gregg shorthand textbooks. As such, the dictation material generated under these conditions provides a fundamentally structured approach to speed building. The use of vocabulary-controlled dictation material tends to alleviate many of the dysfunctions associated with the use of nonvocabulary controlled dictation materials. (Author)",

        "description":"One of the major objectives of programing for the educable mentally retarded is the development of the individual's economic competency or efficiency. In order to reinforce this objective it is necessary that classroom activities employ real money and that some type of work experience be provided so that students learn to manage a given amount of economic resources within the community marketplace. With most jobs open to the retarded being low-paying service occupations, it is paramount that educational programs provide the best possible training and the survival skills necessary to make every dollar stretch as far as possible. The educational program conceptualized to meet this need contains two interacting phases: classroom instruction which focuses on problem solving, and  work-study which provides economic rewards for completing specific repetitive duties characterized as work tasks. Once work-study programs are operational, it is possible to introduce into the curriculum the concepts of consumer education, suggested topics for which are: banking and savings, bills, borrowing money, budgeting, buying on credit, home ownership, insurance, medical-dental, renting, shopping techniques, taxes, and transportation. Thus students' experience of earning a salary is complemented with that of their own planned utilization of financial resources within the community marketplace. (Author/JR)",

Two exploration-level documents and two sets of preparation-level documents were to be developed. The project staff, assisted by an advisory committee, selected a 10-step plan for production of the instructional materials incorporating national and international research and consultation with the educational and industrial fields. A specifically designed field test was conducted for one and one-half school years by a national advisory committee in three school districts which met the selection criteria. Evaluations and recommendations throughout the project came from: the advisory committee  members; field test visitations; interviews with students, teachers, counselors, and administrators; and status reports from instructors, counselors, and administrators. Eight basic recommendations which were incorporated into the final products dealt with: need for illustrations in student manuals (including women and minorities), reduced size and bulk of the documents, use of simple language in student manuals, and expansion of exploration segments in instructor's guide. Appended are advisory committee and consultant lists, names of field testing schools, and visitation agendas. (Author/MS)",

A definition of policy is proposed and policy analysis is discussed in terms of political analysis and institutional analysis. The necessity for nonformal education is explored through historical background and current need, 13 characteristics of nonformal education are listed, and a graphic presentation showing the relationship between nonformal education and general socioeconomic development is included. Policy sectors and policy arenas are defined, and nonformal education is discussed in terms of a policy arena. Policy analysis of Bolivian nonformal education is discussed in terms of the present political configuration, current distribution  of educational goods, and the aspirations of the Bolivian elite. Evaluation of the success of nonformal education in Bolivia is made through examining Bolivian national policies, institutions and their capacities, media, grassroots organizations, and governmental support systems. It is suggested that the document may be useful to those interested in comparative and international education through its definition of policy and its relationship to public concern and the distribution of power within a society.

The literature review discloses a dilemma: while the simulator does constitute a viable basic training aid, differences among pilots trained by various methods become statistically unreliable after pilots have gained a small amount of air experience; faulty control results when a pilot, trained in a simulator supplying highly correlated and accurate motion cues, comes to rely on the cues and attempts to fly an aircraft under instrument-referenced conditions  which often produce misleading vestibular indications. The current experiment will produce quantitative data on which a simulator designer or user may base a rational choice of how much fidelity to include in his or her device, rather than allowing the budget to fix the level of realism. The research evidence to date suggests that the highest training effectiveness of a simulator may occur well below the cost levels of very high fidelity motion systems. (Author/AJ)",

Enlistees indicated their occupational preference on MAPS administered at entry to, at completion of, and six months after completing recruit training. Selections was made from 28 Marine Corps ground occupational fields. The third administration of MAPS included self-evaluations on job satisfaction and service plans. Concurrently with the third MAPS administration, supervisory evaluations were obtained on job satisfaction and service plans and supervisory evaluations were obtained on job performance. Occupational preferences were  found to be inconsistent from one administration of MAPS to another. Statistically significant differences were observed on supervisory and/or self-evaluations between individuals in an occupational field/area they preferred versus those in the same field/area who had chosen some other field/area. The differences between groups based on preferences expressed at entry into basic training are statistically significant. However, they are so small that the association between granting preference options and job satisfaction/job performance has not been clearly demonstrated. Assessment instruments are appended.

The basic hypothesis is that if formal schooling and post-school training are substitutes, then experience-earnings profiles measured in the logarithm of earnings should tend to converge. To test the hypothesis, a sample of approximately 11,000 males over 14 years, who had nonfarm earnings in 1966, and who were not in school or in the military, was selected from the Survey of Economic Opportunity conducted in 1967 by the Census Bureau. The sample was divided occupationally into eight subsamples (professional/technical; manager, official, proprietor; clerical; sales; skilled crafts; operatives; service workers; and laborers)  on which linear regressions were run to determine the extent to which the post-school training of dropouts successfully substituted for the additional formal education received by high school graduates. The linear regressions revealed a very strong tendency for almost complete substitution to occur in all but two of the occupational groups (manager, official, proprietor; and skilled crafts). These tentative results lead to the conclusion that dropping out may be rational from the point of view of both the individual and society. (Author/JR)",

A general matrix of competencies for the three training areas was established through analysis of course content in terms of reading level of material used, numerical skills needed, and student and instructor perceptions of skills necessary to complete a course successfully. These were developed into Skill Checks which underwent field testing, item analysis, measurement of validity, and evaluation in order to determine their usefulness as predictors  of student success and need for remediation. A flow chart visually outlines test development procedure. Continuation of the project is planned with six new areas for test development and the co-operation of other institutions anticipated. It is felt that immediate identification of skill deficiencies and their remediation, through Skill Checks, will help students to complete their vocational programs successfully.

The Utah Department of Vocational Education studied the potential for using this type of instruction in their schools. Air Force material is developed for specific groups to attain specific performances in a prescribed condition. The criterion for successful instruction is the attainment of certain objectives. This is different from civilian instruction which lacks measurable objectives and centers more on instructional procedures rather than instructional outcomes. The selection of criterion-referenced  Air Force material used, with certain additions and modifications, must be based on their success in achieving their objectives.

Also discussed is a House Joint Resolution which is under consideration and which is a constitutional amendment that would revert the State to the elective Superintendent of Public Instruction system without a State board. The document focuses on the concerns of vocational education, whose interest in structural change and administrative reorganization in Illinois relates particularly to the primary role vocational education plays in Illinois' rapidly growing junior college system and the problems to be anticipated should the General Assembly adopt a policy providing for a board  limited to the elementary-secondary level. The review of the pending bills is therefore preceded by a brief overview of the legislative history of Federal vocational education enactments, and is followed by a table comparing the bills on 18 points, including vocational education special provisions. A six-page section then discusses the comparative implications for vocational education; a briefer section is devoted to a discussion of the value of a separate vocational education board.

CBVTE focuses on teaching competencies, expecting trainees to possess the technical or occupational skills which comprise their subject matter; it identifies teaching competencies, provides learning activities which focus on their mastery, and assesses them in real teaching situations. It is individual-, performance-, and field-based, rather than group-, content-, and classroom-based. Florida's universities and State Department of Education (vo-tech division) are exploring CBVTE; Florida State University's (FSU) research and  development project, the advanced testing of 300 CBVTE modules (which were based on exhaustive task analyses and developed in all vocational subjects in a lengthy cooperative venture at Ohio State University) has taken place on and off campus with preservice and inservice teachers. A wide variety of learning activities and feedback devices are used in the modules. Trainees practice competencies in a simulation and then in a classroom. Problems have included gaining commitment from individual faculty members and hesitant trainees. Statewide testing of the Ohio modules is being considered, and FSU plans an exemplary CBVTE program.

The initial six months were spent in research on adult basic education, surveys of community needs, and the construction of the TV studio. The plans for television production called for a curriculum in math, reading, and consumer education. The evaluation of the Salem project consisted of a preliminary pilot test and a more rigorous field test; posttests  showed an increase in the grade level of the participants.

The synthesis of information compiled from this plan was intended to provide school systems with an accurate account of the requirements of Chapter 766 of the Comprehensive Education Act of 1972, and the core evaluation process; the information was also intended as a potential model for any school system in Massachusetts. The document is the result of an 11-day workshop at which professionals from various areas of special education presented pertinent information related to the education and training of special needs students; participants developed and summarized major issues and concerns  to assist in the successful implementation of Chapter 766 at a regional technical school. The resultant materials are organized under four broad headings: (1) developing vocational/technical education for students with special needs, (2) planning instruction for special needs students, (3) major administrative concerns, and (4) summary of workshop participants and final recommendations. Appended are two forms: (1) student information for determining vocational potential and programing, and (2) a survey of services for students with special needs in regional vocational/technical schools.

(These materials are discussed, but not included, in the document.) A national advisory committee was set up, and directors of career education curriculum projects across the nation helped to establish guidelines for articulation and coordination among projects. Materials and information were solicited from career education projects throughout  the United States, from State supervisors of business and office and career education, and from business education supervisors of large cities. The National Symposium for Business and Office Education Curriculum Guidelines was held in Denver in 1973 to inform leaders of the project and to develop and disseminate curriculum guidelines. Cooperating teachers participated in workshops, tested materials (titled resource guides) in their classrooms, and contributed to their revision. In July, 1975, a meeting was held in Denver to disseminate the materials nationally. (AJ)",

The course is divided into two parts; one covering operations with whole numbers, decimals, fractions, and percentage; the other dealing with ratio, proportion, square roots, fundamental geometry, and trigonometry with practical applications. The skills in part one are prerequisite to successful completion of part two which meets the performance requirements of the second class machinist classification. The outline contains lists of texts for both parts on which the skills and assignments are based and a pretest for proficiency credit for part one. The course is structured in units (13 in  part one, 10 in part two) which are divided into lessons. For each lesson specific performance objectives with corresponding assignments from the texts are indicated. Quizzes for some lessons and tests for each unit (actual forms) are included. An evaluation form for each unit has space for lesson, quiz, and unit test grades and a percentage formula for using these three types of scores in tabulating a final grade. (MS)",

An open-ended, closed form survey questionnaire mailed to a stratified random sample of vocational educators in Virginia was analyzed. An 80.23 percent return was obtained. Few significant differences were found in comparing the stratification variables of sex, age, vocational service area, vocational education status, geographical location, and vocational education level with attitudes toward the elderly. Vocational educators were found to be somewhat homogeneous in attitudes and perceptions. Vocational educators perceived that the elderly were a proper concern of the profession, and that, for the most part, personnel and material resources were inadequate for the  task of working with the elderly. It was found that few programs were being offered for the aged by vocational education as a profession, and that where such programs were in effect they were likely to be adult education offerings in skill development areas with the aged eligible to attend, but such activities were not specifically planned for them. Basically, it was found that vocational educators are sensitive to the needs of the aged, but largely unaware of how those needs can be met within the existing structure of vocational education.

        "description":"The report represents the results of a 1973 survey of senior students in hospital schools of nursing. Prepared by the American Hospital Association (AHA) Division of Career Information, the report is based on data compiled by the AHA Division of Survey Research. More than 11,000 students in 388 schools completed and returned a questionnaire which was divided into three major sections: career goals, career guidance, and individual information. Some of the questions required only checks, others required ranking factors in order of importance, and a few asked for open-ended responses. The study findings underscore the influence of the educational program on job selection. The major findings were that a large percentage of seniors expected to continue their education either on  graduation or in the future, that the majority who had accepted job offers selected hospitals as their first employer, that clinical experience appears to influence choice of specialty, and that most students would be willing to work in manpower shortage areas. Several pages of comments interpreting the findings are followed by 41 tables of data. Among the appendixes are the survey questionnaire and tables showing breakdowns of data concerning AHA member and nonmember schools and States and regional data. (Author/AJ)",

        "description":"With manpower considerations assuming an ever increasing importance for the Department of Defense, the report was prepared as part of a research program intended to bring new methodologies to bear on present and future military manpower problems. The report describes the All-Volunteer Force (AVF) recruiting, classification, and assignment (RCA) processes and examines the emerging issues surrounding those processes. Section 1 describes the operational characteristics of pre-Volunteer RCA; Section 2, All-Volunteer RCA in terms of the major underlying influences shaping its development; and Section 3, the emerging issues and potential problems acting on RCA and their relationship to one or more of the underlying influences. Pre-Volunteer RCA was relatively simple; the most important  influence was the virtual guarantee of a ready supply of high quality people to fill the needs of the Services. The absence of this guaranteed supply has been the dominant factor in shaping AVF adjustments and adaptations; seven major institutional influences acting on RCA are identified, and each relates to one or more emerging issue/problem affecting RCA. Six emerging issues are identified, which have in common a high degree of complexity and pervasiveness and which, together, constitute a major challenge to AVF management. (Author/AJ)",

The study sought to find a way to upgrade the career guidance program at the junior high level with little cost in counselor time. Three junior high schools supplied the ninth grade students to be used for experimental and control groups in the study. A pre-posttest decision wh a control group was used for the first part of the test and a posttest only for the second part. In the first school the self-directed search (SDS) test without the use of the SDS kit was administered. In the second school the SDS kits were introduced into the experimental treatment. The third school was used as a control group and used neither the test nor the kits. The  Crites Maturity Inventory was used to measure results to determine whether the SDS had stimulated students to seek career information on their own. Results were inconclusive. The third party evaluation (appended to the report) was conducted, recommending the use of SDS kits along with improvements in scheduling and more involvement of classroom teachers. (MU)",

The survey instrument consisted of 170 previously established and validated statements of teacher competency. A sample of 36 ABE teachers (primarily female, ages 25-65) with three or more years of ABE teaching experience and recent ABE training were asked to indicate, on a scale of zero to seven, the degree to which a teacher should be able to perform each competency. The results, presented in tabular form, show the mean scores used to rank the competencies and the following categories into which they were classified to provide another format for viewing the data: scope  and goal of adult education, curriculum instructional process, and ABE learner. Those competencies ranked in the top quartile were found to be critical in providing criteria for certification. Most critical competencies were in the instructional process category. A method for clustering competencies was suggested for use in developing courses for certification. Appended are a copy of the inventory and a 14-page computer printout of raw data from the survey.

The Crawler Tractor Operator Course, a seven-week heavy equipment course conducted at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri was selected for the study involving approximately 300 trainees. Findings indicate that in the self-pacing system, training managers can (a) train on additional pieces of equipment, if trainees are retained for the full seven weeks; or (b) achieve substantial savings in the time and training costs if the trainees are released for assignment upon their qualification in the crawler tractor operator skills. Other findings from the self-pacing study are: (a) the system  permits trainees to proceed through the course at their own rate of learning, (b) the rate of learning correlates moderately with individual predictor scores, (c) the system is readily accepted by the trainees, (d) although instructor workload is heavier, motivation and morale are higher, (e) peer instruction can be used, and (f) the system is more economical and efficient. The self-paced performance tests and questionnaires used to sample trainee and instructor attitudes toward the program are appended. (Author/AJ)",

An introductory chapter defines types of robberies and suggests administrative and operational uses of the manual. Research and control strategies are reported according to five robbery types: street (visible and non-visible), residential, vehicle, and commercial. Robbery control projects in five cities (Miami, New York City, Denver, Kansas City, and Minneapolis) are described in detail. A chapter on developing a robbery control project presents a step-by-step process for analyzing the pattern of robberies in a community and planning actions to combat them. Techniques are described that can be adapted for use by police departments of any size. Other chapters deal  in depth with organizational and operational problems, training curriculum and methods, and sources of funding. Appended items are: (1) synopsis of robbery programs in 30 cities including program title, descriptions, cost, and a contact for each; (2) analyses of robbery and assault in Worcester, Massachusetts; and (3) public information material used in some of the programs.

        "description":"The report on developing community services identifies effective alternative administrative structures and funding patterns which have enabled or could enable Title I efforts in the State of California to be expanded, continued, or adopted when Title I funding to institutions is diminished or terminated. The first of the report's six chapters is an introduction and overview. Chapter 2 describes the research methodology employed. Chapter 3 discusses the diversity of perspectives and interpretations which have been attached to such terms as continuing education, community service, community development, and public service, and offers a means of clarification based on the distinction between education-oriented, community-oriented, and broker-oriented Title I projects. Chapter 4  focuses on the nature of the strengthening and continuing process of continuing education and community services through developmental funding which has, in some cases, occurred as a result of the intervention of Federal Title I funding. Chapter 5 discusses the primary variables which have been found to affect the strengthening and continuing process for various types of efforts, and presents general conditions which have been found to be important to the continuation or persistence of community service efforts. Chapter 6 provides a summary and general conclusions of the study. (Author/JR)",

The period analyzed runs from the fourth quarter of 1973, to the first three months of 1975. Data breakdown is by sex, race, and age, with the focus primarily on the category of job losers. Men under 56 years of age, with 18 percent of them black, have shown the largest increase in job-loss unemployment. Women account for one-third of job-loss unemployment, with those aged 45 and over showing a larger percentage. Occupational breakdown shows job loss unemployment highest among factory production workers with the relative increase higher for women than men. The increase in job-loss  unemployment has been matched by the increase in unemployment insurance benefits drawn by workers under State programs. Unemployment rates for unemployed re-entrants, consisting mainly of women and blacks, rose 46 percent; new entrants, largely youths 16 to 19 years of age and one-fourth of them black, rose 37 percent; and job leavers showed little increase.

A common requirement in all States for vocational teachers is actual occupational employment and, in Pennsylvania, an additional requirement is the completion of the occupational competency examination. To determine whether occupational competency evaluation scores are a valid indicator of subject competency, a five-year study of 107 full-time vocational teachers was conducted. Data were collected using a 17-item questionnaire designed to measure subject matter competency of teachers through ratings by their supervisors. An 86 percent return resulted. Occupational competency evaluation scores were obtained from the files in  the Department of Vocational Education of the Pennsylvania State University. Relationships between performance scores and supervision ratings were correlated. Results are tabulated and discussed. The occupational competency areas in carpentry, drafting, electronics, and machine shop were correlated and tabulated according to performance, written portion of the occupational competency evaluation, and supervisors' ratings. The fact that no evidence of a relationship between occupational competency evaluation scores, subject competency, and supervisors' ratings was found is discussed.

The project focused on nine priorities related to job placement, job development, job-seeking and keeping skills, and followup services. Objectives, procedures, and methods of evaluation were set up for each priority. The process was divided into five major areas in which specific activities were conducted: needs assessment, job development, student development and placement, followup (post-graduate and undergraduate), and evaluation. A placement team approach was developed as a model for small schools with limited guidance staff. A successful program was established which led to the writing of legislation to provide similar services to  all Maine high school graduates. Conclusions relate to each of the five activity areas and show that the need for job placement among high school students can best be met by existing guidance staff or by a placement team. Five recommendations for promoting job placement in secondary schools are stated. Appended materials (24 pages) include forms used in assessment, development, and evaluation activities; a copy of the legislation; and a 20-item bibliography. (MS)",

All trainees worked individually and at their own rate, with test results showing Group Four personnel achieving proficiency in only some of the required skills. Concluding that mathematical learning capacities of  Group Four personnel did not appear to be adequate for learning to perform typically required computational tasks of Navy enlisted men, despite experimental changes in coursework presentation, it is stated that the nature of the difficulties experienced by this group must be clarified before further improvement in training can be accomplished. Tabulation of test results is included and descriptions of meld test problems, the recipe conversion test, and the diagnostic mathematics quiz are appended. (LH)",

Categorized as Group Four by receiving scores from the 10th to the 30th percentile on the Armed Forces Qualification test, trainees received instruction in computational skills up to a ninth grade level of difficulty through three techniques: audio instruction, minimizing direct assistance, and increasing time of study. Audio instruction techniques included reducing reading requirements and the visual complexity of presentation, with neither method improving test scores. Withdrawal of assistance and extension of training time were combined techniques that produced improvement in test scores. Less than  half of the trainees involved in the study were able to achieve a ninth grade level, making their performance of typically required computational tasks of Navy enlisted men uncertain. More effective training approaches will have to be developed along with a determination of the nature of difficulties experienced by Group Four personnel. Tabulation of test results are included and the arithmetic operations quiz, attitude questionnaire results, and evaluation of audio techniques, and a sample of standard and audio versions of course material are appended.

The question of whether there is a correlation between the length of occupational experience as a valid indicator of the quality of the teacher is examined. There are two ways whereby a person with an occupational skill can become a vocational-industrial teacher: the traditional four-year baccalaureate program, and the certification program. Data were collected on the selected personal, professional, and academic characteristics of 63 students enrolled in the Penn State baccalaureate program, 129 students in the certificate program, 28 certificate holders, and 23 baccalaureate graduates. The procedures used in this study are  described: the selection of population and sample, investigation of the characteristics, and data collection and computer analysis. Conclusions regarding the differences in the two programs are discussed. Research indicates that the number of years of occupational experience has little effect on the outcome of the trade competency examination and that the results of the trade competency examination cannot be used as a predictor for teaching or academic success.

Seven utilization fields were analyzed and inventories were constructed for another three fields. The basic finding was that the inventory method can be used operationally in the analysis of officer jobs if job analysts use specific approaches to task statement construction and if more front-end research than is usually needed for airman job inventories is performed prior to the finalization of a job inventory. No magic formulas for the construction of task statements exist; however, after heavy front-end work, the job analyst will obtain enough information to resolve the issues of task specificity and breadth of coverage for each utilization field on an  individual basis.

Identifying these negative aspects would lead to an understanding of the problem viewed by servicemen as irritants in their military career and popular misconceptions of the military service. Deterrents for enlistment motivation in Australia and the U.K. were identified as inadequate monetary compensation and the service term required. Common negative aspects of military service life  include dissatisfaction with pay, problem of family separation, and inconveniences of changing stations.

Tests, developed for grades three, six, nine, and twelve, measure achievement categories of self-realization, economic efficiency, civic responsibility, and social relationships. Test design incorporates ease of administration and scoring, with provisions for student questions. Pilot testing occurred at each grade level and teacher evaluation was received.  Recommendations for future training programs include a two level approach with careful selection of advanced level participants, and the involvement of administrators, counselors, and community representatives. Testing recommendations include data analysis, lower level test administration to low reading ability students, and incorporating tests into counseling and classroom situations.

However, women's position in learning better trade skills has been hindered by institutional barriers in vocational education training for technical jobs, the trades, and industry. Few studies have been made pertaining to the roles and needs of women in vocational education. Barriers confronting women seeking vocational education include: admission to vocational education courses, which often separates programs and courses by sex in high schools and, in postsecondary programs, the lack of publicity about vocational education programs for adult women; enrollment in postsecondary education programs, hindered for many women by the problems of school  location and child care; instruction methods, which tend to produce female stereotypes and where women are barely represented in the administrative levels; and the lack of counseling for women in curriculum and career choices. Improvements in job training for women and guarantees of equity in vocational education should focus on the following areas: Federal laws; Federal, State, and local educational policies and practices; and research and development. An outline of the Vocational Education Amendment of 1968 and 83 notes and references are appended. (EC)",

Program objectives were to provide: (1) student counseling services to help appraise interests, aptitudes, and skills in relation to occupational preferences; and (2) a sheltered work experience vocational curriculum with vocational counseling services to assist students in developing entry level skills for commensurate occupations. Inservice training was conducted and programs developed in five areas: grounds keeping and landscaping, janitorial and custodial, domestic, food service, and maintenance service for building and equipment. The  programs centered around work experiences at work stations provided by the school system. Combined with the vocational instruction was a compensatory program in basic communication skills, reading, and mathematics as needed for the jobs. More than half of the students also held part-time jobs, some of them in their areas of study, and earnings from the jobs contributed to students' improved attitudes. Appended materials comprise over half of the document and include: newspaper articles, participant responses, supervisor's checklist, list of project developed materials, resource bibliography, attitude tests, and project budget.

Twenty-four non-teaching graduates were identified and surveyed and 17 responses were gained (71 percent). Personal, educational, and work-related data are tabulated and an analysis of the results is also presented. A wide variety of reasons are given for not entering the profession. The predominant factors were: to secure more personal freedom, to secure a higher salary, to improve their family situation, and to get away from too much red tape. The writer suggests that the report provides  important input for teacher educators and those associated with the preparation of teachers of agricultural education in the technical agricultural subject areas.

The report describes the methodology of the occupational shortages forecasting model and the equations used in the model (least squares method), and describes the features of the computer program with respect to input requirements, computing sequence, and output descriptions. The model predicts occupational shortages by extrapolations of the calculated linear forecasting equations which approximate the nonlinear occupational data. The correlation analysis which shows (1) how well the  forecasting line represents the actual data points and (2) the reliability of the prediction is also included. Appendix A of the report (78 pages) presents computer graphical representations of the forecasting model as it applies to 76 technical occupational areas covered in the various departmental course offerings of the James Connally Campus of Texas State Technical Institute.

The specific objectives of this project were to: (1) provide an estimate for future need for teachers in vocationally reimbursed teaching positions in Minnesota, and (2) identify and describe the relative size of sources of teachers in these positions. Conduct of the study was accomplished in two phases. The first phase employed the Delphi technique with a group of experts and the second phase involved sampling schools having vocational education programs with vocationally reimbursed positions. The findings show: (1) a need for approximately 370 new teachers each year over the next five years, (2) the  estimated average annual total number of full-time teachers in vocationally reimbursed positions over the next five years will be approximately 4,750, (3) a number of reimbursed teachers in new program levels will be added in the next five years, and (4) each program area has a large number of part-time teachers for adult programs. Summary data on future demand and average annual growth or decline of teachers, and summary data on factors affecting the supply of teachers is appended. (Author/KB)",

Other parts of the manual cover a different phase of vocational orientation, using a more theoretical approach based on traditional vocational guidance methods, with emphasis on providing information on personality development. Goals of vocational orientation are student self-evaluation, introduction of the various occupational areas, exploration of the economic and social values of work, exploration of the psychological and sociological meanings of work, description of educational avenues,  and the development of students' decision-making ability. The unit-project approach to vocational orientation is applied to the curriculum flow in order to give students some practical experience along with the information.

As the postsecondary technical-vocational schools throughout Wisconsin showed great differences in the content of their communication skills courses, both among schools and within various educational programs, a statewide survey was conducted to determine the importance of various communication skills competencies. A list of 40 communication skills or tasks was developed. Questionnaires containing these 40 competencies were sent to employers and to graduates of vocational-technical programs for ranking of the competencies in 15 occupations in job clusters for business technology, secretarial and related science, industrial machine, health vocation, and industrial technology. Detailed rank  orders and mean responses are presented in the report. Survey results indicated that some communication skills are more important than others and that different occupations require different levels of competency. Results also supported the cluster concept that vocational programs can be clustered for the purpose of teaching or learning communication skills.

A later post-conference evaluation was also made to determine the effectiveness of the conference in behavioral terms. The report includes a project summary, with goals, objectives, procedures, results, conclusions, and evaluation findings. The 13-page curriculum guide developed and used for the leadership training conference is also included. The conference agenda  and project correspondence are appended. (NJ)",

        "description":"The purposes of the study were: (1) to compare the occupational achievement of vocational education graduates with that of nonvocational graduates, (2) to determine the number of graduates trained in the various vocational areas, and (3) to describe the group of students enrolled in vocational education courses. The study was limited to 1970 graduates of eight high schools in Arkansas. The data were collected by use of a mail-out questionnaire. Thirty-six percent of the sample of 1,749 returned completed questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used to present characteristics of one-year and two-year vocational education graduates. Chi-square analyses were made comparing data and responses of the two-year graduates and a control group of nonvocational graduates. The following  are some of the important findings. More two-year graduates than one-year graduates were employed full-time and in jobs in the same area as their training. More of the one-year graduates were unemployed. More one-year than two-year graduates were attending college. Also, the vocational education graduates had significantly higher achievement records in high school than the nonvocational graduates.

A special program emphasis had been developed for each of the three grade levels. It was not possible to evaluate the grade 8 program; however, two evaluation forms were used in the grade 7 program and proved to provide sufficient information to make an estimate of the relevancy and appropriateness of the program. The evaluation tool used for the grade 9 program was the self-concept and motivation inventory. This instrument was administered twice for providing information to be used in the statistical evaluation of program effectiveness. The instrument proved unsatisfactory for this purpose, but gave valuable  information concerning the individual. The learning activities for grades 7, 8, and 9, making up the bulk of the document (283 pages), are appended. Organized as lesson plans for each grade level, objectives, teaching suggestions, procedures, required materials, and instructional materials are provided. Grade 7 materials (52 pages) emphasize self-evaluation, grade 8 materials (79 pages) stress vocational interest development, and grade 9 materials (53 pages) deal with career planning and decision-making.

Students intended for the preparatory program were those identified by their high school records and by entrance examinations as needing further development before admission to a postsecondary vocational program. The program objectives were accomplished by: (1) assessing the remedial education needs of students through diagnostic testing in reading, English, math, natural science, and study skills; (2) interviewing instructors for their reactions to the program; (3) visiting other schools to examine methods and curriculum materials  used in their remedial education programs; and (4) developing programs to meet the specific remedial education needs of individual students. As a result of these efforts it was recommended that a learning resource center be developed to provide an opportunity for individualized instruction. Three-fourths of the document consists of appended materials: a periodicals bibliography, program objectives, school visitation and seminar report.

Various activities commonly occurring in retailing are simulated through the use of written memos and telephone messages. The learning activities were written for use in either a traditional classroom or a model store. The goal of the package is to acquaint the student with situations surrounding various tasks that must be performed in a store. The scope of topics presented was reduced to functions rather than positions in an effort to better enable the students to identify with the actual units of work to be performed. (Author/VA)",

The manual presents a program based on the art of delegating authority and responsibility from a management perspective. The course is designed to help managers realize the value of delegation by understanding what and how to delegate and by identifying ways to overcome the forces working against delegation. The program can be conducted in 7 to 20 hours, depending on the background of the individuals in the program. The course was developed for the adult training level, but it can also be used for high school distributive education students and in postsecondary management training. The manual includes transparencies and a listing  of films which are annotated. (VA)",

The cumulative grade point average (GPA) of the Ss was the measure of academic achievement. An estimate of each S's degree of satisfaction with his academic performance was obtained. An analysis of variance on the data indicated that only HU males scored significantly lower than NU males. These results  suggest that while HU females might benefit from appropriate counseling, distinterest of HU males in academic performance might be responsible for their lower GPA scores. (SE)",

Seizing the opportunity will be largely dependent on the well-prepared presentation of a case for the needs of young people by dedicated advocates in every state. Title XX fosters a decentralized program of Federally supported services as set forth in a Comprehensive Annual Services Program (CASP) Plan published by each governor, and prepared and administered by the designated Title XX agency in each state. In addition, the law encourages very active participation by private organizations, agencies, and individual citizens in the development of the plan and, by contract, in the provisions of the  services planned. This manual is designed to help advocates for children and youth understand the opportunities in Title XX and prepare for effective participation in the state planning process. The manual is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the background and philosophy of Title XX; Section 3 outlines the operating requirements of the new law; Section 4 describes the planning requirements in Title XX along with detailed examples of how Title XX can be used to fund children and youth-oriented services programs; and Section 5 suggests some &quot;next steps&quot; for state or local action.

The overall focus is on the role of the individual in the development of contemporary China and the attempts to integrate individual and collective goals. The process of socialization in China is examined through a description of the society's major institutions, the role of women, the concepts of work and career, and the integration of theory and practice in education. The political consciousness-raising processes in the society are examined along with recent trends in physical and mental health care, urbanization and industrialization, and marriage and family planning.

The arbitrary divisions of a life into periods of education, work and leisure impose related problems, both on institutions charged with preparation and certification and on the individual who meets these divisions with growing skepticism. The job of continuing education is to bring to bear a new perspective on the interrelationships of learning, work and leisure. It must search out more positive concepts of adulthood and better links with industry and community. It must help to articulate and meet the rising need for a wide variety of adult educational experiences. (Author)",

The project consisted of 10 one-hours sessions. The objectives were to give high-school girls an opportunity to get to know themselves better, develop an understanding of the limitations of sex-stereotyping, acquire better decision-making skills and appreciate the need for career planning and information. Basic tenets behind the project were: (1) career development is a process not an event; (2) career development is a personal event of great importance--developing an understanding of that unique event was a component of the project; (3) career development is essentially a socially-bound process--the limiting  aspects of female stereotyping, the occupational person concept, and the role of personal values were topics; (4) young people experience a great deal of anxiety in connection with career choice but still spend little time in career planning; (5) change is the dynamic condition under which career decisions are being made, thus decision-making skills received special attention; (6) the essence of career development is experience, so role-playing, simulations and gaming were the primary techniques used in the project.

The first is the attack on trait theory, and it is argued that socialization research can survive this attack only if it becomes more concerned with structural developmental change in its dependent variables. Second, the impact of the \"cognitive revolution\" is assessed, and the paper argues that more attention must be given to the ways in which children process inputs from socialization agents, and developmental changes in processing capacities. Finally, it is urged that research attention must be focused on the conditions which sustain the effective  performance of socialization agents. (Author)",

Specifically, the study asked: Is teacher change in Intimacy and Esprit related to pupil change in Self Perception and Peer Acceptance? Activities were designed to: (1) provide children with counseling opportunities, individual and group; and (2) provide teachers with consulting activities which included classroom video-taping, private and group focused video-tape feedback sessions, and discussions of classroom management techniques. Analyses of covariance yielded significantly higher Self Perceptions scores among pupils whose teachers' Esprit and Intimacy scores evidenced the greatest  change, and Peer Acceptance scores among pupils whose teachers made the greatest gains in Esprit. Additionally, correlated t-tests indicated no significant gains in either Esprit or Intimacy for teachers. On the other hand, significant gains were observed for pupil Peer Acceptance scores. It should be noted that significant decreases were observed for all but one factor of the Self Perceptions Index. It was concluded that positive changes in teacher affective behaviors were associated with positive changes in pupil affective behaviors. Further, the findings suggested that comprehensive guidance services have the potential for influencing such behavior changes. (Author)",

These instruments included graduate and student questionnaires that were developed to evaluate important input, process and outcome variables. This paper is concerned with the results of these two respondent groups. Results indicate that students and graduates appear most satisfied with the clinical practicum experience and least satisfied with the inability of the curriculum to allow for  specialization within the profession (administration, etc.). Opinions of graduates and current students were very similar, and the study clearly indicates that what students perceive as strengths and weaknesses in their training programs does not change once they leave school.

        "description":"Relatively little data exist concerning the effectiveness of Navy intercultural relations (ICR) training programs. In addition, much training research in this area is characterized by methodological and design inadequacies. The purposes of this study were to design and test a methodological model, and to provide an objective assessment of ICR training impact. It was found that training had a modest but significant effect upon the attitudes of Overseas Duty Training (ODT)/Personnel Exchange Program (PEP) and Human Resource Development Center (HRDC) IDR Personnel. ODT/PEP personnel changed significantly on 13 of 24 scales and HRDC personnel on 9 of 24 scales. Scales measured self-actualization, flexibility, tolerance of ambiguity, acceptance of self and others, leadership styles,  and basic motivational patterns. The failure to detect a greater degree of change may have been due to various test ceiling effects or to the nature of the change process itself. Although the real test of program impact necessitates validation against external or in-country criteria, the results did indicate that the impact of ICR training, although modest, was consistent with the hypotheses generated for the evaluation of the training objectives of the program.

In this volume, the author has compiled a group of English-language short stories and novels which deal with the use of mind-altering drugs, all written since 1900 and falling within the literary category of science fiction. (Not included are stories dealing with drugs whose effects are primarily on the body rather than the mind--immortality serums, for example.) The majority of the stories included in the study date from the post-1965 period, when the wide use of drugs first pervaded the national life. Included is an overview of drug themes in science fiction and an annotated bibliography of 75 novels. (Author/HMV)",

The themes represented in the survey reflect popular American attitudes toward drugs from pre-World War II through the 1970's. The roots of these themes, beginning with 17th century French cultural attitudes are explained. The subject has been treated broadly; there is no attempt to analyze literary characters who used drugs (for example, Sherlock Holmes), nor to consider the effect of drugs on the creativity of any authors who may have used drugs. An annotated bibliography of 41 novels is included. (Author)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to frame the outlines of an interpersonal theory derived from exploratory research among adolescent reading failures. The theory postulates that adolescent reading failure syndrome results from and is maintained by conscious elements of choice manifested in the adolescent's perception preferences. The affective readiness for failure in reading tasks is, therefore, a deeply seated psychological generator of the reading failure disturbance showing extreme resistance to modification through traditional remedial reading school practices, but worthy of as vigorous an exploration as has been undertaken into the more familiar cognitive parameters of successful reading performance. The subjects, 180 seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth grade Black male  students, were evaluated through personal interviews, questionnaires, and observation over an 80-week period by the researcher. Results indicate that adolescent reading failure is accompanied by perception preferences for retreat into one of three views of the world depending upon the interpersonal and intrapersonal pressures of the moment. Such preferences are characterized by: (1) unsocialized aggression, reflecting overt and covert hostile disobedience, quarrelsomeness, physical and verbal aggressiveness, vengefulness, and destructiveness; (2) social approval anxiety, reflecting continuous anxiety, unrealistic fears, immaturity, self-consciousness, inhibition and frustration; or (3) unsocialized withdrawal, reflecting seclusiveness, detachment, sensitivity, shyness, and a flagging  desire to form close personal relationships.

Results showed that all subject groups, pre-counselor through experienced counselor, with and without master's degrees, were able to make empathic and stereotype predictions at a level significantly better than chance, although relative accuracy was not demonstrated to increase significantly and directly as a function of either education or experience. Graduate counseling students were more accurate than either non-graduate students or novice counselors. As counselors became more experienced, their understanding of problems typically experienced by clients with certain disabilities improved, but their ability to be sensitive to the problems  reported by specific clients decreased. As counselors gained experience, they tended increasingly to perceive their clients as some stereotyped \"typical\" client. (Author)",

In this case, the problem studied was drug abuse in the Army. A mail survey dealing with illicit drug use was conducted, comparing the data acquisition effectiveness of the Randomized Inquiry (RI) technique and a conventional-type questionnaire. The respondents were four stratified random samples, of approximately 500 men each, drawn from the U.S. Army, Continental United States. Variables studied were (a) method used in questionnaire (RI vs. conventional), (b) rank of respondent (officers vs. enlisted men), and (c) effect of advance notice on return rate. Five sensitive questions were  developed to get information of the respondents' use of five drugs. Conventional questionnaires yielded more response than questionnaires employing the RI technique; drug usage rates reported were not significantly different under the two techniques. The questionnaire return rate proved to be higher for officers than for enlisted men, particularly when they received advance notice of the survey.

It describes a study in which rates of nontherapeutic drug use obtained by a random urine screening program among Army personnel were compared with rates obtained by an anonymous self-report questionnaire. Procedural methodology in the urinalysis program was also examined. Questionnaire administration and urinalysis testing were conducted during the spring of 1973 on a sample of over 1,000 personnel assigned to five posts. The questionnaire was an inventory of drugs on which the subject indicated frequency of use during the previous three days. The field testing procedures in the urinalysis  program were examined to determine variations in administration and to identify problems which could enable drug users to evade detection. As predicted, there was a discrepancy between the self-report rate of drug use and that found in urinalysis, with the self-report rate being much higher. Individual company commanders were particularly instrumental in determining the effectiveness of the urinalysis program. (Author)",

Children with visual problems may experience difficulties in visual discrimination, visual-motor coordination and visual memory. In the auditory modality, a child may suffer from difficulties in auditory discrimination and auditory memory. The authors describe several remedial techniques to treat each of the mentioned learning disabilities, adopting a team approach to the problem. Before a child is treated, an effort is made to determine the specific nature and degree of his impairment. The latter is accomplished by the administration of achievement,  and other appropriate visual and auditory tests as well as by the completion of a questionnaire by the teacher describing the details of the problem. Afterwards, the teacher, the counselor, the reading specialist and other specialists consult together and prepare a detailed program for remedying the specific difficulty faced. The program is carried out in a special room called the \"resource room.\" Periodically, similar consultations are held to assess the progress made and to plan new approaches, if necessary.

Stage II sequentially outlines how to specify and enumerate behavioral goals for the program, how to develop its delivery system, how to design evaluation procedures and what to prepare for running the pilot program. Stage III emphasizes the importance of effective program publicity, the necessity of developing staff training methods, some notes on actually conducting the pilot program and ends with a discussion of the  importance of studying the pilot evaluation results before deciding to embark on Stage IV. Stage IV consists of offering the program on a regular basis with refinement of training and evaluation methodologies. Finally, Stage V includes the periodic re-examination of the program in relation to its target, purpose, method and changing agency needs. (Author)",

Information was also sought regarding the position of the top personnel administrator and the major personnel problems as perceived by him. The major findings were: (1) the Personnel Departments of the majority of the districts are responsible for the personnel functions of the Certificated and Classified staffs and the Salary Administration; (2) the Payroll processing function is usually the responsibility of the Business Department; (3) negotiations are a  separate function but receive input from the Personnel Department; (4) the overall personnel responsibility usually rests with an Assistant Superintendent reporting to the Superintendent or his Deputy; (5) the Assistant Superintendent for Personnel has ultimate responsibility for the Certificated and Classified staff whether they are administered as a unit or a separate division; (6) in districts with separate geographical administrative units, as in districts with a single unit, the personnel function is centralized; (7) staff development is most frequently the responsibility of the Curriculum/Instruction Division or Personnel; and (8) the major problems are in the area of personnel placement.

The need exists for identifying potential dropouts prior to their actual withdrawal. After a dropout-prone student has been identified, an analysis of his specific needs should be made. Finally, specifically tailored instructional programs based on needs should be implemented to allow the student to achieve academic and social growth. This paper describes such a program. A psychologist and psychometrist developed a battery of tests to help identify prospective dropouts, for whom a remediation program in basic mathematics was developed. Results indicate that the program was successful in encouraging students to  stay in school. (Author/HMV)",

Evaluation results yielded positive overall ratings and comments concerning the program, while suggestions were made to improve areas such as placement tests and Ethnic Studies Information.

All too frequently after giving birth to a series of unwanted, uncared for children these women and their children become psychiatric casualties. Attempts by helping agencies to deal with these adolescents are often unsuccessful. In a large metropolitan hospital the Ob-Gyn and Psychiatric Departments established a group therapy program which utilized \"advocacy\" as a primary mode of treatment. The group was designed as a quasi-family with the therapists emphasizing their roles as mother surrogates. With the therapists as advocates, feelings of self-esteem were reinforced, and the ability to deal effectively with others was conveyed. Problems  were dealt with in a dynamic context by way of the group therapy process and advocacy stance. As a result of this corrective emotional experience in the group, the members have taken good care of themselves and their children. They have been better able to negotiate systems, and have made better use of resources available to them. Group members have also requested continued treatment to deal with \"our messes that got us in these troubles.\" The adoption of this therapeutic stance which emphasized social and psychological advocacy as an expression of good mothering has had many positive results in working with teenage mothers. Such a therapeutic stance has widespread applicability in terms of prevention and treatment. (Author)",

Differing with traditional modeling procedures, the junior high students were required to interact with the youngsters as well as each other. Following the interaction, twice-weekly group counseling sessions were conducted for a nine-week period to discuss the interpersonal behavior of the preschoolers and to have the junior high students relate it to their own behaviors. Some structural group procedures were also adopted. The goals of the procedures were increased self-understanding and understaning of others as expressed by improved interpersonal relations with persons both younger and older than the client as well as his peers. The program gained popularity among the students  and staff throughout the two years of its existence. The impact of the procedure on participants' behaviors and attitudes as well as the school environment was assessed. The participants for this study included 24 students from a federally funded Title III ESEA experimental junior high school and 12 students from a neighboring traditional junior high. (Author)",

The categorization has followed the areas detailed above. Of these an example has been  chosen to illustrate the points made. Case studies, well disguised, are presented as an illustration of the topic area.

The studies were performed on nursery school children and first graders. Results suggested that there are several different types of impulsivity, and that only one of these is related to academic achievement. In general, the research findings from the project show that lower SES children develop verbal control over impulsive behavior more slowly than middle SES children. Furthermore, it was found that lack of impulse control was significantly related to poor academic achievement in the lower SES first graders, even though IQ was controlled. Finally, an attempt was made to train lower SES children in  techniques that would lead to increased verbal control over their impulsive behavior. The training techniques developed in this research were found to lead to greater impulse control on specially devised experimental tasks. However, the data were not clear on whether these improvements in impulse control resulted in better academic achievement. Further research is needed on this topic. (Author/SE)",

Students first master consonant and vowel sounds from phonetic spelling lists, and as they proceed through the course to special reading books, the cuing with symbols is gradually reduced. The symbols enable the students to progress rapidly  enough that they experience feelings of confidence and success in their reading. Students enter the program at the level at which they need work.

Although the principal objective of the research was to produce multimedia inservice packages for reading teachers which demonstrate twelve outstanding programs, the number of effective reading programs discovered was too significant to go unreported. Summaries are given for each of the 222 programs judged to have potential for improving reading ability. The size of each program and its target population are described; its starting date, staff, and major features are given; its facilities, materials, and equipment are listed; and its cost is detailed. Sources of further  information on each program are also included. The programs outline elementary, secondary, adult, and special education areas and cover a wide range of reading skills, organizational plans, and geographical areas. The twelve programs to be depicted in multimedia packages are also briefly described. More complete descriptions of most of the programs can be found in the ERIC system. (MKM)",

Eighty-six test exercises were classified according to the various formats of reading materials they represent and according to the types of behaviors they elicit. The highest expected level of performance was determined by the achievement level obtained by a group of superior readers on a standardized reading test. All groups performed highest on drawings, pictures, signs, and labels and second highest on charts, maps, and graphs. Most groups performed third highest on passages, fourth highest on forms, and least well on reference materials. Comparison of the results of this  test given in 1973-74 with a truncated version given to 17-year-olds in 1970-71 showed all groups gained in functional reading skills. Three exercise parts consisting of questions about an insurance policy statement, a traffic ticket, and an application form were answered well by no group, including the superior readers, which raises the question of further defining functional reading.

Such skills are, paradoxically, among those least often developed in a systematic fashion in elementary schools. One reason for this is that component subskills of visual and verbal literacy are infrequently identified. The three subskills identified in this paper are describing, comparing, and oral valuing. An effective way of encouraging children to learn these skills is to use illustrations from children's literature. The approach offers many advantages because illustrations are easy to locate, plentiful, and of much interest to children. The teacher attempting to use this approach will find that children respond eagerly and in the  process develop valuable visual and verbal literacy skills. (TS)",

While the program was received enthusiastically, the results of the evaluation showed no significant gains in reading achievement when compared with the previous  year. In fact, all gains were lower for the project year than for the year before. Another finding was differences in reading achievement gains for different ability levels.

Two experiments--one on first graders and one on first and third graders--are contained in this paper. These replications and extensions of Samuels' (1967) tests in both laboratory and classroom of the distractability of pictures in the initial acquisition of reading responses to printed words resulted in both failure to replicate the original findings and in a major reinterpretation of the design. Application of the classical conditioning model to Samuels' test of attentional processes in  beginning reading revealed that it does not provide an adequate test of attention, but rather, constitutes a test of either learning to read using intrinsically-produced, visually mediated responses or learning to read using extrinsically-produced, verbally mediated responses.

An analysis of eye movements of &quot;competent&quot; and &quot;less competent&quot; readers reading for general and detailed information showed many differences between them. One of the findings is that competent readers made fewer saccadic eye movements per line of print and spent less time on fixation pauses. In addition, when reading for detail, they did not change the size of the informational chunk taken in during each fixation pause but did increase the amount of time spent on such fixation pauses. Less competent readers decreased the informational chunk taken in per fixation but did not change the amount of time  spent per fixation. Also reported are a pilot study concerning blink or saccad suppression of information, a study of eye movements as readers scan back from the end to the beginning of a new line, and the development of a procedure for measuring head movements. A study of informational chunking which investigated the effects of the wider angular distance of the PLATO display and typed materials suggests that a drop in efficiency of reading speed is noted when reading these compared to reading a printed book format.

Two independent learning strands suggested as major factors in achieving literacy are learning to understand language by eye (reading) as skillfully as one can understand language by ear (auding) and learning to use the printed medium for literacy task performance in understanding various graphic displays using iconic, linguistic, and schematic representations. Examples of advanced information processing skills involved in the latter are presented and explained. A study designed to assess discrepancies between auding and reading skills of adults in a literacy training program used the Durrell Listening Reading Test and obtained auding scores for the adults of only the fifth-grade  level. In a second study, it was observed that adults who scored at the eighth-grade level on a standardized reading test may be less developed than a group of average fifth-grade readers in automaticity of decoding. This and other studies surveyed suggest that learning to understand language by eye as skillfully as by ear may take several years after the initial decoding has been mastered. (MKM)",

The tutorial assistance program attempts to provide help with both study skills and specific course content, since students experiencing academic difficulty in a specific course may request tutoring aid, not realizing that their approach to learning may be interfering with their mastery of the course. Two types of positions for student tutors are: tutor consultants or advisors, who interview prospective tutees, serve as paraprofessional learning specialists, and act as consultants with student tutors in their efforts in guiding a student's learning; and student tutors, who actually tutor the student in a course. Training for the tutor consultants has focused on  expanding their knowledge and expertise in interviewing skills and diagnostic techniques, learning skills and teaching strategies, consultation techniques, and administrative skills. Methods for training have included workshops on selected topics of interest, weekly staff meetings, and individual weekly meetings with the director. (MKM)",

The program consists of two ungraded reading chains of twelve groups each (determined by reading comprehension) which meet for 45 minutes daily, read material above the group's tested total reading level, and decode unfamiliar words using the Formula Phonics System learned by videotape at the beginning of the program. Reading matter--short stories first, then novels and other works--is chosen for literary worth and interest level and instruction is designed to teach critical thinking with open-ended questioning and to reinforce thinking processes and reading skills by writing tasks keyed to the reading  experience. Pupils move up on the chain upon the teacher's recommendation. Detailed information about the reading chain design, staff development procedures, specific methodology, and the school is included in this document.

In the past 10 years, research has accumulated to show that all children pass through the important stage of initial cognitive confusion in learning to read. Children often confuse \"writing\" with \"drawing,\"\"letter\" with \"number,\" and so on. Cognitive confusion is a natural outcome of normal environmental conditions which cannot be avoided, but if it persists too long it may prevent the child from understanding the task of learning to read. Several studies about helping children to develop language concepts have been conducted. The general key to improving this kind of concept learning is the use of the language-experience approach. Children need experiences of spoken and written  language which are relevant to them and which allow them to discover the functions of reading and writing. (TS)",

Two 550-word reading passages taken from \"Life in the Ancient World\" were rewritten to conform to sixth-grade readability levels. Alternate form reliability was established in a preliminary investigation in which cloze tests constructed from both passages were administered to a group of 45 sixth graders. It was concluded that, given the design of this study, neither specific nor general reading directions influenced the level of reading achievement. It may be that sixth-grade children just  have not yet developed the reading skills necessary to use reading directions of the type provided in this experiment. For these children, purpose setting directions which are facilitative may be those which are discussed, verbalized, or in some manner internalized, rather than those presented in a list. (RB)",

One hundred fifty language samples of approximately one hundred words each were selected and keypunched for computer analysis to determine average word length and total number of running words. Manual syllable counts for each sample were also performed. Their values were then used to calculate letters-per-syllable predictors for each level. The use of letters-per-syllable constants predicted between 73 percent and 90 percent of the variance of the actual syllable count. It was concluded that this procedure for calculating the number of syllables makes it possible to program a computer to compute  readability of language samples using readability measures which rely on syllable counts.

Fieldwork data were collected through semistructured interviews with superintendents, project directors, principals, teachers, and others with a knowledge of the project, such as district office personnel or parents.

Discussed are such topics as evidence of listener awareness, stylistic and rhetorical contrivances, and individualization in plots and motifs. It was concluded as follows: that through representative and interpretive projections, newly literate children show a marked preference for reappraising and reorganizing received literature in relation to their own sense  of creative awareness; that the most predominate conventional patterns in the newly literate child's fiction are those which most resemble conventional aspects of oral traditional literature; and that the literature of newly literate children is a sophisticated form of primitive art which should be judged on its own terms and not by standards of contemporary adult literature.

The first MAFL was administered to 5,200 17-year-olds statistically selected to represent the entire population of in-school 17-year-olds in America. These students were asked to answer questions and complete basic everyday reading tasks which had been selected by a panel of reading specialists appointed by Right to Read. All groups gained in functional reading skills measured by the 64 exercises which were used both in the regular NAEP reading assessment in 1971 and in the MAFL in 1974.

Examples of word patterns whose primary dimension of classification is word ending are listed. The terminal design requirement was to sequence letter-sound rules used in phonics-based word attack instruction so as to optimize the rate at which items from the speech lexicon become decodable and hence potentially items of the sight lexicon. Thus, since a majority of the two-syllable words of English are initially stressed, variations of this pattern are suggested for introduction  systematically and early in reading instruction. (MKM)",

Thirteen fifth grade students from a lower-middle-class background were randomly selected to compose a training group and 18 matched subjects formed a control group. All subjects were given a pretest which consisted of 10 unfinished vignettes whose completion required a simile (an explicit metaphor). The completion task consisted of two parts: subjects first created their own endings for each item and then chose an ending from several which were presented to them. The study clearly documented the fact that fifth graders in this population could produce and appreciate figurative language.  Metaphoric endings were preferred by all subjects by the third week of the study; metaphoric endings were routinely produced by all of the subjects by the sixth week of the study. Although individual rates of progress varied widely, the stages through which subjects passed in acquiring metaphoric understanding were remarkably similar. (RB)",

Six essays, all on the same topic, were used for the study. It was concluded that the analytic method of rating produces a higher reliability among raters than does the holistic method, but that the analytic method produces a lower validity for the grades on the papers than does the holistic method.

Two versions of a classroom discussion about \"A Spring Night\" are given in the form of a script. The most significant techniques developed by psychologists which can be used directly in responding to literature are described.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine whether practice in transformational sentence combining will aid students' reading comprehension by giving them a large repetoire of syntactic constructions from which to draw when matching constructions contained in the materials they are expected to read. The first section of the document discusses the background of and need for the study, including the language processes (oral language, awareness of language structure, and syntactic maturity in written language) in relation to reading. Twenty-four seventh grade students were the subjects of this study, twelve for the experimental group and twelve for the control. Problems for sentence combining were constructed largely by the investigator, although in the beginning it was found that  all students needed the preliminary models and exercises developed specifically for this research study. Some of the primary findings were that there appears to be a close link between a student's reading level and the same student's syntactic maturity level; that the greatest gains in reading comprehension from sentence combinings appeared to be from among the lower and middle groups of readers; and that experimental students made large gains in writing fluency.

The Old Testament writers considered them just as impartially as they did men, free from prejudice and even from condescension.&quot; The Bible portrays Rebekah, Rahab, Deborah, Jael, Esther, and Judith and their contributions to the nation of Israel with faithfulness and extreme candor. These women are represented in the Old Testament as multidimensional human beings--self-reliant, resourceful, influential, and courageous--but at the same time capable of resorting to morally questionable means in order to accomplish their ends. This straightforward portrayal of women is due largely to the fact that the Hebrew mind was  intrinsically realistic, which accounts for much of the directness and simplicity of the Old Testament narratives and also for the fact that the writers had a respect for self-determined and resourceful women.

Any literature, art form, or medium of expression which is capable of affecting the imaginative processes of modern man is not a distraction, it is an important force in shaping the collective dream of society. Science fiction is making it possible for mankind not only to imagine earthly paradises, commercial or visionary, but also to create them, make them work, and live within them. The utility of science fiction is that it prepares mankind for those changes of consciousness which alter experience. The contributions of  science fiction to the literature on the imagination are varied, and science fiction has also been seen as the new mythology. (RB)",

        "description":"The primary purposes of this study were to investigate the phonetic bases of nonstandard spellings invented by preschool and primary-grade children, to devise appropriate experimental techniques for eliciting judgments of phonetic relationships from young children, to identify the specific characteristics that influence children's categorization of speech sounds, and to identify the significance of children's phonetic judgments for phonetic classification and for the teaching of literacy. The six chapters of the book discuss such topics as invented spelling, experimental studies of clusters, experimental studies of preconsonantal nasals, and studies of vowels. Some of the major conclusions reached in this study are that (1) the basis for certain common nonstandard spellings is  that children categorize speech sounds in unexpected but phonetically justified ways; and (2) categorization of speech sounds is an important component of early language learning because it influences children's efforts in spelling, giving rise to certain types of apparent errors which teachers should understand in order to respond appropriately.

Although immigrants and their descendants have been culturally assimilated to varying degrees over a period of years, they have nonetheless remained significantly ethnic in a social sense. In order to cope adequately with multiethnic American literature, American literary studies should become international and Americanists should become multilingual as a group, minimally bilingual as individuals. Furthermore, they should become sensitive to the characteristics of ethnic cultures and of immigrant experiences. Toward this end, Americanists will have to join and work cooperatively with  three groups of professional colleagues: literary and linguistic specialists in the non-English languages, specialists in the history and culture of the nations and regions from which American immigrants came, and specialists in the sociocultural history of ethnic groups in the United States and in the North America of pre-Columbian and colonial times.

There is indeed much evidence to indicate that this may be true. On the other hand, Peter Drucker has warned us that the political units of the world are on a collision course with the economic concept of one world. He points out that there is really no economic substitute for the nation state. There is increasing evidence to indicate that nationalism is on the rise and that advertising planners as well as economists and all sorts of internationalists may be in for hard times during the next decade.

Such activities place Americans and the constituents they represent in different cultural contexts that involve and require adjustment and adaptation to situations and people with different value systems and behavior patterns. This paper focuses on the primary cross-cultural verbal and nonverbal communication elements entailed in the behaviors of personnel in multinational organizations. A schema for the training of overseas personnel is proposed, and examples of different problems arising in cross-cultural contacts are given. The schema represents a continuum for observing and classifying a wide range of culturally determined behaviors. The areas covered in  this schema deal with the most recurrent behavioral variables involved in cross-cultural communication breakdowns. Even though the categories in the schema may interrelate or occasionally overlap, the intent is to arrange them in an order of a likelihood of priorities of occurrence in interactional contexts.

        "description":"This essay explores the group dynamics relating to the events surrounding the Watergate coverup and attempts to identify the factors that predispose of the parties involved to make inappropriate, foolish, and ineffective choices concerning a criminal case in which none of them initially was culpable. The initial Watergate breakin is briefly outlined, and the details of the Watergate coverup are described extensively through the use of manuscripts from the Watergate hearings and books written by such eminent political commentators as Theodore H. White, Arthur Schlesinger, and Dan Rather. Four points of view are then offered to account for the behavior patterns and decision-making procedures of the individuals involved in the Watergate coverup. Each of these views is dismissed as  only a partial explanation for the coverup because President Nixon could still have made the right decision to avoid culpability. In conclusion, the author argues that to understand why Nixon did not, one has to focus on the communication behavior of the group involved as that behavior reflects the forces that inhibited their ability to make not only what would have been &quot;the easy&quot; decision but the right one as well.

These differences have been found in vocal patterns, intensities, length of speaking turn, eye gazing and contact, amount and timing of smiling behavior, posture and movement, spacing, and the amount, initiation, and area of touching. In addition, the same or similar nonverbal behaviors may be given different meanings by observers, as in vocal patterns, the smiling behavior of parents, and eye behavior. If future studies confirm that sex is a significant variable in nonverbal communication, sex should be a  consistent component of further research design, teachers should be aware of the differences in a classroom context, and women and men may want to acquire new nonverbal behaviors to expand their repertoire of communication.

The majority of students are admitted to Walbridge on a first-come, first-served basis; however, some positions are reserved for students who have been placed on extended suspension by the regular schools. The school employs a behavior modification system centering on token points. The curriculum includes reading, math, science, history, social studies, and English. The evaluation objectives focused on student progress toward graduation, social and academic attainment, program strengths and suggestions, and program observation and description. Extensive information on the findings in the areas of student population,  academic achievement, absentee rates, high school credit acquisition, a follow-up of 1973-74 school year students, staff evaluations, student evaluations, and parent evaluations are included. Walbridge Academy is achieving its objectives with a large proportion of its students. Suggestions are included in an attempt to aid further improvement of the program. (Author/IRT)",

Most of its 26 students are below grade level in reading and mathematics and have histories of behavioral difficulties or adjustment problems. The objectives of the program are to build meaningful personal relationships with each student and to develop student reading and mathematics achievement. Extensive data is presented on findings related to the student population, academic achievement of the students, attendance rates, staff evaluations, interviews with the staff, student evaluations, parent evaluations, and evaluations of the program by members of the staff of the parent school. The evidence seems to indicate that the program is successfully achieving the goals of building a meaningful personal relationship with  students and improving reading and math achievement. The major problems within the program seem to stem from the lack of opportunity for full planning and for preparation for the admission of students. Recommendations are offered to help improve the program. (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"In considering the organizational functions of school systems, the following assumptions need to be examined: client achievement cannot be used as a major index of organizational health; organizational functioning relates closely to the utilization of available human and material resources; maximizing available resources increases organizational adaptability to change; and schools have limitations and need to recognize them. Characteristics leading to an assessment of organizational health include clearly stated purposes and responsibilities, a systematic process for evaluation, a built-in spirit and attitude toward change, and an ability to utilize influence as a feedback mechanism for growth and development. Such characteristics permit school systems to retain their uniqueness  relative to their own situations. Procedures for gaining control over the above characteristics would vary from school system to school system. However, the outcome for different school systems should be the same; improved efficiency and productivity could result in better educational opportunities for the children and community.

The objective of the present study is to establish the best institutional means for achieving this aim and, insofar as there are common patterns between countries for such institutional arrangements, to try to identify them. The institutional arrangements for school building relate essentially to the total period from the initiation of a project (that is, as soon as the need for a school and its type and size have been determined) through completion of the building and its subsequent maintenance and evaluation. The processes involved in this must, moreover, be viewed at all times in the  wider context of forward planning of school building programs if implementation is to be effective and resources properly used. Indeed, the framing of school networks and of forward capital programs to meet educational needs are key factors in the whole matter. (Author/IRT)",

The movement in education now called accountability has added the additional requirement that educators stipulate the objectives to be achieved by students, the actual success in achieving them, and the costs incurred in the process. This is probably best called performance accountability; its underlying theme is that the objective of education is learning, not teaching. The appropriate unit of accountability for results is the school and the school district. If the school as a system does not attain its objectives--if students do not learn--the system  is redesigned until they do. Regardless of the results, the students or parents or teacher are not blamed for failure to learn. (Author/JG)",

The school administrator must be accepted as a leader, and he must earn this acceptance through his performance. Very little money is spent to develop leadership for the vast educational enterprise that spends $108 billion a year and involves three of every ten Americans on a full-time basis. More than $2 billion a year in federal money is spent on undergraduate grants, loans, and fellowships, but the  practicing school administrator has no access to a sabbatical, grant, or fellowship.

The survey showed that 53.7 percent of American public high schools currently provide by policy for early graduation, and that the percentage of early graduates rose from 2.2 percent of the class of 1971 to 7.7 percent of the class of 1974. Most early graduates were successful, well-adjusted students who decided to graduate early for a wide variety of reasons. More than two-thirds of early graduates were female, and most graduated  one semester ahead of their class. Three years after graduation, only 9 percent of 1972 early graduates felt they would have been better off to graduate with their class. Implications for school administrators of the trend toward early graduation are discussed, and the early graduation policies of seven high schools throughout the United States are described briefly.

The first paper, \"Education, Work, and Productivity,\" points out that while productivity per man-hour in the private sector of our economy has been increasing, productivity per man-hour in the educational sector has decreased markedly as educators continue to push for lower student/teacher ratios. The author suggests that this trend can be reversed by utilizing such technological advances as video cassettes and instructional television networks to extend education beyond the classroom and improve educational results while increasing student/teacher ratios. The second paper, \"R & D and Productivity  in Education,\" suggests that improved educational productivity can best be achieved by changing from our present teacher-oriented educational system to a student-oriented system. To achieve this shift will require an expansion of research and development efforts focusing on student-centered education, the author argues. (JG)",

        "description":"The planner's model requires people to be rational in setting educational policies and spending resources to implement those policies. It is assumed that if an organization has difficulty in planning, the fault lies with the people, not with the model. Two images of the school cover the conceptions commonly held by many people. The image of the school as a unit of production rests on a belief that organizations act like people. Alternatively, the school may be seen as a public utility rather than as a factory. This service model of the school accounts for the fact that people develop strongly held normative views about schools and that these views frequently conflict. There are four serious objections to the planning-production model of the school. First, schools are not really  organized around educational goals; second, it is very difficult to evaluate schools; third, educational policy is not made according to plan; and fourth, useful means for identifying and measuring educational resources are lacking. To improve educational planning, people must first overcome the rationalist bias in planning and look more closely at moral and experiential bases for planning. Second, people in education must be much more experimental about discovering educational purposes, applying educational resources, and evaluating the consequences of their efforts. (Author/JG)",

The problem of absenteeism is presented in terms of policy implementation, in relation to ways absence is measured, and in respect to recent studies on the subject. Experiences of private business and industry in improving attendance are cited as models for school administrators. The school principal is seen as the single necessary person who must be involved in the development, implementation, and evaluation of the  effectiveness of any attendance improvement plan. Various management activities are suggested. The data section of the report contains a set of narrative-charts illustrating the absenteeism rate of New Jersey teachers and that from selected studies of private sector employees. (Author/MLF)",

However, analysis of educational and training systems in developing countries shows serious inadequacies, imbalances, and inadaptations. Thus, the remarkable quantitative expansion of educational systems has not been a satisfactory solution to the problems that face developing countries. According to data published by the Development Aid Committee (DAC) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, total net public and private assistance in 1968 for all DAC countries was 0.77 percent of gross national product. Altogether, assistance accounts for about 8 percent of total educational expenditures in developing countries. Obviously, any serious study of  educational policies can be worthwhile only if it is based on a preliminary study of the objectives and means of promoting economic and social development. If UNESCO could take full responsibility for the technical tasks within its competence in the elaboration of educational development policies, it would help coordinate and give direction to the action of all donor countries.

A manager must first determine his own goals within the framework of overriding organizational objectives and limitations. Second, a manager must determine what methods he will use to achieve his goals--on the basis of cost-benefit comparisons. Third, the manager must design his specific management plan, which must include a monitoring system that permits him to observe and respond to any deviations from the original plan. Educational preparation is a critical factor in the development of effective managers. First, managers must develop analytical ability and learn to treat knowledge and perceptions in a problem-oriented fashion. Second, managers must learn to interpret ideas creatively. Third, managers must have  the ability to lead and motivate people. Fourth, managers must be able to understand and organize information flow. Fifth, managers must understand how to delegate. Educational management is often hindered by political considerations and other noneducational factors. Also, in the operational area of education, it is extremely difficult to measure cost effectiveness. However, the lessons of business administration and factory management are still largely applicable to educational management. (Author/JG)",

        "description":"The crucial problem for educational administrators concerned with improving the quality of education is how to build into their systems the capacity to change. Four major factors are necessary for an education system to remain sensitive and adaptable to change: a proper understanding of their own role by administrators, availability of well qualified teachers, encouragement of flexibility in teachers and schools, and provision of change-making research institutions. The administrator's role is to organize a system that enables educators to do their work effectively. The essential step toward divesting administrators of technically educative functions is improvement of the quality of teachers. When teachers are well educated and have access to continued professional training,  administrators are able to encourage local initiative and autonomy. The role of administrators then is to set up innovative machinery or change-making institutions. The simplest such institutions are committees of teachers and advisers; however these groups are rarely able to generate really new ideas, techniques, or methods. For that, more formal, specialized research and development institutions must be set up. (Author/JG)",

The countries under consideration are the six member countries of the European Economic Community and the United States, Great Britain, and the U.S.S.R. The organizational structures of vocational and technical &quot;secondary&quot; education are not considered. The problems of  reforming the structures of secondary education are not abstract: the difficulty does not lie in conceiving a system considered as ideal, but in conceiving transitional systems, concrete ways of changing over from the present parallel stream system to the reformed system, and in accepting the difficulties arising from this transition.

The complexity of the task is increased because the five planning activities--issuing directives for planning, preparing plans, approving plans, implementing plans, and evaluating and revising plans--overlap each other. Educational planning poses specific administrative problems in three areas--determining the location of a planning agency in a governmental structure, sorting out the relationship between politics and administration, and resolving the issue of involving public opinion in planning.

        "description":"It is fundamental in planning to see why and how expenditures on education should be limited and related to other priorities as part of economic and social planning. Integration of education with economic needs involves three elements. First, the identification of the general limits on educational expansion in the economic development planning context. Second, consideration of some of the requirements for economic development. Third, the application of the principle of selection of priorities to the educational system itself as part of economic and social planning. In order that the limited resources available to education should be well spent in relation to economic development, educational planning should consider (1) the integration of primary education with adequate measures  for postprimary training as part of rural development; (2) the change and expansion of secondary and higher education in relation to future employment possibilities; (3) the creation of a mass approach to nonformal education whereby those who are working are also learning; (4) the territorial location of educational effort so as to contribute most to other types of development planning; and (5) the unit costs and the efficiency of the educational system.

It considers (1) analysis of the existing situation of education and employment in order to prepare the basis for an educational plan that takes account of employment requirements and possibilities; (2) the main practices and principles involved in preparing a perspective plan for education in the light of manpower needs; and (3) some objections to the manpower approach to educational  planning.

The guide suggests alternatives for those engaged in such policy-making rather than mandating a single course of action for all school districts. The guide is not intended to limit a community's prerogative to determine its own rules and regulations under existing state and federal law. Drug policies should be flexible and possess a high degree of individual application, as simplified, rigid, and general policies are frequently unworkable. Any action designed to help students meet and cope with their problems must steer a course between two concerns: what is best for the individual and what is most desirable for the total school  population. In the sections on individual topics--the role of school personnel with respect to confidentiality, pupil records, the school's relationship with the police, student rights, procedures regarding suspension and expulsion, and procedures regarding readmission--an attempt is made to state the issue clearly, to refer to pertinent law, to suggest possible approaches to policy, and to explain, where necessary, the reasons for the approaches taken. A sample school policy is appended. (Author/IRT)",

The data collected were examined and assessed according to five major topics: (1) criteria used for school closure decisions, (2) optimum elementary school size and methods of determining building capacity, (3) amount of cost savings resulting from closure of elementary schools, (4) disposition of buildings that had been closed, and (5) impact of elementary school closures on surrounding neighborhoods. The three criteria cited most often as reasons for closing schools were declining enrollments, age of building, and desegregation efforts. Closure is a simple solution to the problem of excess space,  but it is also a source of other problems, problems far more intricate and complex and much more difficult and costly to solve. Once an elementary school is closed, the environmental forces of out-migration, population decline, and neighborhood deterioration are set in motion. Numerous charts and a review of the literature on optimum school size are included. (Author/IRT)",

Described is a 5-year project, funded under Title VI, operating within 11-18 elementary schools surrounding the University of Maryland Hospital. Biweekly services are offered to participating schools by a task-oriented multiprofessional team that includes a nurse, a physician, a diagnostic and prescriptive educator, a psychologist, a communications specialist, and a social worker, as well as the child's classroom teacher and principal. Stressed is the importance of monitoring the child's educational needs and re-evaluating his progress on a regular and frequent basis. Successful results of the interdisciplinary team approach are said to  include observable educational improvement for 52 percent of LD children served during 1971 and improved inservice training (in such areas as early identification and development of specific prescriptive techniques) for regular class and resource room teachers.

A model was developed which used the learning center approach within classroom boundaries, and involved a psychologist, a reading teacher, classroom teachers (for grades K-3), and volunteers. The teacher-directed educational program consisted of a highly-structured, slow-paced teaching method; materials such as basal readers, language development kits, and audiovisual equipment; a parent involvement component; and preservice and inservice training for teachers. Results obtained by comparing Ss with controls from regular grades showed that experimental Ss progressed faster in word  recognition, did not differ significantly in IQ level, attained a significantly higher level of maturity, and showed a significantly lower incidence of personality and interpersonal adjustment problems.

Among the findings  were that the Ss made up a heterogeneous population and that little positive change is shown by first time enrollees on objective measures although parents reported improvement in coordination.

Results over a 12 month period indicated that 68 percent of the Ss showed no change in developmental level, 92 percent of those making a gain increased by one level, and 6 percent demonstrated losses. Data suggested that curriculum materials should be appropriate to the student's level of cognitive development, and that measures of developmental level provide more educationally relevant information than IQ scores.

Ss were shown three sets of structured/unstructured stimuli (such as \"VUNS\" and \"NSUV\") and were instructed to write down all or as much of the stimulus as they could after the cessation of the stimulus presentation. It was found that both the deaf and hearing Ss were influenced by orthographic structure at the earliest levels and that the hearing Ss showed no over-all superiority in this task. An additional finding that fourth grade level deaf Ss performed better than hearing Ss on unstructured items led to the  conclusion that older deaf Ss had developed a compensatory skill permitting superior perception of unstructured items.

Evaluation indicated that significant improvements attributable to project intervention occurred in the areas  of achievement test performance, self concept, and mainstream performance. Additionally, parents indicated strong support for the home involvement aspect. Identified were 15 program strengths (such as the team approach to diagnosis and remediation) and program problems such as classroom teachers who were unfamiliar with needs of the LD child.

The training sequence involved an intensive learning experience (seminars and internships) and practicums experience in different activities (such as classroom teaching) at a therapeutic school for ED pupils. Before and after each academic year, three groups of eight students each were administered test batteries (measuring competencies, attitudes toward education, and interpersonality characteristics) along with two self-evaluation instruments.  Results comparing pre- and post-program attitudes showed that trainees reported they felt less disturbed by overly aggressive behavior of children, increased their skill in decoding affective statements, tended to see others as less lovable and less competent, and checked a greater number of favorable adjectives when rating themselves. Follow-up interviews indicated that graduates felt the program provided the most effective training for those areas (personal sensitivity and behavior management) which they also considered most relevant.

The 17 projects are categorized in two different ways. In a brief summary section, projects are classified according to whether they relate primarily to organization and planning or to R and D needs. Provided in the next section is a more detailed description of short-term projects that may be expected to yield successful early results (including new reading and mobility aids for the blind and studies of visual capabilities among the partially sighted) as well as long-term projects (involving broader research in such areas as  vocational opportunities, public information programs, sensory aids centers, technological applications, and research on the reading process among sighted individuals). Also listed are 19 source documents said to define problems, to describe the current state-of-the-art, or to indicate organizations and people currently active in the field of sensory aids for the visually impaired.

R. Nystrand provides an overview of decentralization theory and process and suggests that reasons for the development of decentralization include a general distrust of professionals and the political and social aspirations of minority group members. Results of two studies are reported: the effects of decentralization on special education in two large urban school districts (E. Avery et al), and a survey of decentralization and special education in the Great City schools (N. Nash). M. Gittell focuses on the decision making process to distinguish political and  administrative decentralization, and describes the impact of the process on such special education issues as mainstreaming and the right to education mandates. Discussed by M. Shedd are strategies and considerations involved in decentralizing the administration of special education in large city public schools. A conference summary is offered by E. Willenberg. Included in three appendixes is information about decentralized and centralized school systems in such cities as Atlanta, Detroit, and Cleveland. (CL)",

Reported in the literature review (1973-75) is a continuing trend toward favorable reception and positive use of paraprofessionals in special education. From questionnaires (a sample is provided in Appendix A) mailed to directors of 12 community colleges involved in training paraprofessionals in programs for handicapped children, findings are reported in terms of types of programs; number of paraprofessionals being trained, graduated, and employed; and program highlights and changes. Workshops and conventions are seen to demonstrate that the paraprofessional is a successful part of the delivery of instruction to handicapped  children. Also summarized are three critical areas which are needed in the training and utilization of paraprofessionals: organized dissemination of materials, management and training skills for professionals to work with paraprofessionals, and closer examination into training models for paraprofessionals to work with severely handicapped children.

E. Noakes's paper deals with such basic housing needs as homes planned for independent living to which services can be delivered and homes planned for congregate living with appropriate services provided inhouse. Responses to the topic from E. Weinrich and R. LaPierre cite prejudicial attitudes as major problems for the handicapped. Provisions of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 are related to the needs of the handicapped by M. Jackson, and responses to his address are given by L. Kirk and K. Arneson. Alternate housing models are reviewed, including  programs in Fall River, Massachusetts, and Fargo, North Dakota. P. Roos proposes principles for normalizing the housing for handicapped people, including providing a range of options and minimizing obstacles. E. Fiorito and M. Thompson suggest ways to achieve the goal. Considered by J. Shover are responsibilities of public and private organizations in providing housing, and comments regarding her presentation are offered by C. Gueli and E. Leonard. Listed are recommendations adopted by four conference discussion groups. In the concluding address, A. Adams calls for a coalition to develop a national housing strategy.

Among the results were that most respondents were aware of drug treatment, that the Freedman Report was best known  among professionals in medicine and least known among laymen, and that the principal source of information on child hyperkinesis was professional literature.

Explained are distinctions between mental retardation and developmental disabilities, and between decentralization, deinstitutionalization and institutional reform. Forces in the deinstitutionalization movement are analyzed, including normalization and legal action. Resistance by parents and economic interests are said to be among barriers to deinstitutionalization. Elements of a comprehensive service system, including adherence to a developmental model are considered, and comprehensive system services such as family support and child development services are described. Given are examples of deinstitutionalization efforts in  Connecticut, Nebraska and California. Approaches to deinstitutionalization in rural areas receive special consideration. (CL)",

The project is described as a 3-month institute to provide experiences in areas such as learning to use creative thinking and problem-solving strategies in language arts, science and mathematics, and music. Results and recommendations from the first evaluation are outlined and instruments used for the second evaluation are described in three sections: the experiment, student perceptions, and other sources. Reported are findings which included that Ss showed significant improvement in verbal originality and figural flexibility; that Ss improved in the areas of self-strength and  individually; and compared to Ss' self-perceptions in 1974, 1975 Ss' self-perceptions significantly improved in environmental sensitivity, initiative, self-strength, individuality, and intellectuality. Recommendations for the project's third year are noted which include the continued encouragement of effective use of the library. (SB)",

Too often such programs rely on cultural learning through haphazard and chance experiences. In its stead, a carefully organized program of cultural knowledge and experiences is advanced. Centered around a thematic approach to analysis of the foreign life style, the program involves face-to-face interviews and field experiences which bring students into direct contact with the foreign people and their social organization. Field assignments are accompanied by written guidelines to aid in the culture quest. Discussion-type seminars help sharpen understanding of the subject matter, and special sessions for teachers to design cultural materials for classroom use back home provide  appropriate pedogogical application.

The main part of the report describes the design of the procedures set up to evaluate these programs based on the following recommendations from the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction: (1) prior to implementing a bilingual program in a community a sociolinguistic survey should be conducted there; (2) priority should be given to early childhood programs, preferably pre-school and kindergarten; (3) 'standardized' instruments, rather than criterion-referenced tests  should be selected as measurement tools; and (4) insofar as possible, a true experimental evaluation design should be employed, with randomly assigned treatment and control groups. The aim was to select and implement the combination of designs and instruments which would most effectively give an accurate picture of local bilingual education programs. Actual evaluation findings are not reported here.

        "description":"This study examined acquisition and development of children's social/symbolic and strategic communication abilities within a sociolinguistic model of communicative competence. The major theoretical perspective was derived from Mead's symbolic interactionism and the cognitive-developmental theories of Piaget and Werner. Role-taking was the central concept used to examine the developmental variation and achievement of specific communicative abilities in two communicative task situations: (1) social/strategic or &quot;persuasive,&quot; (2) social perspective taking, or &quot;empathy.&quot; Measures of role-taking ability were developed, based on qualitative criteria established by the social/symbolic requirements of the communication task. Two additional sub-skill indices of role-taking ability were  also developed: a communication construct measure and a communication &quot;management&quot; score. The sample consisted of 61 grade school children, 27 males and 34 females, ages 9-12, from three ethnic groups (Caucasian, Black, and Spanish American), all having a low socio-economic background. Results showed that older children and Caucasian children demonstrated significantly greater role-taking ability, that general role-taking ability operates across task situations and conceptual domains, that grade level was minimally important in communication construct usage, and that the ability to manage the ongoing situation across tasks showed a significant developmental increase.

        "description":"This paper explores the meanings and distribution of the perfect in contemporary American English prose, with reference to problems encountered in teaching English as a second language. The English perfect comprises forms traditionally called present perfect tense, past perfect tense, and perfects of the infinitive, gerund and present participle. All forms have a tense function: to situate the action or state conveyed by the lexical verb in a time period which begins before and extends to a point of reference that varies depending on the perfect form in question. Each instance of the perfect conveys one of three secondary meanings: single action, iteration, continuation. This meaning depends partly on the nature of the lexical verb and partly on context. The verification of this  theory of meaning of the American English perfect and a study of its distribution in contemporary writing are accomplished by use of the Standard Corpus of Present-Day American English. Instances of the perfect from approximately 300,000 words, or 30 percent of the Corpus are extracted with 10 words of context from either side, analyzed for meaning, and the distribution of the various forms in written American English is determined.

        "description":"A native speaker of a language possesses both grammatical and rhetorical competence. A grammatical model, in its deep structure, represents an &quot;is a&quot; relationship. It seeks to offer some explanation of a human being as a human being. A rhetorical model represents a &quot;counts as&quot; relationship. It seeks to offer some explanation of a human being as a social animal. Linguistic models, such as the performative analysis, that attempt to integrate illocutionary force into a grammar are ill-conceived. An illocutionary act must be context-oriented. A rhetoric relates illocutionary force and context. That is, a particular chunk of linguistic material (generated by the grammar, without orientation to context) counts as a particular illocutionary act (the actualization of an illocutionary  force) in a particular context. Queries, a rhetorical concept, underlain by basic assumptions or sincerity conditions (Austin's proper thoughts and feelings), and questions, a grammatical concept, provide interesting examples of and insights into incongruities resulting from the nexus of grammatical and rhetorical competence.

The two major experimental questions were: (1) Will there be development towards greater complexity in the syntax of spontaneous writing and how should it be described? (2) What transformational linguistic analysis of spontaneous writing at the acquisition and early development stages tell about the ability to express syntactical relationships in writing? Spontaneous written language in response to a stimulus picture was obtained weekly from 5 children each at three grade levels (8 boys and 7 girls, ages 4-7) over a ten week period. Each child was tested individually. A case study approach was used to analyze each written corpus. A  battery of tests for background data, letter recognition, letter writing, word writing, oral reading, vocabulary and drawing was administered. Results revealed parallels between acquisition and early development in oral and written language, ability to produce linguistic forms and to express syntactical relationships, and increasing movement towards complexity in spontaneous writing. Each child's written language corpus is included. Appendices contain relevant statistical data. (CLK)",

The subjects were required to select a response picture appropriate to the sentences. Three subject groups were tested: (1) controls with no history of neurological damage; (2) a group of aphasic patients with unilateral left hemisphere brain damage; (3) a group with unilateral right hemisphere brain damage. The general conclusion was that the right  hemisphere appears capable of processing some syntactically simple language stimuli; however, as stimuli become more complex, the left hemisphere may be necessary for comprehension. Testing involving cortical visually evoked responses recorded over both hemispheres simultaneously was conducted to see if visual AER's can be used to detect cortical language processing. It appears to be a useful means to study intra- and inter-hemispheric neural language systems. Charts and graphs illustrating research methods and findings are included. (CHK)",

        "description":"Most of what has been taught in the language classroom for a long while has been generally a reflection of the particular concept of language popular among linguistics at the time, but recently this trend has begun to break down. Recent texts are starting to be organized according to considerations besides linguistic criteria, for example, psychological and pedagogical criteria. We are becoming increasingly more aware that linguistics should not be viewed as the sole source of information about the nature of communication. That language study should not be the exclusive province of experts in one area of academic specialization is demonstrated with the example of &quot;extra-sententials.&quot; These are various expressions used in verbal communication, such as &quot;in all seriousness&quot; and &quot;to  begin with,&quot; which have no grammatical connection to the sentence but refer instead to the locutionary expressions, to some aspect of the various kinds of speech acts. These expressions, considered in relation to a set of postulates that accompany speech acts, have three main functions: (1) a neutral verbalization of the postulate, (2) raising the possibility of doubt as to whether the postulate is being adhered to, and (3) rectifying a violation of a conversational postulate. Extra-sententials, then, are tools for communication, and some way should be devised to include them in language instruction. More attention should be given in language teaching to the communication situation, that is, to the perceptions and intentions of the participants. (CLK)",

        "description":"Throughout the fifties and sixties the methodology of second-language teaching underwent a radical change in response to new communication needs, and under the influence of structural linguistics and behavioral psychology. Unfortunately, the effort did not produce all of the results expected, and this probably for two reasons: on the one hand, it was based on a linguistic and psychological foundation which was much too elementary and limited and was soon put in question in its own right; on the other, it did not take sufficient note of the characteristics of the learners. At the same time, disciplines such as psycholinguistics and sociolinguistics made their appearance and developed alongside linguistics and psychology, contributing in the process fresh information concerning the  acquisition and use of languages as instruments of communication. Since then, it has become possible to speak of a renewal and a diversification of second language pedagogy in the light of these disciplines, which take better account of the characteristics of the groups and individuals involved, in particular of their language needs, their attitudes, their motivations and their learning strategies. The last part of the report outlines the methodological implications of this new approach and illustrates them with the help of some recent findings. (Author)",

These activities include an annual state-wide essay contest and language festival, a cultural exchange program, a group uniting all small high school foreign language clubs, administration of the National Spanish Examination and of the National French Contest, teaching workshops for high school teachers, and various cultural events such as film festivals and exhibits for the community. The internal programs,  benefiting the college students and the college community, have instituted laboratory material to be used at home, taped classes, free tutoring sessions, revised curriculum descriptions, double specialization whereby a student can combine languages, and new fields of study in which foreign languages play a major part. Each innovation is described briefly. The results of these programs are increased enrollments and renewed interest in foreign language study. (CLK)",

The experiment was inspired by the fact that teaching spoken Chinese cannot be solved by traditional classroom methods, particularly at the intermediate level. The lack of texts, the inadequacy of existing texts, the low morale of intermediate students and the difficulty in creating native environment for learning Chinese are factors that justify the use of play production. Play production puts dialogues into a situation that simulates life, the project itself providing an environment which requires verbal communication and mutual cooperation. The tedium and boredom of language learning can be avoided, and the promise of  recognition creates a further incentive. But to carry out such a project, one must first obtain a suitable play, by simplifying an existing one, adapting a short story or writing an original play. Once a play is obtained, one must assemble a staff capable of directing the production and get the cooperation of the students. The next steps involve familiarizing the students with the text through discussion, assigning and learning roles, rehearsals and performance. Each of these steps is discussed with specific reference to the Oberlin experience. (CLK)",

Despite the proliferation of bilingual programs in many parts of the country, only very modest progress is being made toward the goal of equal educational achievement. We are coming to realize that limited English-speaking children with a 5- to 6-year handicap in English can only very exceptionally catch up. Only if a greater, not just an equal, opportunity is provided, can these children be expected to compete successfully with their English-speaking schoolmates. There are two prerequisites: (1) that limited English-speaking children be given an early start in learning to read, first in their home language and then in English, and (2) that the community  accord non-English home languages the same respect as English. The second, involving profound social changes, will take time. Even the first will require years of experimentation. This paper sketches the preliminary steps of a long-term project to test the hypothesis that limited English-speaking children (how many will have to be determined) can learn to read their home language between ages 1 1/2 and 3 and English between 3 and 5.

In a probe recall experiment, a word with a thematized referent was a better recall probe than a word with a nonthematized referent. Also, an agent noun was a better prompt than a recipient, and this semantic variable interacted with topicalization so that a semantic recipient was a better prompt when it was topic than when it was comment. In a second experiment, subjects' choice between semantically equivalent active and passive sentences was influenced by thematization. Thematized nouns were chosen as topics more often than nonthematized nouns, and nouns used as paragraph titles were chosen as topics slightly more than non-title nouns. It is  suggested that twin discourse functions are served by thematization and topicalization, the former providing stable referential focus and the latter providing monentary referential focus.

        "description":"This article, in the form of an interview, deals with the status and expected future of foreign language programs in the nations schools and colleges, and in particular, Virginia's. Despite hearsay, enrollment in foreign language has remained fairly constant in Virginia high schools. French and Spanish have the highest enrollments, followed by German, although French has lost more than 20 percent of its enrollment. Russian enrollment has not obvious pattern and Latin is declining. In colleges and universities, enrollments were noticeably affected by relaxation of language requirements, although many schools still maintain a language requirement for entrance. Negative reports about declining foreign language programs are overstated, mostly because of the decline in French in urban  language programs, which are losing academically oriented students to the suburbs, and because of the priority on basic subjects. Changing trends in public attitudes and in business should affect foreign language study in a positive way, however. A growing spirit of nationalism in other countries is leading to increased use of language other than English for international business negotiations. Acceptance of languages other than English in the United States and improvement in the quality of instruction are also sources of encouragement. The article concludes with some advice to students and a brief discussion of the changes in recent years in FL teaching methodology and the challenges facing FL teachers today. (CLK)",

Communication should be established with civic organizations and community groups by means of lectures. Foreign language clubs can assume new importance by participating in international friendship organizations. The Partner of the Americas organization, for example, establishes relationships between North American and Latin American cities. Students should be encouraged to become acquainted with the organization and to participate in the various cultural exchange programs. The annual state-wide conventions of the federations of high-school foreign language clubs make for further publicity for foreign languages and cultures. Strategies for organizing such a  convention are outlined, followed by a copy of the constitution and by-laws of the Alabama Federation of High School Spanish Clubs. Additional forms of publicity and public relations techniques include promotion of foreign languages through television and radio programs, through newspapers, and by means of communication with public figures, such as political leaders and educators, and community agencies, such as publishers. Bumper stickers are also recommended as a form of publicity. (CLK)",

The remainder of the article deals with the problems that arose when the program was  implemented. The teachers prepared their own materials and found it difficult to combine advanced content with elementary-level English. The courses were organized to be as lively and motivational as possible by the use of diagrams, tables, graphs and interpretation. Possibilities for classroom activities, especially technical ones, were limited. Drills were found not to be very useful in this situation, but humor, discussion and student participation in general proved very fruitful. (TL)",

It was suggested that a pre-first-year period be divided equally between attendance of regular college courses and English courses designed especially for them. This article describes the English course hurriedly prepared to meet this specific situation. The general guidelines were: (1) the English teaching section of the scheme should be heavily, though not totally, oriented to the preparation of materials in English for Special Purposes, and (2) grouping should be according to scientific specialty and not according to proficiency in English. The first term was devoted largely to passive work taught in 5 two-hour sessions each week: (1) kernel lessons intermediate, (2) basic English for  Science (BEFS), (3) BEFS, (4) continuation of orientation and social English, and (5) listening/reading materials. The materials and activities used for each of these sessions are described. The cloze procedure was used extensively as was the language laboratory for listening exercises. Reading and writing skills were not tackled systematically until term 2, when the 10 weekly hours were divided as follows: (1) kernel lessons, (2) aural comprehension, (3) BEFS, (4) oral production, and (5) reading comprehension and writing. Students will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis focusing on the study skills needed by a first-year undergraduate in science. (TL)",

The skills a student needs in order to achieve success in a science are analyzed as: (1) discipline-specific--strategies for extracting and patterning the data in a particular field, (2) general organizational--for presenting data in written and iconic form, and (2) linguistic skills. In a second-language situation, the teacher cannot assume that students come equipped with these skills; he must, therefore, teach them in addition to the scientific content of the course. This places constraints on the organization of the course and on  the materials that can be used successfully. High-level science materials, such as lectures and lesson notes, modifiable to fit the level of the students' abilities. What seems to be called for is a set of integrated materials which require increasingly complex communication skills and which provide for individualized learning activities.

The latter, which rates the performance of a student on an absolute standard, makes for an individualized approach. Two kinds of tests are distinguished, the formative, administered during the course of learning, and the summative, which evaluates achievement following a given period of instruction. It is suggested that formative tests be of the criterion-referenced type. A specific testing program is outlined whereby an aptitude test is administered before instruction begins. When instruction begins, testing is tied directly to the teaching process. The advantage of this is knowing immediately which items need more work.  Criterion-referenced testing also de-emphasizes competition, reduces anxiety about learning, and encourages teachers to set realistic and reachable goals, thus helping the less able students. Future language instruction should place greater emphasis on the teaching and testing of communicative competence. The results of an experiment conducted at the University of Illinois to determine the effectiveness of incorporating competence training into the learning process reinforce the importance of teaching communicative competence. A suggested foreign language testing program follows the article. (CLK)",

The basic procedure of parsing is described. The discussion of the principal systems is based on the idea that &quot;meaning is procedures,&quot; that is, that the procedures of application give a parsed structure its significance. Natural language systems should be content- rather than structure-motivated, i.e. they should be concerned with linguistic problems revealed by parsing rather than with the relation of the proposed structure of the system to the structures of other systems. Within this framework, Winograd's understanding system, SHRDLU, is described and discussed, as are the second generation systems of Simmons, Schank, Colby and  Wilks. A subsequent discussion compares all these systems. Concluding remarks outline immediate problems, including the need for a good memory model and the use of texts, rather than individual example sentences, for investigation. (CLK)",

The present volume contains the first two parts of the report, the third being submitted separately. The first part includes chapters 1-5, the second 6-9. Chapter 1 sets forth the sociocultural setting for the study, while chapter 2 establishes a sociolinguistic framework for viewing the linguistic diversity of the region. Chapters 3 and 4 outline the main features of Appalachian English, focusing on phonological and grammatical levels of language organization. Educational considerations are discussed in chapter 5. Part One is intended primarily as a reference work for educators,  particularly reading specialists, language arts specialists and speech pathologists. In Part Two, several select features of Appalachian English are examined in more technical detail; this section is intended primarily for the professional linguist. Chapter 6 deals with &quot;A-prefixing,&quot; and chapter 7 with irregular verbs. Chapter 8 discusses the perfective &quot;done,&quot; and chapter 9 deals with subject-verb concord. Appendix A provides a sample of two interview questionnaires, one used for adults and one for adolescents. Appendix B consists of a sample informant interview, and Appendix C gives a complete list of the informants who participated in the project, including their age, sex, and occupation.

        "description":"The ergative construction is characteristic of all 37 languages of the Caucasian group. After definition of &quot;subject&quot; and &quot;object,&quot; a summary is given of 13 Caucasian intransitive and transitive sentence-types, with respect to the case forms of their subjects and objects. The principal &quot;symptoms&quot; of ergativity are: (1) subject in an oblique (ergative) case; (2) object in the nominative (or absolutive) case; (3) verb agrees in class and/or person and number with the object; and (4) in N.W. Caucasian only, pronominal prefixes in the sequence O-S-V. Numerous deviations are discussed. Arguments are presented against the once-popular view that the ergative construction is &quot;really&quot; a passive construction. In the N. Caucasian languages, the ergative transitive construction  systematically contrasts with a nominative transitive construction (subject in nominative, object in nominative or oblique case). The ergative construction highlights the effect of the verbally expressed activity on the object; the nominative construction highlights the activity of the subject. Ergativity in all ergative languages can be classified as Functional (i.e., in meaningful contrast with a non-ergative transitive construction), as in N. Caucasian, Chukot-Kamchadal, Eskimo-Aleut, or Formal (i.e., as a mere obligatory formal feature of transitive sentences), as in Georgian and the Iranian, Dardic, and Indic ergative languages.

The purpose of this paper is thus twofold: first, to study their distribution, and second, to account for their co-occurrence or nonco-occurrence in the V-V constructions involved. It is claimed here that with the help of the semantic properties of the V-V constructions, we can easily predict where they can be inserted, and where they must be excluded. (Author)",

Characteristics of graduate enrollment examined were enrollment status (full- and part-time), distribution among fields of science, level of study, citizenship, control of institution (public or private), sex of students, type and sources of major support. Postdoctoral utilization by field of science was examined in terms of type and source of support. Trend data for the period 1967-73 were derived by linking the 1972-73 data to  statistics provided for 1967-71 on National Science Foundation traineeship applications. Findings include these: In 1973 doctorate-granting institutions enrolled 218,000 full- and part-time students, with full-time enrollment (164,300) down 3 percent from 1972 and part-time enrollment up 4 percent. Decline in full-time enrollment since 1967 was 5 percent, with students dependent on federal support down 40 percent. Graduate departments utilized 16,400 postdoctoral appointees in 1973 (a rise of 31 percent from 1967 to 1972), 69 percent of whom received federal support. Detailed statistical tables are included.

In 1974, 56% or 24,188 of the total undergraduate enrollment at these institutions were residents of North Carolina. The state has a policy of general financial assistance to the private sector amounting to $200 each academic year for each full-time resident undergraduate enrolled in these institutions. The institutions are obligated to match these funds. This report provides an overview of the private colleges and universities and the present state policy toward them as well as the contributions of these private institutions to the state while outlining their needs. These institutions have made it clear that state assistance should be in the form of aid to students and not aid to the institutions. The report  recommends the establishment of a Tuition Assistance Grant program which would provide aid to needy North Carolina undergraduates to assist them in meeting tuition charges to attend an accredited private college or university which they select and to which they are admitted. The funds appropriated for the Tuition Assistance Grant program would respond to the problem of enrollment difficulties caused by the tuition differential between public and private institutions.

Generally, financial aid offices did not consider race, sex, athletic ability, academic record, and alumni relationship of student applicants. However, some financial aid officers were influenced by one or more variables in addition to need, such as age, class in school, and place of residence. The present process for allocating loan funds to educational institutions is  apparently not equitable. Some institutions receive all or more than the total funds they need to meet the needs of their students while others receive substantially less than their actual need.

Discrimination in the right of access to higher education is cited for the 42 percent of the state residents who attend independent colleges and universities in the commonwealth; i.e., those not state-owned and taxpayer subsidized. Public and private institutions are equated in terms of goals and actual costs, but differences are cited in terms of price to the student. Statistics are reported to indicate the economic benefit to the state of private institutions as well as the economic burden carried by the institutions themselves. Comparative graphs are presented on expenditures such as maintenance,  retirement and insurance costs, cost-of-living adjustments, fuel deficiency, debt service, and taxpayer/student expenditures. The Massachusetts House Bill 2882, which provides an apportionment to each qualified Massachusetts high school graduate that the student can take to the college of his choice within the commonwealth, is supported with modifications recommended. It is concluded that if the General Court continues to restrict its subsidy of public higher education to the state sector and continues to discriminate against the independent sector, it will eventually destroy a significant part of the system of quality education in Massachusetts.

The first is the striking change in population trends; the declining birth rate reached a low of 15.6 live births per 1,000 population in 1972. The second factor examined is the apparent shift in attitude toward college going among the traditional group of college-age persons. These two factors will obviously not in themselves account for all of the changes that will take place in higher education before the year 2000, but numbers of students who finally enroll will always establish the context within which institutions must develop strategy, and will set the parameters within which changes will be effected. In reporting on the recent literature  in these areas, the report makes no attempt to establish specific projections for any group of institutions, much less any individual institution. It does, however, examine the predictions of several other sources. The report examines the traditional pool from which college enrollments are drawn and the expanding college going pool, the \"new student,\" and its impact on both public and private institutions.

Longitudinal studies are reviewed that indicate the gap within the generation of young people in 1969 was greater than the gap between the generations. The campus was becoming highly politicized, with a large proportion of students sharing the views of the minority group of revolutionaries. A 1971 study noted a change in mood, away from personal despair and depression. The 1973 students seemed more prepared to accept or at least work within the established political lines and had more confidence in society. Striking differences are noted between entering in 1966 and those in 1973, with increases in interest  in business fields and decreases in engineering. Increasing numbers of women and minority students are cited. Problems in the job market are seen, and opportunities in the 1970s are outside the traditional professions, concentrated instead in government administrative and management fields, business management, sales, advertising, and other service industries. Developments in student attrition rates are also discussed. (JMF)",

        "description":"Changing curriculum involves more than effecting variations in content of particular courses; it involves the sum total of experiences afforded the student in the pursuit of his educational objectives. Rather than debate whether what is happening is new or different or evidence of change, this review of the current literature reports what is being written about curriculum and leaves it to the reader to make judgments about degrees or kinds of change. There is an attempt to compare program elements over time and to analyse these trends toward change in terms of three kinds of responses by institutions that have resulted in new programs: (1) the creation of new institutions; (2) the transformation of existing institutions as in the &quot;cluster colleges&quot; and the&quot;college-within-college&quot; as well as totally reorganized colleges; and (3) change through accretion and attrition, i.e., the addition of new programs or emphases and the droping of old programs. The transformation is illustrated by gradual changes and developments in general education, in the areas of concentration or majors; the development of new areas of concentration; the changes in academic calenders to allow for more course experimentation; and procedural changes, such as new grading systems, variations in advising, development of contract and performance-based courses, and others.

Further, the report discusses categories of expenditures and what institutions have attempted to do in becoming more efficient through instituting economies. Finally, the report turns to general issues of policy as these relate to both income and expenditures, and notes what several national commissions have suggested as possible approaches to dealing with the situation.

Barring the sudden and unexpected restoration of basic science to public favor, there seems to be no way of restoring equilibrium between the demand and the supply in astronomical employment without a sharp curtailment in the rate of production of new Ph.D. 's. The problem will probably not be solved even if the rate of supply is reduced by one or two factors. The committee has recommended a number of steps that might be taken to increase the number of positions available to astronomers, particularly in college teaching and in industry, where astronomers are under-represented as compared with scientists in other branches of  physics. The report is intended to be a guide for students preparing to enter graduate school about their chances of finding employment, and also to encourage faculty members to take appropriate steps to broaden and diversify the training of their graduate students.

This report constitutes a significant phase in the Common Core of Data (CCD) program which is a major new concept of the National Center for Education Statistics. CCD provides an integrated and interlocking system of educational statistics to meet federal, state, local, and institutional needs for planning and management. Federal policy issues include providing equal educational opportunities, meeting manpower needs, promoting recurrent education, stimulating educational diversity, and encouraging research in the national interest. The data needs reflect the broad dispersal of federal programs supporting postsecondary  education and the important policy issues underlying them. The identified data needs call for varied collection methodologies, including surveys, samples, and case studies. NCES is suggested to provide a data coordination role as a national center with expanded operations and influence, as well as coordination with states and the postsecondary education community of associations, institutions, and individual researchers.

Since the programs are largely efforts to explore and demonstrate effective teaching and learning not present in traditional postsecondary education, the appropriateness of judging their financial right to life by traditional standards is questionable. This study was commissioned to determine the nature and extent of restraints imposed by state and federal funding formulas, guidelines and regulations on emerging, innovative, time- and place-free opportunities in postsecondary education. Administrators from several nontraditional colleges and programs were interviewed in person and 300 questionnaires were mailed to  others, with 134 responding. The analysis of these questionnaires revealed much frustration with state and federal funding policies and specific funding and approval problems. It also produced a number of proposed solutions to these problems. Largely these centered on restructuring formulas and guidelines to take into account the special features and purposes of nontraditional education ranging from adding flat or percentages increments specifically for nontraditional program development to finding a more equitable unit of measure than the credit hour.

The purpose of the project was to gather data relative to the post-graduation vocational and educational activities and future plans of the graduates for the five years 1968-1972. Part 1 of the study outlines the results of a questionnaire sent to the graduates as well as input obtained from the school's director and the Medical Center's assistant director for Patient Services. Part 2 of the study reviews the responses obtained to determine potential implications for the curriculum and to  formulate recommendations based upon comments made by the graduates. The questionnaire contained a list of 22 nursing functions and two open-ended questions. The ratings of the nursing functions and responses to the open-ended questions provided the information for the recommendations. (JMF)",

The strategy for assessing attrition using these three quantitative techniques is discussed as are qualitative phone interviews. The attrition rate in terms of a temporal count was 28 percent. Phone interviews with 93 leavers in early 1975 showed that the dropout tends to be younger than currently enrolled students, single, working full time in a lower status occupation and enrolled as a half-time student. Students left the college primarily because of personal reasons or job related problems. Poor student-mentor relationships was the top college related reason. Additional findings on the effects of ESC experience, suggestions for improvement, and  policy implications for educators and administrators are discussed. A multiple perspectives strategy for examining policy implications of the data is illustrated. (Author)",

Tasks facing African universities involve the design and operation of the educational system, especially in regard to entrance qualifications and their relationship to academic standards. African scholars should address themselves to all problems and should have sufficient working contact with policy making and executing agencies to ensure that their academic findings will influence practical events. Since African countries are less developed economically, problems arise in relation to cost and cost effectiveness. The high cost of universities underlines the reasonableness of government concern to see that the  choice of university curriculum reflects national needs, but a balance between practical requirements and those of intellectual inquiry must be maintained.

These are institutions whose basic reason for existence is itself political; in other words, political parties, the legislature, and the executive institutions of government. The second category is that of precipitatory institutions. These are not directly political in their immediate purposes, but could have an impact on politics far greater than that exerted by some of the primary political institutions. The university in Africa is a precipitatory institution of a different but still decisive kind. While the pure sciences augment the riches of scholarship, and the applied sciences promote technological improvements and socioeconomic welfare, the  humanities have to grapple with problems of values and identity and are therefore the most directly connected with the process of political development. The two most serious political crises facing Africa are the crisis of national integration and the crisis of political legitimacy. In the process of national integration a university may help to forge a shared sense of historical identity. The university's role in resolving the crisis of legitimacy should limit itself to the task of creating a climate of political and intellectual sophistication. (Author/KE)",

To economists the role of higher education in the promotion of economic and social development belongs to the field of economics of education, a field that together with wealth economics constitutes the rapidly growing branch of economics of human resources. The three basic functions of universities are in satisfying the needs of society for high-level manpower, undertaking scientific research, and assuming a leading role in the promotion of change in social values and institutions in the  desired directions. Developing nations vary widely in supply, structure, and state of development of institutions of higher education available to them. Consequently, the content of what constitutes the particular policies that ought to be followed in a particular case will vary from one country to the next.

The university should be a center where one would elaborate an expression specific to Africa, actualize the values of its traditions, and draw inspiration from the African past. Instead of artificially accepting an imposing foreign culture, the university should be fit to rediscover or create from African experience a new culture, in other words, a new way of expression. It is the task of the university to solve the much debated question of  the cultural unity of Africa, a question essential for the political development of African unity. An institution is recommended that would specialize in applied research to further develop the drive to restore and stimulate culture that will give back to the peoples of Africa a sense of their identity and to the community their historical destiny.

In the ABS open system, more than one manufacturer can supply each of the components of the building system. This is felt to offer the best potential for reducing construction, maintenance, and remodeling costs and for improving the usefulness of academic facilities. The systems approach provides a high degree of coordination of the building components. It takes into consideration standard and repetitive features, life costs  of complex buildings, adaptability of station utilization, tradeoffs of higher first costs versus lower life costs, and shorter construction time. The major innovation in the fixed elements is the space module, which is a repetitive unit used throughout the structure and which reduces construction costs by making possible the use of standard units of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning to service each module.

A Program Classification Structure (PCS) is described which facilitates the concepts of program budgeting. PCS provides cost centers for the preliminary and support activities of an institution. If an institution determines the cost of instruction in each discipline, degree program costs may be obtained by allowing the dollars to flow from the discipline cost centers to the various degree program cost centers in proportion to the  flow of credit hours from disciplines to degree programs. Program output indicators and information exchange procedures are also used, as are student flow models that project enrollments by major and by student level within the institution. Using a program budget, decision makers can compare the costs of various alternatives and weigh these costs against their anticipated benefits. (LBH)",

A second leadership task is to increase institutional  sensitivity to minor irritations; a third, to define goals and make more effective use of the resources of the institution in reaching them. Other areas of leadership concern public accountability in the use of resources, collective bargaining stresses, the development of coordinating and planning groups as extra campus levels, and manpower planning and development in universities.

        "description":"Decreasing enrollments of American colleges and universities of all types and geographic regions are described that have resulted in many deficits since 1968-69. Contributing to the financial squeeze are inflation, unionization, and sharp reductions in the level of scholarships and research support. Studies of four-year liberal arts colleges confirm the continued growth and frequency of deficits, despite much publicized and feared budget cuts. Policies of raising tuition, increasing the total amount of financial aid, and setting higher admission goals had the net effect of spending more money and attracting fewer students. These problems are seen to be not merely financial but managerial difficulties. Key trends are outlined that must be considered in making five or six-year  plans, with annual reviewing and updating. Suggestions are offered for cooperative efforts on the part of admissions staffs, business offices, and students to carry out appropriate policies that will help solve the financial problems. (LBH)",

The Committee concluded that gains from endowments need not be treated as principal of NACUBO sees this doctrine as being erroneous because it arises out an incomplete reading of the conflicting historical legal opinions regarding charitable trusts and faculty interpretations of those opinions. The evidence presented shows that colleges and universities must retain realized endowment gains as principal. The controversy continues into a discussion of whether the college or university holds the funds as absolute owner or as trustee, and the  accounting principals that must be applied in each case as well as the implications of each argument. Additionally, the discussion continues to whether or not realized gains from an endowment should be treated as income or capital gains for accounting and tax purposes. NACUBO looks for a conclusive court ruling in some future test case to prove the legitimacy of their arguments. (JMF)",

In terms of the relevancy to college fiscal administrators, five major conditions are discussed: (1) Students will no longer tolerate the secrecy that surrounds the allocation process and will demand a say in budget and allocation decisions; (2) Minority and disadvantaged groups desiring to raise themselves will demand a fuller share of opportunities and a reordering of fiscal priorities and, ultimately, an expanded state and federal support for higher education: (3) With the possible exception of many of the newer community colleges, the 1970s will be a  period of low growth rate for colleges and universities that will pose decidedly unfamiliar operating situations for administrators in search of internal efficiency and a closer examination of priorities. (4) The press for greater efficiency and economy is likely to give impetus to the formation of collective bargaining units on the campus. (5) The business officer must meet the challenge of the seventies with new technologies both in the direction of efficiency and economy and of a new pattern of human relationships. (JMF)",

A comparison of past experiences with unionization both in academe and industry reveals that administrations must determine their human resources policies and objectives before dealing with the unionization question if the question is to be dealt with effectively. There are four basic developmental phases of union-management relations that are explored in some depth: (1) the period before there are any signs of union organizing efforts or union interest among the employees; (2) the period when the rumors of union interest start circulating and handbills or other union literature begin to appear; (3) the period when a union has formally  requested recognition as the collective bargaining agent for employees; (4) the period when the administration discusses and negotiates with the union and then lives with the agreements reached. Developments from outside must be recognized as impacting on colleges and universities as when federal pay scales are altered and the impact is felt throughout the labor market. (JMF)",

Ten colleges, representing a variety of computer needs and a diversity of preference in choice of computer vendor, configuration, and mode of operation, participated in an experiment to find if new \"minicomputers\" might be able to provide instructional computing support that even the smallest colleges could afford. A basic conclusion, expressed unanimously by the ten somewhat varied undergraduate institutions, is that a minicomputer system is the best-buy source of computing power for most instructional activities. The combination of low cost, constant availability control, and the many advantages of an on-campus facility  make the minicomputer a preferred choice over known off-campus alternatives.

The system has three main features, which are a new conception of the relationship between investment and education, an ideological basis and the fact that it is a planned system. The system, subordinated to the needs of the economy, is specialized, and has a diversity of forms--day, evening, and correspondence courses, and a variety of educational institutions. In attempting to formulate a few realistic conclusions, it is important to take into account the constraints that have affected the development of higher education in the USSR. These constraints were largely the result of demographic growth in the  USSR, though they were also influenced by the determinism that follows certain political and economic choices. The Soviet Union is now paying the price of the diversity of institutions and networks initially devised. Such a system rapidly becomes cramped once new stimuli no longer reach its central nervous system. (Author/KE)",

All open schools have one thing in common: they are to a greater or lesser extent efforts to expand the freedoms of learners. The trend towards open forms of learning cannot be separated from the extraordinary efforts in our times to create, if not a new America or a new humanity, at least better situations out of which an improved human condition may evolve. But the open learning trend is also related to a number of other phenomena--social, economic, political, technological, demographic, and educational, which has important implications for standard, conventional education, as well as for  independent study. The implications seem to be significant in seven areas: mission; operations; student body; academic, curriculum, instruction, learning and reward system; access; diffusion and communications systems; and institutional support. The open learning trend is the child of independent study. It affects its parents in significant ways. This child, in fact, may win the acceptance so long denied to its parents. (Author/KE)",

        "description":"Despite the wealth of information available about methods of instructional development, the practitioner still faces a major task of adapting these to any local situation. Precisely because instructional development is a \"people process,\" most developers must work through the value systems and priorities set by clients rather than imposing their own. In this process, the clarity and logic of idealized instructional development models often become obscured by local variations in budget, personnel, facilities, and viewpoints. The question for the developers, then, is how to go about finding the best match between the principles they know must be followed and the perceptions and constraints of the people with whom they will be working. A way that looks promising is establishing a  faculty ad hoc committee to study and make recommendations for developing and producing specific instructional media, without immediate reference to the more general, total instructional development program. Although attempts are indeed made to sort materials by the degree of their complexity and the assumed expertise of the viewer, the fact is that the same materials may be profitably used in different ways by creative faculty in several situations.

Such explanations involve reference to family socialization, university conditions, societal-based issues, and to the possibility of social change. Sociological explanations appear to focus on the causation, alternative explanations, and continuities. From such a perspective, the student movement can be seen to arise initially from the peculiar juxtaposition of intense and numerous social issues with a special kind of primary socialization that addresses itself to values affecting these issues and that resulted in an alienated youth culture. In these terms, a renewed interest in activism by students might be anticipated, but not until continued  affluence is assured or denied, and not until the possibility of repression either becomes greater than it is or ceases to exist at all.

It is concluded that academic freedom and university autonomy are indispensable to the well-being of a liberal democratic society. The university, as a part of such a society, must use its freedom and autonomy in a responsible manner. The problem becomes one of mutual understanding and trust. What disturbs academics at the present time is the apparent lack of understanding of academic freedom with a consequent lack of  faith and trust in the universities. Such freedom is seen as a necessary condition of the highest efficiency and the proper progress of academic institutions, and encroachments upon their liberty would diminish their efficiency and hinder their development.

The eight sections of the inventory are General  Information About the State, Student Access, Manpower Programs, Enrollments, Finances, Staff, and Facilities. Also included with the inventory (including an index, glossary, and bibliography) is \"An Overview and Guide to the Use of the Statewide Measures Inventory,\" containing information on its origins, general structure, and possible uses. Although its primary target audience is policy makers and analysts in state agencies, it is anticipated that postsecondary education institutions and national organizations also will find it of interest.

        "description":"The federal government has traditionally relied on a variety of private accrediting bodies and state chartering and licensing authorities for determining eligibility and exercising direct supervision and consumer protection in education. As Federal financial assistance directly to students has expanded (3 million students received $6.4 million in 1974), the diffuse and uneven system of approval and control of educational insitutions, programs, and student financial aid by &quot;voluntary&quot; agencies has become confused and overburdened. As an aid to legislators, the Eligibility Task Force of the Postsecondary Education Convening Authority synthesized numerous recent studies and dialogues in the field of eligibility and accreditation. This was done to define key terms, sort out the  interests of the various parties involved, delineate the current issues, offer conceptual models of alternative eligibility systems, and summarize some proposed solutions, including revisions based on the present system, which places heavy reliance for determining institutional eligibility on private accrediting associations. This also includes plans to separate eligibility judgments from accreditation. Appendices to this summary of the Task Force findings include principal participants in the present eligibility system, a review of statistics pertaining to the Guaranteed Student Loan Program (GSLB) and the Basic Opportunity Grant Program (BOGS), and a list of issues discussed at the U.S. Office of Education National Invitational Conference on Institutional Eligibility.

Recommendations are made for changes in the current treatment of students' assets in the Parents' Confidential Statement processing system. It is proposed that the current treatment of a student's social security benefits be modified to provide for their inclusion in family income rather than as a student resource. No changes are being  proposed in the current treatment for veterans' benefits (i.e., vocational-rehabilitation payments, war-orphan benefits). These are specifically student benefits and are made available to meet the specific costs of postsecondary education, and their inclusion as a part of student resources is believed to be appropriate.

It is shown that: (1) scholarship respondents were divided about evenly between men and women, with slightly more men in the grant respondent groups; (2) the grant group includes substantially more commuters (54 percent) than the scholarship group, which is related to the greater percentage of grant respondents enrolled in public two-year colleges; (3) both scholarship and grant group distributions are skewed toward the freshman and sophomore levels; and (4)  decreasing percentages of grant respondents attend private four-year colleges over the period studied, with a shift from private four-year colleges to public two-year colleges. The distribution is more stable for scholarship respondents. These findings are discussed in terms of the impact of awards on access and choice of college, theory and reality of financing a college education, opinions and attitudes toward financial aid. The findins can also be applied to operational decisions regarding student financial aid administration and policies. (LBH)",

        "description":"The Higher Education Amendment of 1968 provided for support services on college and university campuses to facilitate the progress of disadvantaged young people (from families within the national poverty criteria or the physically handicapped). Three years later an evaluation of the special service programs (typically including specially staffed activities such as counseling, tutoring, remedial study, and ethnic identity activities) was conducted to determine effects of students' progress, satisfaction, and perceptions. Methodology included review of the literature, census of institutions, and collection of questionnaire and interview data from program directors and students. The interview data was obtained from a national sample selected from the 190 projects, involving more  than 50,000 students, which were in operation in the 1971-72 school year. Major conclusions are there is no evidence that availability of or participation in support services systematically improves performance and satisfaction with college over that which may be expected from previous academic performance; institutional differences account more for differences in disadvantaged student success and satisfaction than do supporting services; in understanding behavior and attitude, race is more critical than poverty or physical handicaps; and forces to equalize opportunity seem to be working better for poor whites and blacks than for poor Orientals, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Native Americans, or other ethnic minorities.

Major findings: About 14 percent of enrolled undergraduates are estimated to be disadvantaged, with considerable variability among percentages in different types of colleges and geographic regions. Half of the institutions reported special support programs, one in three with federal support, one in seven state or local, one in seven institutional, and one in 20 private foundation. Federal funding has been given to those institutions with larger proportions of disadvantaged students.

The major conclusions of the study are that scholarship and grant aid do promote equal educational opportunity, and that with equalization of public-private tuition levels through the aid grants, students will favor private institutions in large numbers. Three major failings of state scholarship programs are identified: (1) lack of consideration of all education-related expanses; (2) unrealistic expectations regarding student contributions to educational costs; and (3)  failure to adjust income levels indicating disadvantagement. It is concluded that the use of scholarship and grant aid as a mode of financing higher education is on the increase, but that there needs to be more data before the true impact of such programs as the Basic Opportunity Grants can be determined. Further research concerning other types of direct student aid, such as loans, and for longitudinal studies, is advocated. (LBH)",

The goals of the student unrest in the late sixties have not been fully reached, although students have gained more influence than anticipated. The present situation shows that the absolution of the full professors has disappeared in most member countries and that the power structure is based upon a certain balance between different groups. Many of the student leaders of 1968 are now employed by the universities, and their new roles are speculative. Questionnaire samples are included. (LBH)",

Grievance procedures have two related functions; to determine whether an injury alleged by the grievant was the result of an error in an institution's policies and procedures or their administration, and if error is established, to determine an equitable redress for the grievant. In the light of the Title IX regulations specifically and of changing social and legal  standards more generally, colleges and universities should reexamine their grievance mechanisms with particular attention to the following questions: (1) Is the structure of traditional grievance procedures adequate to today's requirements? (2) Who should participate if the procedures are to operate equitably and promptly? (3) Can informal grievance procedures be strengthened? (Author)",

The major purposes of the study are: (1) the formulation of a workable definition of Black Studies, (2) the identification and selection of a representative group of programs, and (3) the identification of major issues associated with the development of Black Studies programs along with alternative approaches to these issues. In addition, it was also accepted as a reasonable supposition that the findings of the study and the literature associated with it could be distilled into a useful and practical set of guidelines that would be  helpful to persons developing or evaluating Black Studies (Afro-American) programs in higher education. The Task Force formulated the major issues through discussion and interpretation of: (1) structural relationship to the institution; (2) theoretical focus and objectives; (3) financing; (4) staffing; (5) enrollment pattern; and (6) identification of major issues. The questions raised tended to probe rather deeply into the nature of Black Studies, but they also brought into view many other related issues. (Author/KE)",

About 55 state agency staff members from all over the east coast attended an inservice workshop that attempted to measure some of the new dimensions of postsecondary education and to equip participants with effective means to confront related daily problems. There were six content modules which included formal presentations, illustrations, demonstrations, and discussion: \"Information Related Problems in State Planning\" by T. Edward Hollander; \"Problems and Issues Related to the Data Game\" by Robert Huff; \"External Interest Group Impingements\" by Richard Millard; \"Problems Clinic--Where Do We Turn for Help?\" (a panel of eight  representatives from national resource organizations--American College Testing Programs, Southern Regional Education Board, College Entrance Examination Board, American Association for Higher Education, ERIC Higher Education Clearinghouse, and U.S. Office of Education); \"State Agency Relationships\" by Patrick McCarthy and John Porter; \"Dealing with Dwindling Resources\" by S.V. Mortorana; \"Problems and Issues Related to Legislative Process--The Federal Dimension\" by Robert C. Andringa; \"New Assumptions for State-Level Leadership in the Future\" by Robert B. Mautz. All workshop presentations are included along with a post-workshop analysis by DeForest Trautman that summarizes activities and outcomes. (JT)",

The goal of the study was to describe off-campus students including their perceived needs so that their input could be considered in decision-making processes. The results of the questionnaires were analysed to examine the students' views on the following issues: (1) the potential use of facilities on campus; (2) the desirability of a service and programming organization for commuters; (3) the relative importance of a variety of programs for commuters; (4) the degree of usage of various means of communication; (5)  the amount of time spent on campus by commuters; and (6) the desirability of social functions planned for commuters.

Such support for higher education currently amounts to $3.4 billion, exclusive of research and veterans educational benefits under the GI bill. Two roles are identified for federal support of higher education: (1) the role of increasing access to postsecondary education by concentrating resources on direct financial aid to students on the basis of need; and (2) the role of encouraging a diversity of educational programs that will be responsive to the particular educational needs of citizens. The Administration's view is reaffirmed that the best way to achieve these goals is through student aid rather than general financial support for institutions. It is suggested  that the major part of federal budget resources should be devoted to student grants rather than student earnings subsidies and student loans. The Basic Grant program should be the foundation of higher education legislation, which would permit a maximum grant of $1400 for all classes of students. Suggestions are offered for perfecting the access role of this program. Coordination of federal and state programs is also recommended. (LBH)",

The survey taken early in the senior school year indicates intentions for further study. The current sample is spread over 461 areas comprising 923 counties and independent cities with coverage in each of the 50 States and the District of Columbia. Many students appear unsure of their future plans: about 27 percent of the high school seniors said they may enter college and 44 percent said they definitely planned to go to college. Although the proportion of male high school seniors planning for college declined somewhat, there was no corresponding increase among  them in plans for vocational-technical school enrollment. Female high school sneiors were more certain of their college plans than were the men. There was some evidence that black high school seniors were less likely to make definite plans for entering college. (Author/KE)",

(2) Students who rely on scholarships or grants increase their chances of completing college, but only slightly, while students relying on savings or the G.I. bill increase their chances of dropping out. (3) Participating in work-study programs increases chances of completing college, particularly among students from middle-income families. (4) Students who receive support for college expenses from their parents are more likely to complete their education. (5) Students who are married when they enter  college have a good chance of completing their education if their spouses provide major financial support, but dropout chances are substantial if spouses provide no support or only minimal support.

Labor has delegated to 11 other agencies--including the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW)--the responsibility for performing compliance reviews of contractors' facilities and enforcing Labor's guidelines. HEW, however, has made minimal progress in making sure that colleges and universities have accepted affirmative action programs and are in compliance with the Executive action programs. HEW has not consistently sent required \"show-cause\" notices to colleges and universities whose affirmative action programs it has found to be not in compliance, it has not begun sanctions against these institutions, and has not  generally performed preaward reviews. HEW negotiates and conciliates with colleges and universities over prolonged periods rather than requiring them to prepare acceptable affirmative action programs within the time specified under Labor guidelines. Neither Labor nor HEW has identified all colleges and universities that have Government contracts and are subject to the program. HEW has not provided a uniform nationwide training program for its compliance officers. Recommendations follow. (Author/KE)",

This paper describes a proposed system for a uniform methodology for measuring parental ability to pay for postsecondary educational costs for consideration by the membership of the CSS Assembly. In setting forth this proposal, a brief review of the CSS need analysis system is given. This comparative analysis demonstrates the substantial aspects of the CSS need analysis rationale that have been incorporated into the proposal outlined. The proposed methodology brings into being several characteristics long considered desirable by many  financial aid administrators and agencies awarding student aid funds -- namely, a more simplified system in which the methodology can be readily understood by the users and in which accuracy of information is retained.

An adequate theory of faculty development will involve a sophisticated understanding of the process of professionalization and an integrating theory of human development. Approaches, in terms of strategies and tactics, must respond to the interests and needs of students, faculty, and society. Deep qualitative objectives defy quantification but remain unquestionably important. The case for facutly development includes the faculty need to be prepared to work with new students in new places, to be made acquainted with alternative modes of teaching and learning, to be more sophisticated in their knowledge of the  workings of the institution, and to become more conscious of the end of the learning experience for which teaching is a means. Behind the case for faculty development is the concern for institutional survival and for the needs of the larger society. Clearly we need more than the psychological-developmental approach, which deals mainly with the strengthening of the individual, even as we need more than the administrative-bureaucratic approach, which measures development by institutional criteria.

        "description":"Cost analysis is not solely the concern of the technically proficient analyst. Determining what uses are appropriate for cost information is a broad policy issue in which academic administrators, department chairmen, and faculty have a tangible interest and should have at least a conceptual grasp of this subject. It is particularly important to appreciate what the technical experts can accomplish with cost analysis and what the problems are. Placing cost analysis in its appropriate context has needed to be done for some time. It involves the examination of these concerns: (1) the recent increase on pressures for cost analysis and the motivations behind these pressures; (2) the guidelines for cost analysis that have been established at NCHEMS; (3) the directions that the  development of cost analysis procedures should take in the future. Appropriately or not, the growth of cost analysis in postsecondary education over the past decade has taken place largely in the context of accountability, and more recently in an environment of resource acquisition frustrations. Cost information is increasingly important in planning, budgeting, budget control, and evaluation of performance. (Author)",

The existing system of postsecondary governance is discussed, followed by a study of the legal constraints on the functions of and interrelationships among the triad elements. The status quo regarding postsecondary educational governance is concluded to be unacceptable. Immediate goals for the triad are shown to be: increased understanding of each element's capabilities; sharper emphasis on each element's strong points; cleaner definition of each function; and better division, of power among triad elements must be maintained if the triad concept is to succeed in the long run. Educational consumer protection is one of the primary issues whose  solution requires an intelligible division of function among triad elements. All three elements of the triad will need to participate in eligibility determinations, with balance of power stimulated through increased attention to the legal considerations. (LBH)",

With the new system students can analyze more extensive and realistic data sets and, as a consequence, can devote more time to the concepts of statistics rather than to calculations. Minitab consists of a worksheet (normally 200 rows by 50 columns) and about 130 free format commands which provide a wide variety of capabilities. The system is in current use not only in  academic settings but in industrial environments as well. Minitab is written in machine compatible FORTRAN IV and can be implemented on a variety of computers. Examples of a paired t-test, a data analysis, an illustration of the concept of a limit, a simulation, and a polynomial regression with data transformation are provided to show the ease and flexibility of Minitab II.

During the last 25 years, there have been two strands in library administration. The older, human relations approach allowed individuals to work in productive cooperation. The scientific approach of the fifties and sixties, on the other hand, emphasized rigid measurement, machines, and statistics. However, the latter approach came to libraries at a time when the management field in general was moving back to the humanistic methods of Douglas McGregor and the motivational psychologists. The newer theories make a major contribution to library administration and  provide a framework for considering the complexity of forces which are having an impact on administration of all kinds; the thrust toward greater democratization and the historical tendency of Americans to want strong, even authoritarian, managers. The magic of administration comes in reconciling these contradictory trends through a careful analysis of the needs of one's institution and the leadership styles appropriate to meet them.

        "description":"Usable data relating to six elements of job satisfaction: work, supervision, people, pay, promotion, and total satisfaction, were collected from 190 of a total sample of 310 librarians, chosen by stratified random sampling techniques from library association membership lists. The librarians, both male and female, represented three types of libraries: public, college/university, and special. One purpose of the research was to determine the differences in job satisfaction between the three types of libraries. Additional questions concerned the variations in satisfaction, if any, attributable to sex and/or to size of the library staff and how librarians' scores compared with population norms on two scales of the data collection instrument, the Job Descriptive Index (JDI). JDI scores  were tested by means of t-tests and analysis of variance. The conclusions drawn were that: (1) Job satisfaction is partially a function of type of library. (2) Special librarians evidence less job satisfaction due to restricted promotional opportunities and greater work stress. (3) Women are generally happier as librarians than men. (4) Librarians are generally more satisfied than other workers. (5) Staff size has little or no effect on job satisfaction. (Author/SL)",

        "description":"The past decade has given us an encouraging number of well-written and appealing children's books which give an authentic picture of the black people in the United States in dramatic text and brilliant illustrations. Indeed, in this period, a whole new sense of realism has come into children's literature which portrays urgent social issues and attacks racial and sexual stereotypes. It is impossible, however, to gauge the exact extent of these trends, since no complete study of children's book publishing has been conducted since 1965. Despite the efforts of many groups, it may be that this flow of newly published interracial books is slowing down. This is one problem, but a more serious one is the apathy with which teachers and, in some cases, librarians treat this whole issue.  Many seem to feel that interracial books are only for black children, and they often display an almost total lack of critical sense in recognizing gross stereotypes. Even those teachers who wish to use these books may face constraints from administrators or the community. The greatest issue in the decade ahead is not getting more interracial books from the publishers--important as that is--but convincing all school staff and parents to bring these books to the children.

The six schools in District 2 utilized a local buying list in their acquisitions, those in District 1 did not. The hypothesis to be tested was that as selection procedures for elementary school libraries become less centralized and standardized, that is, not under the control of a local buying list, the quality of the collections improves because school librarians and teachers are more actively involved in selection. Through visits to the schools, data were collected using questionnaires and structured interviews with teachers and librarians, socioeconomic and reading achievement data  from school records, a comparison of the school's science collection with a standardized list, and acquisition records for the past five years. Results indicated that teachers were not deeply involved in the selection process. The local buying list and exhibits seemed to create more interest in selection. Despite different selection procedures, the science collections in District 1 and District 2 were not appreciably different. (Author/SL)",

A letter was sent to every academic library in the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) to inquire if they engaged in book storage. From the 35 which answered affirmatively, 15 were selected for visitation: the libraries of the universities: California at Berkeley, Chicago, Connecticut, Cornell, Harvard, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Princeton, Purdue, Rice, Texas, Tulane, Wayne State, and Yale. Results indicated that book storage is viewed with distaste, because it inhibits free access to materials and because the costs of weeding, changing library records, and maintaining a storage facility mask its economic advantages. Two alternatives may be available: the conversion  of library materials to a less bulky form or the reduction of individual collections through increased interlibrary cooperation. Although review of the policies and practices of the 15 libraries revealed no firm guidelines for book storage, general suggestions were made for the size, location, and design of a storage facility; record keeping; weeding policies; and retrieval for patrons.

Teachers and researchers were able to retrieve desired data using either the standardized reports or the flexible QUERY program. The paper emphasizes how the data base structure contributes to retrieval speed and output format flexibility, and how the organization of the system facilitates data base updating and student data utilization for monitoring student programs.

The second part asked the faculty members (1) to indicate their use and knowledge of listed current reference works, and (2) to answer questions about their needs, attitudes, and habits in regard to current reference materials. Results indicated that a considerable portion of reference literature has escaped the attention and use of the faculty members, that the faculty tended to use older, better known materials, and that the reason for low use of recent  materials was a lack of knowledge that they existed. The situation could be improved if librarians would make greater efforts to provide faculty with information about new reference books. (LS)",

        "description":"To determine whether contact with computer-assisted instruction (CAI) leads to feelings of \"depersonalization\" and \"dehumanization\" a review was conducted of investigations to explore attitudes toward various modes of computer-based instruction before, during, or after exposure. Evaluation of pertinent factors which influenced attitudes was made through assessment of relevant literature and personal communication with experts associated with CAI projects. Results of studies are compared in table form and recommendations made for future acceptance and implementation of computer-based systems. It is concluded that computer-based instruction is not a threat to humanization, and that it can provide opportunities for increasing effectiveness and personalization of the  instructor-student relationship.

        "description":"A new organization is proposed that will serve as a regional library network for the midwestern United States: the Midwest Regional Library Network (MIDLNET). MIDLNET must meet four requirements in order to assure its success: it must meet the needs of the major academic research libraries in the area, it should be a limited sponsor network, it must allow administrative and decision-making roles to the states involved, and it must have an organizational structure that will not restrict potential services or activities. Conceived as a non-profit corporation run by a board of directors, the organization's five major objectives will be to: (1) reduce per-unit costs of library operations and services, especially through computer applications; (2) provide rapid and efficient delivery  to library users; (3) coordinate and improve library planning and research in the Midwest; (4) provide a vehicle for area participation in federal funding for regional network development; and (5) coordinate a materials preservation program. After its initial three years, MIDLNET's funding will come from user fees and federal aid. (Author/SL)",

Differences in the amount of viewing, program preference, type of program preferred, and typical daily patterns of viewing were items investigated. A questionnaire was used to survey general information, and a program recall list was used to determine the patterns of viewing. The children were grouped by grade level and questioned over a one-week period. The study revealed that children use television as a &quot;time filler&quot; but a majority have a special program in mind that they wish to watch. The average child views approximately 3.7 hours of television per day; boys tend to view television more than girls. Nine statistical tables show  viewing categories and favorite programs by grade level. The questionnaire and program recall list and their results categorized by grade level are appended.

        "description":"A study was conducted for the purpose of clarifying decision alternatives concerning computer-assisted instruction (CAI) in the Merrill Library at Utah State University. The main research questions were: (1) To what extent is the CAI system in use at present? (2) What factors have encouraged or hindered CAI usage? (3) How do people feel about the system? (4) What alternative approaches are available and how feasible are they? To obtain answers to these questions a series of four questionnaires were used to poll students, library staff, faculty users, and prospective users. With the exception of a portion of the library staff, feelings expressed about the CAI system were generally positive. Negative feelings encountered were due to mechanical difficulties. The interview sessions  are summarized; the results of a cost-effectiveness study are presented; and recommendations are made for future CAI use at Merrill Library. It is concluded that the CAI system appears to have considerable support from users and is in a position--through anticipated expansion of terminal usage--to demonstrate a level of operation that is more cost-efficient than has previously been the case. A simplified glossary for CAI, a brief bibliography, and the questionnaires used in the study conclude the report. (Author/KKC)",

The Director describes the Instructional Development Program which is designed to improve the teaching/learning process by developing in professors an interest in learning theory, team teaching, computer-assisted instruction, simulations, seminars, the lecture, and self-paced instruction. The model chosen for implementing the instructional improvement program consists of three stages: (1) awareness level, for which the literature on instructional renewal was surveyed and pertinent information sent to the professor; (2) initiative level, for which minigrants were  awarded to professors who wanted to develop a new teaching strategy; and (3) the instructional development level where participating faculty members are released full time for one quarter to work on a project of their own choosing. The Director concludes that the model has enjoyed modest success, that they are in the process of modifying it, and that they are pleased that it is making some contribution toward improving teaching and learning at a small university.

The model for Instructional Development (ID) consists of four parts: (1) developing faculty awareness; (2) capitalizing on faculty initiative, primarily through small-scale funding under a program of minigrants; (3) conducting faculty support activities where participating faculty members are released full-time for one quarter to work intensively on a project of their own choosing; and (4) working with an entire department to revise particularly important steps in the curriculum for its graduates. Through a series of survey techniques and interviews, this study gathers data about the program as perceived by faculty members. The conclusions are that  there is considerable awareness of the ID programs across campus; that ID should not move entirely from individual-centered to department-centered activities; and that the program is generally held in high regard by USU faculty. One-third of the document consists of instruments used in the survey and responses of participants. (Author/KKC)",

The basic objectives of this research project were to develop a model budget for upper division university libraries and to demonstrate the use of formulas in predicting the anticipated resources necessary to operate and maintain upper division university libraries (UDUL). Existing formulas were examined and evaluated. These, together with the UDUL models, were field tested in application at ten upper division institutions. The UDUL formulas were evaluated by a panel of experts and, finally, conclusions and recommendations were drawn concerning the feasibility and utilization value of a formula designed for  upper division university libraries. The scope of the study was limited to formula budgeting. The UDUL formulas developed cover all major budget categories commonly found in academic libraries, i.e., salaries, materials, and expense. A physical facility formula was excluded, since it is not typically part of an annual operating budget. (Author/SL)",

This is because evaluation and accountability are fraught with decision situations which embody the potential to become political. Among sources of conflict in evaluation and accountability are questions of goals and priorities, economic matters, perceptions of evaluation and accountability by outsiders. Evaluation is also threatening to many school administrators and teachers; thus external evaluators have been employed by many groups wishing to evaluate school programs. The implications for the school media center focus on resources and policy-making, with an informal evaluation of the school library every time a budget is allocated. Librarians must become  knowledgeable in the techniques of evaluation in order to provide policymakers with needed information, but must also learn how to apply these techniques in politically sensitive environments.

The arrival patterns, selected as workable examples from a random sample of the Kardex files at the University of Utah, were graphed against a statistically-based claiming algorithm and two algorithms based on the arrival frequency plus a lag factor. The statistically-based algorithm produced more false claims and usually claimed issues sooner than the algorithm based on the lag factor. The statistically-based algorithm worked best with the medium frequency (monthly, quarterly, etc.) serials and the lag factor algorithm appeared to work best with the long- and  short-frequency (annuals, weekly, etc.) serials.

A self-study guide was formulated, for one group while the other group received the traditional lectures. A posttest was administered to both groups twelve days after formal instruction began, and the results were measured by a statistical analysis of variance test. The results verified the null hypothesis that no difference existed between the two groups; therefore, the lecture and self-study methods could be interchanged for instruction in the use of indexes.

The study was concerned with personnel at all levels, in all types of libraries, media centers, information centers, and similar organizations. Three formal data-gathering processes were developed: a questionnaire to librarians on employment statistics and trends and attitudes toward preservice and continuing library education; a questionnaire for public library board members on their background and perceived education needs; and an interview schedule to use in on-site visits to library/media education programs. Factual data were gathered from a variety of sources for use  in developing recommendations and forecasting trends in enrollment in library schools and in employment opportunities for librarians in the state. The task force made 16 recommendations on credentials, library school curriculum and program articulation, continuing education, and the training of library board members.

It was found that proximity to the parent university and the size of its collection were the prime determinants of special library use.

If the student is to give usable information to the computer, his decisions, planning, and thinking must be perfectly organized; thus, computer programing provides an excellent opportunity for the teacher trainee to acquire cognitive competencies in mathematics, to develop confidence with teacher methods, and to become aware of the benefits and limitations of computer technology. In order to acquaint future teachers with programing as  a pedagogical tool, the University of Massachusetts has introduced a course entitled, &quot;Computer-augmented Teacher Training.&quot; Among the expected goals of the course are to give the prospective teacher: (1) a knowledge of computers; (2) knowledge of algorithms and processes; (3) a knowledge of the applications of computer technology; and (4) experience in computer usage.

This study undertook an investigation of two aspects of the subject headings for juvenile literature: first, an analysis of the vocabulary levels employed in the four systems of subject headings currently in use; second, a specific analysis of the Machine Readable Cataloging (MARC) system and a comparison of how its subject headings for 437 children's books compare with the readability levels for those texts. The four systems were found to be only slightly different. The Library of Congress system rated at grade level 7.7, the Sears system at 6.9, the MARC system at 6.4, and the Library of Congress--Juvenile system 6.0 The comparison between the MARC system subject headings and the readability  level of the corresponding text revealed no relationship between the two. Combining these findings with data concerning the nationwide reading level, it was found that for children reading above the national norm, the subject catalog can provide access to 70 percent of juvenile reading material. Using nationwide comprehension scores, it was estimated that only 29 percent of children's reading material is accessible through the subject catalog. (EMH)",

        "description":"DIALOG, an interactive, computer-based information retrieval language, consists of a series of computer programs designed to make use of direct access memory devices in order to provide the user with a rapid means of identifying records within a specific memory bank. Using the system, a library user can be provided access to sixteen distinct and extensive data banks. Examining four San Francisco Bay Area public libraries, a study, DIALIB, was conducted in an effort to answer the following question: Will the computerized search be wholly adopted by the public library, will there arise a private search service, or will a system of limited public access develop? The first year of the study shows that the library's capacity to do in-depth research in diverse fields has been expanded,  especially in libraries that do not have a large reference collection. The computer search has also shown to be more cost effective than the manual search. The first year of the study has shown that the public is interested; the second year will attempt to discern whether the public is willing to pay for those services. (EMH)",

        "description":"Although an increasingly large proportion of Americans are living to be 65, evidence indicates that little is being done to alleviate the problems of declining health diminishing income, limited mobility and social interaction, and the disproportionately severe effects of inflation upon the elderly. Despite the fact that this age group is becoming increasingly more educated and more politically involved, the libraries have done little to meet their specific needs. The library should not be exclusively guided by the pragmatic principle of selecting books with only broad intellectual appeal; rather, it should recognized that we live in a plural society and that literature should be provided to meet the needs of each sub-culture within the society. This document includes a  bibliography relevant to senior citizens which incorporates these topics: aging; filmographies; and senior power. (EMH)",

Characterization of the patterns of intercultural communication in terms of dyadic phonetic patterns, such as time-imbalance, switching pause, and mismatch analysis, provides a focus for more detailed analysis of international relationships. As phonetic science becomes important to intercultural communication, it  assumes the potential for making contributions to worldwide communication needs. (KS)",

Respondents who said they enjoyed and needed the telephone were found to feel isolated, uneasy, and less in control without it. While 33% used more media during the deprivation period, few wrote more letters. Interpretation of the findings concludes that, though many regard the telephone with ambivalence for its intrusive capacity, most value it strongly for the sense of &quot;symbolic proximity&quot; it provides with scattered family and friends.

        "description":"Recent behavioral research has challenged the relationship between speech organization and the communication variables of source credibility and attitude change. Two hundred eighty-seven students comprising six discussion sections of a basic speech course were exposed to videotaped versions of three separate speech conditions: a 30% disorganized speech, a 60% disorganized speech, and an organized speech. Levels of disorganization were achieved by random relocation of sentences within the text. Data revealed that the organized speech produced significantly greater acceptance of the speaker's position and more positive assessment of the speaker's credibility than did either disorganized version. Credibility ratings did not significantly differ between 30% and 60% disorganization  levels, nor was persuasive ability perceptibly different in either case. Speaker character was also assessed as higher when an organized version was given. While speaker authority was viewed as stronger when an organized speech was presented than when a 30% disorganized speech was given, no significant difference was noted in assessment of authority between organized and 60% disorganized presentations.

The second part of the syllabus  outlines briefly a series of historical problems whose events have been computer programed.

These include the following: (1) it is more expensive to provide public services in urban areas; (2) the socioeconomic characteristics of urban residents place heavy demands on municipal services; (3) city tax bases are failing to keep pace with increasing costs; and (4) suburban areas contribute significantly to the fiscal problems of central cities. There is no basic agreement among those interested in municipal overburden on the best way to relieve the problem. Some suggest that the state assume greater direct responsibility for educational costs, or, alternatively, provide additional state funds for noneducational services to free up local revenues for schools. Other researchers suggest that  the way to solve municipal overburden is by an adjustment to the state school finance formula. It is difficult to assess the impact of municipal overburden on school finance because of definitional and measurement problems, as well as conceptual problems. There is still much for educators, economists, and policy-makers to learn about the complex interrelationships between educational and noneducational finance. (Author/JG)",

The data suggest that the decline in mass attendance and Catholic school enrollment over the past decade is largely a result of changing attitudes toward papal authority in general and the ban on birth control in particular. The church hierarchy has contributed to this decline, the author argues, by preventing lay participation in church decision-making and by basing policy decisions on inaccurate stereotypes of American Catholics. The author asserts that many of the problems now facing  American Catholic schools could be effectively attacked through implementation of an opinion research program that would enable the church hierarchy to be more responsibe to the needs and attitudes of its members.

The concept of permeability assumes that any social system, such as a school, is surrounded by a psychological boundary that insulates it from its environment. The degree to which this boundary is permeable to input from outside the system is directly proportional to the openness of the system. Originally, the PSCQ consisted of 50 descriptive statements that respondents were asked to rate on a five-point Likert-type scale. However, when the PSCQ was field tested by mailing it to a random sample of 500 parents from three elementary  schools, respondents and school administrators agreed that the questionnaire was too long and repetitious. The PSCQ was revised on the basis of this feedback and shortened considerably. Comparison of PSCQ data with data from personal interviews with 60 parents showed close agreement between responses to the interview questions and responses to the PSCQ statements. (Author/JG)",

The five states studied were selected to represent different degrees of centralization in the control of school curriculum. The laws of each state are analyzed using a common framework that facilitates analysis of the relative authority of state legislatures, state boards of education, chief state school officers, state courts, local boards of education, superintendents, principals, teachers, unions, parents, students, and citizens. Also described is the content of the school curriculum in each state as prescribed by state statutes, regulations, and court rulings.  Following a fairly extensive introductory chapter, a separate chapter is devoted to the analysis and discussion of curriculum control in each state. In the final chapter, the authors present a comparative analysis of the laws in all five states and offer their recommendations for change. (Author/JG)",

An important need is to define the elements of an \"equal rights curriculum\" that meets the needs of all children. One of the important elements of such a curriculum is \"adventuring.\" Through more extensive and intensive interaction with various environments and cultural realms, adventuring broadens children's base for learning and enlivens the whole educational process. \"Mastering\" is another element of the equal rights curriculum. All children, including those who have been traditionally undertaught, must succeed in mastering the educational fundamentals and much more as well. \"Associating\" is the final important curricular element. Children who may have  been mistaught about racial-ethnic, gender, and class differences need the correction that comes from interacting with all kinds of children and from studying the social aspects of human behavior. This proposed curriculum is meant to help those children who have been traditionally undertaught, but it should also benefit children who have been overtaught, as well. (Author/JG)",

        "description":"There are four major functions involved in the management of any human enterprise: planning, organizing, executing, and controlling. Educators would add an additional function--evaluation--although it is generally subsumed under control. The control function has been neglected in education. Control means formative (inprocess) evaluation plus timely remediation. Quality control is concerned with remediation and correction. It includes a monitoring function designed to determine if necessary corrective actions have been taken. Planning should anticipate control; that is to say, planning should provide sufficient guidelines to permit effective monitoring of the enterprise as it progresses. This implies that planning must include establishment of clearly articulated standards of  performance and that the objectives for any program must be based on clearly articulated discrepancies between what is and what ought to be. This shift in outlook to output standards allows a redefinition of quality (fitness for use as judged by the user) and a refocussing on the efficiency and effectiveness of education. An emphasis on control in education should allow educators to solve the chronic problems of redundancy in instruction, the academic/vocational dichotomy, and the failure to use a total management approach consistently.

It proposes the use of three powerful constructs--quality control, quality assurance, and an independent educational accomplishment audit (IEAA). The essential elements of quality control are agreeing on and specifying desired outcomes of instruction (the standards), translating the desired outcomes into measurable objectives or verifiable proxy experiences (the design), formally comparing what is actually happening with what was intended (the evaluation for conformance to design), deciding what is required to be done to achieve conformance to design (the control plan), and doing what is required when such action is feasible (the control action). The agenda  of quality assurance is the organization's quality control program. An IEAA is an audit of program accomplishment, in output terms, done by an outside agency. The audit would consider the quality control in a program and the program's cost-effectiveness. The intention of an audit must be viewed as positive and necessary if organizations are to learn and change for the better. Ideally, the net effect of an educational audit will be an emergence of an increasing number of success strategies. (Author/IRT)",

It is a case study designed to illustrate what one urban school system is doing to finance equity among schools. There are five major considerations related to the program to equalize per-pupil costs: distribution of resources, development of comparable per-pupil cost data, action to equalize per-pupil costs, analysis of per-pupil cost data, and need for evaluation. Four specific programs were promoted to equalize per-pupil staffing costs: the maximum class size program, the equalization program, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act comparability program, and the moratorium on teacher transfers. Statistical analysis of the  1972-73 data is presented in an appendix. (Author/IRT)",

The task force concluded that school size is not the determining factor in the quality of a child's elementary school education. Other factors such as leadership of the principal, ability and dedication of the staff, and community support and involvement may be more important factors. It was determined that operating costs rose rapidly once a school drops below 300 students. Schools that drop below 300 are subjected to a detailed review and analysis that includes the following factors: modernization  schedule, availability of space in nearby schools, transportation implications, long-range need for elementary school facilities in the area, articulation with secondary schools, and socioeconomic and racial balance. The committee examined methods of reducing the operating costs of small schools, for instance reducing staff and food service costs. Alternative uses of facilities were also examined. A process for addressing specific small school situations and the board policy on small schools are included. (Author/IRT)",

Several versions of the system, termed the Instructional Improvement Kit, were empirically tested to observe the differential effects of program monitoring versus program monitoring plus instructional modification, as well as follow-up teacher meetings. Superior achievement is obtained when a program monitoring system is supplemented by instructional modification  strategies that assist supervisors and teachers in analyzing instruction and making changes that have been demonstrated to be generally effective in improving pupil performance.

Once the teacher and administrator have agreed on what outcomes to teach, they can then agree on some indicators as to how well and at what rate students attain these outcomes. (2) Sharing achievement information. The teacher and administrator establish a simple, convenient information channel whereby the administrator is kept informed of student accomplishments as assessment occurs. (3) Working to improve instruction in light of identified learning deficiencies. The beginning reading program tested here is consistent with the instructional leadership model discussed in that it set achievement indicators, established an information  base, and modified instruction to improve achievement. The findings suggest that the instructional supervision model presented can substantially improve pupil achievement in an outcome-based, classroom-verified instructional program. (Author/IRT)",

Although specific reforms are not examined, there is a tenuous connection between bureaucratic organization of schools and the kinds of teacher attitudes toward clients so often cited as the justification for changes. Contrary to conventional expectations, the ability of teachers to interact with parents and students without conflict, and to accept pedagogical and organizational reforms, appears enhanced by the reliance on clear and concise rules for teacher behavior in areas such as student discipline and relations with parents. Organizational strategies that enable teachers to make difficult decisions, sort out  ambiguous situations, and reaffirm frequently challenged authority are often well received. Extensive school rules for teacher behavior in such circumstances are apparently compatible with teacher expectations and, therefore, a reasonably successful administrative strategy. (Author)",

Treatments in the form of objectives were applied to the various problems uncovered and became the basis for the model. Subsequent evaluation indicated that all problems uncovered by the needs assessment were significantly lessened by the implementation of the objectives. The model proved effective in facilitating the physical movement and social adjustments of students as they moved from one school level to the next and in establishing communications between the professional staffs of the schools. The ten objectives of the program dealt with the meeting and planning schedule,  articulation commitment and rational development, fall orientation for tenth-grade students, the individualized student orientation program, ability level assignment, professional staff meeting and planning, the interschool teacher exchange program, course familiarity of feeder school guidance staff and curriculum specialists, spring orientation for rising tenth-grade students, and parent orientation.

        "description":"This practicum developed a model of vertical articulation between elementary feeder schools and an intermediate school. The program and model were developed after a formal needs assessment was carried out to determine articulation problems. After problems were determined, objectives were formulated and strategies developed. Objectives that provided the bases for the program model were then implemented for treatment of the problems and further evaluated to determine their effectiveness. The objectives dealt with the schedule of meetings and the planning for articulation; articulation rationale and commitment; eighth-grade student orientation; individualized new student orientation; interorganizational staff meeting and planning; interschool teacher observations; feeder teacher  familiarization with curriculum, placement, and registration; seventh-grade student familiarization with curriculum, placement information, and registration; parent orientation; and the student activities program. Evaluation revealed that each of the problems was significantly reduced by the implementation of the program objectives. Outcomes facilitated the physical movement and social adjustment of students as they moved from one school organizational level to the next and established communications between the professional staffs who work at the secondary organizational levels of the school system.

Data for the study were collected in 1974-75 through observation of classroom behavior, through interviews with school principals, and through self-administered questionnaires completed by the teachers and principal in each school. This report examines the relationship between administrative leadership and schools' success in raising achievement. Analysis of the survey data showed that schools in which principals emphasized the importance of selecting basic instructional materials and made more of the decisions in the instructional area were more likely to show achievement gains in the subject areas of reading and mathematics during  1974-75.

However, the bureaucratic model fails to recognize the intervening character that the presence of professionalism has on the process of school governance. The data from this research, drawn from a field study, are used to construct the Interacting Spheres Model which, it is argued, is capable of clarifying the decision-making ramifications of professional employees working in bureaucratic organizations. The model suggests the presence of two interacting spheres of influence, with some decisions formally delegated to administrators and others informally assumed by teachers. Each sphere  maintains a degree of decisional autonomy but with identifiable limits placed on that autonomy. Members of each sphere have developed strategies designed to aid them in indirectly managing behavior in the other sphere as well as strategies for defending their own sphere against attempted outside intervention.

Through the use of the community task force, the frequently painful decisions entailed by a no-growth policy can be made more palatable. There are three types of task forces (the indepth seminar, the six- to eight-week study group, and the extended study committee). The task force may be led by an outside consultant, a central office administrator, a board-appointed leader, or a leader elected from within the group. The composition of the committee should be representative of the community as a whole. Organizational structure is all-important if the task force is to accomplish its duties (for example, specifying which schools will be closed first). Decision-making  models such as KEMEC can assist in identifying evaluation criteria, which usually include economic, facility, and social factors. An example of how this decision-making model is applied in a hypothetical school district indicates the process to be followed by the task force. (DS)",

Essentially, the model is a 90-day issue-identification and solution-planning strategy that can be applied to any concern deemed by a school board and its constituency to be sufficiently critical to warrant involving significant numbers and kinds of persons in seeking solutions. The model contains simplicity of design, emphasizes representation of various segments of the school/community population, assigns clear responsibilities and authority parameters to each unit in the system, possesses continuity, takes into account time factors, and provides for clear lines of communication and interaction. Human inputs to the planning process were made by members of three kinds of groups--a steering  committee, a citizens' committee, and subcommittees. Four means of formative evaluation and ten means of summative evaluation were employed to assess the effectiveness of the planning processes and outcomes. Twenty evaluation findings are cited.

Section 1 identifies North Smithfield's perceived budgetary and accounting needs and discusses the possibility of utilizing PPBS to meet those needs. Section 2 establishes a theoretical and practical framework for meeting the various needs of the system's staff and administration, as well as the community and state, through use of a PPBS  model. Section 3 includes the detailed models used for the inservice phase, presents both Smithfield's old and new budgetary designs, and discusses the rationale and crosswalk capabilities of the practicum. Section 4 describes the pretest and posttest assessment of staff involvement and skills during the inservice phase and presents an overall summative evaluation of the practicum. Section 5 reviews the practicum's first-year accomplishments and describes certain follow-up activities planned for its second year. (Author/JG)",

Components of the program included (1) inservice training of staff in the analysis of test results and understanding of statistical terms, (2) workshop sessions in which teachers correlated test results with strengths or weaknesses in the curriculum, and (3) teacher development of recommended changes in the curriculum to compensate for weaknesses identified by the tests. The state tests were criterion-referenced based on specific objectives. The program emphasized the identification and  reinforcement of objectives needing improvement rather than strategies for improving state test scores. (Author)",

By utilizing the computer many information processing tasks can be made possible, providing assistance for decision-making and setting priorities with respect to educational facilities. Inventories, utilization reports, maintenance scheduling, insurance reports, and energy conservation are some of the seemingly routine  tasks that may be computerized and made more exacting.

The research suggests that Catholic parents perceive a difference among these schools in terms of their educational and social environments and make choices accordingly. If the centralization decreases the differences among these schools, will Catholic parents continue to select one or another of these schools for their children? The answer has a direct bearing on the financial crisis facing Catholic schools in the nation. (Author)",

It is part of a growing body of social change research being done by American sociologists. In Part I, the first five chapters, the context for the analysis of the changing impact of Catholic education on adult religiousness is placed in context, the demographic and political changes among American Catholics in recent years are discussed, and an attempt is made to discover the underlying cause of the dramatic decline in Catholic religious belief and practice since 1963. Part II, the second five chapters, turns explicitly to the question of Catholic schools, addressing the  relationship between value-oriented education and social change, including attitudes toward race; discussing Catholic attitudes toward Catholic schools; and examining the specific areas of Catholic schools and finances, religious leadership, and basic beliefs. Chapter 11 is a summary and conclusion. The principal investigator offers a personal statement in the Afterword. (Author/IRT)",

Nichols remedies specified by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) in ways that both adhere to the spirit of the Lau decision and allow the school district to develop coherent educational programs for all students. First, it should be understood that the remedies are minimal and that they have been drawn to adhere to the narrowest legal interpretation on the basis of the most promising current knowledge and thought relating to the education of children of limited English-speaking ability and cannot require bilingual, multicultural programs for all children. Second, an acceptable plan must include realistic time-outcome expectations; a  plan can be rejected for projecting unrealistic expectations. The development of an elementary-level compliance plan calls for four phases: student identification, student language assessment, analysis of achievement data, and creation of program offerings. The process at the secondary level is the same except that program offerings can include a wider array of options. A sample community language survey form is included. (Author/IRT)",

A number of crucial elements common to each of these model programs should be explored. Among these essential ingredients are an appropriate assessment of teacher needs before inservice sessions are scheduled, a carefully prepared outline of the year's objectives, a realistic schedule for activities, a provision for release time, morning sessions whenever possible, a reward system, well-prepared agendas, capitalization on hired consultants, and a plan for  evaluation of the entire program and each of its individual sessions and components. Looking at the methods for implementing the actual training, one might consider some of the following structures: workshops, institutes, seminars, study groups, micro-teaching, intervisitation, master-teacher rotations, and carousels.

The paper concludes that, overall, the BSM can be useful for diagnosing a student's strengths and weaknesses in the basic structures of a language, for student placement, and to measure the degree a student has maintained or lost certain basic structures. The measure offers instructional suggestions for each level. (Author/IRT)",

PAL consists of four components, including an examiner's manual containing directions for administering and scoring the test, a picture book containing three cartoon-type pictures used in administering the test, a scoring book containing the English questions and spaces for recording and scoring the child's responses in English, and a scoring booklet containing the Spanish questions and spaces for recording and scoring the child's responses in Spanish. PAL is administered to one child at a time by a bilingual  person who has undergone special training. When scoring is completed for all children, language dominance is established by converting the English and Spanish scores into language levels. Each child is then classified as Spanish dominant, bilingual, or English dominant. PAL is an economical instrument that provides valuable information on levels of language proficiency; however, it does require specialized training, particularly for the scoring process.

With minimal effort and cost, a school district can offer unique learning situations that suit the needs of all students without shortchanging those whose native language is not English. The ultimate goal of a bilingual education program is individualized instruction. This goal can be achieved by flexible grouping of students, student exchange among classrooms, and differentiated staffing, which utilizes teacher aides and paraprofessionals, as well as parents and other school children. These techniques have been used successfully  in the Edgewood Independent School District, one of the poorest in Texas. (Author/DS)",

In general, the study focuses on examination of the &quot;parameters of adjustment&quot; of public school systems with varying growth histories. Colorado was selected because some of its characteristics made it an ideal region for the implementation of the study. Some of the major hypotheses to be considered are (1) the pattern of resource allocation is significantly different among the growing and declining enrollment systems, (2) levels of student achievement differ among school systems encountering different growth rates, (3) the level and structure of the staff has a tendency to stabilize in the negative growth systems,  and (4) the rate of innovation is retarded in the systems encountering stable or negative enrollments. The study is organized into three major sections. The first describes the data collected and performs a preliminary analysis. The second formulates and analyzes a questionnaire used to test the responses of administrators to decline. The last section uses a case study approach to further analyze the effects of decline on the local school district. (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"The Texas Foundation School Program, popularly known as the Minimum Foundation Program (MFP), is a very complex approach to school finance. It provides basic assistance in three areas--minimum salaries, operating allowances, and transportation--and additional assistance in two others--vocational education and special education. The state pays roughly 80% of the MFP costs. On the whole, the Texas system favors smaller districts, especially those under 500 average daily attendance, even though district wealth is generally an inverse function of district size. The major sources of the inequities have to do with how enrichment monies for operating expenses are provided, how capital outlay monies are raised, and how foundation program current expense allotments are determined. The  manner in which local fund assignment is calculated is also weak but it is not as large a problem as the other three. An equitable system must take into consideration district wealth, district family income, local school taxes, local municipal taxes, different common costs of education, the concentration of students with special needs, and different transportation needs.

        "description":"The current system of school finance in Texas allows for gross inequities among districts. Statistics indicate that although Texas ranks slightly higher than the nation's average in state wealth, its support of schools, as measured by the percentage of personal income devoted to education, ranks about 35th. These figures suggest that the state could be spending more on education. Two suggestions for correcting the state system, consolidation of districts and elimination of the &quot;economic index&quot; in current use, are inadequate. The major problems that must be addressed are how enrichment monies for operating expenses are provided, how capital outlay money must be raised, and how foundation program current expense allotments are determined. The reform of these problems must take into  consideration district wealth, district family income, local school taxes, local municipal taxes, different common costs of education, concentrations of students with special needs, and different transportation needs. It must be kept in mind, however, that finance reform alone will not help the station of the poor and those from minority backgrounds unless the factors of cultural difference, language difference, economic difference, and Anglo political domination are also faced.

Learning is seen to involve the interaction of cognitive developmental stages at the preverbal, verbal, and postverbal levels with learning disabilities seen to be due to perceptual handicaps. A model is offered which posits a hierarchy of learning capacities resulting from increasing differentiation of the nervous system and the importance of modality preference in matching instruction to the child. A perceptual test battery is described. Confirmation of the author's theories is seen in results of five field studies which investigated the development of perceptual processing, the modality distinction, and the reliability and validity of the test battery. Stressed  is the importance of matching instruction to the child's individual learning style. The ignoring of individual differences in the development of perceptual adequacy is seen to be responsible for many learning disabilities. A chapter (reprinted from Issues on Classification of Children by N. Hobbs) focuses on the purposes of classification, evaluation and intervention with learning disabilities. Three detailed case histories are provided to illustrate the type of examination, diagnosis, and recommendations that can be made in evaluating a child's problem. Educational implications of the author's model are seen to involve early perceptual training and modality oriented instruction. (DB)",

Results for grade 1 indicated that children who showed an auditory preference achieved significantly higher when auditory decoding  techniques were used and children with a visual preference achieved significantly higher when visual techniques were used.

Individual 45- and 30-minute relaxation exercises which involved tension and relaxation of all muscle groups combined with visualization techniques were presented to all Ss. The experimental group (n=4) received nine 20-minute feedback sessions in which each S was instructed that his goal was to lower his overall body tension--to be relaxed--and that the reading on the EMG meter display would be the measure of his relaxation. Pre- and post-EMG training test batteries were given to all Ss  and included the Student Self-Liking Rating, Draw A Person Test, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, and the Wide Range Achievement Test. All Ss significantly reduced hyperactivity and lability, and increased auditory attention. There were no significant changes between the experimental and control groups. (Author/SB)",

Following an introduction covering the problem, purpose, need, and limitations of the study are sections which include a review of the literature (with discussions of behavior, academic performance, and statistical measurement), a description of the typical assessment process (including a review of the typical classroom measurement, system-wide assessment, and individualized measurement of educational adequacy, as well as weaknesses within the typical measurement), the assessment procedure steps (such as  behavioral observation) of the SFAO, the data assessment program for three elementary level underachievers, and interpretation of the data and prescription for remediation of the three case studies. It is concluded that the SFAO can be used by the clinician with any of the present standardized assessment instruments and provides for an increased clarity in the process of identification, interpretation, and prescription for remediation. Among appendixes are a glossary of terms, information on the behavioral observation chart, and a sample summarized statistical profile chart. Also provided is a bibliography with 74 entries. (SB)",

A model for making program decisions is noted to include five data collection phases: problem selection (describing numerically the difference between the referred student's actual and desired behavior); program selection (selecting and testing a variety of alternative programs); program operationalization (determining whether the program is being implemented as planned); program improvement (holding on to program plans which succeed in bringing about meaningful changes while dropping unsuccessful plans); and program certification (evaluating the success of the program in achieving goals). It is noted that trainees are  evaluated regularly to determine their mastery of specific actions, and that individual program modifications are made based on such evaluations. The results of a survey to assess the perceived importance of program activities to 38 trainees are summarized. Included are tables on the model for data based program modification and on the survey of SERTS trainees. (SB)",

        "description":"A modeling procedure involving dynamic interactions was used to train three language-delayed preschool children to emit five-element syntactic responses. A single-subject multiple baseline design using within- and across-subject replication was employed to study the acquisition of expanded &quot;agent-action-object&quot; sentences and the spontaneous generation of this form in the natural environment. A familiar person, using an object known to the child, demonstrated a common action, and the symbolic form which described this event was modeled for the child. The generalization and maintenance of the lexicon and syntax trained were tested by contextual probes and responses to video tape presentations. The result demonstrated the effectiveness of the training strategy. Probes revealed  generalization and maintenance of both lexical and syntactical forms acquired in treatment. Significant increases in each S's spontaneous usage of the basic syntactical form in the natural environment, i.e., the classroom during free play, were documented. (Author/SB)",

Results indicated that there were no  significant differences among total groups with the three administrative settings in reading, spelling, or arithmetic; that there were significant differences on some measures of academic achievement when groups were divided in terms of high and low IQ; that there were no significant differences found in self concept among total groups of high IQ groups; that both total groups of pupils and low IQ pupils were significantly better adjusted socially in the special school and special class than in the regular class; and there were no significant differences in the social adjustment of high IQ pupils among the three administrative groups.

The Early Childhood Medication Questionnaire used in the survey included items relating to teacher, program, and student descriptions; medication information; experience with children on medication and interaction with parents and doctors regarding children and medication; role behaviors from the diagnostic, dosage adjustment, and follow-up phase of the drug regimen; statements about drug therapy in general; areas in which teachers received specific training or acquired definite knowledge regarding hyperactivity, convulsive disorders, medications, and  involvement in the drug regimen; and problems comments, and questions concerning medication usage. Among the findings of the study's first phase were that most early childhood special education teachers have had experience teaching children receiving drug therapy for both hyperactivity and convulsive disorders; that the majority of teachers has no formal education regarding the most frequently prescribed drugs for preschool special education children; and that over a third of the teachers reported nonprescription drug therapies (including coffee, special diet, and vitamins) for hyperactivity.

Use of the index identified 74% of the males and 30% of the females as possibly LD for a total of 67% possibly LD identifications. Among the identified children, 93% had discrepantly low PIAT subtest scores in reading recognition, 88% in reading comprehension, 83% in spelling, and 52% in arithmetic. Results suggested that caution be exercised when classifying children, especially females, as LD. (Author/DB)",

During the positive reinforcement condition each student earned a slash mark whenever he was observed attending to task, while in the punishment condition, slash marks were placed next to each student's name and then removed when the student was observed in an off task behavior. Results indicated that punishment in the form of response cost did not appear to be associated with dysfunctional side effects, and that there was no relationship between increases in academic production and changes in nonattending behavior.

Covered in Part 1 are the reasons (such as geographical restriction and lack of public awareness) for the unavailability of specialized services for special needs children and the key Office of Child Development (OCD) policy features (such as the requirement that programs provide the handicapped child with learning and playing experiences with nonhandicapped children) regarding services for handicapped children in Head Start. Part  2 begins with an overview of the Cooperstown Experimental Project and the case study of a 5 1/2-year-old cerebral palsied child served by the project. Detailed in the remainder of the document are the step-by-step procedures for implementing the project's three major components (VTR, MRC, and CSS). It is noted that the VTR serves as an observation tool for looking at a child's behavior, assessing needs, and leading to a follow-up prescription for the individual child's program; that the MRC is used as a center where children participate in a half-day educational and socialization program in an integrated setting; and that the CSS is a special staff member with general child development background, training, and experience who works directly with the child, his family, Head Start staff,  and the community. Appendixes and exhibits include a listing of OCD experimental Head Start projects for handicapped children, a list of stimulus materials which can be used for the VTR procedure, and job descriptions and responsibilities of various project staff positions.

        "description":"Provided is a practicum report on a travel training program initiated at the Ray Graham Training Center (Chicago, Illinois) for 40 trainable mentally handicapped young adults. The center is described in terms of the geographic area and clients served, staff roles, parent role, and curriculum. It is noted that a prime impetus for the development of a mobility training program came from the need of clients to reach job sites. A search of the literature is reported to reveal that very little written material exists on travel training for the mentally retarded. Outlined are instructional objectives (such as the ability to discriminate and use various forms of money) and activities (such as orientation tours of the school community), and briefly described are methods for evaluating  program effectiveness. Described in the section on program implementation are the gaining of parental cooperation, procedural activities (such as development of a program rational), client selection procedures, and instructional activities (such as field trips). The terminal objective, developmental sequence, and evaluation of the independent travel training design are given. Pointed out are the steps to be taken in preparation for independent travel. Program evaluation results are cited which support the program's success in terms of achievement of program objectives, parental cooperation, and system wide application. Appendixes include a pedestrian skills checklist, a table comparing mobility goals and attainment, and a 36-page teacher's guidebook for mobility training. (SB)",

The committee was subdivided into five groups to provide solutions to a need for legal protection, a need for uniform eligibility standards, a need for a standard set of forms, a need for a model appraisal flow chart, and a need to standardize the roles of supportive personnel. Solutions to all of the needs but the last (dealing with role standardization) were proposed. The majority of the items were accepted by Region XX CASE, and an Appraisal  Awareness Seminar was held to explain the recommendations. The project was evaluated along three areas: process (described in terms of staff, clerical assistance, facility utilization, and monetary support); products resulting from the project (including reports of the various committees, a set of forms for implementing a common appraisal system, and a manual explaining the model appraisal process); and effects of the project (including a drop in the number of students found eligible for the educable mentally handicapped program due to the requirement of more exact criteria for placement). (Appendixes, which make up the bulk of the document, include information on the organizational meeting and plan, committee reports, the project's manual for understanding the special education appraisal  process, a copy of state board policy, and examples of individually administered intelligence tests.)

The book first summarizes some of the problems of grammatical description encountered from Saussure through the present and then outlines possibilities for new descriptions of language which take into account sociolinguistic factors. For instance, a static framework would view creole situations as &quot;freak&quot; situations and creoles as necessarily unstable and rapidly changing. A dynamic framework would endorse the Saussurian paradox that competence is looked for exclusively in the individual, but variety is sought in society. A dynamic framework would hold that competence is polylectal; what language-users know about communicating  with others more nearly represents their language competence than the subset of this knowledge exhibited in production. The bulk of the text centers around the enumeration of principles and the presentation of models for variation theory. A paper on feature marking and weighting is appended. (CAL/DB)",

        "description":"This publication reports on research which has investigated phoneme acquisition and carry-over in a programmatic fashion. This research began with investigations of the effect of an extension of stimulus control of new phoneme responses through a systematic operant procedure. After quantifying the effect of such procedures in terms of stimulus generalization, the program of research moved to the investigation of additional systematic procedures which were applied to such factors as phoneme position in words; phoneme responses embedded in sound-loaded sentences; and phoneme-responding in sentences under enforced time limits. Measurement of the effects of such training variables was made in terms of correct phoneme-responding in controlled samples of connected speech and in  spontaneous conversation. The goal of the research has been to identify, empirically, the treatment variables which function to attain the carry-over of new phoneme learning into nonprogrammed conversational speech. The results of the research indicate that systematic procedures which treat certain stimulus and response variables result in high degrees of correctness in new-phoneme responses in conversational speech. These variables are: (1) antecedent stimulus variables ranging from imitative models to nonimitative evoking stimuli, such as pictures and intraverbal chains; and (2) response configuration variables, such as word-position of phonemes and sentence-production performance.

Results indicate that the subjects' linguistic aptitudes and habits are influenced by four principal variables: age, sex, social rank, and language or habit considered. Given the variation of linguistic aptitudes and habits according to age, predictions can be made concerning the evolution and preservation of French. The open questions yielded a significant linguistic corpus  which should make possible a detailed analysis of spoken French in Welland.

In Spanish vocabulary and storytelling, the Bilingual group was stronger. In English vocabulary the results were mixed and in storytelling the Comparison group appeared to have an edge. In math, the results were mixed. Finally, the Bilingual group reported using more Spanish than the Comparison group, and more Spanish than English.

The performance of fourth- and sixth-grade children taking part in a French immersion program was compared to that of French-speaking children of the same age using an elicited imitation task. The subjects' performance on eight syntactic features was measured. French-speaking children, in general, performed better than the English children. A consistent pattern of errors by the English children indicated that they possessed a rule system for several of the features which was different from that of the child native speakers.

Greater variation was found for some error categories between these two tasks and the translation task. Analysis of the errors suggests that differences in results could be reduced through slight adjustments in the method of data analysis, and a variation of the translation task.

Adults learning English as a second language in a formal classroom situation were recorded as they described a series of pictures in English. Two subjects were native speakers of Cantonese, two were native speakers of Portuguese and two were native speakers of Korean. Their speech was transcribed and analyzed for syllable structure. The data support the following findings: (1) the syllable structure of the interlanguages examined was markedly different from that of the target language; (2) in the syllable structure of the interlanguages examined, both epenthesis and consonant deletion seemed to be used as  strategies for syllable simplification, with the first-language background of the learner seeming to be related to a preference for one strategy over the other; (3) the dominant process influencing the syllable structure of the interlanguage phonologies appeared to be language transfer; (4) a preference for the open (consonant-vowel) syllable seemed to operate as a process independent of language transfer in influencing the syllable structure of the interlanguage phonologies; and (5) glottal stop insertion appeared only between words, possibly as a result of an attempt to produce lexical items as separate units in the speech stream.

        "description":"Before any conclusions can be drawn about the relative complexity of grammatical items, the items should be thoroughly analyzed. For example, learning to use French gender involves much more than learning to recognize formal characteristics which account for gender in nouns; it also requires that semantic gender features be mastered, so that correct forms will be connected with the right meanings. In this study, it is found that six subsets of nouns isolated on the basis of formal properties interact with four semantically classified subsets, yielding 48 &quot;rules&quot; to be learned. Furthermore, correct usage must be combined with adequate reference, which involves still another set of rules, differing not only in number but also in kind from the first two sets. Finally, it should be  noted that gender and number, although both appear to involve only dichotomous choices, are not strictly comparable, as number has a diacritical function which gender does not have.

These were 8-year-old, 11-year-old and adult native speakers of Arabic who were learning English as a second language. The subjects were asked to repeat sentences of seven different grammatical structure types. Previous research with 4-year-old native speakers of English (Smith, 1973) has found that three of the structures were easy to repeat (Type A structures) while four were difficult to repeat (Type B structures). In the present study, a similar difference in the repeatability of A and B structures was found for the youngest subjects, but there was no such difference for the adults and only a moderate difference for the intermediate group. The pattern of results suggested that this was not a function of  differences in the subjects' English-language backgrounds, but represents a developmental difference in the ability of second-language learners to repeat certain grammatical structures. The theoretical reasons for the variability in repetition difficulty for the different structure types were considered. (Author)",

The main focus of this paper is the consideration of Piagetian cognitive developmental theory in general, and the development of the symbolic function in particular as it relates to the problem of second language acquisition. The suggestion is offered that the onset of Formal Operations may well mark the beginning of the end of a critical period for the acquisition of language.  (Author)",

        "description":"The performance and recognition of the act of putting people on involves an awareness and use not only of aspects of the communicative process that hold for all face-to-face interaction, but also of culturally acquired aspects of communication. Teasing and punning are varieties of communicative acts that involve the use of the put-on to accomplish their ends. They seem also to involve a kind of relatedness between verbal and nonverbal communicative acts that is not usually acknowledged, suggesting that the same act can be accomplished through either mode or through a combination of both, and raising the possibility that this may be true of some speech acts or genres. More generally, this paper argues for an interactional approach to the analysis of punning and teasing, so as to  include both the efforts of the instigator of the act and those with whom he is interacting. Finally, it is recommended that nonliteral or nonserious communicative acts make more sense when considered in relationship to the literal formulations on which they depend, and that examination of nonliteral uses can in turn contribute to our understanding of the literal usage of both verbal and nonverbal modes of communication.

        "description":"A study was made to determine the effectiveness of the Connecticut &quot;pairing&quot; model in improving the school success of Spanish-dominant children classified as low achievers. The study was concerned with whether a carefully designed model of bilingual-bicultural education can improve reading, arithmetic and language arts skills and enhance the self-concept of Spanish-dominant elementary school children. The pairing model consists of one native Spanish-speaking teacher who teaches basic skills in Spanish and an English-speaking teacher who teaches speaking, reading and writing in English. Study methods, scope and statistical findings are reported in detail. It was concluded that the pairing model does increase the Spanish reading achievement of Spanish-dominant elementary school  children at a statistically significant level. The model increased English reading achievement at all grades; the increase was statistically significant at the second grade level. Arithmetic and language arts skills were also improved, in comparison with those of children in typical classrooms. In addition, evidence indicates that the pairing model did enhance the development of a positive self-concept in the Spanish-dominant children, who exhibited less negative behavior than their control group counterparts. It is recommended that the pairing model be introduced into all school districts and that teacher preparation institutions establish appropriate training to produce competent staff for such programs.

        "description":"This paper discusses bilingualism from the point of view of language universals, including Fillmore's case grammar, McCawley's &quot;anywhere rules&quot; for lexical insertions and Slobin's operating principles in first language acquisition. It is assumed that first and second language learning is essentially the same, regardless of age. Whereas the monolingual learner's strategies involve the observation of intralinguistic connections between semantic representation and surface structure, the bilingual's strategies have a second interlinguistic dimension. In order to display his total language processing capacities, the bilingual needs a bilingual learning situation. The Multilingual Project illustrates how this can be achieved in a multilingual classroom. The learning materials developed  by the Project are subject matter-oriented and student-centered. The learner can progress at his own rate studying in the language or languages of his preference with the help of bilingual tests supported by activity materials. This approach is based on the hypothesis that allowing the bilingual to learn at his own intellectual level will best serve his conceptual and linguistic development. (Author)",

Among other things, the acquisition of spoken English by bilingual francophone students from these cities was studied in depth, using error analysis. The present study attempts to show that in a bilingual environment, the language most often spoken between parents and children plays a major role in the language acquisition of the children. For the study the spoken English of a sample of 15 Grade 2 children, selected from the French language schools of Welland and Sudbury, was analyzed. This sample was divided in two groups. Group I included children who spoke mostly French with their parents at home. Group II children spoke mostly  English. The results of our study show that: (1) Group II children commit a lower proportion of interference errors (errors attributable to the influence of French) than Group I children. On the basis of these results we can say that the language most often spoken between children and parents seems to have a significant influence on the language acquisition of Grade 2 children in a bilingual environment.

It was discovered that the subject was able to self-correct nearly every error she made in casual speech when the errors were pointed out to her after their commission. Furthermore, in nearly every case she was able to describe the grammatical principle involved. It is speculated that if second language users are able to apply such conscious rules when sufficient processing time is available, perhaps conscious knowledge is applied only when sufficient processing time is available. There is at least suggestive evidence that subconscious \"acquired\" linguistic knowledge (that is, internalized before puberty) is involved in ordinary  unmonitored speech, while consciously \"learned\" rules are available to the second-language speaker only as a monitor.

From the first year of the program (the basic features of which are intensive training in language, culture, and business, as well as internship abroad), students are exposed to facts of life relating to foreign language, culture, and business. It is believed that their learning experience will enable the students to work successfully in multi-national firms in the U.S., to transfer their learning skills to another language, and to adjust to other learning situations. The effects of the program on the Department of Foreign Languages are: to create  more jobs, to stimulate cooperation among different departments, and hopefully to heighten interest in the foreign language requirement as a useful tool. For the high school teacher, the program implies: the need to inform students and native speakers of a foreign language of the possibilities for those skilled in foreign languages; the importance of cultural education in high schools; and the need for the student to understand his learning processes.

The effectiveness of such pedagogical methods as the grammar-translation, audio-lingual, and \"balanced\" approaches, and of language learning with the aid of an informant, is discussed. It is concluded that, given adequate motivation, any method seems to work. In particular, the audio-lingual approach (without its excesses) proved highly effective. The author wonders whether those who now condemn the audio-lingual method have themselves ever been language learners rather than merely language teachers. (Author/DB)",

Foreign language learners do not have to learn, to anything like the same extent, in this way. Foreign language teachers should study students' mistakes in order better to understand how they are learning and mislearning. Teachers should try to avoid language teaching procedures which appear likely to cause students to make mistakes. If, however, the teacher is too strict about mistakes, learners will not be bold in use of the language and their progress will be retarded. There are times for controlled and correct use of the language and times for adventurous use. Mistakes are not to be encouraged, but sometimes they should not be strongly discouraged. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"In the surface structure of Chinese nominal modifiers (quantifiers, determiners, adjectives, measure phrase, relative clause, etc.) may occur either before or after a modified noun. In most of the transformational studies of Chinese syntax (e.g. Cheng 1966; Hashimoto 1966; Mei 1972; Tai 1973; Teng 1974), it has been assumed that such NP's have the underlying order of modifier + noun (M-N, henceforth) with the variant surface order of noun + modifier (N-M, henceforth) being derived. This paper, however, first argues that Chinese has the underlying order of N-M and that the variant M-N order is due to an optional transformation that reorders the N-M sequence. It is shown that the M-N hypothesis requires a set of complex constraints on the rule postposing modifiers in order to  account for various surface patterns exhibited by NP's containing more than one modifier. It will be argued that in the N-M hypothesis proposed here various surface patterns can best be accounted for by constraining the N-M inversion rule to the following effect; namely, it can apply to any NP, either a higher one or a lower one, but only once within the domain of a possible complex NP.

        "description":"Bidialectal approaches to American public school teaching presume a relativistic view of language on the part of teachers, a requirement which has received little scrutiny since bidialectalism has become a predominant approach to divergent language in school settings. Evidence drawn from documents of the American teaching profession over the past fifty years suggests, however, that the rank-and-file teacher is committed to an absolutist position on language in the classroom. During the 1960's a shift is seen in which concern about nonstandard dialects partially replaces disputes over usage issues, but the underlying inclination towards an absolute view of language prevails throughout. This investigation further suggests that teachers' language attitudes may pose a serious  obstacle to the success of bidialectal programs. The work of linguists in helping to develop good language programs is far from over, but to move beyond the current state of affairs, better research is needed. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"A framework which considers speech and language as separate entities in a symbiotic relationship is presented, and basic questions are raised concerning how speech and language function together and what their reciprocal effects are. Based on the notion that speech and language are independent, various examples of speech without language and of language without speech are discussed. Speech and language are basically seen as two different rule systems functioning at different levels. One approach to understanding the role of speech in language consists of comparing the rules of speech, i.e., phonology, with the semantactic rules of language, i.e., syntax and semantics together. A second approach involves comparing the development of speech in man to that in children, while a third  approach compares sign language with speech. Although these research strategies allow for the logical separation of speech and language, it is cautioned that they should ultimately be considered part of one system. (CLK)",

        "description":"The lexicon of present-day English is changing rapidly and regularly, and a description and explanation of this change is necessary for any comprehensive diachronic theory. An examination of a corpus of 500 new words collected during 1975 provides the basis for a typology of lexical change that both supports and suggests modifications for the theories of language change of Weinreich, Labov, and Herzog (1968) and Samuels (1972). The rarest neologisms are nonce words and words created from scratch (zero-derivatives); somewhat more common are words consisting of new or uncommon morphs combined with more ordinary ones. Least rare are new combinations of old morphs; borrowings from other languages, cultures, or specialized or non-elite dialects; words created by analogy; and words  modified to fit new syntactic slots. Words may simply have their semantic range altered, or existing words may fossilize in phrases acting as single semantic units. Lexical change usually involves material already present in the language system or in that of a contact system. It occurs in all idiolects and registers in response to definable linguistic forces, in various degrees of consciousness; and its diffusion, while not necessarily predictable, can be mapped according to a number of specific linguistic, social, and psychological variables. Particular attention is paid to the neutralization of sex references where they are not contextually relevant. (Author/KM)",

At the same time, it is argued that Labov's method of investigation, whereby informants name pictured objects, suffers from built-in limitations and distortions. An alternative method is proposed, in which informants respond to linguistic rather than pictorial stimuli. This method, though perhaps not superior to Labov's, at least has complementary advantages and disadvantages, so that its use, when combined  with Labov's method, may be said to widen the empirical basis for the study of lexical semantics.

The key word in this proposal is \"system.\" Teachers can, and do, add cultural comments on a hit and miss basis as they teach the language, but this is not enough for the student who is thoroughly grounded in his own cultural perspective and, more often than not, has well entrenched negative cultural stereotypes about the speakers of the language he is learning. Teaching a second language can be thought of in terms of three interrelated areas of communication: the speaker himself, the form of dialogue between  two native speakers, and the way native speakers describe the world they live in. By applying anthropological insights into the concept of culture, a ten-theme system for developing the sociocultural context of a second language has been devised. The principal value of these sociocultural patterns is that they provide a systematic means for planning themes that can utilize the content presented in the standard language textbook and help to create the sociocultural context for teaching the language.

Highly accessible but nonproductive patterns may be overgeneralized, e.g., \"bring, brang, brung.\" To incorporate information about pattern accessibility into a formal grammar, it is proposed  that the speaker's knowledge of unproductive patterns be captured by the introduction of a sublexical level of morphemic analysis representing the maximal redundancy recognizable to speakers. The lexical level contains all information not predictable from productive rules; a lexical entry is related to a sublexical entry by sublexical \"derivational\" rules, but this decomposition and derivation is to be interpreted only as word analysis, not as word synthesis. This addition to morphological theory is illustrated with the nonproductively related Spanish words \"puerta\" and \"porton.\" It is also noted that English speakers have some access to meanings encoded by nonproductive morphological process, both Latinate and English, when they are asked to guess \"meaning\" of properly made up nonwords  in a multiple-choice task.

        "description":"An attempt is made in the present paper to resolve inconsistencies between the results of recent studies which have reported that bilingualism is associated with positive cognitive consequences and earlier studies which suggested that bilingualism might adversely affect cognitive and scholastic progress. Because recent studies involved balanced bilinguals and were carried out in \"additive\" bilingual settings, the bilingual subjects in these studies are likely to have attained a high level of competence in the second language (L2) at no cost to their level of competence in the first language (L1). However, earlier studies tended to involve bilingual subjects from language minority groups whose L1 was gradually being replaced by their L2. Thus, it is not surprising that many of  these earlier studies produced evidence of a \"balance effect,\" i.e., that a bilingual paid for his L2 competence by a lowering of his L1 competence. On the basis of the differences in linguistic competence attained by the bilingual subjects in earlier and more recent studies it is hypothesized that the level of linguistic competence attained by a bilingual child may mediate the effects of his bilingual learning experiences on cognitive growth. Specifically, there may be a threshold level of linguistic competence which a bilingual child must attain both in order to avoid cognitive deficits and allow the potentially beneficial aspects of becoming bilingual to influence his cognitive functioning.

Errors were categorized with two major learning strategies in mind: transfer and overgeneralization.

It was found that mother-tongue interference errors are quantitatively affected by the degree of bilingualism, and by the level of proficiency in the target language. Error types did not vary qualitatively for the studied subjects.

Past research involving language mismatch and reading is reviewed, and it is noted that even though the best evidence against mismatch involves phonological mismatch, it elegantly refutes a thesis held by nobody. Grammatical mismatch research is flawed where completed but often hampered by an unwillingness of the public to accept dialect in print. The major thrust of the paper is to suggest that recent developments in linguistic theory and research have opened the area of language functions for investigation. Functional language competence is asserted  to be much more crucial to reading, particularly as it relates to teacher education, curriculum, materials and cross cultural understandings. Finally, it is urged that investigations be undertaken in the mismatch of child language and learning styles. (Author)",

Some findings are: (1) in actual practice there seem to be few differences between large and small classes; and (2) large classes were 400 percent more productive than the small classes in terms of student credit-hour generation  at a cost of only 40 percent increase in faculty time spent. Balancing class size by having every student enroll in a multi-pattern of at least one small and one large class was found to be possibly productive for the institution. (Author/KE)",

Although considerable effort has gone into the development of the NCHEMS postsecondary education subject matter taxonomy, the final result is not entirely satisfactory. This is due in part to inadequacies in the foundations upon which the proposed taxonomy has been based (that is, two existing taxonomies, both of which have internal inconsistencies) and in part to the restriction of the taxonomy to a four-digit coding structure. This proposed taxonomy has not attempted to resolve these issues but does  seek to lay out issues and alternatives for consideration by others who may be concerned with the development of subject matter taxonomies.

The organizational development, administration, and subcontracting procedure are described in this report, along with an evaluation summary of the project. The conference series is concluded to have  been successful from several perspectives: (1) Student groups were given broad responsibility for conference planning and management and for subcontract administration, as well as for developing leadership skills. (2) Students responded positively to the challenge of seeking better avenues for cooperation. (3) The significance of interdisciplinary cooperation in the health, socioeconomic, and sociopolitical fields was stressed.

While it is apparent that these colleges have attracted many students to their classrooms, this study attempts to find out both how many of these students would have attended other colleges and how many would not have attended at all had the local college not been available. This is done by developing and estimating a demand for an educational model using a human capital framework. The National Longitudinal Surveys provide the opportunity to investigate several important issues related to the attendance decision. The availability of data on family background (including family income), ability, existence of public and private colleges in their area of residence, measures of college  quality, and the cost of college attendance allow an examination of the demand for college attendance. The determinants of desired, expected, and actual college attendance for young men and women are examined separately for blacks and whites. Based on the parameter estimates of the model, it is determined that the vast majority of students at local public colleges would have attended other colleges had the local ones not existed. However, the existence of a local two-year public college is associated with greater college attendance among white women and black men. (Author/JMF)",

More detailed knowledge of these interrelationships should provide guidance to federal agencies and to universities in their efforts to sustain academic research in health fields at a high level of national effectiveness. The analytical framework for the investigation involved two modes of trend comparisons: (1) differences among various types of institutions in patterns of change in a given financial or educational variable; and (2) concurrent changes in two or more variables for a given type of institution. The sample included 148  institutions classified by type of control; medical school status; and involvement in doctoral education and research. Variables analyzed included: educational and general revenues; proportion of revenues supplied by R and D funds; trends in sponsored R and D revenues for all fields; expenditures for biomedical-behavioral research; enrollment trends; and trends in doctoral degrees. The general conclusion, although not conclusive, is that the financial condition of private research universities has been deteriorating under the impact of cost inflation and recession in revenues.

Preliminary statistical data revealed a pattern similar to the national findings of differential salaries, rank, and tenure for women, relative to male colleagues. While the percentage of women on faculties has been found to be smallest at the &quot;elite institutions,&quot; it is of interest that at a four-year, &quot;non-elite,&quot; private university, such as Fairleigh Dickinson, the percentage of women on the faculty still does not exceed 20.5 percent. Of a total of 488 faculty members in 1972-73, 100 were women. Information was also collected in the study regarding: perceptions of  discrimination, sex awareness in career choice, marital status, preferred activities, departmental differentiation, personnel decisions, university policies and benefits, professional development, and the women's movement. The most striking finding of the indepth interviews was the proportionately low amount of perceived discrimination among women who have clearly been &quot;tracked&quot; along a second-class route to academic success.

Evaluation procedures and findings are described in this report and recommended procedural changes are listed. Conclusions: Compared to other costing systems designed for higher education, the CAM and IEP systems are relatively simple and may be particularly adaptable for smaller, single-purpose institutions. The systems are available as a package that can possibly be implemented more easily by some institutions than if they were  to develop their own customized costing systems. NACUBO feels that additional research is required for the critical areas that remain unresolved: (1) uses of cost information; (2) fixed, variable, and semivariable costs; (3) cost identification and assignment; (4) modification of CAM and IEP costing systems; and (5) direct and indirect costs. NACUBO and NCHEMS staff are now working together on a project dealing with fixed, variable, and semivariable costs and have agreed to cooperate on resolution of the difficulties of complex institutions in using IEP costing procedures and modification of the existing CAM and IEP costing systems.

        "description":"While the dental education expansion in Illinois has been notable, some problems remain to be addressed in the last half decade of the 1970's. There is a geographic maldistribution of dentists, with more dentists per capita in the urban areas, particularly Chicago, than in the downstate rural areas. While some progress has been made, considerable growth of ethnic minority enrollments must occur before such students are proportionately represented in the state's dental schools. The expansion of dental education in Illinois undertaken in 1968 will result in substantially more dentists. The increase should maintain and will likely improve Illinois' position among the top 15 states in terms of dentists per capita. In recognition of the substantial increases made to date and some of  the dental care problems in Illinois, the following recommendations build upon the progress made to date: The three Chicago-area dental schools should meet their current enrollment projections. The necessary state funds for completing the expansion of dental education in the public dental schools should be provided through the usual budget review and appropriation processes. The private dental schools should be awarded an annual operating grant of $3,000 per Illinois resident student. Affirmative action efforts in each dental school should be continued and expanded. Each school should attempt to enroll and retain a student mix that ethnically and geographically reflects the population base from which it draws its Illinois students.

From an employment perspective, the most favorable combination of factors for women college students is a field of study with a limited percentage of graduating women now entering an occupation where women have been underrepresented in the past, and where total openings exceed total supply of graduating students of both sexes. Examples of such fields are engineering, accounting, business administration, computer  sciences, public administration, hospital administration, and the medical professions. Despite high representation in the various health fields, college women will continue to find favorable job market in nursing, physical and occupational therapy, dental hygiene, medical record librarianship, medical laboratory technology, and other health fields. Although more women students are switching to fields previously dominated by men, over half of them still major in education and the arts and humanities--fields in which the job outlook is relatively poor.

It was an outgrowth of its predecessor, the Latin American Free Trade Association (LAFTA), which had been formed in 1960 with eleven member countries. The Andean Group (GRAN) from the beginning addressed itself to the key factors that had weakened the LAFTA group. Thus (1) it put great stress on strong political support from each of its countries, (2) the sectorial program of industrial development was specifically aimed to increase the industrial capacity of the six member countries while, at the same time, (3) a scheme of automatic tariff reductions with relatively few exceptions was adopted, thereby avoiding  the paralyzing effect of bilateral country negotiations on hundreds or thousands of individual items. Its ambitious blueprint includes the development of regional programs in such basic sectors as metalworking, automotive, paper and pulp, fertilizers, and steel. The Andres Bello program is the educational arm of GRAN. Its projects have been a regional network of educational television programs transmitted by satellite and the establishment of a regional school for training in public sector administration. (JT)",

These programs have in common the delivery of health care. From the administrative standpoint, the broad area of human services must be brought down to manageable, functional segments, but must also be concerned with all of the human services. A way an administrator can relate to other human services is by first having a thorough knowledge and understanding of the health care delivery system and the role management plays within it. This initial working document deals with graduate education for administrators of mental retardation, development disability programs, and institutions. Included is a questionnaire and  results that identify major functional areas of responsibilities for administrators. (Author/KE)",
