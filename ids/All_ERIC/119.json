        "description":"Results of a ten-year review of state appropriations for higher education in the states are presented. Findings reveal a wide range of differences among the regions of the nation and among the individual states. The share of education appropriations received by higher education institutions has grown considerably, with the greatest rate of growth occurring in the private sector. Appropriations for student aid in higher education has also increased considerably from 1968 to 1977. The division of the share within the public sector has shifted toward a larger percentage appropriated directly to the community colleges, and a smaller percentage appropriated to the advanced graduate and research universities. While higher education has increased its share of the education  appropriations, its share of state general revenue dropped slightly. Overall, state governments in the aggregate kept pace in funding the increases in full-time-equivalent enrollment although the percentage change was small. Projections for future public support of higher education are included. Data on state general revenues are reported by region and by state. State appropriations information include funds to public elementary and secondary education, and appropriations to various sectors in higher education. Information is presented on appropriations adjusted for inflation, the private sector, and appropriations by enrollments. Appended material includes survey instruments and an analysis of issues in requesting information and using the data. (SW)",

Usable responses to a questionnaire, which is appended, were obtained from 1,031 students in January 1979. On the whole, results indicate that there are other factors more influential than the catalog in the student's decision to attend the university. Between 58 and 78 percent of the respondents always or usually use the catalog for information about degree requirements. Students also refer to the catalog for specific information on housing, financial aid, and student services. The younger students appear to be  the largest users of the catalog for obtaining information on student life. It is suggested that some types of information could be minimally covered in the undergraduate catalog and provided under separate cover. (SW)",

        "description":"Students' reasons for applying for admission to the University of North Dakota for the academic year 1979-80 were studied. Information was obtained from a question appearing on the admission application form completed by all new freshmen and college transfer students. Results revealed that students cited reasons related to academic program 40.2 percent of the time, followed by location (25.5 percent), and school's reputation (13 percent). Further analysis revealed that age appeared to account for most of the differences. Students 25 years or older were more likely to give location as a reason than were students 19 and younger, or students aged 20-24. These groups generally stated a reason related to an academic program. Variations in stated reasons were evident between new  freshmen and transfer students, military veterans and non-veterans, and between students maintaining continous enrollment and those who had last attended school more than six months ago. However, since each of these variables consisted of categories that reflected age differences between groups, the findings were probably more symptomatic of the age differential than of true differences between groups. Differences between findings of this study and those of the American Council on Education are noted. (SW)",

        "description":"A 16-item Q-sort evaluation of teaching was administered to 2,784 graduate and undergraduate students in education at a state university. Four subscales based on Spady's (1974) teacher competencies model, subject expertise, pedagogical expertise, stimulation and empathy were obtained from two pilot studies. Test-retest reliability and construct validity were established. On the pre-course sort, the most important characteristics of an ideal professor were \"knowledge of subject matter\" followed by \"communicates clearly\" and \"presents well-organized course.\" On the post-test evaluation of the professor these factors plus \"enthusiastic about teaching\" were obtained. Correlations between pre-test and post-test were significant at the .001 level and ranged from .30 to .50. Students'  ratings of professors appear to be little more than their scaling of the professor against their expectations. If they get what they expect the professor rates high, and if it is different, the professor rates low. Reexamination of the use of student rating forms for important decisions is suggested.

Forty-nine faculty members from various colleges and universities in Ohio and Indiana were subdivided into two groups: those who had taught in a structured higher education experience aimed at people over 60 years of age and those who had not. Results indicate that younger faculty members were less critical about older adults as learners and potential learners than are older more experienced faculty members. Older faculty members who had taught a high number of classroom contact hours with adult learners expressed less positive attitudes toward the capabilities of older adults to be successful college students. Younger faculty members maintained few negative  sterotypes of older adults as learners. Further revision of specific item pairs of the survey is being pursued.

The five steps of this approach are examined, and the application of cost behavior analysis at four college-level settings is documented. The institutions and areas of analysis are as follows: Denison University-operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of physical plant; Drake University-instructional capacity; Santa Fe Community College-student services; and the University of Wisconsin System--library services. A major feature of the Denison study is the method used to assign O&amp;M service levels to particular kinds of rooms. In the Drake study, a formula was developed that shows classroom utilization  as an important feature of the study. The Santa Fe study is useful for its validation of the requirements of different kinds of students for varying levels of student services. The library study undertaken at the Wisconsin System was a component of a much larger effort to develop a formula to appropriate state revenues. The method used for dividing library services into those that are affected by student enrollments and those that are affected primarily by acquisitions is also significant. It is suggested that the case studies reveal the challenge of applying cost behavior analysis to the internal reallocation of resources and to state allocation of funds. (SW)",

The utility of both programmatic data and auditable accounting data is also addressed. Business managers, presidents, and governing board chairmen at four community colleges and representatives of six different state agencies were interviewed to determine the perceived need for uniform financial data and views of data formatted in accordance with the Oregon Community College Classification of Accounts. This set of uniform reporting guidelines were derived in large part from the expenditure and revenue categories and definitions outlined in the &quot;Higher Education Finance Manual&quot; of the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems (NCHEMS). The  characteristic of the uniform reporting guidelines that almost every user group in Oregon regarded as most important was the capability they provide to generate uniform financial data. Many felt that the ability to compare uniform data would make their tasks easier, while some believed that the ability of community colleges to provide uniform data would result in better management. NCHEMS' observations concerning the design and implementation of a uniform account structure for the community college system in Oregon are presented. The Classification of Accounts format and interview results for each of the user groups are included. (SW)",

Separate reviews are presented for studies of quality at the graduate level, in professional programs, and at the undergraduate level. Academe's continuing attempts to quantify \"quality\" so as to measure it empirically rather than subjectively through reputational ratings are examined. In addition, accreditation and state program review, both of which exemplify external approaches to assessing quality in American higher education, are discussed. In academic studies, usually conducted by researchers from the higher education community, assessments have focused on identifying the best institutions (or graduate departments). It is concluded that whether based on peer review or  on the application of a set of traditionally-used quantifiable indicators, such assessments ignore about 99 percent of the nation's higher education institutions. It is suggested that these rankings serve to reinforce the hierarchical structure of the system, whereby material and human wealth tend to be concentrated in a few institutions. It is also noted that the teaching-learning function of higher education has been virtually ignored in quality assessments. Conclusions and recommendations as to how quality in higher education might be better defined and how methods of assessing quality might be improved are presented. A bibliography is included .(SW)",

Workload studies are valuable to state legislators concerned with budgets, enrollment trends, and efficient institutional operations. Typical questions that workload studies address and three commonly used quantitative measures are outlined. Two approaches to assessing workload are quantitative measures based on institutional data and measures based on faculty self-reports of how they spend their times. For collective bargaining contracts, workloads are typically defined in terms of credit or contact hours. Teaching-related activities that do not have specific credit hours  attached are given equivalencies. A new federal requirement for institutions receiving federal grants and contracts is that the department must report 100 percent of compensated faculty activity for all faculty, even those not directly involved in the federal activities. Reasons for this regulation and objections voiced by faculty members are examined. Some proposals for alternative workload structures are briefly noted. A bibliography is included. (SW)",

        "description":"Approximately 50 statistical tables are presented to provide the latest data on higher education in 1979 and 1980 for the United States, the Southern Regional Board (SREB) region, and the 14 individual member states. Information contained in the tables is grouped under the six headings that form the sections of the publications: population and economy, enrollment and institutions, degrees, institutional finances, student finances, and faculty. An abridged composite of some of the more fundamental statistics is included, offering brief state profiles on population and economy, finances, and enrollment. Among the highlights provided by the data are the following: (1) residents of the 14 Southern states made up 30.6 percent of the total population of the United States in 1979; (2)  per capita personal income in the region in 1979 was $7,896, which was 91 percent of the U.S. level; (3) appropriations of state tax funds for higher education were 15.4 percent of state taxes in 1978; the national average was 13.5 percent; (4) fall 1979 enrollment in Southern institutions of higher learning exceeded three million, representing some 26 percent of the national collegiate student body; and (5) although the number of part-time students continues to grow, the region still enrolls a greater proportion of full-time students than does the nation.

The study focused on the degree to which teachers encourage, praise, or use student ideas; the degree to which teachers ask questions that encourage evaluative and divergent thinking; the degree to which students make higher levels of cognitive responses; and the degree to which there is peer interaction in the class. Twelve faculty members known for a variety of teaching styles in a variety of disciplines were studied. Questionnaires were distributed to students at the beginning and end of the semester, class sessions were tape recorded, and questionnaires were distributed to the faculty members. Though an adequate range of behaviors was observed across the 12 classes, less than 20  percent of class time was spent in student participation or in encouraging involvement. Student participation, encouragement, and peer-to-peer interaction were rather consistently and positively related to the outcomes under consideration (perceived value of the course in stimulating additional intellectual pursuits, critical thinking scores on the Watson-Glaser test, and increased time spent while studying in analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating materials). Implications for research, faculty development, and teaching are considered. References and a sample questionnaire are included. (SW)",

Three starting points are as follows: examining the intentions constituting the background to the present organization of studies, considering continuing developments and attitudes toward problems; and analyzing the educational structure existing when the reform is implemented. Aims of the new organization of studies were that a diversity of forms was to be superseded by uniformity, and that it would also be flexible for new developments. Uniformity was designed to provide greater clarity about the range of educational opportunities to assist prospective students and employers. The organization of studies was also designed to provide  clearer documentation for the decision-making bodies. To elucidate the structure of the range of separate courses, a survey will be undertaken of courses at all higher education units in three higher education regions.

The project explored contemporary concerns of institutional viability as they affect Catholic higher education. Information is provided on enrollment, financial operations, and student financial aid. Data on the performance of Catholic higher education against the background of the remainder of private higher education are examined. It is suggested that Catholic colleges and universities are meeting the financial aid needs of their dependent aid recipients to a degree comparable with other private colleges and universities. It is concluded that expansion of graduate and  first-professional programs, accommodations of part-time students, coeducation for some colleges, and renewed strength in women's education are all indicators of institutional flexibility in Catholic higher education. Some areas for future concern regarding declining enrollments are considered. Data are presented that suggest the present ability of Catholic higher education to maintain current expenditures and revenues in balance. The rate of expenditure increase was slightly below the average in the doctoral universities and slightly above average in the other four-year institutions and two-year colleges. (SW)",

        "description":"An examination of the findings of three national surveys reveals that several statistical academic science resource indicators reflected a period of growth during the mid-seventies. While this trend is expected to continue through the end of the seventies, the 9 percent increase in federal research and development (R&amp;D) funding to universities proposed in the President's 1981 budget is seen to permit little if any real growth in the early eighties. These highlights are presented: in dollars, one-tenth of the R&amp;D was spent by universities in 1979, as well as one-half of the basic research. Although annual growth in R&amp;D expenditures averaged 9 percent between 1972 and 1977, real growth was only 1 to 2 percent. During this period the life science dominated academic science and  engineering (S/E) resource increased. Graduate institutions increased their employment of S/E personnel by 3 to 6 percent. Overall in academe, part-time S/E personnel increased 35 percent, and full-time personnel increased 11 percent. S/E employees in R&amp;D increased at a full-time-equivalent rate of 22 percent; those in teaching increased 14 percent. In addition, the mid-seventies was a period of increased participation by women in acdemic science programs. Despite an overall decrease in graduate level enrollments in 1974-77, graduate enrollment in S/E rose, with part-time enrollment rising faster than full-time, and with women's and foreign student enrollment rising faster than the average. Data are presented in narrative and tabular form, with survey forms and instructions for fiscal  year 1977 appended. (MSE)",

It was set up to run over a few months rather than be an intensive session at the beginning of the faculty member's appointment. Program activities are outlined and the phases discussed. Workshops were offered in course unit writing, objectives and assessment, and course design. Participants were interviewed for their reactions to the program. The overall impression was that it was successful,  and although some activities appeared more valuable than others, all activities were of some value to someone. The timing was felt to be inappropriate to some. Most participants felt that other faculty should have such programs.

Continuing HBC leadership in promoting equal educational opportunity and in producing Black graduates is still seen as necessary in spite of the integration process. Recent achievements of these institutions include: expansion of curriculum offerings outside the traditional areas of education and social sciences, reflecting new career opportunities for Blacks; enrollment of 16 percent of the Blacks in higher education, and a third of the Blacks in those states in which the HBC's are located; awarding of over a third of all degrees awarded to Blacks nationwide, in 1975-76; and employment of over a third of the Black faculty and administrators/managers  in higher education nationwide. Fiscal constraints and lack of government support are noted: (1) expenditures for fiscal year 1975 were 99 percent of revenues; (2) in 1975, library holdings were considerably less, per capita student, than for higher education overall; (3) HBC's rely more heavily on federal funding, and receive less state funding, than other institutions; (4) in fiscal year 1979 the HBC's received only 4.4 percent of federal funds obligated to higher education institutions; and (5) HBC's continue to receive a very small portion of federal funds obligated for research and development.

The approach was originally developed at the University of South Carolina and has been replicated at other institutions. University 101 has provided faculty training through its 40 hour training workshops for over 400 faculty and professional staff. The faculty training is divided into four phases: building group trust, identifying learning objectives, interaction with learning resources, and linking with experienced University 101 faculty. The program  is designed to integrate faculty and professional staff in an effort that is both academic and humanistic in its orientation in order to reduce the barriers between them at the university.

The bill would allow an extension of the time by which hospitals are required to reduce their reliance on foreign medical graduates. In particular the bill would authorize: a two-year extension of the substantial disruption waiver authority for those hospitals that make a clear showing by means of a comprehensive plan that they are phasing down reliance on foreign medical graduates by recruiting U.S. medical graduates, improving the quality of the program, and attempting to use alternative health care providers. The bill suggests that the National Health Service Corps should play a  prominent part in providing medical services while hospitals and programs develop and implement their plans. Testimony by representatives of the federal government, the City and State of New York, and the medical community are presented.

        "description":"Two allocation methods for studying costs per student credit hour at Montana State University are compared. Both a long method and a short method, using the same source of data, were proposed prior to the study. The long method required much more effort, in that it considers every individual faculty member's salary and, for each faculty member, requires a series of calculations to allocate salary costs based on the person's individual teaching load. These individual calculations are then added to determine salary costs by level for each department. The shorter method differs only in that total teaching loads for each department are used to allocate total department faculty salaries, thereby eliminating individual calculations and directly arriving at departmental salary costs  distributed to levels of instruction. The rationale for use of the long method is examined. However, the university also maintained an additional worksheet so the short method could be used on exactly the same data. The comparison of the two methods shows not only that both methods produce similar results, but that the short method may even be more valid. (SW)",

NETMAN enables its users to obtain information such as personnel requirements, training requirements, and workload alternatives in such systems as the Marine Corps' Tactical Warfare Simulation, Evaluation, and Analysis System (TWSEAS). The model had received preliminary sensitivity testing, and a more thorough program was required. Consequently the Army Research Institute instituted a program to complete a formal model sensitivity test and validation, and define the role of such exercise control models in system design and redesign. This  report summarizes the first year's effort and provides the model validation results, including selection and collection of criterion data from actual military exercises and the comparison of model results against these measures. Conclusions indicate that the model can be used with increased confidence to predict the performance of training exercise control systems up to battalion level. (Author/LLS)",

Three simulated diagnostic tasks were developed: a simple context-free task, a complex context-free task, and a context-specific task (simulation of aircraft powerplants). The six studies evaluated the effects of computer aiding on the performance of each task and on subsequent unaided performance, using different task mixes, subjects (4 to 48 engineering or technical trainees), and conditions (self-pacing vs. forced pacing, feedback loops). Computer aiding reduced the number of tests required to diagnose simple problems and enhanced  subsequent unaided performance except when subjects were under time pressures. Training on the simple task with computer aiding first inhibited and then enhanced performance on the complex context-free task. Training on the context-free tasks improved performance on the context-specific task. Results provide a database for both theoretical issues in fault diagnosis and practical application of computer aiding to live system performance. (Author)",

A strategy for applying mnemonics and mnemotechnics to military training is then given. It is concluded that mnemonics and mnemotechnics have the potential to significantly enhance training effectiveness. However, if they are not carefully researched and implemented, it is likely that their training potential will be mitigated, if not entirely lost.

Although questions of adequacy or relevance are not addressed, the study does provide much detail regarding the structural characteristics of the ERIC journal and document literature. Posting data for CIJE and RIE are examined for each of the five equity groups within topical areas of attitudes, employment, counseling, and curriculum. Each of the 20 resulting combinations is  analyzed in terms of publication data classifications and comparisons are made based on content analyses among the five equity groups. RIE data are also examined in terms of cross classification of content dimensions. The study establishes significant relationships among the various dimensions and concludes that literature posted to each of the five groups is significantly different in most of the content categories.

Its specific objectives are to: (1) indicate the present status of cooperation between school and public libraries; (2) present a historical perspective within which to evaluate the progress of current efforts; (3) identify future trends and directions; (4) point out barriers to cooperation and factors leading to its success; (5) suggest outstanding sources which contain relevant insights about school/public library cooperation; and (6) identify some representative cooperative activities. As a structural framework, several functional categories are identified for the literature; in addition, a distinction is made between research-based and non-research-based documents.  Major areas treated in the non-research-based literature include history, legal bases for school/public library cooperation, cooperative techniques, factors leading to success, barriers, and trends in school/public library cooperation. Research-oriented studies of cooperation between school and public libraries, conducted on a more limited basis, are discussed in the categories of combined school/public libraries and less formal cooperative activities between school and public libraries.

A stepwise regression analysis was applied to assess the predictive value of the following independent variables: full- or part-time enrollment status, educational objectives, scores on English and math placement tests, sex, age, marital status, high school GPA, employment status, basic skills competency, educational goals, college choice, financial worry, defined career plans, and degree of student self-confidence. Study findings, based  on two separate regression equations for vocational and liberal arts students, indicate that while academic characteristics seemed more highly correlated with GPA and academic persistence than did personal characteristics, none of the independent variables could account for more than 20% of the variance in either of the dependent variables.

The study revealed that a total of 2,183 students graduated between July 1979 and June 1980, representing an 8% decrease over the previous year. Factors contributing to this decline included an increased proportion of part-time students, a lighter credit load carried by both full- and part-time students, and an increased proportion of non-classified students. Of the diplomas awarded, 48% were for Associate in Science degrees, 31% were for Associate in Arts degrees, and 21% were Certificates of Achievement. Liberal arts was the most popular program (709 diplomas were awarded), followed by secretarial science (122  diplomas), accounting (120), auto mechanics (108), food service (93), clerical (90), mid-management (80), practical nursing (67), hotel operations (54), and electronics (53). Distribution of graduates by sex varied by campus and program; females comprised 86% and 99% of the graduates in health and secretarial programs, respectively, and males comprised 84% of the graduates in technology programs.

This section also includes an examination of student assessment procedures used to determine the appropriate balance between core courses and basic skills courses.

The tables, which include fall term data for 1977, 1978, 1979, classify the transfer students by age, sex, race, date of entry into the university, number of quarter hours transferred from the community college, number of quarter hours earned toward a degree, community college of origin, grade point average (GPA), and academic major. Selected findings, based upon a comparison of the three years, indicate that the percentage of females transferring to the universities increased steadily, and that the percentage of Blacks and Hispanics, while rising between 1977 and 1978, decreased  slightly between 1978 and 1979. Most students earned more than 90 quarter hours at the community college before transferring to the university. While at the university, 85% of the transfer students earned a GPA of 2.0 or higher. This average varied from major to major, but was consistently higher for those transferring after earning 90 quarter hours than for those transferring with less than 90 hours credit. The total mean GPA of the transfer students decreased only slightly from 1977 to 1979, while the standard deviation remained constant. The tables present data by university and, in some cases, by college of origin. (JP)",

        "description":"Despite the strategic position the community college administrator occupies within the institution, there appears to be no definitive statement of administrative freedom and responsibility comparable to that available to faculty members. This is particularly surprising since many administrators are recruited from the ranks of faculty members, where they have historically enjoyed the support of academic freedom and tenure. This support, articulated and defended by the American Association of University Professors, has, despite abuses, assured freedom of teaching and research, as well as the economic security necessary in making the profession attractive to persons of ability. Although these tenets of freedom and tenure may not apply specifically to the administrative endeavor, it  is generally accepted that administrators should be free to seek the truth in their specialty, carry out the duties prescribed in their job descriptions, and implement decisions consistent with governing board policy. While the American Association of University Administrators has adopted a statement of Professional Standards for Administrators in Higher Education, this statement focuses primarily on the university setting. A statement of principles emanating from the national level would help clarify the issue of administrative freedom and deter the erosion of authority and influence currently experienced by college administrators.

Data collected on a 13-item student evaluation of instruction form were analyzed for ten departments for Spring 1973, Fall 1973, and Fall 1975. Instructors in five departments were advised of their mean ratings for all of the sections they taught on each of the items on the rating scale and were informed of the mean ratings on each item  for their respective departments. Instructors in the remaining five departments were given their own ratings and not the departmental means. Step-wise regression analyses were used to determine the relationships between the change in Spring 1973, Fall 1973, and Fall 1975 ratings and the five independent variables (sex, age, rank, tenure, and knowledge of relative standing). Findings indicate that none of the independent variables significantly accounted for variance in ratings after one semester or after the two-year period. (JP)",

Only business administration and nursing programs showed above average retention rates, while engineering  technology showed a lower than average rate. Other findings indicate that, after the sixth semester, graduation rates stabilize for all programs at approximately 5% to 6% per semester. Students with high school averages of 75% or above were twice as likely to graduate by the end of 12 semesters as students with averages below 70%.

The data, compared on a series of tables with findings from similar studies conducted annually since 1972, indicate that while 62% of the entering students were placed in remedial English or reading courses, 70% of the students actually enrolled in the courses.

Of the 1,283 known high school averages, 31% fell below .70 and 14% fell below .65. Since the  discontinuation of open admissions policies and the implementation of progress standards in 1976-77, the proportion of severely underprepared students (those with a high school average below .70) declined significantly in English and general academic achievement, but not in the areas of mathematics and foreign languages.

The next three articles deal with science instruction. Curtis Cox compares general education natural science courses with courses designed for science majors. Darrell Clowes  examines the two-year college science curriculum, its functions, and the courses designed to serve these functions. Thomas Doe discusses the instructional materials and practices used in mathematics courses. The final articles deal with liberal arts in general: Veloris Hallberg compares instructor goals and student evaluations among disciplines; Yukie Tokuyama reviews the instructional practices of humanities and social science faculty; Rose-Lise Obetz examines the use of instructional media in liberal arts; Kenneth Green focuses on faculty holding doctoral degrees; and Callie Bowles examines instructional differences in the sciences and humanities.

        "description":"The present definition of social services for young people should be extended beyond the provision of counseling and therapy to include the provision of help for those who do not have psychological problems. For example, the role of probation officers should include helping probationers find a job and keep it, return to school, or obtain other needed services. It is a fact, however, that the dominant form of social services to youth is counseling. Such an emphasis seems misplaced when the single greatest need of millions of young people is in the area of employment. In this respect, the work experiences created for teenagers should be evaluated to see if they provide worthwhile experiences and the educational needs of these young people should be reviewed with renewed care. Many  youth will need job readiness preparation in addition to skills and extensive support services while on a job, whether the job is subsidized or not. Additional problems demanding discussion are the role of social services in relation to the schools; the system of income maintenance and welfare assistance; juvenile justice policy; services to troubled youth at the community level; and federal foster care policy.

Children's sense of community changes as children increase their mobility, their independence and take on responsibility. Their understanding broadens to include a sense of boundaries, distance, and location, as well as spatial relationships of resources and organizations, demographic characteristics and group identity. Competent communities are characterized as those that accurately identify the needs of their citizenry and recognize the importance of the  experience of mastery and effectiveness for their citizens. Competent communities can be identified by their efforts in three areas: health and safety, responsiveness, and the enhancement of human potential. Involvement in and use of the environment depends on one's conceptualization of self within the context of the community. The more one understands one's own talents, aspirations, and motives, the more one seeks resources in the community to enhance or complement those elements of personality. In the adult stage of generativity, ideas about one's own needs and goals converge with one's understanding of the social community and interact to guide actions taken on behalf of future generations.

These categories are conversation, acquisition, social information, monitoring the environment, participation in activities, imitation of others, creative behaviors, expression of feelings, behaviors expressing self-concept, behaviors indicating security, changes in the child's own norm of social behavior, the teacher's feeling of how the child responds to him or her, peer teaching behaviors, ability to change the rules of a group, and adaptive behaviors. It is stressed that observations and  assessments should be theory-guided. It is assumed that behavioral and pedagogical theory is always operative in selecting assessment categories, and that this theory must be made as explicit as possible.

The study examines the underlying change philosophy of each program and the changes that families participating in the programs are undergoing. Three processes of change were proposed as a focus of study: cultural elaboration, cultural reorientation, and cultural reinforcement. Case studies were done of actual programs that exemplified these three processes. Researchers obtained data through participant-observation and interviewing methods. Conclusions about impact were based on self-reported statements by participants concerning changes in their  ideas or behaviors, and on analyses conducted by researchers concerning the match and mismatch between changes intended by programs and changes that parents reported. Each case study discusses: (1) the history, community context, setting, goals, organization, recruitment procedures, and curriculum of each program; (2) the lives of the parents who participate in the program; (3) a summary of the participants' evaluations and conclusions about the impact of the program; and (4) generalizations about the program and its participants as instances of the models of cultural change proposed. In addition, field work at a school-community liaison program is described in the Appendices. (Author/SS)",

Information is summarized under the following topics: (1) the value of toys and manufacturers' claims; (2) basics of the toy industry; (3) toy hazards and accidents; (4) guidelines for toy selection; (5) toy safety legislation and protection; and (6) toy libraries. Information from the areas of education and psychology, business and marketing, consumer protection agencies and toy safety indicate that the toy industry has done little to develop methods for testing the educational value and safety of toys, but has relied instead on the opinions of professionals. A basic condition of the toy industry is extreme competitiveness. Consumer criticism is strong and has spurred the  growth of toys marketed as safe and educational. Toy endorsements and labels which say &quot;tested by research&quot; are often misleading standards of toy safety. Statistics show that child injuries from toys are related to features such as the actions of the toys, damaged toys, and packaging. Toys which are inappropriate to the age and abilities of the child are also a major cause of injuries to young children. This factor should be taken into consideration in toy selection. Other criteria of toy safety and precautions are summarized and insights are offered about toy safety through analysis of toy safety legislation. Guidance in toy selection is also available through toy libraries. The operation, aims, resources, and potential uses of these are described. (Author/SS)",

Home Start was a three-year demonstration program which provided Head Start-type comprehensive services to young children (3- to 5-year-olds) and their families in their homes. In Chapter 1 background information is provided about the followup study design, including a brief description of the original Home Start evaluation and its results. The next two chapters address two key implementation issues. Chapter 2 reports on the tracking of Home Start and Head Start families who participated in the original evaluation. Also included in this chapter are descriptive profiles of the Home Start followup study sample and a report on sample  attrition effects. Chapter 3 describes how the comparison group for the followup study was selected and compares the Home Start and comparison groups on a number of child and family characteristics to determine group equivalency. Chapters 4 and 5 present the results of the followup study. Long-term program effects on parents are examined in Chapter 4, followed by presentation of child outcomes in Chapter 5. The concluding chapter of the report discusses implications of the Home Start followup study design. (Author/MP)",

An attempt was made to examine the durability of gains made as the result of families' (parents and their 3- to 5-year-old children) participation in the program. In addition, the study was designed to determine whether program duration (one versus two years) had a lasting effect on parents and children as measured approximately two years after the conclusion of the Home Start demonstration. The HSFS's sample consisted of 199 Home Start, 46 Head Start, and 137 comparison group families (families who were eligible for but did not participate in the program). Three sets of comparisons were conducted: (1) Home Start families versus the comparison group families; (2) Home Start families  versus Head Start families; and (3) Home Start families who had participated in the program for one year versus a group of Home Start families who participated in the program for two years. Five measures were used to determine the longterm impact of the program on participants. Four of the measures were standardized tests for children and one was a personal interview with parents. Results indicated that: (1) while math and reading performance of the Home Start first graders was lower than the national average, the Home Start second graders were comparable with respect to the national norm; (2) no significant differences were found on any of the children's outcome measures between the Home Start and the Head Start groups; (3) no differences were found between the one-year and two-year Home  Start groups; and (4) most families were pleased that they had been involved in the program and indicated that the activities concerning the child and learning about child growth and development had been most important for them.

        "description":"Some of the most used, misused, and abused terms in contemporary education are the words \"create,\"\"creative,\" and \"creativity.\" One way of understanding creativity is to reject the current practice of assuming that creative behavior is directly caused by some special kind of mental operation called \"creative thinking.\" What can be accepted is the fact that individuals constantly produce unique and new behaviors and prodwcts. Inherent in this position is the assumption that it is not the mental operations themselves which automatically generate creative outputs: rather, it is external criteria applied to unique, novel behaviors which ultimately determine the degree to which a person's output is \"creative.\" Educators should use the word \"novel\" to describe any new response or  product by an individual. The word \"creative\" should be used only when very specific external criteria have been met. Eleven categories of psychological variables that may influence the production of novelty are accident, accommodation, reproduction, duplication, fabrication, imitation, transfersion, substitution, experimentation, innovation, and generation. Criteria for assessing the creativity of a product or person can be described in terms of the product itself as an entity, the problem which it resolves, the field in which it is presented, and its out-of-field effects.

        "description":"This report of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation focuses on issues raised by the marketing of commercially prepared infant formulas that were nutritionally deficient. In this context, the report examines the scope of FDA authority to protect the public and the manner in which the FDA carries out its responsibilities with respect to product recalls. Additionally, the report reviews existing standards and regulations for infant formulas, and reports findings of an investigation into the manner in which one manufacturer, Syntex Laboratories Inc. of Palo Alto, California, complied with these regulations. This investigation revealed that over 100 infants became ill, some severely so, as a result of having been dependent on the formula for a long period of time. In  evaluating the actions of the FDA and this manufacturer, the subcommittee found that little had been done to minimize or prevent this affair. Consequently, it was recommended: (1) that congress enact legislation to create a separate category of food known as infant formula; (2) that infant formula contain all nutrients recognized as essential; (3) that the formula be tested at critical times for nutritional adequacy; and (4) that the FDA be given the ability to inspect records of infant formula manufacturers.

        "description":"This discussion explores children's understanding of the nature of distributive justice in classrooms and provides an initial model for further research. The issue of distributive justice arises in a situation when an individual assesses the fairness of the distribution of any limited resource, such as the physical, instructional and social opportunities present within schools. It appears that the understanding of distributive justice by children requires that they coordinate three domains of knowledge: (1) consequences of resource allocation; (2) criteria of deservingness; and (3) schemas which define fairness. Exploratory, semi-structured interviews were conducted among 25 children in a mixed kindergarten/first grade classroom and a mixed third/fourth grade classroom. The  interview data indicate that children know the consequences of resource allocation and that they also know what resources and how much of a resource they and others will receive as a result of a distribution. Criteria for deserving consist of attributes of individuals. Findings suggest that children attempt to coordinate consequences of resource allocation with criteria of deservingness. Further, children apparently employ formal reasoning as well as substantive declarations to justify the fairness of the relationship between resource allocation and deservingness. Three areas for further inquiry are specified in the conclusion. (Author/RH)",

Two assessment strategies were employed. One strategy (S1) was used to investigate the practical operation and effects of the program. The second strategy (S2) compared answers to interview questions provided by visited mothers, non-visited mothers residing in the visited mothers' locale, and non-visited mothers whose socioeconomic status was higher than visited mothers' status. Part One of the report provides a brief overview of the EHV and the evaluation program plus EHV background and operations information. Part Two introduces  S1, identifies theoretical issues of practical importance in such areas as language development, discipline strategies and cognitive development. Possible and probable long term personal and social effects of the program are also discussed. Part Three introduces S2 and assesses the impact of the EHV program on parents' attitudes, beliefs, expectations and perceptions of their problems, their role, their children, and if and how they can guide their children's development. The implications of the data for home visiting and EHV program design are explored in Part Four. The concluding section, Part Five, provides recommendations for action and further research.

The focus of the study was children's mastery of arithmetic operations in which they had displayed low achievement. Subjects, drawn from six elementary schools, were 40 children with a mean age of 8.4 years. The treatment consisted of providing children with a packet of instructional materials and having them engage in self-directed learning over a series of sessions under conditions involving a proximal goal, a distal goal, or no explicit goal. It was hypothesized that the motivational effects of the proximal goals would lead to higher  arithmetic achievement, self-efficacy, and interest, as compared to the other two conditions, and that self-percepts of efficacy would bear a significant, positive relationship to interest shown in arithmetic tasks. In accordance with the hypotheses the proximal-goal treatment produced more rapid mastery of arithmetic operations, a higher level of skill development, a stronger sense of self-efficacy, and greater interest in arithmetic than did the other conditions. The distal-goal condition did not differ from the no-goal condition in promoting change. Perceived self-efficacy concerning arithmetic competence was positively related to achievement and intrinsic interest in arithmetic. It was concluded that the study supports the idea that self-motivation generated through proximal goal  setting can influence children's achievement outcomes. (Author/MP)",

Five tasks, varying in degree of structure and difficulty, were used in mothers' interactions with their children at 24 and 36 months of age. Subjects were Mexican-American mothers and their children. All were participants in an extensive 2-year parent education program designed especially to meet the needs of low-income Mexican-American families. Families entered the project when the child was one year of age. Participants were randomly assigned to program or control groups and then each mother-child interaction was videotaped and rated at one minute intervals on the following scales: Affection, Praise, Criticism, Control, Reasoning, Mother's Verbal Encouragement,  and Child Verbal Responsiveness. The Bayley Mental Development Index (MDI) was used to measure the children's abilities at 24 months of age and Palmer's Concept Familiarity Index (CFI) and the Stanford-Binet (S-B) were used when the children were 36 months of age. Results showed that: (1) program and control mother-child dyads differed significantly on mean scores for Affection, Criticism, Child Verbalization, and Mother's Verbal Encouragement and that with the exception of Criticism, all differences favored the program group at both time intervals; (2) while significant correlations were found between mother-child interaction variables and measures of child cognitive competence, there were no distinct differences between tasks in these relationships; and (3) for both groups, the  correlates with measures of child competence were similar for high and low structure tasks while the relative stability of high and low structure tasks across time was also similar.

Measures of academic achievement were obtained from the standardized Science Research Associates test series for reading, language and mathematics. The 23 item Classroom Social Competence Scale (CSCS), reflecting the item content of the Kohn and Rosman (1972) Social Competence Scale was designed for this study to assess the children's  classroom social competence, along the behavioral dimensions of withdrawal (non-participation and aggression), disruption, and task orientation. The Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME), designed by Caldwell and Bradley (in press), was used to measure the quality of stimulation, and the social, emotional and cognitive support available for the child's development. Multivariate multiple procedures were used to test the existence of associations between the three variables. Results revealed significant relationships across the three sets of variables. Patterns of these relationships suggest that early experience prepares the child to meet not only intellectual performance requirements but also social performance requirements. (Author/MP)",

Primary schools in England and Wales are normally those with pupils between 5 to 11 years of age. The term Primary Schools encompasses Infant Schools (for children ages 5 to 7); Junior Schools (ages 7 to 11); First Schools (usually ages 5 to 8); and, in some cases, Middle Schools (usually ages 8 to 13). Numbering around 23,000, the English primary schools are co-educational, free and attended by over 95% of the nation's 4 million plus children. The paper first presents general background information concerning advisory/inspectorate bodies for policy and practice; physical plant, equipment and materials; teacher education and training; and  primary school ideologies. Current trends and issues discussed include (1) the general organization within the primary school, (2) declining enrollment and changing school organization, (3) curriculum organization and teaching style, (4) curriculum content, and (5) accountability and assessment. Recent key publications in education are identified and emphasized in order to discern possible future trends. Reports explored include the following: &quot;Primary Education in England&quot; (1978); &quot;Assessment - The American Experience&quot; (1978); &quot;Local Authority Arrangements for the School Curriculum&quot; (1978); and &quot;Inside the Primary Classroom&quot; (1980). In conclusion, 10 predictions for English primary education in the 1980s are briefly stated. A bibliography including selected recent and ongoing research is  provided as well as two appendices that provide notes on the primary education report and chart trends in the school population.

The sample consisted of 21 only children (children who did not acquire a sibling for at least the first 48 months of life) and 35 first born children (children who acquired a sibling between the ages of 24 and 36 months). Results indicated that differences in only and first born children were related to three possible sources of variation: (1) the birth of a sibling for first born children; (2) child characteristics; and (3) parent characteristics. The birth of a sibling was noted to change the cognitive performance of first born children and was related to a drop in  skill performance. This finding suggests that first born children are different from only children as a result of experiencing the entrance into the family of a new infant. Possible differences in the temperament characteristics of first born and only children were reflected in the tendency of only infants to cry more and smile less at 3 months of age than did first born infants. Finally, parents of only and first born children may be different: mothers of only borns were more involved in their infants, expressed the desire for less children, were older at the birth of their first child and experienced a more difficult pregnancy than mothers of first borns.

Forty-eight 4-year-old children (mean age, 4.65 years), and forty-eight 9-year-old children (mean age, 9.78 years) comprised the sample. In both age groups there was an equal number of boys and girls. The variable investigated was type of advertisement (low-nutritional, pro-nutritional, non-food control), and the effects of the advertisement were assessed via a behavioral eating test, a food attitude scale, and an interview. Results suggest that both 4-year-old and 9-year-old boys seeing low-nutrition commercials did significantly increase their consumption of the low-nutrition foods but that girls were not affected. The pro-nutrition commercials had no apparent effect.  Regardless of advertisement type, age did not mediate the effects of the commercials, and the self-report and behavioral measures correlated with one another in a low and inconsistent manner. Results are discussed with regard to methodological issues, developmental issues, and social policy implications. (Author/MP)",

        "description":"This study investigates the hypothesis that during adolescence the developmental increase in the tendency to use elaboration as an associative study strategy is explained by increases in metamemorial knowledge. Independent assessments of the metamemorial knowledge and spontaneous strategic behavior of 32 fifth- and 32 twelfth-grade subjects were made. To assess metamemorial knowledge subjects were presented nine hypothetical memory problems and asked for their opinions on strategies for best remembering the material. Scoring took into account choice of strategy and justification of that choice. Strategic behavior was obtained by asking the subjects to verbalize their thoughts while studying each of 36 pairs of concrete nouns by the study-test paired associate method.  Verbalizations for each of the pairs were classified into one of 15 categories by two independent raters on the basis of a transcribed record of the tape recorded study trial. Verbalizations were labeled &quot;elaboration&quot; if a direct interaction between the pair members was described. As hypothesied, grade-related advances in metamesorial knowledge appeared to be a powerful predictor of grade differences in use of elaborative strategies. However, results indicate that relevant metamemorial knowledge is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for elaboration. (Author/SS)",

        "description":"Attempts to assess maternal and neonatal behavior and subsequent mother-infant interactions as potential determinants of the quality of attachment between mothers and their infants provide the focus of this paper. Several instruments and procedures that focused on (1) maternal and infant characteristics, (2) mother-infant interaction, and (3) life stress, were used to collect data from 212 high risk pairs of mothers and infants. The collection of data began during the prenatal period and continued through the infant's first year of life. Attachment was assessed when the babies were 12 months of age. Using the Strange Situation Procedure researchers classified infants as anxious/avodiant (Group A), securely attached (Group B), or anxious/resistant (Group C). Overall group  differences among the three attachment groups were tested by a one-way ANOVA and the Student-Newman-Keuls was used for post hoc comparisons. Results indicate that maternal, neonatal, and interactive factors contribute to the development of qualitatively different attachment relationships. Anxious/resistant infants appear to develop more slowly than others. Mothers of anxious/avodiant infants tend to be tense, irritable, disinterested in their babies, and react negatively to motherhood. Securely attached infants tend to have mothers who are sensitive to their needs and who encourage reciprocity. While male infants tend to be more vulnerable to caretaking differences, female infants may be more vulnerable to stressful life events than males are. (Author/RH)",

Twenty-four middle-class children attending a university-affiliated preschool were observed for 20 one-minute play observations during the Spring Semesters of 1978 and 1979. Play was coded using categories for both social (solitary, onlooker, parallel, and interactive) and cognitive (functional, constructive, and imaginative) components. Imaginative play was further scored for number and type of transformations (person, object, situations) and for thematic content (sociodramatic or fantasy). During each semester, children were administered the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (Form B) and the Ravens Progressive Matrices tests of intelligence, and a battery of  classification (dichotomous sort, cross-classification, and class inclusion) and conservation (liquid substance, number, length, area, and weight) tasks. Pairing of play and cognitive test change scores from year one to year two revealed that, generally more children increased in cognitive ability without increasing in imaginative play than did those who increased in dramatic play without increasing in cognitive ability. Results suggest that directional influence between these two variables moves from cognitive ability to imaginative play and not vice versa. (Author/RH)",

The goal of the therapeutic preschool is to meet the needs of behaviorally disordered and emotionally disturbed children in a special education setting, and then to mainstream the children into less restrictive settings as soon as possible. Eight program elements that can be combined to create a therapeutic daycare program are as follows: (1) a developmental evaluation and behavior observation made prior to admittance in the program; (2) planned structure in the areas of space, time, relationships and knowledge; (3) use of behavior modification procedures at several levels; (4) a mental health curriculum designed to focus on  identification of emotions, acceptance of feelings, and ways to cope with and solve social problems; (5) one-to-one remediation sessions with therapists; (6) a high staff-to-child ratio and staff relationships characterized by consistency, the ability to increase prosocial behavior and decrease inappropriate behavior, and the ability to reflect and interpret children's feelings; (7) parent involvement; and (8) follow-up procedures at several intervals subsequent to the child's discharge from the program. This sort of program can alleviate presently distressful symptoms for the child and his family, and can help prevent mental health problems from occurring at a later life stage. (Author/SS)",

A cognitive factor, reinforcement value, was also hypothesized to be a significant variable in the behavior of the children. Prior to treatment, subjects rated 15 toys for reinforcement value by coloring either a \"happy\" or a \"sad\" face to indicate like or dislike, respectively. Ratings were used to match subjects in experimental and control groups. Thirty-two first and second grade boys and girls then viewed and rated for reinforcement value 15 videotaped vignettes in each of which an adult male used one of 15 toys to perform one of 15 different aggressive acts against a bobo doll.  Control group children did not view the vignettes. Following the vignettes, combined vignette and pre-experimental toy ratings were used as a basis for selecting eight toys for placement in a play room which contained a bobo doll. Subjects were observed at play in the room for five minutes by trained observers who recorded aggressive behavior. Among the results it was found that experimental group children exhibited significantly more aggressive behaviors than did control subjects, that boys exhibited significantly more imitative aggression than did girls. Further, reinforcement value was a significant factor in the imitative behavior of the children. (Author/RH)",

Raising swine and beef cows, dairying, and  improving land use for hay and pasturing were among the primary enterprises. Forty percent of the families increased their net income, worth and savings over the previous year, indicating that better management can increase income. Improvement in the quality of life was appraised by assessing the increase in home gardening, which reduced food costs, improved diet and health, and provided enjoyable family activities; and the improvement of family resources, which increased food preservation and production, improved farm and home record management, and promoted home weatherization practices.

Unusually high numbers of fatalities/injuries are found among the aged and minorities after natural disasters. This fact may be partially attributed to physiological deficiencies, sociocultural factors, and/or economic circumstances of the elderly and minorities. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the psychological impact of disasters on the elderly, therefore other mitigating variables need to be explored before age differences in emotional adaptation can be  more fully understood. In addition to natural disasters, life-threatening events may take the form of illness or injury of self or loved one, war, vehicular accidents, explosions, collapse of buildings. This research review manifests some methodological concerns (issues of cultural encapsulation, culturally sensitive classifications, the influence of folk beliefs on decision-making, and appropriateness of survey instruments/ items/scaling procedures) and underscores the need for future studies of the aging process, ethnicity, and adaptation to the stresses in life.

According to a 1976 study by Kuvlesky and Edington, there is a strong tendency for particular ethnic patterns to exist in the occupational aspirations of rural disadvantaged youth. There is also great intracategory variability for each ethnic-gender type. Findings over a 10-year period indicate that Mexican American youth are socially, culturally, and psychologically bi-ethnic but that they vary in terms of what ethnic subculture traits they want to maintain and in what social contexts they desire  to interact with Anglos. In general, Mexican American girls are more comfortable in bi-ethnic work situations than are many Mexican American boys. Though youth vary in the type of employment they want and need, they are very concerned about getting employment and earning money. There is a shortage of jobs for disadvantaged rural youth and a lack of diversity in those jobs that are available. A state and federally funded national policy aimed at improving employment opportunities, social and work skills, and counseling services for disadvantaged rural youth is one means of correcting this situation.

        "description":"Since the phenomenon of reabuse is postulated as being more probable after initial child abuse than is the probability of an initial abuse and since only modest inquiry has been directed at this phenomenon, research was conducted to answer two questions: Is there patterning to reabuse? And if so, is this different in metro and nonmetro environments? Data were derived from the official Wisconsin Central Registry of Child Abuse reports for January/1973 - May/1978, during which time a very structured instrument was used for 10,666 reports. General variable areas investigated were geographical environment, abuse incident characteristics, demographic characteristics, and case management by the social worker. Of the certain or legally established cases, 2,439 (56.5%) were metro and  1,874 (43.5%) were nonmetro cases. This constituted an averaged annual abuse rate of 48.3 metro and 54.1 nonmetro per 100,000 children. Retained for analysis were 310 reports (152 metro/158 nonmetro) where reabuse had occured and had been recorded. This constituted an averaged annual reabuse rate of 0.30 metro and 0.46 nonmetro per 100,000 children. It was concluded that there was patterning but not very strong and that the patterning was somewhat different in metro/nonmetro areas. It was also concluded that the model developed for forecasting was only slightly better than chance. (AN)",

        "description":"The persons and groups who held lead roles in the development of an electricity generating plant near Craig, Colorado, and/or aided in problem solving activities are the concerns of this examination of boomtown studies in which field theory is employed as a framework for assessing Craig's community structure characteristics. The usefulness of field theory is assessed in regard to enhancing a locality's capacity to deal with the boomtown phenomenon. A segmented community structure in Craig is exposed by an analysis of the actions taken by various persons and groups (including constructing new schools); and a common theme is revealed by a review of other boomtown studies, namely, that managing rapid change in a community is possible if local residents and groups can work  cooperatively in identifying and solving common problems. It is concluded that field theory can provide a framework for the development of a local structure which can effectively plan for change, a structure that establishes programs which are comprehensive as to interests and coordinated as to effort. It is also concluded that if Craig and other boomtowns could have developed this type of coordinated local structure, the negative consequences of the boom on the host community would have been minimized.

Problem areas and policy suggestions are presented as follows: (1) diversity and isolation cause rural poverty to differ from urban poverty, and policy development must acknowledge this difference; (2) changing patterns in rural growth and settlement necessitate the application of new forms of organization and technology for more effective planning and services in rapidly growing isolated areas; (3) the increasingly nonagricultural character of rural areas effects rural economy  (therefore, economic development policy should address the needs of the entire rural population); (4) economic and political natures of local governments must be understood in order to correlate their actions and effectiveness in the framework of federal capacity building; and (5) 1976 analysis of federal spending in rural America illustrates difficulties in assessing the equity of federal spending for rural health, education, and manpower programs. More study is needed regarding urban bias and federal policy for adequate rural programs. (JD)",

Each strategy was identified as addressing variables within the educational system or as external to the educational system. The 14 rural school improvement strategies were analyzed in terms of the success of each  community project, as determined by the durability of the program over time and its continuing contributions to its original objectives. Conclusions were that improvement efforts in rural schools must be based on the reality of rural circumstances, and must include problem defining, planning, and implementing at the local level, as well as incorporating assistance from professionals and agencies outside the community.

The median number of school grades completed for the sample was 6.04 years. The respondents were considered to be more  politically than socially participative, with blacks being more involved than whites. A high level of motivation to work and desire to do a good job was indicated. Authoritarianism and alienation were characteristic of the sample. A sense of community solidarity was generally lacking.

Most teachers surveyed had little or no formal coursework pertaining to the marine sciences. The teachers felt they did not have adequate knowledge for teaching most marine-related topics. Most familiar topics were rated as highest in importance. A variety of teaching strategies and approaches were identified as suitable for presenting marine education concepts. (Author/BW)",

The review illustrates that children's meanings for words differ from adult meanings. The nature and findings of several research projects are discussed and it is concluded that while there are many limitations to the studies reported, there are several general and specific trends worth noting. Children's first meanings for terms can be viewed as incomplete and incorporating additional features as part of their meaning that are not part of adult meanings. Teachers of young children should be aware of the many diverse situations in which terms are used, and should listen more to children in natural language  contexts where they exhibit spontaneous use of terms. The stated purpose of this paper is to emphasize the need for mathematics education research that focuses on lingusitic variables as well as cognitive ones. (MP)",

Literature can enhance the learning of science by providing students with more appealing materials which will motivate them to pursue their interests and explore real-life issues. Appealing materials increase student interests in science and stimulate higher-order thinking while increasing the levels at which students read, write, converse, and learn independently. Examples are given of literature integrated into science in the form of one-act plays, periodicals, bibliographies, science fiction, and non-fiction. Literature presents the human side of science and provides opportunities for students to experience issues which frequently confront scientists in real life. (Author/DS)",

An attribution pattern variable (ATTPAT) was created to categorize individuals studied into three groups. The first group had an attribution pattern thought to lead to generalized low expectancies for success. Students classified as &quot;high&quot; were in the second level of ATTPAT, and pupils placed in the third level were those who could not be categorized within either of the first two groups. It was found that a student's perceptions about how others viewed him constituted important causal variables in both years of the study. Interest in and the rated importance of mathematics by students was heavily affected by performance in the second year of the study  only. In general, the results and analysis indicated that notions about the functions of attribution patterns may need to be seriously revised. Factors identified as calling for further study include more explicit specification of hypotheses, models, and predictions about the causal role of attributions, with particular regard to the direction and magnitude of effects. Neither the grade level of the students nor the mathematics being studied is specified. (MP)",

It is hypothesized that effective human problem solvers first generate some type of &quot;physical model&quot; and use this model to create a mathematical one. Further, the development of a model requires children to make three types of abstractions from a story. These are: making an abstraction of the (1) objects described, (2) locations or possessors of the sets, and (3) operations or relationships described. The type of physical model involved in the study is &quot;operations on sets.&quot; The focus of the research is on student attempts to answer addition and substraction problems. Four components  identified in tasks of abstraction are: set identity, set numerosity, operation on sets, and identity of answer set. The study results review each identified component, identify some pupil difficulties, and support several specific conclusions concerning pupil success with each aspect of abstraction. Also included are suggested steps for aiding students experiencing specific difficulties. (Author/MP)",

The problem chosen is based on an apparent discrepancy between the present school programs and Piaget's theory concerning the grade level at which the volume algorithm should be introduced. Subjects were chosen from three suburban schools in British Columbia and classified as conservers, partial conservers, and non-conservers, using a judgment-based test of volume conservation. The students were divided into three groups, two designated as experimental and one as a control group. One experimental group was taught the algorithm with  the standard approach used in North America, with the second experimental group taught with a method emphasizing multiplication skills. Data showed that sixth graders could apply the volume algorithm to computation and comprehension questions regardless of their volume conservation level. There was also noted improvement of students' conservation levels regardless of their volume achievement scores or their treatments. (MP)",

The project was carried out in Northern Alberta (Zone 1) during the 1978-79 school year. The revised mathematics curriculum, introduced in 1977, presents the mathematics content within five &quot;strands&quot; of Number, Operations and Properties, Measurement, Geometry, and Graphing, at all 6 elementary grade levels. Metric measurement, decimal fractions, and motion geometry are among the program's most prominent components. Criterion-referenced mathematics tests were designed to assess pupil understanding of specific content objectives, with the Zone One Testing Project  centering on 5 specific questions related to the new mathematics program and applications of the test results. A variety of conclusions from the tests are given in this report, along with uses of student profile computer print-outs that were a product of the study. The paper concludes with implications of results of the study for the mathematics curriculum and several recommendations for further research. (MP)",

        "description":"Prepared by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Education in response to a request by President Carter for information on the condition of science and engineering education in America, this document contains data showing a decline in the general understanding of science and technology among secondary school students. Although scientific and technical literacy are increasingly necessary in our society, high school students are dropping out of science and mathematics courses after the tenth grade, resulting in a citizenry lacking understanding of the increasingly technically complex world. While data from econometric projections indicate that, with a few exceptions, there should be adequate numbers of engineers and scientists at all degree levels to fill available  positions in 1980, concern also needs to be given to the education of engineers, scientists, and technicians. Suggestions for actions to alleviate these and related problems and to refocus efforts for upgrading education for the citizen as well as for the specialist are included in this report. Positive action is needed so that all citizens have the scientific and technical understanding to participate in an increasingly complex society and so that technical and professional personnel remain on the cutting edge of scientific and technical progress.

        "author":["Hatcher, Barbara"],
        "description":"This paper discusses four key concepts to help preschool and primary grade children develop the ability to read and understand maps. Examples of student activities to develop each of the concepts are provided. The essential concepts are representation, symbolization, perspective, and scale. Representation is vital. Children must perceive that a map represents something else--a place. Block building provides an excellent opportunity for young children to develop an understanding of representation. By using non-thematic blocks, children can create with the blocks, the entity of their choice. Second, children need to know that a map is a symbol for a place that it uses other symbols such as colors for land and water and lines for roads and highways. Three activities to increase the  understanding that a symbol represents a real or actual thing are \"Lotto Match\" in which children pair three dimensional items to two dimensional drawings of the same thing; having children write experience stories using pictures from magazines or drawings; and the game \"Symbo\" played like bingo in which children designate the correct sign for a river, desert, airport, school, and other map legend symbols. Perspective, the third essential, is difficult for young children and may not be fully developed until later. However, a foundation for future understanding can be provided. Children should be given many opportunities to view objects from above by taking field trips to tall buildings and observation towers. To help children discover that maps are drawn to show only the tops of things,  not the vertical features, children can build towers and trace the shape of each block in the tower. In teaching the fourth essential, the concept of scale, emphasis should be placed on how maps show things as they are, only smaller. The scales of distance should be left to older children. Photographs of children can be displayed noting that pictures are just like the student, only not as large. (Author/RM)",

Chapter III explains the system and interrelationships of laws at federal, state, and local levels. The four sources of law--constitutions, statutes, court decisions, and administrative regulations--are also discussed. Chapter IV provides an overview of the litigation process, specifically, what litigation is, who litigates, how, and where. Chapter V describes how to research the law. The intricacies of law  libraries and indices and digests of laws are discussed. Chapter VI illustrates how to build a case on behalf of a client or constituency. An example based on an actual case is provided. Chapter VII addresses methods for systemic change and community organizing. Concepts discussed include power, reasons for inaction, and change strategies. The document concludes with a brief bibliography. (KC)",

Demographic data include total population and percent of change, land use, number of households, number of births and birth rate, and number of children under five per 1,000 women. Social statistics categorize population according to ethnic group and number and percent of population under 18, under 5, between 5 and 17, between 18 and 64, and 65 and older. The number of families with female head, no  husband present, are also counted. Economic statistics reveal median family income, 1969 to 1975; per capita personal income; and median income by race and sex according to high school graduates and those with four or more years of college. The number of families below poverty level, labor force, unemployment, and major occupational groups are also included. Educational statistics depict total enrollment in public and private elementary and secondary schools and estimated number of high school graduates. Enrollment is categorized according to handicapped, sex, ethnicity, and English as a second language. Statistics for public and private institutions of higher education are also included.

        "description":"A study to analyze individual differences in interpersonal styles of students and to identify behavioral differences in student interactions with adults and peers is reported. The sample consisted of 18 high school males who were observed during two normal school days. Students were observed according to interactions with other students, adults, males, or females; settings where interactions occur; and content and affective style of the interactions. Results reveal five interactive styles: Group One demonstrates an average amount of interaction; Group Two, a great deal of interaction with peers and little interaction with adults; Group Three, little interaction with peers and a great deal with adults; Group Four, extremely verbal and high participators; and Group Five, low  participators. Group One individuals fit into the school because they are willing to maintain a \"student role\" at the expense of allowing a more authentic self to emerge. Groups Two and Three probably engage students in one fashion and adults in another; more research is needed to determine their methods of interaction. Group Four persons dominate interactions so totally that it is difficult for others to make an impact on their world view. Subjects included in Group Five demonstrate some possibilities for maladaption. They view themselves as outsiders and appear anxious and unable to communicate. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"This review of research examines responses of women and black social scientists to discrimination within their disciplines. The attitudes of male social scientists toward these two groups are also examined. Although the difficulties experienced by women and blacks in the social sciences have been reduced in recent years, in actuality only a few have been able to cross long-standing barriers. Much of the change can be attributed to governmental policy concerning discrimination rather than originating from the discipline itself. Research indicates that many white males oppose government policies and try systematically to evade them or postpone compliance. Ironically, until quite recently women and blacks have been defined by the dominant white males in the social sciences. However,  a mark of the elevated consciousness of these two underprivileged groups is their intense redefinition of themselves. These actions have several serious consequences. They raise misgivings about the way power and privilege are allocated, provide stimulus for social change, question social science wisdom concerning both sex and race differences and the methods employed in researching women and blacks. In short, actions by women and blacks in the social sciences have created reservations about the ability of white male social scientists to study in a detached and objective way groups about which they are likely to have strong subjective feelings.

        "description":"This paper discusses a study to determine attitudes among women in the field of social work regarding opportunities for professional advancement. Specifically, the study investigated whether female social workers noticed differences in opportunity among males and females to be recruited to management positions and to hold management positions once they were recruited. The study also compared perceptions of women who desire administrative positions and those who do not. A random sample of 1,000 female members of the National Association of Social Workers received a five-page questionnaire. Among other background statistics which were collected, a breakdown by administrative status and desire for administrative positions became the basis for analyzing responses. Questions covered  sexist practices in hiring, personal/professional conflicts, need for aggressiveness, role models, and personal and organizational supports. A major finding was that women who are non-administrators with desire to be, perceive sexist practices at a higher level, see a need to be aggressive to get ahead, undergo more professional conflict, and desire more organizational support for their career goals. The author suggests that training programs be developed for women seeking management positions. These programs should teach women to be competitive, take and give criticism, develop role models, use language and code words, develop networks of contacts, take risks, develop stamina, and never expect praise.

It is part of a series of reports surveying statewide basic curriculum data. Data were collected in 1977 from 459 public junior high schools and 704 public high schools. The document is intended for use by school administrators, school board members, teachers, parents, legislators, and others who have a role in making decisions about public education in Illinois. Specifically, the data can help educational policy makers by providing background data on issues including modifying programs in light of declining enrollments, reallocating resources, and assessing the impact of federal regulations and state laws mandating equal access to all school programs  for boys and girls. In addition to information on course offerings, information is presented on school size and community type (central city, suburb, independent city, or rural). Highlights of the report are that every Illinois secondary school offers social studies courses; United States history is required of all students for graduation from eighth grade and high school; there is no direct relationship between the frequency with which a course is offered at the high school level and the level of enrollment; over 50% of the high school social studies courses are electives; there are no sex differences in enrollment in social studies courses; enrollment declines may induce schools to reduce the number of social studies courses; and competency testing in the social studies is becoming  increasingly broadened.

Reasons for this include inflation, unemployment, a low rate of productivity, the flow of U.S. funds to OPEC nations, an unfavorable balance of trade, and the unstable international environment. In view of these factors, some analysts predict that the 1980s will be a decade of weakness in real income for consumers and caution in family financial management. However, changing demographic statistics may indicate a more positive consumer climate in the future. During the next 20 years the 35-54 age group will increase dramatically. This age group traditionally is one of high earning capacity. Population growth will slow down. More wives will enter the work force,  thereby making dual-earner families the norm and increasing household income. Senior citizens will comprise a lucrative and expanding market. The results of increased incomes will probably mean the expansion of affluence in the middle and working classes. Life styles will reflect themes of self-gratification, enhancement of personal health and well-being, smaller and more efficient housing, more cosmopolitan consumer tastes, and dependence on services and products that facilitate essential living activities.

        "description":"This paper reports on a study of the components of political leadership and emphasizes problems of women in attaining positions of political leadership. The authors use the term political leadership to describe the decision-making mechanism within organizations. First they review their survey of the personnel of a large organization. Respondents were asked how they thought about their organization in terms of issues including politics, satisfaction and loyalty, organizational flexibility, and perceptions of elitism. Responses of men and women were compared. The more women saw the organization as being political, the more likely they were to view it in a negative (elite) rather than positive (flexible) way and the less likely they were to be satisfied and loyal to it. Men saw the  organization as political and were more positive and satisfied at higher levels within it. A review of literature revealed that political behavior is predominant at high levels of decision making within organizations and that informal friendship and information-sharing coalitions are vital to successful leaders. Women are poorly prepared for high level leadership positions because of their early socialization to be nurturing, role conflicts between masculine and feminine behaviors, and the tendency of male leaders to want to keep their power cliques homogeneous. The authors suggest that women seeking political leadership develop coalitions to generate support, operate opportunistically, disclose positions strategically, always have an option when negotiating, use humor, and be clear on  willingness to take risks.

        "description":"This paper is a guide for determining how to measure the goals of citizen education programs. It presents a procedure by which educators or evaluators can identify program goals and determine what types of measures can best assess achievement of the goals. It does not suggest specific tests or measurement instruments; those can be developed or selected on the basis of the procedure outlined in this paper. The opening sections discuss four categories of possible program goals: knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors. Each type of goal must be measured in a different way, based on clarification of the goal's content and determination of the appropriate measurement format. For example, skill goals should be measured with performance tests whereas behavioral goals should be  assessed by observational procedures. A lengthy appendix presents 16 sample outlines for reviewing measurement criteria for various goals in each of the four areas of knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors. Each sample outline states a goal, clarifies its content, relates it to citizenship, and explains its implications for the type of measurement best suited to it. (AV)",

        "description":"This paper discusses a needs assessment study undertaken to determine student attitudes toward womens studies. Specifically it proposes a male/female relations course and outlines a data-based approach for teaching a college level communication dynamics course based on the assessment. The needs assessment sample consisted of 481 students at Rutgers University. A 30-item questionnaire directed respondents to select up to nine high interest topics from a list of 20. Findings indicated that students were most interested in male/female roles and stereotypes, practical exercises to improve communication with the opposite sex, sexuality as an influence on interpersonal communication, and nonverbal communication differences between men and women. They were least interested in an  historical overview of male/female liberation movements and research strategies for studying sex roles and communication. Findings also indicated that 53% of respondents would probably register for the proposed course and that there were few differences according to gender and/or academic major. A course based on this needs assessment set the following objectives: to help students understand role theory, consider the advantages and disadvantages of roles affecting interpersonal relationships, become aware of gender role stereotyping in mass media, recognize verbal and nonverbal communication differences between men and women, and be able to use behavioral science approaches to studying gender role dynamics. Activities recommended to achieve these objectives included keeping a journal,  preparing written answers to assigned reading, discussing issues in class, and writing research reports. The document concludes with a copy of the course survey, the assessment questionnaire, footnotes, and additional reference materials. (DB)",

        "author":["Berkowitz, Marvin W."],
        "description":"A basic assumption regarding moral development and a critical corollary to this assumption are analyzed. The assumption, advanced by Lawrence Kohlberg, is that moral education requires a group discussion leader who can pitch moral arguments one stage above (plus 1) the majority of the class. The corollary to this assumption, based on critical studies by Jack Fraenkel and R.A. Wilkins, argues that most teachers are not developmentally advanced enough to consistently produce such plus 1 arguments. The paper states that the corollary is invalid because it is based on data referring to specific instances of reasoning rather than on a spontaneous capacity to reason. Further, by comparing some of his own data with data collected by other researchers, Wilkins followed an irregular and  questionable procedure. Although these critiques lead one to question the empirical basis for the critique of the feasibility of the plus 1 moral convention, it does not mean that Kohlberg's initial assumption regarding the plus 1 convention is correct. In fact, one can question this convention from at least two standpoints: 1) Is the one stage discrepancy really the most appropriate indicator of successful classroom moral education?, and 2) Is a teacher-student discrepancy necessary for successful moral education? The conclusion, which rests on findings often overlooked in the moral education literature, is that moral development is closely related to the degree of heterogeneity of student moral reasoning in the classroom and that leaderless discussion groups are just as valuable for  moral development as are teacher-led discussions.

The program, mandated by the Illinois State Legislature, is intended to provide students with the unique opportunity to learn about the entire election process through actual voting experience. The two guides--&quot;Speak Out&quot; for elementary teachers and &quot;Election '80&quot; for secondary teachers--include background information for the teachers, procedures for conducting the election, classroom activities for students, and materials simulating actual forms necessary for conducting an election. The guides recommend that the election activity be conducted on the day of the General Election, November 4. The candidates for State  animal are limited to the following: raccoon, fox squirrel, white-tailed deer, opossum, and two other animals nominated by the Illinois State Museum. Students learn about the candidates through readings and campaign speeches. Students learn about voter qualifications, absentee voting, and voting procedures. They register to vote, put out a notice of election, and serve as judges of elections and as pollwatchers. Other activities in which students are involved include classroom discussions, crossword puzzles, and interviews with adults to learn why they think voting is important. Although written specifically for use in Illinois, the guides can easily be used by teachers in other states. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"This publication describes what approximately 100 groups around the country are doing with regard to food, housing, energy, and health to beat inflation on the neighborhood level. The book is intended as a resource for citizens wishing to take the kind of consumer action that will save them and their neighbors money. Some of the programs featured are saving families hundreds of dollars annually. For instance, several groups are promoting community and backyard gardening. In 1979, backyard and community gardening projects nationwide produced $13 billion worth of produce. Another example is a corporate-sponsored ridesharing program in California which saves commuters $4 million in commuting costs and an estimated two million gallons of gasoline each year. Other groups have found  less tangible ways to save while making life more enjoyable for those they serve. For example, some organizations are giving residents a new sense of pride by revitalizing their neighborhoods. In St. Louis, a dynamic innercity group has renovated $15 million worth of housing, created jobs for 450 residents by luring a shoe factory into the area, and opened a low-cost medical clinic. Many groups are fighting inflation by finding alternatives to the traditional marketplace. They have developed programs to promote medical self-care, food co-ops, and self-help home repairs. In New York City, for example, a homelike childbearing center offers residents an alternative to traditional hospitals. Still other groups are using old-fashioned political methods to achieve their goals. For example, in  Cape Cod, Massachusetts a citizens coalition successfully lobbied a local hospital to adhere to a Federal law and provide emergency care for poor people. In addition to the descriptions of group projects, the resource contains lists of organizations that are eager to help consumer groups nationwide by providing published materials, technical assistance, or in some cases, funding. Information on federal programs that will be of assistance is also provided. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"Three major studies of the role of teachers and other school district professionals in educational decision making and in initiating innovations, spanning the 1968-1973 time period, are reviewed and compared. A probable increase in the role of teachers as initiators of innovations is evident. Data on teachers and others as innovation initiators are shown to vary by: (1) the job position of the informant; (2) the size of the district; (3) the wealth of the district; (4) the grade level of the school; and (5) the level of professionalism of the instructional staff. Teacher participation in educational decision making is most evident in curriculum and instruction, but it is usually confined to advisory or collaborative roles except for areas under the teacher's direct control, such  as methods of instruction and scheduling. There is evidence that school district size and wealth, and teacher professionalism, as well as the school's organizational structure affect levels and kinds of teacher participation. It is suggested that it may be a minority of teachers who are repeatedly involved in the initiation of educational innovations, and that major innovations tend to be initiated by and decided on by administrators.

Issues facing teacher education are put in a socio-historical context. It is stated that teacher training has been largely separated from the public school system, and that training has been overloaded with pedagogical theory before the prospective teacher's experience is broad enough to absorb it. The potential institutional arrangements required for a professional school of pedagogy are examined. A proposed program in pedagogical education is presented, with its focus on the ability to do the job for which training is given. This program is mainly field-based with the campus serving for basic field preparation. Types of  knowledge are identified and their characteristics discussed by showing how each type functions in teaching behavior. What is known about how to teach skills and concepts to teachers is delineated. The final section presents ways to bring about the proposed changes. The role and responsibilities of college faculty and what sort of coalitions will be necessary to effect new policies and programs of pedagogical education are discussed. (JD)",

Process steps for planning and developing inservice programs based in teacher centers are outlined. The role of the central planning committee is crucial to the establishment of a successful teacher center. The responsibilities of this committee include setting policy, securing operating funds, selecting client groups, monitoring programs, and providing direction for the program in general. In identifying needs for a center, the teachers themselves are an integral element in and should be well represented on the central committee. Cooperative planning for a teacher center involves not only the assessment of needs, but the identification of problems, and use of  educational resources and research results in solving the problems. These activities should be collectively addressed by all center personnel working together in teams or on committees. Planning sequences are provided in this publication with sample worksheets that may be used to establish priorities, plan actual workshops, select materials, and evaluate and review procedures.

The potential for systemic educational programs is described, models of programs are presented, and implications for teacher education are discussed. The dimensions of educational systems and change are outlined in the first two chapters. Chapters 3 and 4 focus on changing people. The attitudes, aptitudes, perspectives, and values of the professional staff to be trained, the trainers of the staff, and the  community as a composite of individuals, are considered as interacting elements in the change process. The fifth and sixth chapters examine inservice education from the communication/organizational perspective. The structures for staff development programs are described in rural and urban setings. The last section considers programs and their development. Emphasis is placed on the importance of needs assessment in developing an inservice program. An approach to planning that has proved effective in a number of workshops is provided. (JD)",

        "description":"The primary purpose of the reported survey was to identify the extent of cooperative arrangements between local school districts and institutions of higher education (IHE's) with approved teacher education programs. The survey also sought information on current service activities that IHE's are engaged in with school districts and the potential need areas in their future relationship with school districts. The survey population consisted of teacher education contact persons working at the IHE's. These individuals act as liaison between the IHE and the Pennsylvania State Department of Education. Results indicate that although there is widespread activity on many program levels, there does not seem to be a significant difference in the organizational activity level. Both individual  professors and the institutions, as a whole, are equally engaged in cooperative activities with local school districts. There appears to be a slight movement towards a greater sharing of resources through information dissemination, exchange of materials, formalized referral systems, and personnel exchange. This movement reflects a need felt by both the school system and the IHE's. Other needs identified were: (1) more information available on educational innovations; (2) consortial arrangements for developing and providing cooperative programs; (3) information about resources and technical assistance; and (4) maintaining a data base for and about education.

The next six chapters examine the contemporary literature with respect to some basic categories assumed to relate to teaching mathematics. These categories include content, motivation, planning, classroom events, pupil outcomes and pursuits, and teacher and pupil background. Finally, in the concluding chapter we summarize the information and  present a model based upon the review.

A questionnaire was designed to collect the following data from random samples of the EMH and LD groups: (1) test modifications employed; (2) history of special education services; and (3) remediation efforts in the Spring for those students who failed the test in the Fall. Only the section on test modifications was used for all other handicaps (i.e., hearing impaired, visually impaired, multiple handicap, and other) in order to determine their relationship to the passage rate. Data  on student handicap, race, parent education level, and local school district were obtained from State Department of Public Instruction data tapes. The following conclusions were made: (1) procedures used to classify students as handicapped by local schools were inadequate; (2) better guidelines for the use of test modifications were required; and (3) the student characteristics of ability level, current performance level in reading and math, race, and parent education were related to successful performance on the test.

The story of the successful parent emphasized nurturant-authoritative qualities described as characteristic of the parents of energetic-friendly preschoolers, while the unsuccessful parent displayed authoritarian-nonsupportive behaviors linked with conflicted-irritable preschoolers. On a seven-point scale, students rated the importance of 22 attribution items for  providing an explanatory account of the parent's performance. Factor analysis and analysis of variance were used to reduce success/failure attributions to more basic components and to identify relationships among resulting factor scores. Several main effects for Sex of Respondent and Sex of Parent were found. Males cited external attributions, such as faults of the child, in accounting for parental failure. Females assigned Intrinsic Qualities, such as parent's ability, effort, love and education, as explanations for parental success. Mothers, but not fathers, were perceived to be influenced by family relationships. (Author/RH)",

To do this the Evansville-Vanderburgh School Corporation of Indiana, implemented and conducted a full-day kindergarten pilot program during the second semester of the 1978/1979 school year. The program was continued during the full 1979/1980 school year. Full-day kindergarten children in four pilot schools (experimental group) and a random sampling of half-day kindergarten children (control group) from schools containing the half-day kindergarten session participated in the study. It was hypothsized that children who attended a full-day kindergarten program  would show greater growth in cognitive, psychomotor, affective, and linguistic skills than those children who attended the half-day kindergarten program. To test this hypothsis each child from both groups was administered three evaluation instruments. These were the California Achievement Tests, the Boehm Tests of Basic Concepts, and the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Tests. Personal interviews, questionnaires, and observations were used to collect additional information from teachers and parents. In general, results revealed that full-day kindergarten students scored significantly higher in the above three tests; that most parents (91.6%) of children who attended full-day kindergarten prefer full-day kindergarten; and that full-day kindergarten teachers have a favorable attitude about full-day  kindergarten while first grade teachers are undecided about full-day classes.

The resulting stroke patterns which were observed, supported predictions derived from the starting, progression, and horizontal rules expressed in the Grammar of Action. However, other predictions based on the way these children are said to resolve conflicts among these rules were not supported. Similarly, predictions regarding the occurrence of reversals when kindergarten children print and the influence of formal printing instruction in school on the subsequent printing stroke patterns used by 1st and 2nd grade children were not confirmed. An alternative to the Grammar of Action is  proposed to explain these various findings along with the general uniformity children show when they print letters and numbers as well as copy geometric figures.

The construct \"intelligence\" is a hypothetical notion whose valid expression has yet to be born. IQ tests and the construct of intelligence can be discarded at present, and teaching strategies would be unaffected. To successful teachers the tests are at best a sure nuisance and at worst a reactive influence on teaching and learning. The tests are not simply culturally biased. That bias is only a symptom of the problem which is their scientific inadequacy. To say that \"they are the best we have,\" is not to say that they contribute anything useful at all to instruction. The construct \"intelligence\" is embryonic and has heuristic value for research. Its utility for  instruction remains to be demonstrated. School teachers and students should be relieved of the burden of this bad science and psychological ideology. Testmakers should come again when this product can help to make education better.

Children in Groups A and B had been enrolled in the University of Western Ontario Laboratory Preschool Program for 2 years and 1 year, respectively. Children in Group C had no preschool experience. The academic achievement of Groups A and B, as measured by forms of the Stanford Early School Achievement tests and teachers' reports, was superior to that of Group C. At all primary levels studied, children in Groups A and B maintained intellectual levels attained in preschool, with Group A scoring higher than Group B. Incidence of grade failure  in Group C was three times that in Group A and more than twice that in Group B. Eighty-six percent of Group A, 83% of Group B and 60% of Group C were at grade level at the end of the study. In general, while children in Group C made cognitive gains in kindergarten and first grade, IQ differences between Groups A and C and between Groups B and C remained. Trends in the data suggested that the behavior of the children with two years of preschool experience was more acceptable to teachers than that of the other two groups. (Author/SS)",

Some evidence suggests that there may be sensitive periods early in life that are critical for the formation of food preferences and aversions. Additionally, the familiarity and the sweetness of foods appear to be important determinants of children's food preferences. While studies of consumption patterns have frequently been used in making inferences about the food preferences of children, this practice is not appropriate because consumption patterns are determined by factors other than preference. Three elements of contact with food that potentially contribute to the formation of food preferences are the food, the person and the context. The need to maintain  homeostasis, obesity, the sensory capacity of persons, and conditioned experience appear to be related to food preferences. Social-affective context influences the formation of food preferences in several ways. For example, exposing target children to peers who selected and ate the target children's nonpreferred foods was sufficient to change preference and consumption patterns of target children. Presenting foods as rewards and presenting them noncontingently paired with adult attention produced persistent and significant increases in the preferences of preschool children. Implications for child rearing practices in day care settings are indicated. (Author/RH)",

The results indicated that both fathers and mothers adjust certain aspects of their speech relative to both age and linguistic production skills. In addition, very similar patterns of speech adjustment were found for mothers and fathers. Specifically, parents of both sexes adjusted the length of their utterances as a  function of the production capacity of the child and moderated the concreteness and diversity of their vocabulary relative to the age and production skills of the child with whom they were interacting.

Nearly all who responded admitted behavior that was illegal or contrary to commonly accepted standards of morality. A rural study of 3,260 high school students (1964-1965) and a vocational study of 3,117 juniors and seniors (1965-1966) produced data relating to educational and occupational interests and aspirations, peer group influence, and extra-curricular activities. The rural study indicated that peer  groups were seldom constructive resources for socialization of youth. The vocational study showed an upsurge in the proportion of students who aspired to attain college, but did not indicate a strong thrust toward the redefinition of female roles. High school girls showed strong preferences for occupations traditionally considered women's work. A follow-up study in 1971 of 717 persons indicated that the great majority of young men and women had completed some college work before entering the labor force permanently.

First, token delivery of contract system for motivation involves having the child earn tokens or work on a contract as he accomplishes tasks in specific skills. During the spend period, he may trade for desired conventional or cultural activities. Second, Behavior Analysis Follow Through classrooms are staffed by a lead teacher and at least two Cheyenne parent aides ensuring each pupil receives individual attention. Third, programmed curricula materials allow staff to describe terminal behavior, measure students' entry skills, provide frequent chances for direct student responses, clear criteria for correct responses, and allow periodic assessment of  student's progress. Fourth, to monitor progress, pre-set targets are used as the progress index on a bi-monthly basis. Trainers make periodic classroom visits using a formal observation form. Remediation efforts take place immediately and are followed in one week by another visit. Fifth, staff training and career development are achieved through training all classroom staff members in Behavior Analysis teaching procedures. Cheyenne parents have become valuable instructors and many work toward a G.E.D. or a college degree. Sixth, parent involvement means that the contribution of their own language and cultural background adds a richer classroom environment and provides more response to children's needs, insuring continuity and quality to teaching.

Title IVC funds were granted for the 1976-1977, 1977-1978, and 1978-1979 school years to develop, plan, and field-test an LRC model which used a paraprofessional staff supervised by a professional librarian/Learning Resources Director. Stages of Concern Questionnaires (SoCQ) were given to 97 rural school teachers to measure how individuals involved in the development and adopting processes of an innovation perceived those processes and what their concerns about the innovation might be. Of those teachers selected, 30 completed the questionnaire. The SoCQ consisted of 35 statements which reflected 7 stages of  concern: awareness, informational, personal, management, consequences, collaboration, and refocusing. Data indicated that most respondents were unaware of the LRC program but open to information about it. After a review of the data, some participants were interviewed. While most of those interviewed used the LRC program, few understood the concept or philosophy. There was confusion between the concept of an LRC and that of a school library program. Consequently, the project's implementation activities were modified to place additional attention on increasing teachers' awareness and knowledge of the LRC program. (CM)",

Researchers using unobtrusive observation of Dunlap and seven nearby unincorporated villages, documentary research, and a formal interview of one third of Dunlap's 102 residents, found the dying small town stereotype to be misleading. It was determined the marketplace had shifted, part going to larger trade centers and the remainder changed to an expanded household economy; yet, complex community activities and social subgroupings continued to provide Dunlap with cohesiveness. In and around Dunlap both labor-intensive and  capital-intensive types of production were evident and residents had positive expectations for the future. It was suggested that the fate of such towns lies in the decisions of state and federal public policy making bodies on such issues as discontinuing rural Post Offices, elementary school attendance centers, and flood control projects, all of which would directly affect Dunlap and that these small towns can and should organize to consider cooperative programs, mobile health care, etc., if they wish to conserve an alternative form of American social life.

The historical perspective of the report begins in 1918, when the trend toward consolidation of one-room schools was first indicated and continues into and well beyond the depression. It is reported that the number of school districts decreased from 127,000 in 1932 to 16,276 in 1976. But Sher and Tompkins (1976) postulate that school consolidation has had its strengths exaggerated, weaknesses ignored, and overall merits for educational reform seriously oversold. Sher and Tompkins also report that not a single 1 of 14 recent consolidation studies controlling for IQ and socioeconomic effects records a consistent, positive correlation between size of school and academic achievement. Trends  indicating support of goals for the 1970's are discussed and goals for the 1980's are listed. Strengths and weaknesses of small schools are then discussed from the following viewpoints of administration, teacher, student, community, guidance, atmosphere, finance, curriculum, student achievement, staffing, morale, and cultural opportunity. Concluding the paper is a lengthy review of promising practices. A chart contrasts the characteristics of the Model Innovative Process, as identified by Fullan in 1972, with characteristics of the Rural Futures Development Process, developed by the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory.

One major problem for instance, is that even though primary school enrollment tripled during the 1950's and 1960's, the number of uneducated people in developing countries has soared due to spiraling population growth. The GAO recommends in this report that AID focus attention on three issues: (1) there should be increased involvement of the host governments in the planning, design, implementation, and evaluation of U.S. sponsored projects  with greater emphasis on host-country ability to carry out implementation and sustain recurring costs; (2) more effective use of AID's 20 years of experience in planning, designing, and carrying out education development projects is needed to help develop relevant learning opportunities for the poor majority in these nations; (3) closer coordination and cooperation of external donors among themselves and with recipient governments is necessary to ascertain the most essential education development needs and to best use all available resources in meeting those needs.

At first glance the situation is ideal, but there are several stumbling blocks for the new administration. The first stems from the idea that because of ancestry, Laguna administrators must always be compatible with tribal culture and traditions. The second stems from the lack of previous Indian administrators and the &quot;Anglo is best&quot; syndrome. Both cause dissatisfaction with the new personnel. To date, community acceptance of the two is fluctuating. Philosophically, the Laguna community is  divided into two major groups. The more innovative and progressive community members have in general a higher socio-economic status and educational level and have been away from the reservation much more. They tend to be in favor of change and in favor of Indian administrators or those with proven ability. The more traditional group tends to support the idea of Anglo administrators due to lack of Indian role models in the past. (SB)",

Representatives of nine Pueblos and the All Indian Pueblo Council strongly opposed the bill, fearing the institutionalization of their culture, the invasion of private religious practices, and especially the loss of basic educational services for Indian children in the  Santa Fe area at the Institute of American Indian Arts l(IAIA) facility. The committee reassured the Pueblo governors and the many other witnesses with similar concerns that this was not the intent of the bill. Representatives of the Crow, Zuni, and Navajo Tribes and New Mexico Senator Pete Domenici spoke in support of the bill. Other witensses represented IAIA, the Santa Fe Indian School, and several Indian arts associations. The text of S. 2166 is included in the record. (SB)",

The following people were elected as tribal representatives: Ada Deer, John Borbridge, and Jake Whitecrow for federally recognized tribes; Louis Bruce for Urban Indians; and Adolph Dial for nonfederally recognized Indians. The first business meeting of the Commission was held on May 2, 1975. Chairman Abourzek stated that the Commission would conduct a sweeping review of the U.S.  historical and legal relationship with American Indians and that the information compiled would provide the intellectual framework for future American Indian policy. Senator Abourzek also said that the Commission would examine the difference between white and Indian society and the difference between the Indian tribes and societies. The meeting on June 13 was concerned with discussions of and nominations to the 11 task forces, some of which were to begin functioning in July. The meetings on July 11 and September 12 were again concerned with organizational activities. (AN)",

Two points that emerged from the session were: the need for a specific process whereby the Federal Government recognizes tribes and the noninvolvement of the Federal Government in defining who is and is not an Indian (this should be left up to the tribes). One major objective of Task Force No. 2 was to define clearly the relationship between the federal government and Indian tribes, including the political status of Indian tribal governments commensurate with the views of Indian people across the country. One spokesman reviewed the main obstacles of economic  development; an example is when reservation resources are developed by others the proceeds are then siphoned off by state taxation.

Another recommendation was directed at the real adjustment of the funding mechanism on Indian education money.

Five background and experiential factors thought to be predictors of the initial expectation to farm were tested via mail surveys of male agriculture students at 1862 and 1890 southern land grant colleges. A 15% sample (N=1,788) was drawn from the 1862 institutions and a complete enumeration was attempted at the 1890 schools (N=787). As expected, father a farmer, self-defined potential to inherit a farm, high school agricultural coursework, participation in agriculture clubs, and race were all significant predictors. In both the 1890 and 1862 samples, the father as  farmer and agriculture course and club participation were linked with greater likelihood of the expectation to farm. This likelihood was even stronger when the inheritance factor was also present. However, nonwhite students (usually at 1890 colleges) were less likely to expect a farm career despite a higher proportion of farm backgrounds. Apparently the usual agents of socialization for farmers (i.e., hardship, uncertainty, etc.) operate to shift black agriculture students to non-farm agriculture careers. The study differs from previous research in its attempt to explore conjoint influences among a limited set of significant experiential and background factors previously viewed individually. (SB)",

Questionnaires were sent to the three groups to determine consequences of the programs in the categories of family income, community facilities and services, public policies and issues, and community problem-solving capacity. Results indicated the most significant changes and positive benefits were in community problem solving capacity projects and the least in family income programs. Knowledgeable citizens, 60% of whom had middle to high levels of formal education and income, indicated that CRD projects were more worthy than other tax-supported services and that community support was significantly  related to CRD impact. Results also indicated some &quot;special&quot; groups, such as local governing officials, derived more positive benefits than other groups, suggesting, therefore, that more effort should be exerted to ensure better service to the public in general, as well as to traditional extension clientele and that improvement in data collecting procedures should be made to facilitate future evaluation efforts.

The typical student's family background was lower-middle class, as determined by his/her father's occupation. The values statements used in the questionnaire were Cohen's (1955) nine middle-class items (e.g., working hard at trying to get ahead) and Miller's (1958) six lower-class items (e.g., being able to handle oneself and being tough). For the 20 categories of delinquency studies, males almost invariably admitted to substantially more involvement than did females. There was a slight tendency for proportionately more delinquency to be admitted to by students from  middle-class rather than lower-class families, though the percentage differences between these two groups were quite small. Regardless of the students' sex or their families' social class, consistently more delinquency was reported by students who tended to reject rather than accept the statements contained in a measure of middle-class values. On the other hand, self-reported delinquency was much more ambiguously associated with the students' acceptance or rejection of statements in a measure of lower-class values. (Author/AN)",

Three contingent aspects of job change behavior were examined: the impacts of support on subjects' probabilities of changing employers (241 subjects employed at the pre-enrollment interviews), their duration of unemployment (165 subjects employed at the pre-enrollment interview who subsequently left that employer), and their selection of new jobs (133 subjects employed at the pre-enrollment interview and the 8th quarterly who changed employers 1 or more times). No additive effects of support payments on changing employers were  evidenced. However, relative to similar control group subjects, experimentals who initially had desirable positions were less likely to change employers than were those with less desirable positions. Time of unemployment was longer among subjects who expected less gain upon re-employment than among those who expected greater income gains. Those whose prior jobs were undesirable tended to take new jobs less desirable in terms of status and job satisfaction. Those subjects who had good jobs before tended to obtain better positions than similar controls. Experimentals with secondary earners in the family and a higher guarantee level tended to find jobs with more status and earnings. Findings were compared with the results of the New Jersey-Pennsylvania Graduated Work Incentive Experiment.  (Author/CM)",

Variables were computed from secondary sources to assess educational changes from 1974-1978; mailed questionnaires were returned by 186 superintendents, revealing perceptions about the changes. Similar questionnaires were returned by 33 directors of health districts, indicating adequacy of health service and ability to keep pace with health demands. The most significant difference in the final comparison was 80.4% of the superintendents felt educational needs were being met, while  only 52.0% of the health directors thought health services were adequate. The Recreational-Retirement county type accounted for 80% of the variation on some items, and considerable differences in the superintendents' responses suggested that their perceptions were more a reflection of local attitudes than of the data.

For both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan systems the most significant structural factors accounting for the variation in metropolitan-nonmetropolitan student achievement test scores were the percentage of black enrollment, which had a negative effect on scores, and the type of school system (city or county). Students in independent city school systems attained higher average test scores. In nonmetropolitan systems, a weak positive relationship was shown  between per pupil expenditure and 8th grade scores and between average daily attendance and 12 grade scores. For metropolitan systems a positive relationship was shown between per pupil expenditure and teacher-student ratio and 8th grade scores. Enrollment, average high school teacher salary, and average daily attendance had no effect on student achievement.

The purpose of the entire project is to see if learning and understanding of mathematics can be improved by the use of these science-related units in mathematics classes, grades 7-9. Previous knowledge of science on the part of the students or teachers is not necessary. The units supplement but do not replace, whatever mathematics textbooks are in use. The material can be inserted in a mathematics course for a two- or three-week period over the school year. The use and need for graphing sets of ordered pairs of numbers are concepts in mathematics which can be drawn from the science experiments. Other  useful mathematical concepts derived from the science data are those of: (1) drawing a line of best fit from a series of graphed ordered pairs; (2) the slope concept and its physical and mathematical meaning; (3) developing the equation of the graph; (4) interpolation and extrapolation from the graph and from the equation; and (5) a mathematical generalization and its use in problem solving.

Studies analyzed also included measurements from which effect sizes could be calculated.

On the basis of effect size, individualized instruction appeared to be more effective than the traditional lecture approach for all  methods studied.

        "description":"This publication contains reprints of interviews with leading educators on specific topics of interest to social studies educators at the elementary, secondary, and college level. Twelve interviews from the &quot;Looking At&quot; series were selected to be reprinted in this anthology because the topics are still timely and the comments of the educators interviewed are still pertinent and valuable. All interviewees were invited to update their interviews. Some made no revisions at all; in most cases the changes they made were few and minor. Topics include school ethnography, public doublespeak, oral history, back to basics in social studies, reading in the social studies, evaluating values education, local history, citizenship education, staff development, teaching about aging,  international education, and teachers' centers. The first interview is on school ethnography and includes a discussion of how ethnographic data can provide careful description and cultural analysis of what is going on in a school. The interview on public doublespeak will be of interest to teachers concerned about honesty and clarity in communication. Oral history is discussed as a teaching method which can be used in the precollegiate study of local history. One interview examines what the back to basics issues meant for social studies educators. It is pointed out that social studies in the elementary schools is not in very good shape because of lack of emphasis on content knowledge. At the secondary level most able students are getting very good programs; however, the average and below  average students are being greatly short changed by watered down courses. The back to basics approach will rectify this situation if it results in a reexamination of what the public wants the schools to accomplish and an examination of whether they are actually accomplishing it.

A LAP is a module of subject-related teaching materials which move from structured questions to guided activities and finish with open-ended inquiries. LAP titles are \"The History of History,\"\"American Revolution,\"\"Technology and Modernization,\"\"Cultural Egotism,\"\"Nazism,\"\"Land Use and Culture Conflict: The American Indian vs. White Settlers,\"\"Racism, Discrimination, &  Prejudice,\"\"War and Warfare: The Civil War,\" and \"Foxfire.\" For each LAP, information is given on an overview of the topic, guiding questions, sources of further information, activities, investigative techniques, and extension activities. Students are involved in a variety of activities including compiling annotated bibliographies, writing research and position papers, discussing history-related issues in class and in small groups, defining concepts and generalizations, and preparing history classes for a lower grade. Students are expected to be highly self-directed and to use sources available in the school and community in addition to sources suggested in the unit. (DB)",

Activities in the model concern: 1) general information about the exceptional students and the educational implications of their handicaps, 2) the various functions of individual team members, and 3) methods and materials to be used in the teaching of the exceptional students. As a result, educators should better understand the roles and abilities of all members of the delivery team.  (Author/CJ)",

These data included supervisory ratings of the variables: specifying performance objectives, diagnosing learners, selecting instructional strategies, and interacting with learners collected on 82 student teachers. Additionally, the mean number of objectives achieved by the classes of each of the student teachers was used as a measure of the fifth variable in the model, evaluating the effectiveness of instruction. A recursive causal model which described the relationship of these variables was developed and analyzed, using four linear equations. Examination of the path coefficients from these equations revealed that the variables, specification of  performance objectives and diagnosing learners account for three tenths of the variance in selecting instructional strategies. Other results indicated there were low to moderate amounts of variance shared by the variables of the model. This study illustrates the application of causal modeling techniques in testing theoretical models in education using data collected in naturalistic, non-experimental settings. (Author)",

Comparisons are based on simulated data which follow an approximate beta-binomial distribution and on real test results from the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills administered in the South Carolina Statewide Testing Program. Both procedures lead to setting identical or almost identical passing scores as long as the test score distribution is reasonably symmetric or when the minimum mastery level or criterion level is high. Larger discrepancies tend to occur when this level is low, especially when the distribution of test scores is concentrated at a few  extreme scores or when the frequencies are irregular. However, in terms of mastery/nonmastery decision, the two procedures result in the same classifications in practically all situations. The empirical Bayes procedures may be used for tests of any length, while the Bayesian procedure is recommended only for tests of eight or more items. Further, the empirical Bayes can be generalized and applied to more complex testing situations with less difficulty than the Bayesian procedure. (Author/CP)",

Item difficulites were tabulated on the responses of 364 elementary students. The informal-subjective method, used by many achievement test developers, allowed maximum freedom of wording and yielded significantly more difficult items. The objectives-based and linguistic methods, in which the item writer chose the foils (distractors), were susceptible to item writer bias. In contrast, the method which provided maximum control, linguistic-based algorithmic foil method, yielded the items which were easy and not subject to bias. It also created items which were insensitive to the  pretest-posttest shift in difficulty. Therefore, algorithmic foil methods are promising because they control item writer differences; more research is needed before reasonable item difficulties and instructional sensitivity can be obtained. Teacher-produced items were more sensitive to instruction than those of experienced writers. It is concluded that item-writer differences are real and that field testing is important to identify these differences. (CP)",

The study entailed both the equating of forms (of similar difficulty) and the equating of levels (of differing difficulty). The goal was to equate seventh edition tests to those of the sixth edition. The data were item responses from a representative sample of 10,728 Iowa high school students. One-, two-, and three-parameter logistic latent trait methods were used. The results from the equating methods were compared using a cross-validation criterion which measured the closeness of converted score distributions to actual score distributions for randomly equivalent groups. The one-parameter methods results were  judged inadequate for equating tests differing in difficulty, possibly because of prevalent examinee guessing. The three-parameter methods results were promising although two problems were discussed which require further study. Presently, equipercentile procedures may be the most viable for equating tests of differing difficulty. (Author/CP)",

Another group of classmates was also allowed to categorize options as undecided. Comparisons of the resulting sets of passing scores were made on the basis of (1) the raw distributions of passing scores; (2) the consistency of pass-fail decisions between the two versions; and (3) the consistency of pass-fail decisions between each version and the passing score established by the test designer. The two versions produced  essentially equivalent results. There was, in addition, a significant relationship between the passing score set by a judge and that judge's level of achievement on the midterm. (Author/CP)",

Thus, to achieve a given level of accuracy, some minimum sample size is required. An approximation for this minimum size may be made if some reasonable assumptions regarding the mean and standard deviation of the test score distribution can be made. To facilitate the computations, tables are developed based on the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills. The tables may be used for tests ranging in length from 5 to 30 items, with percent cutoff scores of 60%, 70%, or 80%, and with examinee populations for which the test difficulty can be described as low, moderate, or high, and the test variability as low or moderate. The tables also reveal that for a given  degree of accuracy, an estimate of kappa would require a considerably greater number of examinees than would an estimate of the raw agreement index.

A questionnaire representing the constructs, the Inventory of Affective Aspects of Schooling (IAAS), was developed and administered to 601 students in grade 4. Factor analyses and internal consistency reliability studies were then conducted to investigate construct validity. The inventory measured demographic characteristics, parent involvement, attitudes toward English, mathematics, social science, science, and toward teachers and school in general. Anderson's My Class Inventory was modified and included with the IAAS. The following variables had high factor loadings: parent involvement; attitudes  toward school and specific subjects; self assurance in ability to learn; teacher quality; appreciation of classmates; and lack of academic motivation. Internal consistency ranged considerably from .29 to .91. Overall, the 34 variables subjected to reliability and factor analysis are promising, but vary considerably as predictors of the affective domain.

Three states used the discrepancy evaluation model; four states audited and accredited schools; the remaining states selected the method they felt was best suited to the program. Commonly cited problems were the lack of evaluators, time, funds, training, and particularly the lack of impact of  evaluations. Difficulties in designing experiments, the need for school district data management systems, and evaluation training of school personnel were also cited.

        "description":"A key assumption of the Concerns Based Adoption Model (CBAM) is that change is a process, rather than an event. The Procedures for Adopting Educational Innovations Project is working to identify and verify diagnostic dimensions of CBAM, and to develop tools to measure the developmental status of users and non-users; these concepts will help change agents in deciding what interventions should be made. Another research effort which has tested the dimensions of the CBAM is Emrick et. al's. evaluation of the National Diffusion Network (NDN). This evaluation has identified successful change strategies at the various stages of the dissemination and implementation process. These stages correspond to Hall et. al's Levels of Use of the Innovation, one dimension described in CBAM. Other  CBAM dimensions include Stages of Concern about the Innovation and Innovation Configurations. A review and comparison of these two studies results in these conclusions: (1) both studies describe logical relationships and processes; (2) both studies identified three similar pre-use phases; (3) further study is needed of levels of use by larger (non-individual) institutions; (4) clearer guidelines are needed concerning the timing of intervention by change agents; and (5) effective change agent activities with respect to client diagnosis were identified.

To test this assumption, fall to fall test results on the SRA Achievement Tests were obtained for grades 2-3, and 6-7. Total reading and total mathematics growth scale values were used in all analyses. Score distributions were divided into low, medium, and high subgroups of an approximately equal number of matched scores. With the exception of grades 7-8 mathematics scores, the equipercentile assumption was valid only for certain subgroups, not for the total group. These results conflicted with those of a similar study the previous year, providing less than a harmonious picture of the equipercentile  assumption. Districts considering Title I evaluation model A should conduct a local study of non-federally impacted children to determine for themselves the appropriateness of the assumption. (CP)",

Outcomes of the studies (achievement gains or attitude improvements) were computed as standardized differences between pretested and non-pretested groups. Eleven other variables were coded for each outcome. Initial descriptive statistics were indicative of differences between randomized and nonrandomized studies, so all further analyses were based on the 110 randomized group outcomes. For all outcomes, the average effect size was .34, indicating the general elevating effect of pretest on posttest. Cognitive outcomes were raised .51, attitude outcomes .33, and others about .27 standard deviations. Seventy percent of all effects were positive, and 93% of the cognitive effects were positive. Duration  of time between pre- and post-testing was not related to effect size, although effect size is generally smaller for durations over one month. Year of publication, sample size, presence of experimental treatment, and sameness or difference of pretest and posttest were not significantly related to effect size. Researchers must continue to include pretest as a design variable when it is present, and to estimate its effect. (Author/CP)",

In papers on topics as diverse as philosophy, policy, and the curriculum, there was the suggestion that the political effects of minimum competency testing, namely state control of public education, will be the most profound. Furthermore, if test content comes to define content of curriculum, middle-class children will enjoy an enriched college preparatory program in private schools, and more disadvantaged students will fail to graduate from high school. Thirty-eight speeches and reactions are included in this collection. (CP)",

Problems associated with the complexity of MCT are outlined, the most important being public perceptions; vocabulary of MCT; educational impact; political, legal and financial issues; implementation and measurement problems; and administration issues.

With two more years to run, provisional research provides the beginnings of a model of student learning which is neither static nor mechanistic. Recent research has placed emphasis on describing how students learn and how learning is affected by the academic environment. Three stages of learning are described (intention, process, and outcome), and serialist and holist learning styles are contrasted. Serialists rely on facts, and the logical relationship between them, in building up understanding (operation learning). The holist strategy involves building a conceptual map through complex ideas in which links are actively sought with previous experience (comprehension learning). A questionnaire has  been developed, the first part containing items assessing dimensions related to the studying process, and the second part being a set of items indicating students' perception of their major department. The final part of the research program examines the extent to which students differ in personality characteristics. The outcome is intended to be a student learning model which can be computer simulated. (GK)",

This paper identifies the various meanings and methods associated with needs assessment, including some of the evidence concerning differences in actual practice. Issues which arise as a result of various approaches to needs assessment are discussed, and practical guidance concerning whether or not to conduct a needs assessment is offered. Highlighted are: the meaning of the term; federal law and regulation; proposed methods, tools, and concepts for conducting needs assessment; and the reasons for and uses made of the needs assessment. Although current literature is generally optimistic about the value of needs assessment for resource allocation and decision-making in public  agencies, this paper presents a clear contrast. It is concluded that the case for, limits of, and evidence about the positive impact of needs assessment are not encouraging. Caution and circumspection are suggested about the likely analytical contribution which assessments might make to decision-making in public agencies. (Author/GSK)",

Students from five educational psychology classes (112 undergraduate) were shown video modules under either of two conditions: (1) individually, with the option of rewinding the module as desired, and (2) in groups, without a rewind option. Before beginning the first module, the Test Anxiety Scale and Worry-Emotionality Scale were administered, followed by a pretest dealing with material to be covered by the modules then administered. The Worry-Emotionality Scale was later readministered, and a posttest was given. Data was analyzed by multiple regression analyses. As  predicted, students low in prior achievement learned significantly more in the individual condition than in groups, and high anxiety students achieved more with the option to rewind than without. The results provide support for the formulation that prior learning is an important construct for aptitude-treatment interaction research and educational practice; also supported is the hypothesis that being able to review instructional content is beneficial to high anxiety students.

The skills measured by the Survey of Basic Skills: Grade 3 (an integral part of the CAP) are described. Rationale for test content specifications, methods of skill assessment, and activities conducted during the two-year test development process are discussed. Test development was based on two considerations: (1) the test would reflect the third grade curriculum of California public schools, and (2) the test would insure that assessment information would assist schools in identifying programmatic strengths and weaknesses. Reading, written language, and mathematics skills are described. The reading section contains questions from four skill areas:  word identification, vocabulary, comprehension, and study locational skills. The language section contains questions from eight skill areas: word forms, standard English usage, language choices, sentence recognition, paragraphs, capitalization, puctuation, and spelling. The final section, mathematics, contains questions from seven skill areas: counting/place value, operations, nature of numbers, geometry, measurement, graphs, and problem analysis. Basic skill outcomes of good instructional programs are defined through illustrative test items and skill descriptions. (Author (GK)",

Previous studies yielded inconclusive results because of the procedures by which item calibrations were linked and because of the item selection procedures. Using improved procedures, 83 college students were tested in a test-retest design. Comparisons were based upon (1) test-retest reliability; (2) ability estimates yielded by the procedures; (3) the information yielded by the procedures; (4) the number of items the methods administered; (5) goodness of fit of the models based on mean square deviations; and (6) the correlations of estimated true scores, based on ability estimates. In addition, an attitude survey was administered after each test  session to determine student attitudes toward the tailored tests. Results indicated that both tailored tests had higher reliabilities than a conventional paper-and-pencil test over the same material. The three-parameter procedure had higher test information than the one-parameter procedure and the conventional test. The attitude survey results indicated generally favorable student attitudes toward tailored testing. (Author/CP)",

The latter were specific, operational descriptions of teaching techniques. The five general characteristics correlated .30 or higher with the \"rate the instructor\" item; they frequently correlated at that level with the \"rate the course\" item. The low-inference items having the highest correlationi with the general characteristics are listed. The highly significant, partial correlations found between enthusiasm-discussion  and presentation-organization suggest that there are not five but only two unique general characteristics; furthermore, both paris of characteristics have some low-inference behaviors in common. Rating forms need consist only of overall evaluation questions, for administrative purposes, and one question for each of two or three general characteristics.

Tests of reading, written expression, spelling, and mathematics were administered to all sixth and twelfth graders. Various subtests of the Survey of Basic Skills, which was developed specifically for the California Assessment Program, were used. Results generally indicated improving scores for third and sixth graders, as compared to previous years' test results. Twelfth graders' test scores declined in reading, remained the same in spelling, and improved in writing and mathematics. Several other conclusions were made: (1) females scored higher than males in reading, while males scored higher in mathematics; (2) students who speak English fluently, as well as  either Chinese or Japanese, scored highest, followed by those who speak English only; (3) scores were directly related to parents' occupational and educational level, but socioeconomic differences decreased; (4) pupil mobility increased and although the less mobile students scored higher than the more mobile students, this difference became smaller; (5) nearly 60% of the seniors had taken four years of English instruction; and (6) greater exposure to English instruction and essay-writing experience was associated with higher writing scores.

Reasons for the decline in satisfactory test results is cited, and the factors reported by the National Academy of Education Committee on Testing and Basic Skills are emphasized: (1) proliferation of courses; (2) confusion about the appropriate role of teachers; (3) slackening of &quot;on task&quot; attention; and (4) dismantling of opportunities for intensive study in selective academic environments at the secondary  level.

        "description":"Data presented in this report are the results of the special assessment of writing mechanics conducted during the 1978-79 school year by the Education Commission of the States (ECS) for the Department of Defense Dependents Schools (DoDDS). The purposes of the study were (1) to examine writing abilities of 9-, 13-, and 17-year-old students enrolled in the DoDDS system, and (2) to compare their writing abilities with those of students enrolled in schools within the continental United States. Once a representative sample of students at each of the three ages was selected, assessment materials were distributed. These materials included an instruction manual for DoDDS personnel, administering the assessment, the assessment booklets, and a paced audiotape presenting the materials to  students. Each assessment booklet contained an essay writing task. Following assessment, the materials went on to the regional coordinator, and then to the scoring site. This report is organized by age group; a profile of the &quot;average&quot; essay is presented and discussed; a brief examination of the range of essays is provided; and a comparison of &quot;average&quot; papers by DoDDS students with those of their national counterparts is discussed.

        "description":"A traffic incident in April of 1975 developed into an unprecedented civil rights demonstration by Chinese residents in New York City's Chinatown in May of that year. This paper attempts to trace the factors which led to this large scale demonstration and analyze the development of decision making in this case. The demonstration was the result of accusations of police brutality toward Peter Yew, a witness to the traffic incident, and of frustration on the part of Chinatown residents in later dealings with the police department. An estimated 10,000 Chinatown inhabitants participated in an orderly but boisterous demonstration at City Hall. As a result of the demonstration the police commissioner met with representatives of the Chinese population. An agreement was reached which  included promises of no further police harrassment, the transfer of the Chinatown precinct commanding officer, a reduction of charges against Peter Yew, no police interference in the judicial processing of Yew's case, the hiring of more Chinese in city government jobs, and the rescinding of all cuts in funds designated for Chinatown. The demonstration solidified, at least for a time, the apathetic and divided Chinese residents of Chinatown whose welfare has long been neglected. (MK)",

The meta-analysis procedure used by the authors revealed that small class size is associated with higher quality classroom environments, better student attitudes, and greater teacher satisfaction. Findings also indicated that class size effects are related to pupil age, with effects most noticeable for children 12 years and under and  least apparent for pupils 18 or over.

        "description":"This report derives from a study of the implementation of civil rights guarantees by elementary, secondary, and higher education institutions. The study was commissioned by the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) with the objective of determining whether the OCR should more closely monitor and enforce compliance with Federal regulations concerning the rights of women, minorities, and the handicapped, or whether these regulations are being adequately addressed through local administration of compliance mechanisms. Under Federal law, local institutions are required to (1) file formal assurance of compliance with guarantees established in Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, (2) conduct a self evaluation of their practices in  dealing with the rights of women and the handicapped, (3) appoint a compliance coordinator, and (4) establish formal grievance procedures. Based on case studies of twelve local education agencies and twelve institutions of higher education throughout the country, it was found that (1) nearly all the institutions had implemented the required mechanisms, though few people apart from managerial personnel knew that they existed, and (2) the four mechanisms contribute to the change process, but the most important changes are initiated by institutional leaders or employees. Of the four mechanisms, assurance of compliance was found to be the least effective. Recommendations are offered for improving its usefulness. (Author/GC)",

        "description":"Since the early 1970s, Haitians have been arriving in the United States in increasing numbers. Since 1977, the Immigration and Naturalization Service has taken several steps in response to this influx and to problems Haitian refugees face regarding asylum, exclusion, and deportation. One major decision resulted in new regulations that would provide for evidentiary hearings on asylum claims. Other decisions were to release those Haitians in detention who had been unable to post $500 bond, and to authorize work permits for Haitians residing in Florida with asylum claims pending. In mid 1978, there was a marked increase in the number of Haitians arriving in Florida. The Immigration and Naturalization Service, in order to shorten lines at the district office in Miami, reduced the  bureaucracy involved with processing new aliens and took steps to speed up the hearings process for Haitians already detained. Recently, several lawsuits have been filed on behalf of Haitian refugees and are currently pending. In the meantime, several thousand new work authorizations have been issued. In light of the fact that the Immigration and Naturalization Service considers that most Haitians come to America to improve their economic status rather than out of political hardship, officials feel that considerable steps have been taken to aid this group.

First, the objectives that underlie targeted subsidy programs are outlined in relation to individual program characteristics and the economics of such programs are discussed. Then the wide range of program options available is examined. Among the variations considered are number and characteristics of employees covered, types of employment subsidized, mode of subsidy payment, and levels of employment or employment changes on which the subsidy will be paid. Also considered is the question of whether there should be a cap on the amount of subsidy one firm can obtain. Finally, the recently legislated Targeted Jobs Credit (TJC) program is  described and evaluated, and recommendations for the future evolution of this and the New Jobs Tax Credit (NJTC) program are offered.

Focus is on highly intentional learning which is not part of formal course work: a series of time-consuming episodes in which the person's primary intention is to gain certain definite knowledge and skill. Findings are reported which indicate that about 90 per cent of all women and men initiate and conduct at least one major deliberate learning effort a year (five on the average), only 20 per cent of these are professionally guided, and that intentional self-planned learning is at least as important, relevant, and useful to others as professionally-taught groups. The author outlines a useful way to identify why people learn through  examination of the benefits a person intends to obtain through the learning effort. He discusses findings which indicate that a variety of reasons is always present and that the decision to learn is often voluntary, self-initiated, and proactive even if the task or responsibility for which the new knowledge or skill is used is not voluntary. Survey results are cited to show that demographic variables (previous education, age, socioeconomic status, race, sex) have little or no influence on the choice to learn. In the final section the author notes that most learning efforts are good, but some are harmful. He suggests ways to encourage people to learn things that are beneficial to others. (JT)",

Chapter 2 discusses some specific educational concepts and techniques which have implications for vocational evaluation, including achievement variables and taxonomies. Chapter 3 addresses the concept of evaluation  models. These six models are presented and discussed: Accreditation, Tylerian, CIPP (context, input, process, and product., CSE (Center of the Study of Evalution), Formative and Summative, and Single Subject Design. Chapter 4 focuses on procedures to design a comprehensive evaluation system which includes data collection. Sample charts, tables, grids, and reporting forms are presented.

Cognitive and Affective Education discusses Piaget's construction of knowledge and teachers' decisions regarding instructional methods for content to be learned by rote and to be known and understood. Affective Education in the Classroom concerns creating an environment for affective learning, teaching strategies for the affective domain, and resources to facilitate affective learning outcomes. The next seven papers are special interest group presentations: (1) Moral Development of Nursing Students: An Issue  Confronting Nursing Education, discussing theories and relevance to nursing education; (2) The Socialization Seminar, describing an approach to help students develop professional values, beliefs, and attitudes; (3) Anxiety Desensitization, discussing techniques to minimize and prevent debilitating anxiety levels; (4) The Use of Simulated Learning Experiences and advantages and disadvantages; and (5) three &quot;updates&quot; on activities at four project sites, entitled Eliminating Learning Obstacles, The Impact of Cognitive Styles on Teaching and Learning, and Cultural Awareness. (The tenth paper, Multisensory Instruction, was not presented. It overviews instructional development at Hampton Institute School of Nursing.) (YLB)",

        "description":"A study determined effective inservice education methods to reduce the apprehension of experienced vocational education teachers regarding instruction of handicapped students. In order to guide the study, three null hypotheses were generated and tested. A three-group, randomized, pre- and post-test experimental design was utilized. Thirty teachers of vocational agribusiness in Alabama, who were attending a workshop for cooperating teachers, were randomly assigned treatments which consisted of a videotaped presentation, a lecture (control), and a self-paced individualized packet. The Attitudes Toward Disabled Persons (ATDP) instrument was utilized to collect data. Descriptive and inferential statistics utilized to analyze the data included percentages, means, frequencies,  correlated T-tests, Chi Square, and analysis of variance. All three null hypotheses were rejected at the .05 level of confidence: Voc-Ag teachers were moderately positive in attitudes toward the disabled; there were changes in attitudes after inservice treatments as measured by the ATDP; and the videotape presentation was most effective. Lecture was next in effectiveness, and the self-study was least effective in changing attitudes of teachers toward the disabled. Seven recommendations were made based on the findings of the study.

The project had three phases--research, implementation, and evaluation--and focused on construction training and employment. Research was done with an ERIC (Educational Resources Information Center) search, survey of construction employers in the Eugene-Springfield area, study of two Cognitive Mapping Workshops held at Mt. Hood Community College, and assessment by project staff of existing curriculum at Lane Community College. Project staff then designed an interdisciplinary curriculum that used the Construction Technology Program, a  special five-credit Industrial Orientation class, and selected basic skills classes. Implementation included coordinating the Industrial Orientation class with classes in the Construction Technology Program, final selection of instructors, recruitment of students, evaluation of student skills, and an actual field test of the curriculum involving eighteen students at Lane Community College. A textbook was written for use in the field test (see Note). Evaluation focused on student evaluations of the class, student retention and employment characteristics and staff evaluation. (Appendixes include examples of class assignments, a cognitive mapping workplan, textbook section, and student evaluation form.) (YLB)",

Progress to date has involved establishment of an advisory committee and validation panels, development of thirty-three &quot;I Can&quot; competency lists (e.g., child caretaker, benefit sales worker, consumer rights specialist, fund raiser), validation of the lists (524 items) by 122 women and 56 employers, factor analyses of the lists to revise and cluster skills, and drafting of the first three chapters of a workbook to help women identify their job-relevant  skills and match them to those in paid jobs. Skill clusters will be related to jobs and job families on the basis of employer data, job literature analysis, and data to be collected from 100 employment and career counselors. The remaining two sections of the workbook have been outlined. Most of the report consists of appendixes: data summaries on the skill lists, correlation tables, final draft of competency lists, and draft of the first three workbook sections: introduction, overview and general discussion of questions asked by women returning to paid work, and exercises to review experience and identify skills.

Among the findings of the council concerning the issue of entry-level nursing reported in the paper are (1) there is no conclusive evidence that the proposal will result in improved health care services; (2) implementation of the ANA position would eliminate the diploma nurse and the licensed practical nurse; (3) diploma nurse  training programs, licensed practical nurse training programs, and associate degree programs currently offer viable options to persons desiring a career as a nurse; (4) all four types of nurse training programs produce valuable members of the health care delivery system; (5) implementation of the ANA position would increase the cost of health services; and (6) implementation of the ANA proposal would result in disfranchisement of career opportunities for and discrimination against several disadvantaged and special populations.

The program consisted of a slide/tape presentation, a concept lesson, and a group discussion in which leaders plan a lesson for the local group meeting they are to lead. A literature review examined study group effectiveness, training volunteers in peer teaching, and research and theory on teaching adults. Subjects were 192 Hennepin County, Minnesota, adult women who recieved the training as discussion leaders for that county's 1979 November extension homemaker study topic \"Coping with Change Crisis and Loss in Your Life.\" Three treatment groups were devised: all leaders took a pretest; one group was posttested after the slide/tape,  one after the concept lesson, and one at the end of the whole program. Results of statistical analyses showed a significant improvement for the total sample in both their knowledge of and attitude toward the role of discussion leader and toward planning and facilitating a group discussion. However, there was no statistically significant difference among treatment groups in improvement scores and little relationship between individual improvement and the background variables of age, educational attainment, number of times having been a lesson leader, and number of times having led a group discussion. Participants rated the program highly. Implications are presented for further research and for those involved in educating adult educators who work with volunteers. The slide/tape script,  discussion questions, and pre- and posttest are appended. (JT)",

        "description":"Described in the report are the social, demographic, experiential, educational, and ascriptive characteristics of sixteen- to nineteen-year-old jobless youth in the United States. Population sampling, data collection, organization, and reporting methods applied in the Current Population Survey (CPS) of 1979 (the major source of data) are reviewed. The issues of measurement, labor market shifts, and unemployment/out-of-the-labor force flows are discussed. In the section on the scope of youth joblessness labor force participation, unemployment, and non-participation are presented graphically on the basis of sex, marital status, and race. Difficulties for determining the prospects for youth unemployment are discussed. It is suggested that because a wide array of social, economic,  and legal factors interact to affect youth joblessness, vocational education can contribute only indirectly to the alleviation of youth unemployment through improving the employability skills of youth. Suggestions for further research include (1) clarification of whether the reduction of youth unemployment is a goal of vocational education; (2) determination of barriers to youth employment beyond skill deficits constraining what vocational education could do to alleviate youth joblessness; and (3) determination of what vocational education should do in this area.

It helps them understand the importance of designing and implementing a sound evaluation from the early stages of the program, alerts them to common errors or omissions that weaken or destroy conclusions that can be drawn from the evaluation results and shows how to avoid them, and explains administrative procedures involved in obtaining JDRP approval. Section 1, on the benefits of JDRP approval, discusses structure of the National Diffusion Network (NDN) and JDRP, problems in career education evaluation, and overcoming those problems. Section 2 contains a checklist giving essential points for local career educators to consider in  planning evaluation designs. Each item is discussed. Section 3 provides specific recommendations for the local career educator regarding the preparation and submission of an evaluation report to the JDRP. In section 4 are common questions asked by educators and the answers typically given. Appendixes contain the JDRP submission format, three sample JDRP submissions, and a list of references. Each sample is the exact ten-page report submitted and approved by a unanimous or nearly unanimous vote of the panel. (YLB)",

        "description":"Using a &quot;Knowledge Development Plan&quot; prepared as a blueprint, the Office of Youth Programs of the Department of Labor has undertaken various demonstration projects and large-scale evaluation and complementary research studies. The Office is experimenting with alternative employment and employability development approaches for economically disadvantaged youth, in and out of school. One of the first objectives of the knowledge development activities was to develop a standard set of assessment measures and thereby establish a uniform data base across a wide variety of program strategies being tested. Baseline data have provided insight into important relationships between school and working. The finding that the skills, competencies, and behaviors that constitute employability are  acquired incrementally has led to the notion of benchmarking. If acquisition of employment-related attributes is sequential, then program structure must be sequential. Research is being directed to gaining insights into structuring elements in programs such as Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) programs. Other focuses are gaining private sector access, testing of alternative work-oriented programs to prevent dropping out and provide incentive for return to school, linkages between CETA and local educational agencies, and institutional change that Youth Employment and Demonstration Projects Act (YEDPA) legislation can bring about.

At this stage integration is partial and some individuals are left behind. Previous research on the reactions of those left behind has produced two contradictory patterns, i.e., partial integration increases discontent and raises aspirations, as well as the opposite effect. These two findings were tested using 68 female secretaries, who watched a slide/tape presentation describing an executive and a secretarial position at a fictitious oil company. In the presentation the sex ratio of the executives was manipulated. Subjects responded to an attitude questionnaire, a sex-role ideology scale, and an instrument evaluating their desire for promotion.  Results indicated that partial integration of the executive ranks increased secretarial satisfaction with pay, made promotions less desirable, and also had the paradoxical effect of increasing feminist secretaries' satisfaction with the status quo while decreasing their aspirations for upward mobility.

Techniques in physiological, cognitive, and behavioral modalities were incorporated into a broad-based intervention program focusing on the acquisition of coping responses to handle life transitions for a group of adolescent high school seniors. It was hypothesized that students exposed to such a program would evidence higher self-efficacy and would use more cognitive restructuring strategies and problem-solving skills. Three classes of inner-city high school seniors were randomly assigned to an experimental (intervention) or control group. Results supported the hypothesis. Additionally, the program was positively  perceived by both the seniors and school staff. (Author/HLM)",

The trait-characteristic issue, when carried over to employment, serves to justify discrimination against women. Research on attribution theory also supports discrimination, suggesting women attribute success to luck while men attribute success to ability. Research has further found that males have higher expectancy of intellectual and academic reinforcement than females; little data is available on the relationship between expectancy and performance. Most psychological theories espouse sex differences that have no behavioral referrents, thus contributing to the maintenance of discriminatory  practices. A behavioral approach which eliminates qualitative constructs and emphasizes directly measurable variables and conditions is needed to eliminate discriminatory practices against women. (Author/NRB)",

Each situation describes a realistic incident involving interpersonal conflict, principally criticism or rejection by another person. Self-statements and affective state descriptors listed for each situation are categorized as angry, anxious, suspicious, depressed, and rational. The validation of the inventory on an undergraduate population is described, as is its utilization to examine the correlational relationship between self-statements and affective states. The SSASI is viewed as suitable for examining relationships between  self-statements, affects, and behavioral criterion variables; it would be of interest to investigators developing cognitive assessment inventories for clinical applications. Appendices contain both actor and observer versions of the SSASI and their accompanying directions for administration. (Author/NRB)",

        "description":"Since its appearance in 1974, the Snyder Self-Monitoring Scale has been employed in research dealing with self-presentation, attribution, and attitude expression. The Scale was developed to measure the degree to which people are concerned with the social appropriateness of their behavior, are aware of relevant social cues, and regulate their expressive behavior. Examination of the scale items, however, suggests that not all three aspects of self-monitoring are tapped equally, and that some items do not clearly represent any aspect of self-monitoring. The Self-Monitoring Scale was administered to 237 undergraduates and factor analyzed to determine whether it measures a unitary construct. A principal axis analysis with varimax rotation yielded three major factors: Public Impression  Management, Acting, and Social Insecurity. Of the three, only the first factor was clearly central to the construct of self-monitoring. Results suggest that the multidimensionality of the scale makes its use in classifying subjects as high versus low self-monitors questionable and may result in equivocal research findings.

A scale which rated the degree of perceived discrimination against Blacks in 21 occupations was administered to 75 black male, 70 black female, 1,429 white male and 1,457 white female university freshmen. Underrepresentation of Blacks in each of these occupations, according to 1970 Census data, was assumed to indicate actual discrimination. Correlations of perceived discrimination with this putative measure of actual discrimination yielded substantial and highly significant coefficients among all four race-gender groups. The perceptions of black respondents matched the measure of actual discrimination much more  closely than did the perceptions of the white respondents, suggesting black students may be more likely to attribute occupational inequities to discrimination and may also be aware of actual opportunities for Blacks.

Distinctions between home life and work life are necessary in thinking about fairness, deservingness, and deprivation. A survey of over 400 adults explored the extent to which men and women feel deprived about their jobs and home lives and the extent to which they think they are not receiving what they deserve at work and at home. An examination was made of two special subgroups from this survey: 31 employed men and 31 employed women, all married, childless, and with high status jobs. Both men and women felt less deprivation about their home lives than about their work lives. Both men and women felt that the discrepancy between what they  deserve to receive and what they actually are receiving is smaller at home than at work. Results suggest gender is a less important variable than the work-home difference. (NRB)",

The effectiveness of such a training program designed to teach mental health professionals advanced therapy skills with elderly patients was examined with 53 female and 3 male participants. Participants showed statistically significant improvement on the two major assessment devices after completion of the training program. Concomitantly, job satisfaction and perception of preparedness for employment as counselors to the elderly were affected in a positive  direction, providing supporting evidence as to the efficacy of the program. The impact of the training was also sustained at the two-month follow-up. Regression analyses revealed that the trainee characteristics most predictive of success in the program were those having to do with prior knowledge and skill; those entering the program with higher levels of expertise tended to improve and learn more in training.

The gradual integration of PEP students into the general student body and special problems of the  monolingual Chicanos/Latinos are discussed. Some early observations are presented which indicate PEP is accomplishing its retention goals. A discussion of the future of the program includes the need for more minority-group staff members, increased attention to career planning, and PEP's to reach other high-risk student groups.

This device (1) provides an active language experience that allows children to construct stories easily; (2) demonstrates the consequences of choosing different ways for a story to proceed; (3) avoids the overemphasis on low-level characteristics of text such as spelling and handwriting; (4) provides a real audience for children's compositions; (5) creates a natural context for comparing and discussing stories with different high-level characteristics; (6) provides a social and cognitive context in which it is natural for children to work together on language activities; and (7) provides a motivating, nonthreatening, success-oriented  context for language activities. The choices are structured so that the initial choices a child makes constrain choices that can be made later in the process. The Story Maker is implemented in such a way that the child cannot see a given set of alternatives until the time has come to choose among them. After children have had some experience with this technique, they can construct their own Story Makers. (HOD)",

        "description":"Arguing that the term \"competency based education\" (CBE) has been erroneously applied to minimum competency programs, this booklet contends that the problems addressed by the minimum competency movement can be, but probably will not be, resolved by the implementation of true competency based education (CBE). The first section of the booklet defines competencies and extrapolates some implications for curriculum and assessment. The second section, comprising the bulk of the booklet, delineates the substantial revolution that competency based education entails: a shift from time to outcomes based organization and a shift from teacher referenced to criterion referenced standards. It goes on to suggest that not only the magnitude of these changes, but also the lack of a consensus  about appropriate outcomes will probably prevent widespread implementation of CBE. It then adduces the deficiencies both of teacher referenced standards and of the norm referenced standards introduced to correct them and presents two alternative systems that could be criterion referenced. The booklet (1) argues that the accountability movement does not address the causes of illiteracy, which inhere in the system of instruction; (2) outlines the reforms that would have to ensue if the problem were instead conceived as effectiveness; (3) indicates how CBE would resolve the problem; and (4) stipulates measures that would ensure its flexibility.

        "description":"A total of 168 fourth and sixth grade students participated in a study to examine two aspects of children's ability to apply structure while reading. The first part of the study investigated the amount of detail that must be provided in order for students to apply successfully a desired perspective (schema). Students were identified as either good or poor readers and placed into control or experimental groups. All students were given a short passage to read, with readers in the control groups asked to highlight any material they thought to be important and readers in the experimental group asked to highlight material related to a prescribed topic. They were also administered a recall task. The results showed that both fourth and sixth grade students recalled more  perspective-related material when given a perspective. The second part of the study examined age and reading ability differences in student awareness of an idea unit's structural importance. The methodology used was the same as in the first experiment, with the exception that students also completed a recognition task in which they chose from a group of sentences those that had appeared in the passage. Reading ability was found to interact with idea unit importance on both recall and highlighting measures. Both measures showed good readers to be more sensitive to the structural relevance of the material they were reading. (FL)",

One week later, one half of the students were given tests containing only female referents, and the other half were given tests containing only male referents. A significant difference was found between neuter-and gender-specific test scores, with both males and females making higher scores on the male-only referent test than on the neuter referent test.

In the role-taking approach, researchers attempt to improve children's communication accuracy by training them to be more sensitive to listener needs. In the task-analytic approach, researchers teach specific skills thought to be relevant to the performance of various communication tasks. Efforts to improve children's communication performance by role-taking training have had mixed results. Results from task-analytic training research that focused on teaching children to engage in comparison activity show that the training was effective in improving children's performance and in maintaining these changes over time but  that the training did not generalize to other tasks. Researchers should begin to find ways of integrating the task-analytic and role taking approaches in their studies of children's referential communication ability. (Author/FL)",

Three experiments were conducted involving a total of 98 college stuents. The first and second experiments demonstrated that clauses with pronouns become better processing units in contexts that provide a referential antecedent for the pronoun. The third experiment demonstrated that listeners begin to make inferences necessary to construct an antecedent for a definite noun phrase prior to the end of a clause or sentence. The results suggest that  there is not an initial point in the comprehension process at which the listener's representation of what has been heard is restricted to information of the type provided by the context-independent description posited by most grammars. The findings further suggest that the initial processing and representation of a sentence in discourse may differ from those of the same sentence in isolation. (FL)",

A methodology was developed to elicit and describe children's language in different social settings that require different situational uses of language. Four task situations were designed to create situational contexts and to elicit situational language of either an intimate, casual, consultative, or formal nature. Findings were analyzed in several categories: subject matter maintenance and switching; nonlinguistic features of communication; lexical diversity; contractions, compactions and truncations; colloquial and standard forms of \"yes\"; lexical density; lexical content words;  grammatical features; and extraneous linguistic material. The results of many of the analyses suggest that they are useful measures that differentiate language use in different sociolinguistic situations and that the interlinking of sociolinguistics and child language development can bring a new focus to the study of children's language.

He worked at a four-year public college with an enrollment of more  than 5,000 and advised a weekly student newspaper. He had 9.5 years of advising experience and five to six years of professional journalism experience. He taught journalism, was not the only adviser on his campus, and did not have a written job description. He was not required to read copy prior to its publication. The findings also revealed that 45.7% of the respondents felt that copy should be read before its publication and that 50.2% actually did read such copy, suggesting that student publications nationwide are subject to prior restraint.

(Visual complexity is defined as a composite variable that assesses the number of perceptual elements in a visual display and accounts for the extent of movement or activity in a scene.) Forty-eight preschool children were exposed to half-hour segments of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; programs in an environment that contained toys and other sources of distraction. Each child's visual attention to the television program was recorded by an unseen observer. Following the exposure, each child was asked a number of specific recall and recognition questions about the program. Results indicated a slight negative relationship between visual complexity and  attention and a strong negative relationship between visual complexity and recall. Attention was found to be positively associated with recognition but not with recall. The findings suggest that visual attention was related to the learning of visually presented information but not necessarily to the learning of aurally presented information. (Author/FL)",

It notes that the last stage is often omitted by communication researchers. The paper then describes the stages in causal analysis and relates each to the philosophical requirements. Next, it analyzes three very different  studies involving causal analysis. In conclusion, it illustrates the power of the often omitted third stage of causal analysis in detecting errors in causal ordering and linkages. (FL)",

News values and editorial policy are often implicit varieties of civic propaganda. The subjective metaphor is most evident in the presentation, protection, and defense of the central business district as the place for civic worship of sacred icons, relics, and ceremonies. City planning news policy combines media and civic self-interest wrapped in the ethos of social responsibility and public interest. The civic ideology affects definitions and interpretations of urban problems and sets the news agenda  throughout the newspaper. Journalists tend to justify their subjective involvement (if they admit to it) as a means of promoting civic identity and consensus; but in fact it leads to the reporting of some debatable events as nonpolitical, for the common good, and closed to debate. As civic custodians of civic symbols, civic pride, and a city's reputation, the participant-observer press often blends its fate mutually with that of the community. (Author/GT)",

The articles deal with the following topics: (1) the constant interaction of collecting, connecting, writing, and reading in the process of making meaning on paper; (2) the integration of prose models into the context of the writing process; (3) the application of the experiential approach utilizing the writing workshop; (4) the rhetoricians' concern with purposes and audiences; (5) the epistemic approach using language as a way of writing, knowing, and learning; (6) adaptations of the process approach for beginning or basic writers; (7) a wholly conference-based plan for writing instruction; and (8) an interdisciplinary approach  allowing students to develop their writing through assignments for other courses. The teachers comment on various aspects of teaching writing, including leading prewriting discussions, creating stimulating assignments, asking provocative questions during the drafting process, learning from students' answers, and making evaluation part of learning.

A reexamination of the demise of &quot;The Masses&quot; has been made to show the milieu in which the proceedings occurred. Using biographical materials and original, contemporary sources, this reanalysis has helped elucidate the federal government's wayward legal machinations, its position with regard to the magazine, the devil-may-care attitudes of the left-wing editors themselves, the hilarity of the first trial, and the war hysteria of the times. More than a tragic story of a small, powerless, left-wing publication silenced by the  ruthless collusion of establishment forces, the premature end of &quot;The Masses&quot; is really a part of the larger history of a more youthful, less cynical America.

        "description":"Twenty-eight composition teachers at a large university, a two-year college, and an engineering college, all of whom had taught composition through both the tutorial method and typical classroom methods, were interviewed regarding advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches. Among the advantages of tutorials mentioned were the chance to focus directly on students' unique writing needs, immediate feedback regarding student comprehension, improvement in student/teacher relationships and student attitudes, the possibility of a greater volume of writing than in the classroom approach, and dramatic improvements in students' writing. The most frequently mentioned disadvantage of tutorials was the time they require and their lack of cost effectiveness; other disadvantages were  that tutorials are mentally and physically exhausting, sometimes tedious for the student, and provide no group identity or peer criticism. However, it was observed that many teachers who found tutorials exhausting created unnecessary extra work for themselves and that tedious tutorial sessions may have resulted from a lack of focus on students' writing. It appears likely that the success or failure of tutorials is largely dependent on teacher attitudes. It also appears that the tutorial method provides teachers with a great deal of power over students. (Writing samples are provided to show how a student's writing style was actually damaged through tutorials. A table of teachers' responses to the interview questions is also included.) (GT)",

The report also discusses the state board of education's goals and policies in the areas of reading and writing, gifted education, and arts in education; the future for English curricula in Illinois secondary schools; a comparison of state and national survey data (the latter drawn from Arthur N.

Obstacles to overcome in the efficient administration of interdisciplinary studies include (1) designing quality courses, (2) maintaining cost effectiveness, (3) acquiring full administrative support, and (4) increasing the job opportunities of fine arts graduates. A cooperative or experiential fine arts interdisciplinary program provides employers with a good source of labor and the opportunity to preview potential employees, and  it establishes goodwill ambassadors through students returning to campus.

Successful films were those listed by &quot;Variety&quot; magazine as the top revenue producers for the given year. Data were collected for the years 1969-1979. The analysis showed that years in which fewer films were produced had greater ratios of successful films, usually over 25%. An annual market saturation point of about 400 films was evident. The two central rating categories, PG and R, dominated the system, accounting for 78.5% of all films rated. Films with PG ratings enjoyed the highest average success ratio of the four categories. Of the 1,836 films rated PG from 1969 to 1979, 491 or 26.7% were considered successful. The PG category  had the largest number of successful films for each year in the study. Close behind PG in overall success was the G category, belying the myth that G ratings were &quot;box office poison.&quot; Pictures rated G enjoyed a 24.2% success ratio over the entire period. Although more films were rated R than any other category, their success ratio was only 13.7%. The number of films rated R each year varied greatly, but the number of million dollar revenue producing R films was quite stable from year to year. The success ratio for X-rated films was only 5%.

        "description":"The relationship between communication theory and media research must be reciprocal. Without some acknowledgement of a commonality with specific aspects of communication theory, media research efforts will continue to stagnate and produce uninterpretable or extremely limited observations. On the other hand, media researchers' commitment to the artificial constraints imposed by particular disciplines or applied fields has failed to produce the consistency, generality, and commonality needed for the development of a comprehensive instructional communication model. Such a model would of necessity be eclectic--an extrapolation from a broad spectrum of models, paradigms, classification systems, and hierarchies. Proceeding within such a theoretical framework, research integration of a  statistical nature presents an opportunity to cross the artificial boundaries of disciplines and applied fields to produce information of greater generalizability. It also has the advantage of upgrading the vague summaries generic to many narrative reviews. It seems reasonable to assume that such integrations of communication research in the behaviorial sciences could result in one or more axiomatic theories for instruction. Until these tasks have been accomplished, however, research on instructional media will still be based largely on \"implusive reckoning.\" (FL)",

It contends also that the way in which people's style is used and interpreted by others directly influences their effectiveness in communicative interactions. The communicative styles of Mexican Americans are addressed along a continuum of cultural identity: (1) the \"American of Mexican Ancestry\" to describe individuals who would first identify themselves as plainly Americans; (2) the \"Mexican American\" to describe those individuals who are conscious of the duality of their existence and who live in conflict; (3) the \"Chicano\" to describe individuals who see themselves as part of a unique cultural entity separate from  either Mexican or American culture; and (4) the \"Mexican\" to describe the cultural identity of one whose primary referent in day to day life is Mexican culture. In a subsequent section, testable hypotheses are suggested to provide a framework for researching the relationship between cultural identity and communication style. Appended are examples of cultural identity measures, a communicator style construct, and examples of communication style measures. (HOD)",

        "description":"An organic approach to style in acting can lend credibility and power to performances and can enhance the clarity and extent of what is communicated to audiences about other social worlds. The organic approach is based on the following principles: mental experience and expressive behavior are inseparable and reciprocal; experience in either mode (mental or expressive) automatically provokes correlated behavior in the other; actors are not capable of creating the full illusion of human behavior on stage by purely imitative means; and the primary device for controlling the flow of expression at an adequate level is the stream of perception-feeling-thought, often called \"sub-text.\" Using an organic approach to dealing with style calls for these acting techniques: (1) understanding  the general conventions of the period; (2) finding the extent to which that style is the style of the world of the play; (3) synthesizing a general style from the historical world and the playwright's world; (4) individualizing each aspect of the play through the character's history, goals, motives, and perception habits; (5) using the individualization as the basic communicative device, acting a set of attitudes and expectations within and \"against\" the general style; and (6) making the set of attitudes and expectations habitual and then forgetting them.

The paper then discusses the ways in which the three principles are obstructive.

Principals utilized a variety of methods for actively promoting change. Central office personnel rated experienced principals and those employing paid teacher aides as deeply involved in change more often than inexperienced principals and than principals who did not employ paid aides. Demographic characteristics did not seem crucial factors in predicting which principals would initiate change. In general, the principals were aware of the  behaviors necessary to implement change.

All public schools in Georgia containing eighth grade students were classified as non-modernized, partially modernized, or modern according to results of questionnaires administered to building principals in 1975-76. Academic achievement data providing the dependent variable for the analysis were derived from scores on the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills taken by each school's eighth-grade students in 1975-76. Independent variables were school building age and socioeconomic status of each building's student population (based on the percentage of students participating free or at reduced rates in the school's lunch  program). Analysis indicated that when the socioeconomic status variable was statistically controlled, school building age was significantly related (at the .05 level) to the composite, vocabulary, and mathematics scores on the Iowa Tests.

Opportunities to change this situation presently exist, but will disappear with time. Trends in economics, technology, demographics, the philosophy of government, and changing cultural values and beliefs indicate that the 1980s will be a period of substantial uncertainty in America, necessitating social flexibility and high productivity. Changes in education are vital to encourage this productivity and flexibility. A revision of current federal educational goals is necessary, but will be insufficient without the creation of a new role for the federal government in education. Defining this new role as the coordination of the  production and distribution of knowledge will provide the necessary overarching scope to federal efforts. These efforts can then be readily coordinated through a central agency such as the new Department of Education. (Author/PGD)",

The first section presents overviews of the past and present status of women and minorities in education. The overviews are followed by a discussion of various concepts of equality of educational opportunity and their implications for developing and presenting educational indicators in a social indicator report. The section introducing the conceptual frameworks to be used divides the subject matter into eight content areas  (aspiration, enrollment, retention, resources, achievement, subject matter, teachers, and administrators), each with a set of related issues (research questions) and a focused literature review. The study discusses the data sources available and those that should be created.

Responses were received from 330 of the 1470 persons in the sample. The findings indicate support for the goals of community education. More specifically, 64 percent agreed or strongly agreed that the mission of the schools is not limited to serving the needs of youth but should reflect service to the entire community. Over 75 percent were in favor of expanding the programs available to include leisure,  vocational, and educational classes for adults and to offer more activities for youth. Seventy-six percent felt that school facilities ought to be available to the community for expanding accessibility and availability of services. The strongest support indicated by respondents (85 percent) was for community participation in the design and implementation of programs and activities. Finally, interagency coordination was supported by 70 percent of the respondents. (Author/MLF)",

Eight teachers in three English comprehensive schools participated in a study of their use of the United Kingdom Schools Council Integrated Science Project (SCISP). This project was chosen for study because it asked teachers to take seriously the discussion of value issues in science in the context of integrated subject matter, with an aim of changing student attitudes and evaluating these changes. Interviews, participant observation, and questionnaires were employed to study the use of the project. The teachers also participated in two one-hour clinical interviews in which constructs about  their teaching methods were elicited. Analysis of the constructs suggests that teachers construe their practice in such a way as to reduce ambiguities associated with their work. The paper shows how these teachers adapted the innovative materials so as to minimize sources of role diffuseness inherent in the doctrine of the project. The results suggest that the teachers operated functional systems designed to permit stable classroom relationships. (Author/MLF)",

Research is cited showing the incidence of mental retardation and learning disabilities among adjudicated youth. Policy issues are addressed in the following areas: procedural safeguards (including timely notice, nondiscriminatory evaluation, and surrogate parents); appropriate educational programing; placement in the least restrictive environment (including a review of judicial interpretation of the principle); and individualized education programs (IEPs). Trends  in state interagency agreements to provide special education and related services to the population are depicted in a chart, and selected state situations are discussed. Among future issues examined are personnel needs and inservice training, funding and the provision of related services, and educational policy considerations for the handicapped offender aged 18 to 21 under P.L. 94-142. Eight policy options are presented, including suggestions for cooperation between the state education agency and the state youth correctional facility in developing IEPs. (CL)",

        "description":"The study of overlap between Elementary Secondary Education Act Title I services and P.L. 94-142 (the Education for All Handicapped Children Act) services was designed to address two questions--to what extent is there a duplication of services to students who might be eligible for both programs, and to what extent do procedures and rules in the selection and provision of services to students result in limitations of the services that a student might be eligible to receive. Case studies of schools in six states (California, Tennessee, Wyoming, Washington, South Carolina, and Oklahoma) were conducted. Although patterns of overlap problems differed greatly from state to state, it was found that duplication of services was not a major problem in the districts studied. Among major  findings were the following: the extent of dual eligibility in California is unknown since there is no mass screening of students for special education services; in Tennessee, a student's chances of receiving special education services may partly depend on which school the student attends; and in Wyoming, Washington, South Carolina, and Oklahoma, teacher referrals began the process of special education placement and were important for Title I placement as well. Among conclusions were that there is a need for more flexibility in the rules governing the receipt of multiple services, that problems stemming from exclusive reliance on teacher referrals might be reduced by clarifying the differences between Title I students and handicapped students; and that it might serve policymakers well to  shift their focus from identifying target populations to meeting the specific service needs of students.

        "description":"The survey of adult education conducted by the National Center for Educational Statistics in 1972 is analyzed. The following facts are highlighted in the more detailed analysis of 1972 results: (1) The demand for hours of adult education is distributed in proportion to eligibles in each age and education group, (2) persons with lower levels of either education or income, or both, are likely to enroll in courses of longer duration, and (3) their dropout rate is consequently higher. Hence, it is recommended that special attention be given to restructuring courses for persons with lower levels of education to make them shorter. It is suggested that each module should have &quot;some take home value.&quot; It was determined that income does not play as important a role in determining either  the propensity to enroll, the number of hours contracted for, or the educational institutions in which adult students enroll. The policy implication of these findings is obvious: Additional subsidies to adult education are not a high priority item. The only possible exception to this generalization is the need to increase training opportunities for young, poor Americans. They are least likely to be trained by employers, and depend a great deal upon public moneys to cover their training costs. (Author/HD)",

A historical review indicates the changing perception of the criminal from sinner to socially disadvantaged. A literature review is summarized which revealed that the tendency to declare that no rehabilitation programs work is inaccurate. Key legislation under which Federally funded corrections education  programs are implemented is described, and Federal program coordinating efforts through agencies in the Departments of Labor, Justice, and HEW are outlined. Data are presented for the types and number of inmates involved in corrections education programs in adult basic education, adult secondary education, vocational/occupational education, social education, and postsecondary education. A discussion of the need for corrections education policy and coordination including the role of HEW comprise the last section. The recommendations presented focus on the need for the Federal role being defined according to both national educational objectives and national criminal justice objectives. The establishment of a representative of corrections education within the Office of the Secretary, HEW, to  represent the interests of the corrections clientele, is suggested. (MF)",

Respondents included agents (those involved in the educational system such as administrators, faculty, broadcasters, librarian, and others) and consumers (representatives of groups of people who might pursue lifelong learning). Results revealed differences between these groups, consumers seeing more needs than agents. Differences also existed among agents. Community college staff readily accepted open admission, while staff from State-related universities and private colleges opposed the idea. The general view of the groups surveyed seemed to be that lifelong learners have a broad range of needs and that those learners must bear a substantial portion of the cost of those services.  Results showed primary needs as including limited requirements for admission to educational programs to encourage broad participation, widespread availability of academic and vocational counseling, and development of tests to supplement the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) tests for crediting experience. The authors note that conflicts and disagreements among the respondents prevented simple interpretation of the data, concluding that the lifelong learner has a great many needs and people currently in the system do not yet agree on how to respond to them.

        "description":"An approach to implementing competency-based education programs using a combination of self-instructional modules, individualized management processes, and group instructional techniques was designed and used for a comprehensive consumer education program incorporated into various high school business education programs. This instructional development was part of Project PACT (Pupil Achievement and Consumer Teaching) conducted at Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, in cooperation with three Michigan school districts. Each of the 45 instructional modules in PACT was constructed to lead to specified consumer education competencies and performance objectives, demonstrated by referenced test items. This paper describes the PACT modules and test items and the first year of the  tryout phase of the consumer education program. Appended are an instructional module and an example of a test item.

The approach taken to the job description was a competency-based training design, calling for the specification of the competencies required by the position. A list of 44 competency statements was developed and submitted to the 33 incumbent coordinators who had responded to a questionnaire asking for a description of their programs and individual characteristics. The ratings of the 44 competency statements as made by the 33 incumbents, presented in tabular form, showed that most of the statements were considered important or essential to the job. It was therefore concluded that the competencies were  descriptive of a single job class. The longer-range objective of the study was to provide a base for a proposed inservice training program for this new class of educational personnel, called coordinators of special needs. The competencies required also imply program needs of handicapped and disadvantaged students in vocational education. (MF)",

The paper defines the terms adult and career education and discusses a structure for the domain of career education of adults. Information about aspects of career education of adults other than instructional, such as counseling, career development, and job placement, is reported. The point is made that career education for adults depends not only on activities based in educational institutions but also on a wide variety of services by agencies outside colleges, universities, and other postsecondary teaching  institutions. (Three examples of such services used to illustrate this point are educational brokering, educational assessment and credentialing, and experiential learning.) Three categories of career education of adults are posited: Preparatory, primary, and adaptive, each of which address different goals or purposes of career education of adults. Brief recommendations are made and a list of references is included. (TA)",

        "description":"Seeking to determine the leadership and personal development competencies that are needed by employees in agricultural occupations, the authors surveyed a sample of 280 Ohio agricultural leaders at the management, mid-management, and labor occupational levels. The survey instrument was designed to identify competencies performed at each level, to determine the degree of importance of each competency, and to indicate which should be included in vocational agriculture curriculum. Based on a 76% response rate, a computer data analysis, and review by an advisory committee of agricultural educators to determine which competencies should be included in curriculum, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) Leadership and personal development competencies are performed by agricultural  leaders and are important to successful performance in agricultural occupations at all three levels with no marked differences in performance or importance of competencies by occupational level, (2) FFA activities which promote leadership and personal development competencies were perceived as important, (3) personal development competencies were generally rated higher than leadership competencies in both performance and importance, (4) performance and importance ratings of competencies may not always be directly related, (5) and leadership and personal development competencies must be included in vocational education curriculum. The report suggests specific recommendations and implications for use of the study data and competency lists in program evaluation and development.  (BM)",

It attempts to define relevant terms and outline a method of self-advocacy which can, if utilized properly, lessen the impact of institutional racism. The terms, institution, race, racism, advocacy and self-advocacy are first defined. Next, the origin and development of institutions within a social contract perspective is presented. Third, a theory of the development and diminishment of racist institutions in the United States is presented. Fourth, various advocacy efforts are presented and analyzed regarding their impact upon institutional racism. Particular emphasis is made on the distinctions  between advocacy \"on behalf of\" efforts and self-advocacy efforts. In addition, the Advocate Counseling Model, a self-advocacy approach espoused by authors, is heavily stressed in this paper and in the workshop. (Author)",

The instrument, in its present form, consists of 45 items. Subjects were 135 graduate students. Responses were subjected to a number of analytical procedures. Congruency scores for each item are presented. The following items elicit predominantly congruent responses: lacks self-confidence; easily led; always giving advice; acts important; bossy; and dominating. These items elicit predominantly incongruent responses: self-respecting; firm but just; capable of complaint if necessary; resentful of being bossed; and hard to impress. Categorical responses to the items demonstrate that  generally incongruent responses are dominated by &quot;I am and should not be, ideally&quot; while congruent classifications are dominated by &quot;I am and I should be, ideally&quot;. All items met the criterion for acceptable discrimination. The mean congruency score was 22.6 with a standard deviation of 13.5. The KR-20 reliability coefficient was .96 with a concomitantly small standard error of measurement. These results suggest that it is possible to assess the construct of congruency behavior. Such information may facilitate future counselor training. (Author/JLL)",

This study was conducted to examine the effects of death anxiety on the attitudes and behaviors of student nurses toward old persons. To this end, 150 student nurses were surveyed. Eight scales were subjected to the following analysis: tests for independence (chi-square), two-way analysis of variance and multiple regression analysis. The results suggest that death anxiety and attitudes toward the aged are significantly correlated. A coefficient of determination of 8% indicates that death anxiety accounts for only a small amount of the variance in attitudes toward the aged. Attitudes toward geriatric nursing and death anxiety are not  correlated. Of nine health care settings, institutions for the aged ranked as a preferred place of work. The aged as a patient group ranked next to last. Of five nursing specialities, geriatric nursing is ranked third as a career choice. Two hypotheses for coping with anxiety--an anxiety-denial hypothesis and an anxiety-reduction hypothesis--are used to interpret the results. (Author)",

Compared with women in general, both groups were emotionally stable, assertive, serious, conscientious, sensitive, adaptable, self-assured, experimental, self-sufficient, and self-controlled.

Study 1 was a replication of his procedure with children from Grades 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. While there was weak evidence that some older subjects chose the categorial strategy, there was little evidence for use of the seriation strategy at any age level. In Study 2 we investigated the effects of strategy training with first and sixth graders. Subjects were given either serial, categorical, or no training. Categorical training was highly effective for older subjects, although it had but minor benefits for younger subjects. In contrast, serial training was not differentially effective for older and younger subjects. The data suggested  that seriation as a retrieval strategy develops later than categorization, contrary to current theoretical notions. The implications of these developmental trends for adult individual differences in strategy performance were discussed. (Author)",

The subjects were 76 four-and five-year old females drawn from six privately owned kindergartens and nurseries. The children were randomly assigned to one of two groups. In the control group, color preference was established by presenting each child with circles of each of the five colors: red, blue, yellow, black, and white, and asking them to select the color of their choice. The children in the experimental group were individually presented with dog caricatures of each of the five colors. Each child was then told a story about either a good or a bad dog and then asked to select which of the dogs she thought was the good or bad  dog. These stories were presented to each child in a counter-balanced order. A Bayesian statistical analysis revealed that attribution of good or bad is strongly dependent on color. Attribution of good is associated with the colors red and white; the attribution of bad is associated with black. However, comparison of attribution of good and bad with color preference revealed that attribution of good was highly dependent upon color preference whereas attribution of bad was not. (Author)",

In six of the seven cases, the use of tests in hiring was held unlawful on the grounds that the validity study did not produce adequate evidence. The evidence set forth by the court cases supports the proposition that the greater the degree of adverse impact and the smaller the degree to which an employer in fact desegregated a previously segregated work force, the less likely it is that the selection procedure will withstand judicial scrutiny. The implications of these cases for  industrial psychologists are briefly discussed. (YRJ)",

        "description":"To gauge the effect that different cultural attitudes and child-rearing practices may have on the development of empathy, the Feshbach and Roe Affective Situational Test for Empathy was administered to 64 Greek city children and to 60 Greek rural children, all aged six to seven. The empathic responses of the Greek children were compared to those obtained earlier from 46 American city children. Greek children were less empathic than American children and whereas there was no overall difference in the responses of American boys versus American girls, Greek boys were less empathic than Greek girls. These results are attributed to the inhibition of the internalization process in Greece, where parents discipline their children by rigid and punitive means. The close mother-son  relationship, heightened by the fact that Greek fathers seldom participate in child-rearing and are usually away from home, may further inhibit the internalization process and empathy in Greek boys.

Novaco developed a cognitive behavior therapy approach to chronic anger problems. Clinical techniques have followed the work of Meichenbaum (1974, 1975) in the development of an approach called &quot;stress inoculation&quot; that has been applied to anxiety and pain. Cognitive factors in the regulation of anger and the use of skills training approaches to self-control are reviewed as they pertain to the development of the stress inoculation model. The stress inoculation approach to anger management is described as having three basic steps: (a) cognitive preparation, (b) skill acquisition and rehearsal, and (c) application practice. Results of the anger managment procedures for a  group of hospitalized patients are presented. The treatment was conducted on an acute psychiatric ward of a community hospital for patients, having problems with anger who were referred by the attending psychiatrist. Treatment is evaluated by means of staff behavior ratings, test inventories, self-monitored ratings of anger and ability to manage provocation, and self-report and physiological measures of anger to simulated provocations. The interface of treatment and assessment by the application practice phase is described. (Author)",

Psychopathic delinquents were more immature in level of moral development than all other groups which did not differ from one another. Psychopathic delinquents were significantly more concrete in their thinking on cognitive tasks than all other groups who exhibited signs of early formal operational thinking. Psychopathic and to a lesser extent neurotic delinquents were deficient in role taking compared with controls and subculturals who  did not differ from one another.

Each plan was studied in an elaborated and an unelaborated form. Subjects were 70 four-year olds, 35 boys and 35 girls. The major piece of apparatus employed was a talking Clown Box. Each child was shown a pegboard task, and warned that the Clown Box might tempt him to stop working, thus ensuring that he would be allowed to play only with some unattractive toys rather than with some special ones. The children were instructed in group-specific verbalizations to be repeated to the Clown Box. The main dependent measure assessed the proportion of time spent working by each child. Subjects in the  elaborated temptation-inhibiting and elaborated reward-oriented plan conditions worked for a greater proportion of the test phase than those in other plan conditions and than those in the control conditions. Whether or not a self-instructional plan will facilitate a young child's self-control depends on the substantive or content nature of the plan, and its level of organization of structure.

In the first study, conducted with 200 female undergraduates, it was found that sex-typed perception of within-home spaces was related to sex-typed use of personal space on a project measure. In the second study, perception of within home sex-typed spaces was confirmed in questionnaire responses of 26 married student families living in comparable housing. In addition, husbands and wives individually completed conflict resolution stories using a housing model designed for the study. Those who reported use of sex-typed spaces for privacy were more likely to complete conflict stories with withdrawal  themes. Implications for the effects of microecology of the home on family interaction were discussed. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper addresses two questions of widespread concern in literature on the family: (1) Is a score from one spouse adequate to measure marital adjustment? If not, how should the scores of the couple be treated to measure this concept? and (2) What is the effect of social desirability on responses to marital adjustment measures? Data from 44 paired couples (n 88) selected by a random process from a rural village some 12 miles from a university were collected. The Locke-Wallace short-form marital adjustment test, the Bienvenu communication scale, and the Crowne-Marlow Social Desirability scale were utilized. &quot;Couple&quot; scores were ascertained by three different assumption methods: (1) the partner whose &quot;costs&quot; overbalanced &quot;profits&quot; in the marital relationship would withdraw first  from the marriage; (2) the partner whose &quot;profits&quot; exceeded &quot;costs&quot; would strive harder to maintain the marital relationship, and (3) the couple's marital adjustment score would be reflected best by an average. Results suggest that, should future research replicate these findings, scientists in family research would not need to be too concerned as to which indicator of marital adjustment to use nor about social desirability as a contaminating variable.

Individualized instruction by the teacher is made possible through the use of cassette tapes turned in each week by students demonstrating specific communication skills as outlined in &quot;Alive and Aware&quot; by Nunnally, Miller and Wackerman, 1976. The instructor listens to each student's tape then tapes a personal response to the student's demonstration. Positive and/or negative feedback on particular communicating skills are thus possible. The individual response models an &quot;I count, you count&quot; stance, and is an effective way to personalize the  relationship between student and instructor. The time of listening and responding to tapes and the mechanics of student taping are considered, but the opportunity for spontaneity and individual response which cassette tapes offer are worthwhile.

Four groups were studied: a control group, students contacted through the mail by the counselor, students contacted by their instructor and then referred to an assigned counselor, and students contacted by both instructor and counselor. Analysis of the Study Habits and Study Attitudes for each of the four groups' pre- and post-test was based on a One-Way Fixed Effects Analysis of Variance. In regard to study habits, the  null hypothesis was rejected only by Group D with indications that Group C could also reject the null hypothesis with additional analysis. Data for study attitudes for each group indicated the null hypothesis was rejected by all four groups. In general, study habits can be changed via a counseling program. Integrating instruction with counseling techniques can facilitate this change. Additional analysis should be conducted for the study attitudes area. (Author/JLL)",

While it is tempting to think that proven techniques can be matched to specific marital problems, the literature cautions that predicting outcome in therapy research depends not only on the technique used, but also on therapist and couple characteristics, choice of conjoint, individual, or group therapy, as well as other variables of the therapeutic setting. Results of empirical investigations of these factors are inconclusive. Therapists can, however, examine results of empirical outcome research to distinguish which techniques are most helpful for certain problem areas. The 26 problems, presented alphabetically, include  Alcoholism, Behavior Deficits and Excesses, Communication Breakdown, Hostility, Money and Sex. Sources used are representative of current outcome research and case presentations attesting to the effectiveness of the techniques described under each problem heading. For each problem area, one or more techniques are suggested as useful to therapists during treatment of couples. (Author)",

One group of adults was enrolled in a Transcendental Meditation program; a second group of adults participated in a relaxation response program whose primary focus is the learning of a relaxed meditation technique; a third group, composed of college students, practiced within a Psychology of Creativity course, a variety of creativity enhancing techniques; finally, a fourth group of adults underwent no special treatment. Significant pre-post increases were obtained on four  of the five creativity measures for only the Psychology of Creativity group, with no differences for the TM, the relaxation response, and the no treatment group. The claim that the practice of meditation leads to increased creativity is not supported. (Author)",

The course is designed to provide the student with experiential situations and continual feedback through written assignments  in a two-way interaction with the instructor. There are 12 lessons assigned. Evaluation is based on open book mid-term, and final exams and a project. A pre- and post-attitude scale will assist in evaluating the effectiveness of the course.

A second section of the paper discusses methods of overcoming these obstacles. One subsection lists and discusses sampling techniques which have been proposed and/or implemented to study such &quot;taboo&quot; topics as sexual behavior, homosexuality, family violence and child abuse. The next subsection discusses methods of data collection. Standard methods such as observations and interviews tend to require considerable work if researchers are to get the cooperation of the subjects. Techniques such as the funneling technique, the  random response technique, projective techniques, and experimental designs are reviewed in this section. The last subsection examines problems of validity and reliability. The third section examines additional problems in sensitive issue research such as contingencies posed in federally-funded research by the guidelines for the protection of human subjects. (Author)",

Whether or not the learning disabilities cause the delinquency is uncertain. This report: (1) defines learning problems and considers their prevalence among juvenile delinquents; (2) considers the constraints faced by juvenile institutions in dealing with learning problems; (3) stresses the public schools' need to identify and treat these children; (4) describes the limited federal involvement in  identification and treatment; (5) offers recommendations for Congressional action.

Subjects were 48 mothers in such families. Interviews were intended to determine the following: (1) whether parents who were offered a choice deliberated about the options available to them or whether they chose a school on the basis of one or two narrow criteria; (2) what procedures the parents followed in selecting a school; and (3) what criteria the parents used in making their final selections. Findings show that over two-thirds of the parents used their choice opportunities to select the school they felt was most suited to their child. Active search  behavior seemed to be elicited by two considerations: (1) schools available to the parents qualitatively differed; and (2) education levels of the parents were high. Parents at the lower ends of the socioeconomic range were less likely to have heard about their choice opportunity and to have researched and deliberated. Generally, parents were most concerned about the nature of the school and classroom environment to which their child would be exposed. (Author/JLL)",

The design was executed within the resources of personnel and time budget of the regular school system. The project was intended to be a pilot demonstration -- a model for other schools and other communities. The project sought to train teachers in techniques and methods aimed toward improving classroom learning conditions, thereby preventing the mildly disturbed child  from progressing to more serious problems. Major emphasis of the training program focused on the development of interpersonal skills, group dynamics and management, and utilization of small group interaction in the classroom.

Promising results during the first and second years led to field testing at a county high school, a suburban middle school, and a rural middle school. In each setting, group pretesting, individual goal-setting conferences, individual programming, 15 hours of reading-laboratory time, group posttesting, and final individual conferences were provided. Evaluation of program results indicated that the average pupil in the laboratory school read about one-fourth  faster and with significantly better comprehension and that pupils in the field testing schools evidenced similar gains.

An objective test was constructed for each of eight skills, and published tests were used for the remaining two. Complete data were available on 220 upper intermediate children. Using a series of multiple regression analyses it was concluded that a hierarchical relationship existed which specified an ascending order from the literal, to the interpretive, to the critical. Three characteristics underlying the ability to read critically were subjectively identified: the ability to interact with an author; to use criteria for judgment; to suspend judgment. Characteristics of the children which may have influenced their functioning on the tests were studied. The language aptitudes of  understanding verbal concepts and organizing data for recall had the greatest impact. Of equal importance was a teacher-group interaction which apparently resulted in three patterns of achievement: above capacity; below capacity; scattered functioning. Chronological age, sex, grade level had limited or no effect. (Author)",

This paper suggests that reading teachers should work with individual content-course instructors to show them how to help their students learn to read and study the chosen text. The paper points out that teachers of technical courses need to develop awareness of the population group they teach, since students in community colleges are, typically, far less academically able than are their baccalaureate counterparts. Teachers need to select textbooks appropriate to the students' reading levels, to demonstrate to students how to read the text, and to preteach vocabulary  words. They must show students how to write summaries and papers, and they should be supported in their efforts to write easy-to-read tests for students. Content-course teachers must also consider factors specific to their areas.

In order to design an effective reading comprehension program, teachers and program planners must assess children's logical abilities. This discussion provides a review of some of the literature concerning logical thinking and outlines several reasoning patterns: causality, negation, conditionality, and so on. Implications for the reading teacher suggest that decisions regarding teaching and measuring be made on the basis of workability and not on assumptions of reasoning ability, that decisions concerning instructional approaches and materials selection be based on a solid understanding of the reasoning tasks  required in stories and exercises, and that formal reasoning-skills instruction take place.

Teachers gave prompts, or cues, to help each child recognize unknown words, concentrating on behaviors hypothesized to encourage pupil success and independence in decoding. Previous research had shown that inservice teachers used strategies that did not result in successful decoding by pupils. Data were collected by using the Oral Reading Observation System. The readers were from special and regular education classes, grades two through six, and were at least one or more years behind in their reading achievement. The pupils were divided, at the median, into a high group and a low group determined by standardized test results. Analysis of variance was run to  determine if teachers prompted the groups differentially and if there were differential success rates for the groups in response to specific teacher prompts. Results showed that low-ability readers received different kinds of teacher prompts and that prompts based upon graphic textual features were followed by significantly more correct pupil responses than those based on letter-sound and meaning features.

The first, at West High School, stresses training of tutors in self-awareness and specific teaching techniques. A special time is set aside for tutoring; a waiting list attests to the program's success. At Central High School, the tutoring program in study skills and subject areas is administrated through the National Honor Society. At Westwood High School, tutors work four days a week and spend one day a week in a group session. Regular academic credit is given for tutoring, and teaching focuses on subjects ranging from driver's education to social studies. The freshman communications program at Alhambra High School involves tutoring in English, reading, and  social studies by upperclass tutors in a small-group setting. Since these programs emphasize teaching reading and study skills as they relate to several different content areas, no pretesting or posttesting is done. The need for evaluation of the tutoring experience is, however, stressed. A guide for training student tutors includes suggestions for teaching the basics of administration and structure of the program, as well as for promoting academic skills and personal growth. (KS)",

Information-gathering techniques included interviews of subjects and observations of subjects' reactions to reading materials displayed for their inspection. Interviews revealed that 67% of the sample had some sort of reading material in their homes, that 32% read in their spare time, and that expenditures on reading materials were minimal. Books with a practical application to daily life were found  to be the most popular selections; subjects' choices of reading materials were influenced by title, format, cover design, and familiarity of the material, as well as by content.

Results indicated that readers using graphic advance organizers had higher comprehension scores than did readers using schematic cognitive-mapping organizers or readers using no organizer and that there was no significant difference in comprehension scores of males and females.

Two standardized reading tests and two experimenter-designed oral reading tests were used to investigate the relationships between knowledge of derived-word formation processes and reading. The oral language tests showed differences in the phonological competence of children between the ages of 8 and 17; these differences were  related to children's performance on specific reading tasks.

An additional purpose of the investigation was to examine the relationships between sentence imagery (determined by summing the individual values of component words), the rating of sentences as wholes, and the free recall of sentences. Subjects, 80 volunteers from undergraduate educational psychology courses, were presented with six sets of eight sentences; sentences were varied systematically from low to high levels of imagery. After each set of sentences, subjects were asked to recall as many sentences as they could and to rate them on a seven-point scale, first for imagery and then for comprehensibility. The correlation of rated and  additive imagery supported the assumption that global imagery is the sum of the individual imagery levels of sentence components. Both measures of sentence imagery were found to correlate better with free recall than did ratings of comprehension. (KS)",

        "description":"Although reading is often viewed as a mysterious process, sufficient evidence is available to identify certain areas as promising for further research and others as unpromising. In applied research, the study of how reading programs are implemented in schools, including an examination of leadership roles, teacher attitudes, teacher training, and diagnosis, may yield crucial information on why certain schools succeed in teaching reading and others do not. In theory-based research, the study of visual word recognition, especially of the role of orthographic structure in this process, has already yielded interesting results. A fundamental understanding of word recognition is required, not only for its relation to early reading instruction, but also for its relation to comprehension.  Since almost all approaches to reading instruction employ overt teaching of letter/sound correspondences, a thorough understanding of their acquisition and utilization merits a high priority in developmental research. Among the areas in which further research is not needed are instructional metholdologies, modified alphabets, and eye movements. (Author/GW)",

In segregated memory organizations, related learned propositions have separate memory representations. In integrated memory organizations, memory representations of related propositions share common subrepresentations. Segregated memory organizations facilitate memory for individual propositions, while integrated memory organizations facilitate higher-order processing, such as inferencing. It is suggested that the nature of acquired memory organizations and, consequently, performance on memory and inferencing tasks can be influenced by simple wording manipulations on study materials. Experimental results support these assumptions. (Author)",

A revival of research interest in mnemonics, in the late 1960s, accompanied the general acceptability of cognitive processes as a legitimate area of research. Now we're back where we started a century ago--studying mental processes. Visual imagery has played a central role in mnemonic techniques and systems since ancient times, and recent research has indicated that imagery can be a powerful learning aid for many kinds of verbal material. Strategies that have been recommended for making effective visual associations include forming a visual image of two items interacting with each other, picturing the image vividly,  and using bizarre associations. Recent research has found that interaction and vividness are important, but that bizarreness is probably not important. Recent research has also indicated that it is generally more effective for learners to construct their own mediators than to have them provided by someone else. Finally, researchers in the 1970s have suggested, as was also suggested a century ago, that mnemonics may have applications useful in education. (Author/GW)",

        "description":"The process of acquiring knowledge from texts is considered from two perspectives: the learning of the individual facts in the text, and the integration of the facts into a coherent representation reflecting relations among the facts. The former process is presumed to depend on the linguistics content of the text, while the latter process depends primarily on the text structure or the manner in which the content is organized. The acquisition of information from a text can be influenced by alterations to either process. Repeating structure across successively presented texts facilitates memory for the later passages. This suggests that knowledge of text structure is used to guide encoding of specific facts. On the other hand, repeating some text content in passages with different  structures produces interference in learning of the new content in later passages. The implications of these results for the selection of instructional strategies are discussed. (Author)",

Word difficulty is measured in two ways: by the structural size and complexity of words or by reference to phonomena of language use, such as word-list frequency or the regularity of spelling patterns. Sentence difficulty is measured only in terms of size or complexity, despite models of the reading process which suggest that readers could use a knowledge of recurring syntactic patterns to economize their scan of the text. This study identified syntactic patterns which occurred in samples of student writing and text and counted how often each pattern recurred. McCall-Crabbs test passages were classified for the commonness of their sentence patterns according to these  counts. The commonness of the patterns was significantly associated with the readability of the passages, with other factors controlled. The results bear implications for measuring readability and designing instruction. (Author)",

This disunion between linguistic theory and public attitude, far from being an anomaly, is consistent with the interplay of certain historical, institutional, and sociolinguistic forces: the standardization, autonomy, historicity, and vitality of  language.

Student evaluation of the &quot;trio system&quot; indicated that most felt some form of the system should be extended into student teaching--a suggestion that was later put into action.

Each child listened to a tape-recorded passage. To induce deliberate mnemonic strategies, half of the children were informed that there would be a memory task; the rest were not told. Without contextual information, high-order relations in the passage could not be discerned. Half of the children were presented contextual information; the remaining were not. After passage presentation, each child was asked to reconstruct the story. Results indicated that age-related increases in  memory for prose were, in part, due to the development of deliberate mnemonic strategies. Furthermore, if contextual information were available, older and younger children efficiently retained the analysis of the high-order relations extracted from prose. (Author/AA)",

A random sample of students enrolled in the University of New Mexico's freshman English program was tested during three semesters. Several questions were addressed: Were the courses doing what they purported to do? What were the trends in levels of competence in grammar, mechanics, and writing? What were the connections between the learning of grammar and the ability to write competently? An analysis of test scores and judges' global ratings of students' essays revealed that, past a certain level of instruction, students did not appear to make futher progress; this trend manifested itself sooner with the learning of grammar and mechanics than with the  actual production of writing. In addition, it was found that the acquisition of grammar and mechanics skills was only weakly correlated with improvement in writing, and then principally at the beginning of the students' college careers.

They often perceive little inherent value in their writing. However, experience teaching high school and college students reveals that many students recognize some inherent value in writing when it is used as a means of understanding themselves or others, as in the writing of autobiography (portrayal of the writer in the past), memoir (portrayal of a person whom the writer knew in the past), and portrait (portrayal of a person whom the writer knows in the present). This booklet shows how such writing contributes to the understanding of self and to the development of writing skills, and it outlines classroom activities for guiding students in four areas:  observing and portraying behaviors characteristic of self; choosing specific topics that best portray self; researching topics through free writing, observing, interviewing, and reminiscing; and writing preliminary and final drafts.

There were no significant differences in syntactic complexity, measured by mean T-unit length, between the two groups of books. Similarly, three measures of vocabulary difficulty showed little, if any, difference between the groups.

Materials analyzed include biographies of Charlotte Bronte, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Emily Dickinson, George Eliot, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Angelina and Sarah Grimke.

The author experimented with training a person in group facilitation skills, by using him as a videotape camera operator whose task was to record his perceptions of a group in such a manner that the tape could be used to make an appropriate, though delayed, intervention. The trainee, &quot;Jim,&quot; filmed each group meeting in a college-level laboratory class in interpersonal communication and then conferred with the supervising facilitator to compare perceptions of the  meeting. Later, the tapes were screened and discussed in terms of Jim's insights and his techniques for illustrating them. The group saw five videotaped segments of their interactions during the semester. A comparison of tapes made during Jim's training period revealed his growing sensitivity to the group process and to the emotional states of the participants. These benefits to the trainee were obtained without hazard to the class members, who in fact benefited from the feedback provided by the tapes. (GW)",

The second section discusses a pilot study conducted to test  the empirical validity of the three communicative distances. In the study, a group of untrained judges was asked to determine which of the three communicative distances was reflected in each of four speech samples collected from meetings of various groups in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which were discussing desegregation in the public schools.

Since the procedures were developed during the production of a play for a mixed adult and child audience, it is assumed that the general guidelines set forth are applicable to a production for any age group. It is also assumed that the audience for any sign-language theatre production includes hearing people, as well as deaf and hearing-impaired people. The paper is divided into nine chapters, which deal with the following topics: selecting a play, selecting a theatre, selecting a sign-language system, initial preparation, selecting production assistants, designing the production, auditions, rehearsal schedule, and  publicity.

        "description":"There are many important reasons for including black theatre as part of an interdisciplinary approach to the humanities. One of the most important reasons is that black theatre provides nonblacks, as well as blacks, the opportunity to gain knowledge about the black experience. Black theatre reflects the sociology, politics, economics, religion, and history--in short, the total experience--of blacks. It provides nonblack students with a means of studying the experiences of people in other cultures. Black theatre also meets the demand for relevant studies, and it helps to restore to blacks the self-esteem that has been eroded by continual exposure to nonblack theatre and education. Although it has been argued that the interdisciplinary approach and the inclusion of black theatre in  the curriculum reflect a tendency to teach too many subjects without providing sufficient depth of learning, once students are introduced to the totality of human experience, many will return to study individual subjects in depth.

A search of the literature reveals at least five rather different definitions of classroom management that represent particular philosophical approaches: 1) the authoritarian approach, 2) the permissive approach, 3) the behavior modification approach, 4) the approach based on creating a positive social and emotional climate in the classroom, and 5) the approach that views the classroom as a social system in which group processes are of major importance. Each of the last three represents a different but defensible position concerning classroom management, and supervisors should encourage teachers to develop a pluralistic definition of classroom management. A sixth approach is the \"bag of  tricks\" approach, which consists of a combination of common sense, old wives' tales, and folklore. Because this approach is not derived from a well-conceptualized base, it lacks consistency and tends to be reactive, instead of proactive. It is important that a teacher learn to identify his or her classroom management approach and be able to distinguish between instructional problems requiring instructional solutions and managerial problems requiring managerial solutions.

The legislation requires all school districts maintaining junior and senior high schools to adopt proficiency standards by June 1978 in reading, writing, and mathematics. Districts are required to assess students at least once in the junior high school years and twice in grades ten through twelve to determine whether each student is meeting the required standards. AB 3408 also requires the State Department of Education to provide, by February l, l978, an &quot;assessment framework&quot; to help local  districts develop their own assessment standards and procedures. The bill permits school districts to adopt differential standards and assessment procedures for students with diagnosed learning disabilities. However, the definition of learning disability does not include students who have limited English-speaking ability. (Author/JG)",

The district court ruled that the government had failed to establish a pattern or practice of discrimination. The court of appeals reversed, in part on the ground that the trial court's analysis of statistical data rested on an irrelevant comparison of black teachers to black pupils in Hazelwood instead of a comparison of black teachers in Hazelwood to black teachers in the relevant labor market areas, which it found to consist of St. Louis County and the city of St. Louis. The Court found that the court of appeals erred in disregarding the  statistical data in the record dealing with Hazelwood's hiring after it became subject to Title VII and the court should have remanded the case to the district court for further findings as to the relevant labor market areas and for the ultimate determination whether Hazelwood has engaged in a pattern or practice of employment discrimination.

        "description":"This paper presents the results of an opinion poll given to a sample of parents, parent association board members, staff, and the principal at Cedar Park and Sand Point schools where the dual principalship experiment has been under way since September 1976. The data provided by this limited experiment do not justify a conclusion that the dual principalship is unfeasible or, for that matter, that the experiment should be established on a wider basis. Opinions given in the polls suggest that the principal in the experiment has overcome a number of difficulties in making the dual principalship successful at Sand Point-Cedar Park. The responsibilities of the principalship in two schools are far beyond those expected of one principal in a single building. One may expect the role of  the principal to change dramatically over time if the dual principalship is to become a permanent feature of the administration of the Seattle schools. Appendixes contain questionnaires, responses, and an evaluation of the program prepared by the principal in the experiment. (Author/IRT)",

The organization of this volume is intended to illuminate the role of those linking agents engaged in or providing support for improvement in local educational agencies, either  internally or externally. The volume synthesizes key concepts and findings about change processes, uses of knowledge in change, the management of change, the functions of linking agencies in improvement activities, the attributes and skill clusters needed by external linking agents to function effectively, and a national training system for both internal and external linkers.

Professionals, such as doctors and teachers, must also give their professional opinions as to the nature, extent, and causes of the damaged child's condition. The basic purpose of the law is to identify children at risk because of parental or caretaker abuse or neglect and then to provide protective services for these children. North Carolina's county social services departments have the primary responsibility for implementing the law; citizens must report incidents of abuse or neglect to these departments. The law provides protection against civil and criminal liability for any one reporting such incidents in good faith. This booklet summarizes  the Child Abuse Reporting Law in layman's language.

First, the author reviews how the distinction between short-run and long-run returns is similar to familiar distinctions made by organizational theorists concerned with control mechanisms and by educational psychologists interested in types of student motivation. Second, he describes two organizational routes to activate long-range goals as a source of control or motivation: recruitment or selection and socialization. He reviews the arguments that most schools are at a great disadvantage compared to other types of organizations in appealing to long-range goals. Third,  he offers some ideas on how variations in the schools' authority structure may be related to the strengthening of long-range goals as a source of student motivation for learning activities. He uses some recent evidence from school surveys to argue that the types of academic choices provided to students may be an important organizational feature to make students less influenced by immediate responses from peers and more attentive to information about the long-range outcomes of their school work.

The author draws on three years of the Austin school district's experience with evaluating program implementation and on recent literature on program development and evaluation. Her analysis leads her to conclude that school district programs will be improved by setting priorities by which programs are approved or disapproved, encouraging the school district staff to understand how the district functions as an organization and how the program implementation process works, devising realistic program  designs, and making maximum use of evaluation information.

The politics, economics, and social conditions surrounding administrative practice and its study in the university setting have not been conducive to development work. Research and development directed toward educational administration and intended to produce educational improvement are almost nonexistent. However, development work using competency-based approaches offers a significant and viable means to educational improvement.

Suggestions are made of ways different disciplines can be involved with the site, emphasizing that action-oriented activities are the ones most successful with students. Three site analyses prepared for schools considering development of their properties are included to provide more detailed use and development instructions, to give an idea of the variety of usable natural sites, to suggest possible  planning formats, and to illustrate what a completed inventory and plan might look like.

A systems approach that treats the totality of the problem and analyzes the interrelationships among the parts of the whole was used. A citizen committee and a professional planner developed a series of comprehensive K-12 curriculum recommendations. Accurate computer-generated enrollment projections were obtained by utilizing pre-school census data, a ten-year enrollment history by grade, and district housing development figures. All of the district's facilities were inspected and evaluated to determine if they were durable, functional, and adaptable. The degrees  of non-compliance were then recorded for further analysis. A facilities master plan was made that recommended new construction and renovation in light of proposed curriculum changes, reliable enrollment projections, and evaluations of facilities and sites. Detailed educational specifications were developed for the construction of a comprehensive high school. (Author/MLF)",

There is no central widely available framework or paradigm that permits the ordering of the questions being asked by the researcher or locates the core phenomena that we should be dealing with. The core phenomenon is the classroom as an environment. In the absence of an understanding of this environmental context, research into teacher effects, teacher skill development, and the like will be comparatively fruitless. Research into the classroom must focus on the classroom as a setting or environment and on the management of learning in that setting.

It is noted that the manual was prepared for use in half-hour daily sessions over a period of 8 weeks. Tasks, which progressively increase in difficulty, involve both impersonal cognitive problems such as puzzles, mazes, and copying designs, and interpersonal problem situations. The program unfolds by first using the &quot;copy cat&quot; game on very simple cognitive tasks to engage the child in reacting to all features  of the modeling; &quot;copy cat&quot; is then used to introduce the child to the four steps in dealing with a problem (identifying the problem, developing a plan, monitoring performance, and evaluating performance and outcome), and finally &quot;copy cat&quot; is faded and cue cards standing for each step are introduced to signal the child to verbalize both the question and the answer for himself. Instructions for the teacher, descriptions of materials, recording forms, and puzzle sheets are provided. (SBH)",

        "description":"The goal of European immigrants to the United States was characterized by the \"melting pot\" image up until the late 1960's. Then a trend of revival of the identity of ethnic minorities changed the slogan to \"from the melting pot to the salad bowl.\" Cultural pluralism and maintenance of native languages became the goals of the movement. The massive school failure of the non-English speaking children led the federal government to legislate bilingual education programs in 1968. When a similar law was passed in Sweden for the Finnish-speaking children, the law was easily implemented. In the United States the autonomy of the states over the educational system has made implementation more difficult, and a Supreme Court decision was necessary to uphold the federal legislation (Lau vs.  Nichols). Guidelines, known as the Lau remedies, were then set up by the Office of Civil Rights (HEW). Without such bilingual programs it was found that children lost their native languages without learning English, which led to impairment of cognitive development and school failure. Most of the bilingual education programs in the United States are English-Spanish, and research shows that without exception these programs increase achievement in Spanish reading. Also, achievement in English reading is usually higher than control groups in monolingual programs. They also increase the self-concept scores of the Latino as well as of the Anglo and Black children. (CFM)",

The data present some problems for current views of grammar and of linguistic variation. Regarding the former, it is not clear what sort of &quot;rule,&quot; what place in grammar, the representation of the factual generalizations is to be accorded. Regarding the implications of the facts of constancy and variation in English kinship semantics for the overall conception of the nature of linguistic variation, it is generally concluded that the variation observed in English kinship semantics seems to reflect more directly the structural possibilities inherent in the language than social or sociolinguistic factors. The  further conclusion may be drawn that the closer to sound the greater the extent of social determination of linguistic variation. (Author/AM)",

(1) Command of the Foreign Language: The teacher should demonstrate certain specific abilities in listening comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing. (2) Linguistics: The foreign language teacher should be trained in phonology, morphology, and syntax, and should be able to demonstrate certain kinds of knowledge in these  areas. (3) Culture of the Language Area: The foreign language teacher should recognize that a language reflects its culture and should demonstrate an understanding and acceptance of the ways in which cultures differ. (4) Teaching-Learning Process: The foreign language teacher should demonstrate competency in managing the teaching-learning process on appropriate levels by helping the learner to develop abilities in the four language skills and by selecting and implementing appropriate instructional goals and classroom procedures. (5) Professional Development: The teacher should be well informed in regard to teaching methods, instructional materials, and resources available for foreign languages and should know the professional organizations and their principal publications.

This paper attempts to examine the relevant studies in this area in order to draw some conclusions for bilingual bicultural classroom settings. The reported attitude studies focus on research with standard and non-standard varieties of languages and show that evaluative reactions vary among individuals given certain speech samples. In addition, it is concluded that teachers tend to give stereotypical evaluations when confronted with certain cues (speech style, videotapes, drawings, and compositions). The research does not, however, conclusively substantiate the underlying assumption of the studies, i.e., that teachers' attitudes affect the performance of the child. The  reported studies on student attitudes examine the effect of attitudes toward language and second language learning. It is evident from the research that student attitude clearly affects second language learning. The research also illustrates the controversy surrounding the question of age as a variable in language learning. Implications for bilingual-bicultural classroom settings are discussed.

Because of the attention given to oral skills, the teaching of formal grammar is also avoided, and blackboard notes are not to be provided for the students to copy. Each lesson is structured around a specific situation or topic, such as greetings, the market place, or parts of the body, and occasionally around an element of grammar. Repetition is the basic method used; students repeat a given dialogue after the teacher, and then memorize it.

Teachers fail to avail themselves of an important teaching tool at a critical point, when the more mechanical aspects of assimilating the target language should give way to gaining an actual communicative competence in it. At the higher levels, the potential of the lab has never been fully developed. A number of ways are suggested in which crucial classroom time can be increased by relegating the more routine activities as well as those not necessitating 'live' teacher presence to the lab. A number of such activities are listed and procedures given to put a plan for integrating the lab into operation. It is demonstrated how any classroom teacher or school system  can adopt such an approach at the intermediate and advanced levels without great time expenditures, highly technical know-how in preparing tapes, or substantially increased funds, even if no full professional language laboratory is on the premises.

Canadian culture is distinguished by its emphasis on diversification and its rejection of countrywide uniformity. Canada's existence as a unified country depends on a willingness to live in a country of differences. In order to achieve the acceptance and recognition of the English and French languages as the official languages of Canada, the federal government has developed a number of principles which, taken together,  constitute a statement of the official languages policy of Canada. These include: the right of every citizen to privately speak any language; the official and equal status of French and English; the right of citizens to choose the language of instruction of their children; and the desirability of knowledge of both languages by all Canadians. It is not the intention of the federal government to &quot;bilingualize&quot; the country, but to ensure equal treatment for both language groups in every part of Canada. (AM)",

        "description":"As Labov points out (1971), language is a social phenomenon, and therefore must be studied in its social context; sex based language differences, being part of language, must be studied in the same way. Specifically, sex based language differences can be studied by modifying the sociolinguists' notion of speech community and speech continuum, and by using their methods of gathering and evaluating data. A three-dimensional space whose axes are formality-informality, specificity as to sex, and specificity as to speech community is substituted for Labov's single continuum. Every utterance of every speaker is placed within this space according to how the social situation is perceived by the speaker. To test this model, the members of an all female bridge club were interviewed in two  situations: fairly formal individual, and informal group. It was predicted that the latter would elicit more, and more highly marked &quot;female language&quot; than the former because it is more informal and more sex specific. The former, however, being not sex neutral, would also elicit some female language samples. The data support the model. What is particularly significant is the fact that no such differences had been systematically attested except in our work (cf. Thorne &amp; Henley, 1975). (Author/CLK)",

        "description":"An experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that the use of swear words by women elicits more negative perceptions of the speaker than the use of the same words by men. Subjects (undergraduates) read vignettes describing fictitious clients' initial interviews at a mental health center. One described a forty-year old teacher troubled by anxiety, the other a rebellious teenager. Two aspects were varied, sex of client and his/her use of swear words: none, mild or moderate. Twenty subjects responded to each variant. Subjects rated perceived problems of each client on a five-point scale. Data for each problem were analyzed with a 2 X 3 analysis of variance. A pattern of results emerged which was internally consistent, but counter to prediction. The mildly swearing woman and the  moderately swearing female teenager were perceived as the better adjusted of the various clients. Interpretation must be tentative, but it is possible that subjects may have perceived mild deviations from the norm as signs of strength in females. Undergraduates' misperceptions of the psychotherapy setting may have contributed to the finding. Results suggest that swearing men and women are perceived differently, and that evaluators' background and perception of the speech context contribute to judgments. (Author)",

        "description":"Paradoxically, linguists' speculations about sex differences in language use are highly plausible and yet have received little empirical support from well controlled studies. An experiment was designed to correct a flaw in earlier methodologies by sampling precisely the kinds of situations in which predicted differences (e.g., swearing, questioning, politeness) might be expected. College students were asked to indicate exactly how they would respond in a series of typical campus situations. They were also asked to describe the experimental room. No sex differences were found in any measured aspects of reported speech style, e.g., politeness, questioning, swearing, use of \"feminine\" words, though some differences in content emerged in the descriptive passages. Consistent with  earlier results, women responded more to other people; men, to physical dimensions. The failure of this and other laboratory-based studies to demonstrate consistent differences between men's and women's styles suggests that sex-based styles are not invariant, but rather are continuua similar to those posited by sociolinguists regarding such variables as formality of situation. To record sex-specific language, researchers should abandon the sex neutral laboratory and collect data in sex-specific settings such as baby showers or men's poker games. (Author)",

Hypotheses were derived from Tyler's claims that the \"neutral sphere\" is infused by the male style, rendering it an inhibiting speech environment for women. They included: (a) Can speakers reliably classify commonly used metaphors as masculine, feminine, or neutral? And, if so, by what criteria? (b) If the metaphors can be subdivided, are some more vivid and effective than others? (c) If the metaphors can be subdivided, do men and women differ in usage? Eighty idiomatic expressions were rated by subjects on a scale with regard to: (a) vividness or image-forming  capacity, (b) sex-specific associations with traditional sex roles, (c) subject's understanding of the metaphor's accepted meaning, and (d) frequency of usage by the subject. Results indicated that subjects regard some expressions as sex-specific. Of these, \"masculine\" expressions are more vivid, and more often include action verbs. \"Feminine\" expressions are considered dull, and more often include no verbs, or passive or static verbs. Expressions most frequently used by both women and men tend to be sex-neutral. (Author)",

The new emphases on the quality of learning appears to offer some potential solutions to two current problems: the twin problems of quality and equality in education. Traditional group-oriented education has emphasized equality in the amount of time spent at the learning task and inequality in the amount learned; individual differences are recognized in grading. Individualized learning, and especially mastery learning, reverses the emphasis, stressing equality in the amount learned and inequality in the time spent; everyone must learn to the same level of achievement. If certain scholars are correct in their assertion that anyone  can learn the basic curriculum if given enough time and appropriate help, we have a breakthrough that permits us to conceptualize education in new ways, moving beyond access for all toward learning for each.

General enrollment and student aid trends are reviewed, with the cost of attendance and its impact on students' decision to attend or not attend being considered at length. There is also an examination of the effect of student aid on enrollments by looking at the influence it has on the college attendance decisions of aid recipients. The low income group is increasing its share of private enrollments; the higher income group is increasing its share of university enrollments; the middle income  group representation at both private and public institutions is decreasing. Although major progress has been made in providing access, the poor, minorities, and women are still not doing well when retention and completion are considered, and blacks, in particular, continue to be somewhat underenrolled. The most severe effects of rising costs have been experienced by middle income youth, who qualify for little or no student aid; needs analysis procedures and funding levels should be revised to provide limited benefits to students from middle income families.

Colleague ratings of research and professional service, and student ratings of teaching produced ratings of higher reliability and consistency than did colleague ratings of teaching. Colleague ratings of teaching were more strongly influenced by office location than were ratings of research and service. (Author)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine the extent to which faculty members' attempts to improve instruction at Illinois State University were rewarded. The data were obtained by three methods: (1) a questionnaire designed to obtain faculty perceptions of rewards; (2) a historical analysis of the salary, promotion, or tenure ratings received annually by the faculty; and (3) interviews with department chairpersons about the procedures for salary, promotion, or tenure decisions at the departmental level. The data indicated that the effect of faculty efforts to improve instruction on the formal reward structure was generally nonexistent, minimally positive at best, and punitive in some instances. Whether these efforts were supported by funds from an instructional development program that  is one of the largest single-institution programs in the nation or undertaken without such assistance, the results were the same. By contract, the informal rewards of teacher satisfaction were valued highly by 84 percent of the questionnaire respondents. Implications of this form of institutional schizophrenia, where instructional improvement is encouraged but not rewarded, are discussed. Possible institutional changes in the reward system and negative effects of not changing it are also considered. Some statistical tables are included. (Author/MSE)",

The consistently observed relationship between institutional quality measures and the incidence of unrest is considered in relation to faculty as well as student attributes. The results are discussed in terms of a currently employed model for a program of research on campus unrest that encompasses the totality of factors, both endogeneous and exogeneous, and that contribute to the incidence of protest. Alternative hypotheses of the impact of faculty on campus unrest are  considered, additional necessary research on the role of faculty is specified, and other programmatic analyses currently underway on the various components of the research model are briefly noted.

Instructional materials are developed for specific points in the three dimensional space. The example topic area in this report is electronic fundamentals and the approach taken is the application of a content  analysis and instructional sequencing model, which combines content structure, aspects of the learning process, and the requirements of individualization to guide development of instruction. The result of applying the model is a performance oriented training context. (DAG)",

The recommendations, which emphasize local media control, were based on information provided by village residents, consumer committee members, teachers, and program personnel. A brief description of the ESCD/AK (Educational Satellite Communication Demonstration/Alaska) project is provided, including a map of receiving sites and special features of the program such as interaction between program and viewer, capability of transmitting simultaneously in several languages with four different audio channels available, consumer committees, and local  utilization aides.

GRASP is individualized, as was prior instruction, but where the associated shop work previously had staggered beginning times, students now progress in groups of 16. Each group has a permanent learning supervisor and a single identifiable group for the entire length of the school. By retaining self-paced, individualized instruction, yet building in group identity and instructor leadership, the GRASP program has proved even more efficient than purely  individualized instruction.

Needs were assessed through: (1) a survey carried out within regional Medical Library Association (MLA) groups; (2) contents of journal literature compared with literature five to ten years previous to document changes in the field; and (3) comparison of results of studies conducted by other library groups and organizations. Despite differences in types of library staff surveyed, needs identified were in the areas of administration, audiovisuals, reference tools and services (including on-line systems), and budgeting. Library staffs had difficulty in articulating CE needs. Data collected on  CE opportunities available showed course offerings were sparse in areas of need. Organizational constraints and supports given to staff and CE activities showed CE is primarily self-directed. Some of the national library associations seem less interested in supporting CE programs. A model CE program for health science librarians was developed. The study compared the MLA CE program at the beginning and end of the project within the model's framework. Sample questionnaires, data tables, references, course descriptions, and MLA CE materials are included. (Author/KP)",

Phase I of development established: (1) objectives; (2) two methods of teaching--performance instruction and simulation of a real library situation; (3) two programs similar in sequence and content-- audio-tutorial with tape and mini-catalog for individuals and tape/slide for group instruction; and (4) three evaluation instruments--objective test on effective use of the subject catalog, performance test on search ability, and attitude survey. Trials revealed a weakness in failure to consider in detail the level of knowledge and skills to be reached by students. Phase II  concentrated on curriculum development and combined the original programs. Evaluation instruments included background information, reaction to program, tasks tests, and six parallel versions of a skills test. The program was judged successful in methodological aims and partly successful in program aims, based on trial administration to randomly selected students and groups. Plans for implementing the program and suggestions for adapting it to other libraries and age groups are discussed. Bibliography and other references are attached, as well as tests, scripts, evaluation forms, and surveys. (KP)",

        "description":"A major obstacle to the effective educational use of computers is the lack of a natural means of communication between the student and the computer. This report describes a technique for generating such natural language front-ends for advanced instructional systems. It discusses: (1) the essential properties of a natural language front-end, (2) some prior systems having some of the desired capabilities, and (3) the technical details underlying &quot;semantic grammars.&quot; This last notion is introduced as a paradigm for organizing the knowledge required to understand language which permits efficient parsing. In semantic grammar, non-terminal categories are formed on conceptual rather than syntactic bases. This allows semantic knowledge to be integrated into the parsing process whenever  it is beneficial. The ability of Augmented Transition Networks (ATN)-based semantic grammars to perform satisfactorily in an educational environment is demonstrated in the natural language front-end for the SOPHIE system. Appendices describe SOPHIE semantic grammar in two formalisms (ATN and BTN). (Author/DAG)",

This project was designed to demonstrate how a card catalog in machine-readable form can be augmented to allow greater subject access to the information content of a library collection. Rules and regulations for selecting words from indexes and contents pages to supplement Library of Congress classification, subject headings, and title words are intended to insure selection of significant subjects and useful search terms. Procedures are presented for determining the usability of contents pages, selection of entries from the contents pages, and selection of entries from the index. Following these rules, words and phrases were selected for a sample library collection of approximately 2,000  titles, put into machine-readable form, and merged with the MARC-like records already available to create a new data base, BOOKS. Some comparison searching using MARC records alone was done on the Library of Congress SCORPIO system; separate reports document these trial searches.

Studies show that 10% to 50% of all community college students are mathematically underprepared, and that the majority of two-year colleges offer remedial math programs. Though most are taught using traditional lecture methods, alternative methods in use include programmed texts, tutoring, math labs, independent study, and mini courses. These programs generally provide an individual student-teacher relationship in self-paced mastery learning settings, resulting in a higher student  self-image, and a loss of test fear through the technique of retesting. Although comparative studies generally show non-significant results for programs using alternative methods, benefits in student attitudes and in other factors must also be considered in evaluating the effectiveness of alternative programs.

Students also responded to the Nelson-Denny Reading Test (Form C). Subsequent scores were compared with the functional literacy scores and English course grades, using Pearson's r correlation coefficient. Results showed a correlation of 0.6045 between the functional literacy test scores and the Nelson-Denny, and a 0.4367 with course grades. Each of  these correlations were higher than that between the Nelson-Denny and grades (0.4237). The test items represent reading skills required in daily life, such as telephone listings, thus demonstrating the value of reading.

Part two reviews the effects of student/faculty ratios, full-time faculty  compensation, the ratio of fixed costs to total revenue, the relationship of plant assets to full-time equivalent students, and freshman/graduate and student/faculty ratios as indicators of financial well-being. Revenue and cost patterns are examined in part three, along with future financial projections.

        "description":"A follow-up telephone survey conducted in spring 1977 of 440 students who graduated from Prince George's Community College in career fields in May 1976 produced 382 contacts. Of the 282 (74%) who were employed, 262 (69%) were in a field related to their degree program. Of the remainder, 79 (21%) had transferred to another institution, 11 (3%) were unemployed, and 10 were neither working nor looking for work. Further in-depth interviews were conducted with 154 selected students concerning graduate goals, employment, and college transfer status. Of these, 128 reported a primary educational goal of achieving the Associate of Arts degree, 126 were employed in a new job after being a student, and most reported their degree program had provided them with the theory and skills needed  for their work. Jobs had been secured through direct employer contact (24), family or friends (18), newspaper ads (15), college personnel (5), or an employment agency. These job search methods were similar to those reported in a national labor survey dealing with the methods, intensity, and effectiveness of job search approaches, which is reviewed in an appended report. Also appended are breakdowns of graduate responses by health, technology, and business career clusters. (RT)",

The design plan included the development of a consortium of community leaders and employers of community college occupational students that established needs, advised on and reviewed the preliminary field-test model, and reviewed test experiences and finding. Four college districts participated in field-testing, with six colleges and nine career programs represented. Identification of employers was dependent on following-up students who participated in SAM, a process hindered by student mobility, necessitating  multiple contact methods. Survey design varied by district, but all survey instruments included technical and general knowledge areas, overall student employee performance, and solicited open comments from employers. The document details the systems, methods, and findings from each participating district, presented as separate appended reports.

They allow a college to chart its growth, anticipate emergencies, and meet the needs of all sectors of the institution. Foundations must utilize an active development program for planning and executing a conscious, continuous effort to increase financial resources. Such a development program would depend on students, alumni, foundation board members, college trustees, parents, and college staff to reach donors, through such means as personal solicitations, telethons, and mail appeals. Fund-raising should also include appeals to corporations, philanthropic foundations, local businessess, and should solicit gifts through bequests, trusts, and annuities. The foundation  could be a shared venture of several colleges; its programs could include the leasing of its buildings to the colleges, endowment of teaching chairs, provision of student financial assistance, financing of equipment and facilities, and underwriting educational and community service programs. Organizational structure should include a Director of Development and a board of trustees or directors. (RT)",

        "description":"This paper reports on part of a longitudinal study of personality and cognitive development in young children, specifically, efforts to identify and measure the concepts of ego control and ego resiliency. The concept of ego control refers to the disposition or threshold of an individual with regard to the expression or containment of impulses and desires. The concept of ego resiliency refers to the capacity of an individual to modify his modal ego control capacity, in either direction, as a function of the demand characteristics of the environmental context. At ages 3.5 and 4.5, for 120 children, ego control and ego resiliency were objectified or indexed in two fundamentally different ways, via a composite score based upon the child's performance in a half dozen independent  experimental situations and via a composite score based on the independent Q-sort personality descriptions of each child, offered by their nursery school teachers. In addition, Q-sort descriptions of each child at age 7 were obtained later from their elementary school teachers. (These data are still being analyzed.) The two very different methods used to objectify the concepts of ego control and ego resiliency at three time periods were evaluated with regard to their conceptual and psychometric properties. Results indicate the presence in behavior, for both sexes, over time, and across methods of experimentation and observation, of two context-responsive personality subsystems that separately and in conjunction appear to have consequentiality.

Having two hands that are bilaterally opposed and initially function in bilaterally symmetrical action might serve to structure the form of early sensori-motor experiences and this structured experience serves as the base of the logical operation of equivalence. Subjects were 66 children ranging in age from 7 to 32 months. Each child was presented six different clusters of five blocks each. Children were filmed at block play. Methodology and data obtained are discussed at length. In general the films revealed the gradual atemporalization of successive states and the dissociation of the logical from the contingent. The  films also suggest that the physical constraints of material determine the early block structures, but block structures gradually are constrained more by rules of order than by rules of physical fit or physical balance. Appendices include the notation system used for rating the films, tables of frequency of unique action units and a frequency count of productions of the children. (MS)",

Analyses of the data focused on performance in basic school skills of reading and math, although less school-related problem-solving ability was examined, too. For the 863 families who also had been interviewed six years earlier, the ensuing longitudinal data enabled assessment of the stability of sociocultural determinants and the extent of impact of early home influences on later school success.  Also indicated were developmental trends and interrelationships that become increasingly apparent with measurement in subsequent years.

In the first study (involving 19 subjects) a discovery method was compared to a matched expository method, both of which involved active manipulation of objects. The second study (involving 24 subjects) replicated the first study using different materials and included a third group (observation training) in which subjects did not manipulate objects. The learning outcomes were evaluated by tests of short-term recall,  short-term transfer, long-term recall and long-term transfer. Performance on the posttests administered by a \"blind\" experimenter revealed a pattern in which groups did not differ on short-term recall but the discovery group excelled on far transfer (conservation) and delayed recall.

The novelty preference technique was employed: all infants were familiarized with a three-dimensional object--a doll. Following familiarization, three novelty tests were administered, pairing (1) the familiar doll with a novel doll, (2) color photographs of the two dolls, and (3) black-and-white photographs of the dolls. The infants significantly preferred (looked longer at) the novel three-dimensional doll. This novelty preference was also present for the color photographs of the dolls, and male infants preferred the novel black-and-white photograph. Thus, 5-month-old infants are capable of transferring  the information they extract from a three-dimensional object to a two-dimensional representation of the object. These data suggest that, at least for representations of relatively simple objects, pictorial perception does not have to be learned through experience with two-dimensional stimuli. (Author/MS)",

This study was designed for two purposes: (1) to extend the notion of the \"executive function\" to the case where continued use of mnemonic routine is a reasonable response to an objective change in an information processing task, and (2) to determine the effects of training on the maintenance and generalization of a rehearsal strategy. The subjects were 62 volunteers chosen from grades 6, 10, and 12 and nine adults. The task was a 6-item (pictures) circular recall task presented in a pause-time paradigm. An automated WGTA apparatus was used. The overall design was mixed and represented by the factorial combination of Grade (6, 10, 12, adults) X Phase (Assessment,  Training, Maintenance, Generalization) X Group (training, no training) X Item Type (TBR, TBF) X Serial Position (6). The results showed that adults spontaneously produced a \"cumulative rehearsal, fast-finish\" strategy in response to both the assessment and generalization tasks while only two 10- and three 12- graders did so. All trained subjects maintained the instructed routine and showed evidence of transfer during generalization. Analyses including adults suggested that the form of trained subjects' generalized strategy became more similar to that of the adults as grade increased. Observational and interview data supported these findings. (Author/MS)",

The importance of role playing is discussed and several reasons for believing that role playing is related to intellectual and social development and to learning language and reading are presented. Five components of role playing as presented by Curry and Arnaud (1974) are discussed. The teacher role in preparing for and managing role playing is then discussed step-by-step and several specific \"how to\" suggestions are offered. Finally, the facilitation of growth in language and reading through the use of role playing in the Language and Imaginative Play Approach (LIPA) is discussed. (JMB)",

        "description":"This study investigated social interactions and the development of social concepts in preschool children in terms of two conceptual domains, the moral and the societal. The former has to do with concepts of justice and fairness, the latter with social conventions, rules and social organization. Subjects were children 3 to 5 years of age enrolled in ten preschools. Preliminary results include data from observations made at four of these schools. A total of 98 events that involved social conventional or moral transgressions were observed and rated. The data suggests that essential information regarding the injustice of the act is directly available to the actor through the nature of the victims' response. It thus becomes possible for the very young child to construct conceptions of  morality. Social connections, however, cannot be discussed in terms of personal loss but rather in relation to the social order. Responses to moral transgressions appear to be qualitatively different from those made to violations of social conventions. It is argued that since there is no difference in intensity of adult responses to moral or social conventional transgressions, the intensity of adult responses cannot be viewed as a salient variable to the child. The data seems to support Piaget's suggestion that it is the peer interactions which are the more salient events in the development of the child's moral reasoning. (MS)",

Subjects were 60 children aged 4, 6 and 8 years and their parents. Measures included a parental questionnaire and child interviews. Partial results show that children's belief in Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy are related to age and to parental encouragement of these beliefs. By 8 years of age children have begun to relinquish their beliefs in Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny but belief in the Tooth Fairy is still strong. Parents appear to be more involved in promoting children's beliefs in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy than in the Easter Bunny. The  author is currently studying other correlates of children's beliefs in these mythical characters. (MS)",

An adult told the subjects (48 4-year-old boys and girls) to carry marbles from one box to another. The adult either made no threat or threatened the child for possible disobedience, and either stayed in the room or left the room during the session. Four measures of obedience were recorded for five consecutive 2-minute periods. Results showed in general that: (1) the children were very obedient; (2) threat increased obedience in girls, but not in boys; (3) surveillance increased the amount of time the children worked at the task; (4) obedience decreased with the passage of time; and (5) 94% of the children indicated that the experiment was  fun, but 33% indicated that they would not like to do it again. These findings are compared with previous research findings on obedience, resistance to temptation and social reinforcement. (Author/MS)",

Six 2-year-olds in each of two day care centers were each videotaped for a total of 45 minutes in a variety of behavioral settings. Results indicated that: (1) the scale can be used in group settings with the addition of a distinction between adult/individual interaction and adult/group interaction; (2) interaction involving activities and interaction techniques which Watts found associated with high competence development occurs most frequently in structured activities and to some extent in free play settings. Also discussed: other results involving  differences in the two day care centers; the adult/group mode of interaction; behavior setting sampling; adult responsiveness; adult/child ratios; quality versus quantity of interaction; and assessment of the direct impact of day care environments on the development of competence. It is concluded that day care can provide experiences comparable to good homes. (MS)",

Forty children, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months of age, were assessed for knowledge of the words used in the experiment and were then given a series of 48 statement verification tasks. Stimuli were simple existential statements of either true affirmatives (&quot;That is a ball&quot; about a ball), false affirmatives (&quot;That is a car&quot; about a ball), false negatives (&quot;That is not a ball&quot; about a ball), or true negatives (&quot;That is not a car&quot; about a ball). All sessions were videotaped and coded for affirmatives and negatives used by the children, for  use of referent words (e.g. ball and car), and for nonverbal measures that distinguished comprehension strategies. Results suggested that by 2 1/2 years children manifest knowledge that language may fail to match reality. By 1 1/2 years, they distinguish appropriate true statements from other types. Relations in development between language as a communicative tool and as an object of cognition are discussed. (BD)",

It deals with four major interrelated issues: (1) the prevalence of protein energy malnutrition, (2) the importance of breast milk, not only in preventing malnutrition and disease but also as an important world food resource, (3) the imposition of male-oriented Western culture, involving the more complex mechanisms of exploitation by Western multinational corporations, and (4) the fact that these mechanisms operate in the West as in the Third World to the particular detriment of both women and children. Sections 1 and 2 give an overview of these issues using material from people who have been writing about the  issue for a long time - doctors, sociologists, nutritionists. Section 3 describes the action being undertaken on this issue in different countries: Australia, Canada, Denmark, West Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the U.S. The epilogue attempts to put the issue into political perspective. A resource list and a bibliography are included. (MS)",

In addition, an effort was made to determine whether task demands affect the size of the effective visual field and if so, whether the effects on performance are different for children and adults. A total of 54 subjects in three age groups (5-year-olds, 8-year-olds, and college adults) participated in one of three experimental conditions: (1) identification of a single geometric form located peripherally, (2) identification of a peripheral form presented simultaneously with a foveally located form which was to be ignored, and (3) identification of a peripheral form presented with a foveally located form, both of which were to be  reported. The findings showed that a subject's ability to identify peripherally presented stimulus items was impaired by the presence of a foveally presented item whether or not the item required processing. Results also suggest that this interference by the foveal item was due to the tendency of older subjects to process this foveal item first. This tendency is apparently learned as it is not present in 5-year-old children. (JMB)",

Three types of experimental studies are also identified: paradigms using imaginary or artifical adult-child interactions; those using actual, immediate interaction; and those involving ongoing rather than ad hoc relationships. Problems associated  with the use of observational and experimental studies are discussed. Finally, it is suggested that child effects should be viewed as one part of a bidirectional system and that investigations be made into the means by which children's influences on adults may partly determine their own development.

Basic policy issues of child welfare are discussed, particularly the current state of federal-provincial cooperation in the national health insurance program, and recent changes in the system of federal contributions. The overall picture, statistically illustrated, is seen as a negative one, with large numbers of Canadian children currently &quot;in care,&quot; i.e. living away from their natural families, in institutions or in foster or adoptive homes. A significant percentage of these are American Indian children. Shortcomings in the educational system and, more particularly, in the system of national health care reflect a failure of  federal and provincial governments to take adequate responsibility for child welfare. Medical fee extra-billing practices are illustrated by a table on abortion fees. Tables include statistics on numbers of children &quot;in care&quot; over the past several years, as well as birth and adoption figures for the Indian population. (BF)",

Each section discusses a topic in relation to specific programs. Sections cover: short term and long term effects on children's cognitive and affective development; short and long term effects on non-cognitive outcome measures (socioemotional development, family change, community change); the effectiveness of curricula and treatment structure; assessment of program implementation; effects of parent involvement; effects of programs on children with different characteristics; and timing of intervention.

Rural teachers in the states of Illinois, Maryland, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, and Wisconsin were requested to give data for the period from September 1, 1934 to August 31, 1935. All states included only teachers of white schools, except Tennessee which included white and Negro schools separately, and Maryland which included both white and Negro teachers (the proportion was 5 to 1).

Statistical data were obtained on the incomes and expenditures of rural teachers, the economic  assets and liabilities of rural teachers under varying conditions, and the relationship of the money these teachers had invested in education to the types of schools in which they were employed and to the salaries they received as teachers. Among the findings were: in the smaller schools the salary medians were as low as $600, while in the larger schools of three or more teachers they sometimes exceeded $1,000; experience and tenure were rewarded somewhat by salaries in rural schools; married teachers generally reported greater expenditures than the single teachers; comparisons of expenditures of men and women showed those of the former to be higher; about 67% of all rural teachers reported some assets; and about 20% were in debt.

        "description":"Examined were the educational conditions and efficiency of the school systems during the 1929-30 school year in both the mountainous and nonmountainous counties of Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. Information was obtained for five counties in each State which were regarded as the most mountainous and five counties in the nonmountainous area of each State, for all of the counties of each State commonly regarded as part of the Southern Appalachian area, and for each State as a whole. A comparison of conditions among area types indicated the extent to which mountain conditions affected educational developments. Obtained from published reports and files of the six State departments of education and directly from the schools, data covered the  schools' availability and accessibility; grade levels; length of school term and days attended; illiteracy; pupils' age-grade status; teacher qualifications; annual expenditures; value of buildings, grounds, and school equipment; estimated taxable wealth available for school support; State aid; human resources as a factor in school support; types of nonpublic schools and their curricular offerings; and nonschool educational activities. Findings included: of the children 16-20 years old in the mountain sections, approximately 2/3 did not attend school; in at least 3 of the States, the disadvantage of short terms in the most mountainous counties was aggravated by irregular attendance; and enrollment ratios in the first year of high school to those in the third grade were higher in the  nonmountain counties.

Data were obtained from the county superintendents' reports. Rural data were from 440 administrative units in counties with no single incorporated places of 2,500 or more population. Urban data were from 340 school systems located in all States, except Florida and West Virginia. Data for Lhe urban-rural school systems were from Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, southern Louisiana, and the mountain area of Utah. A total of  1,047,873 elementary and high school pupils in rural, 4,480,873 in urban, and 356,245 in county-unit schools were involved. Data covered enrollment, attendance, pupil-teacher ratio, school expenditures per pupil, the school term, source of receipts, staff salaries, and value of school properties, debts, and capital outlay. Findings included: average daily attendance per elementary school was 317 pupils in large city systems, 181 in small city systems, 38 in the rural school districts, and 111 in urban-rural systems; large city school systems provided, on the average, the longest school term; and rural schools received a larger percentage of revenue from State sources.

Data were received for 183,733 white teachers, 13,072 Negro teachers, 7,569 white principals of rural schools, and 131 principals of Negro schools under the administrative supervision of county, district, union, and similar types of superintendents and located in the open country or in villages and towns of fewer than 2,500 population. Data were presented separately for one-teacher and two-teacher schools, three to six teacher schools and seven or more teacher schools in the open country and in villages or towns. Findings included: as the rural schools became larger the median salaries became progressively higher, ranging  from $535 in the one-teacher white schools to $979 in the white schools of 7 or more teachers located in the villages and towns; in the Negro schools the differences were similar to those for the white schools, except that the ranges were for the most part narrower; in Delaware and West Virginia, the salaries of the Negro teachers averaged nearly $1,000 per year and were fully as high as those of the white teachers, if not higher; most of the rural school principals, especially those having charge of high schools, were college graduates; and about 3% of the white teachers and 21% of the Negro teachers in the one-teacher schools had 2 years or less of high school education.

Data were drawn from the findings of two major surveys conducted by the Office of Education as a part of its 1954-56 &quot;Biennial Survey of Education in the United States&quot;: (1) the Rural County Survey covered multi-district counties--rural counties having more than one school district per county; and (2) the County Unit Survey covered single-district counties--rural counties having a single district per county. A total of 1,760 counties, or 57% of all the counties in the Nation, representing 44 states, were covered. Data were summarized for all rural counties, grouped both by degree of ruralness and by types of school organization (single-district or multi-district). Tabular  data covered general statistics on counties, districts, pupils, staff, schools, etc.; the distribution by level of instruction; adult education, public summer schools, and junior colleges in rural counties; financial statistics collected by the two surveys; and the percentage of total enrollment in each grade (K-12). The data verified the fact that the small school was the dominant feature of rural education. Some highlights included: in 1955-56 the schools of rural counties enrolled 6,248,000 pupils, or approximately 20% of the Nation's total public school enrollment; 40% of the Nation's schools and 50% of all school districts were located in rural counties; and the more rural counties averaged fewer pupils and fewer teachers per school.

Total distribution ranges and central tendencies, by states and geographic areas, were included to show the financial picture concerning rural school salaries and per pupil expenditures. Based on the 1950 Census data, the multi-district and single-district counties were grouped into the most rural and the least rural. Among the findings were: the average annual salary of the instructional staffs in the rural county school  systems was $3,123 in 1955-56; for the most rural counties, the average annual salary was $2,882 and $3,218 for the least rural counties; for the smallest cities (2,500-9,999 population), the average annual salary was $4,034 and $5,068 for the largest cities (25,000 or more); the average annual rural school salaries paid in the states or regions were almost invariably higher than the average annual incomes of the families living within the same states or regions; of the average total expenditure per pupil per annum, an average of $21 went for pupil transportation; and the average for pupil transportation for the most rural school systems was nearly 7 times that for the most urban school systems.

Ranging in age from 15 to 19 years, 115 students from 4 on-going vocational programs recognized as exemplary by state level vocational educators and 93 students from schools not having special vocational programs for disadvantaged youth were administered the Survey of Pupil Opinion, the Career Maturity Inventory, and the Work Value Inventory. Although the majority of the youth in both samples were male and black, comparable proportions of females and whites were included. The instruments measured the students' attitudes  toward themselves, school, teachers, and work. Value was measured in 15 areas: creativity, management, achievement, surroundings, supervisory relations, way of life, security, associates, esthetics, prestige, independence, variety, economic returns, altruism, and intellectual stimulation. Findings included: the disadvantaged vocational group expressed more positive attitudes about themselves as students, gave better opinions of their teachers, and saw themselves as more effective in school and social interactions; and the vocational group displayed attitudes characterized by more involvement with career choice processes, more positive orientations to work, and more independence in decision making.

        "description":"The first thing migrant farmworkers require when they arrive at a new place is shelter. Traditionally, on-the-job housing has been provided by the grower or by a growers association or by a company which owns the crops; and traditionally the quality of such housing has varied greatly. Although Texas is the biggest exporter and user state of migrant labor in the country, Texas had done absolutely nothing to ensure that the housing provided these workers was minimally decent, until 6 years ago. This paper presents a history of the efforts which have been made to improve the quality of migrant farm labor housing within the State of Texas. This history necessarily includes developments on the national level. Topics discussed are: (1) the nature of migrant housing; (2) the Federal  response during the Roosevelt, Truman, and Eisenhower administrations (1932-1960), the Kennedy and Johnson administrations (1961-1968), the first Nixon administration (1969-1972), and the second Nixon administration and the Ford administration (1973-1976); (3) the State of Texas response; and (4) legislation and programs affecting migrant labor housing in Texas today--the Department of Labor's Interstate Recruiting Service Code, the Occupational Safety and Health Act Code, the Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act, the FmHA Farm Labor Housing Program, the Texas Migrant Labor Camp Law, the Rural Housing Alliance, the Housing Assistance Council, and the Texas Housing Development Corporation.

A comparison of the patterns of acculturation/assimilation was made by testing whether any significant differences were found in the acculturation/assimilation of urban and rural refugees, of young and old  refugees, of male and female refugees, and of the better educated and those with less education. Findings included: the ability to speak English, the desire to become American citizens, and the ability to drive a car were among the factors assisting the acculturation/assimilation process of these refugees; contact with American friends and the desire to learn American ways of life were important factors which helped the Vietnamese in Little Rock adjust to living in America; adequate employment and income aided the acculturation/assimilation process; the lack of English speaking ability, the desire to return to Vietnam, and the lack of a good education and of adequate employment hindered the acculturation process.

Dividing the main problematic variable, &quot;career plan&quot;, into &quot;educational plan&quot; and &quot;migration plan&quot;, an attempt was made to delimit the nature and scope of a youngster's occupational options and life chances. Socioeconomic background was measured in terms of non-manual, manual, and farmer or coal miner categories for the non-mining and the mining regions respectively. Results indicated: Appalachian seniors from  blue-collar or farm families had significantly limited access to both the material and non-material resources that facilitate educational achievement; lower class Appalachian girls perceived themselves as having even less of a chance at rewarding careers and/or self-fulfilling life styles than lower class boys; the distribution and allocation of occupational opportunities were linked to a young person's position in the regional social system in both regions (e.g., upper class males living in rural sectors of the coal mining region were less apt to migrate than their subsistance farming counterparts).

A 50-item questionnaire was administered to 240 persons attending the MSRTS workshops at the 1977 State Migrant Education Conference. Results were reported in the following categories: length of service; position title; regionally, in part; and item analysis. Findings included: there was a significant growth of almost 20% between first-year and second-year employees; employees did not improve in their understanding after the second year; community aides did not score significantly different from non-community aides; resource teachers exhibited the  widest spread of individual raw scores of all groups; and respondents had a rather broad and general comprehension level regarding their general knowledge of MSRTS procedure, awareness and content. Recommendations included: a different training component for advanced MSRTS staff should be developed with State assistance which focuses on the specific areas represented by the error analysis; and individualized regional training (and retraining) for advanced Supportive Services staff must consider the differences of responsibility represented by the duality of the field &quot;specialist&quot; and the all-around &quot;generalist&quot; characteristics encountered in the position titles.

        "description":"The study identified programs serving the needs of migrant families and problems in improving services to more adequately address these needs. Exemplary programs were identified which were currently serving migrants through child care, health, education, and outreach services. The study included a literature review, a survey of 90 training programs, and mail and personal interviews with 800 migrant families and agencies in 12 states. The 12 states included major home base and user states, regions covering all 3 migrant streams, states with both large and small numbers of migrants, areas with long-established migrant populations and those with recent migrant activity, and states with major &quot;settled-out&quot; areas. Findings included: summer programs were the most effective Title I  Migrant Education projects due to the lack of other programs during the growing season; the Food Stamps program was the only social services program significantly utilized by migrants; and migrant's access to social services was restricted by their own unfamiliarity with programs in each locale, community attitudes, and lack of transportation. Recommendations concerned the need for recognition of the migrant's special needs interfaced with Federal, state, and local program responsibilities and considered the complexity of social services provider systems, the need for coordination among them, and the structural alterations necessary for both short- and long-term change to enable migrant families to achieve full and self-sufficient citizenship.

Part II synthesizes the information obtained from 12 states according to public social service agencies, child care, personal and environmental health, and education; gives an overview of that service to migrant children; and describes Federal and state funding sources which are, or can be, used to support child welfare efforts in each service area. Also reported are an assessment of migrant children's needs and the extent to which they are being met, a description of existing services  which address these needs, factors which affect service delivery (program implementation, administrative structure, support, service coordination), and barriers of acceptability, availability, and accessibility which impede service delivery. Part III discusses the results of interviews conducted with migrant families concerning their use and need for specific child welfare services. Presented in Part IV are detailed summaries of the findings, with a description and discussion of the services at the state and local levels. Part V includes discussions of the existence of undocumented workers in the migrant stream and the need for advocacy of migrant programs; the results of the survey on training farmworkers in service to migrants; and two case studies which represent the best day care  program and the worst living conditions for migrant families.

Goals of REEEP, an Elementary and Secondary Education Act Title III program, are: to prevent school failure with an intervention program which includes early identification and remediation of developmental learning deficiencies and to integrate handicapped children into the regular school program; to provide in-service training to selected early childhood and kindergarten teachers and aides employed by various New Mexico school districts; and to disseminate information concerning the program. Evaluation of student achievement was based on pre- and  posttests using standardized tests which measured language development in Spanish and English, school readiness, and self-concept. In-service training and dissemination activities were subjectively evaluated using site visits, observations, records, and self-reports by the staff. Major findings included: students made significant gains in language development in English and school readiness; students indicated a positive and continuous growth concerning self-concept and social development; the variable making the greatest contribution to language development in English was IQ; and the in-service training provided to the 47 teachers and aides was extremely successful and effective.

During 1976-77, services included the training of selected teachers and aides to acquire competencies in working with young, high risk, and handicapped children. Conducted on-site at the replication centers (9 school districts and 9 Head Start Centers located in isolated areas in New Mexico) and at the parent center, training was taken to these centers by a specially designed and equipped motor coach. Evaluation of the training was conducted by an external evaluation team via objective evaluation of the workshops; classroom visits;  site-visits with administrators, teachers, and aides; self-evaluation questionnaires from the trainees and trainers; and a review of various records/logs maintained by the outreach training team. A follow-up study of former REPSAC students in grades 1-5 was conducted. Findings included: the training program for the teachers and aides was extremely effective; services provided to the schools in the isolated areas were extremely needed; and the follow-up study indicated a change to an upward trend for Spanish language development, a continued slightly upward trend for English language development, and a mild downward trend for learning aptitude.

Data were collected from 1,676 high school students during the 1974 spring semester. Responses were analyzed for differences between those who had consumed alcohol within the last month (alcohol involved) and those who had never or within the last month consumed alcohol (non-involved). Data were analyzed using non-parametric statistics; the .05 significance level was used to specify significant statistical findings. The characteristics of sex, age, family income,  race, and school class were examined for the Wichita and the state youth, and alcohol involved and non-involved youth. Findings included: 63% of the state sample was alcohol involved as compared to 54% of the Wichita sample; although only about 13% of each sub-sample was old enough to legally purchase alcohol, 45% of the Wichita sample and 52% of the state sample below 18 years of age were alcohol involved; alcohol involvement tended to increase with grade level and family income in both samples; 24% of the Kansas sample and 10% of the Wichita sample did most of their drinking while driving around; and females in all classifications were more willing to drive after becoming drunk at a party.

An alternative model was devised which differed from the Bidwell-Kasarda model in that it included some new exogeneous variables, a new dependent variable (retention instead of achievement), and a reordering of the causal sequence within the model. Variables were categorized as follows: environmental conditions (school district size, fiscal resources, disadvantaged students, parental education, percent nonwhite, and percent rural); structural conditions (pupil-teacher ratio, administrative  intensity, and professional support component); staff composition conditions (certified staff qualifications); and dependent variable (retention). Results indicated the model worked well in accounting for variance in two of the intervening variables, pupil-teacher ratio and administrative intensity, but for the other two intervening variables, professional staff and qualifications of teachers, and for the dependent variable, retention, the model accounted for only a small amount of the variation. It was concluded that neither this model nor the Bidwell-Kasarda model accounted for much variation--21% and 25%, respectively. (JC)",

Group I (N=91 with a 65% response) consisted of all persons who participated in the one-year training program focused on the analysis of local and statewide public issues; Group II (N=34 with a 94% response) consisted of the first group of people who were involved in the three-year program focused on local, state, national, and international public issues; Group III (N=73 with an 81% response) constituted the comparison group made up of people with characteristics similar to those of the program  participants. Participant change was measured in terms of attendance, membership committee participation, offices held, and nonlocal affiliations in groups categorized as: government and quasi-government; voluntary public service (nongovernment); political; fraternal; social, athletic, and sports; religious; military and patriotic; and economic interest. Results indicated a trend away from participation in nongovernment-affiliated public service groups and greater involvement in organizations having legislated authority. Supplementary analysis of participant self-assessments of program effects indicated that the greatest effects were perceived in areas directly related to program objectives (i.e., increases in public affairs interest, feelings of confidence, and analytical skills).

Focusing on 11 counties in northcentral and northeastern Washington, the PRI intent is described as strengthening the capacity for development at two levels: in localities and regions, focusing on individual citizens, local officials, and members of local agencies as the principal actors; and in externally based support agencies or institutions which have specific responsibilities for assisting local people in the development process, focusing on agency or institutional professionals  as the major actors (with particular emphasis on the capacity of educational institutions to provide short and long term services). Presenting an explanation of the rationale for alternative rural development models, this paper includes sections on: (l) the alternative development strategies (the Havelock, Rothman, Eberts, Moe and Tamblyn, and Mulford et al models); (2) the PRI model; (3) the PRI evaluation and research activities (process description and critical incident analysis; outcome analysis; pre- and post-measurements; assessment of effectiveness for specific events; focused evaluation events designed to review and adjust program direction; comparisons between geographic sub-regions; and assessment of the relative utility of the PRI model); (4) review of program progress.

        "description":"A replication of two previous studies, this study examined the effect of both sex and ethnicity on attitudes toward women, self-reported masculinity-femininity, and masculine-feminine stereotypic attitudes. The Attitudes Toward Women Scale (AWS) and the Personal Attributes Questionnaire (PAQ) were administered to 367 college students (112 Anglos, 32 Blacks, and 221 Chicanos) during the Fall 1976 semester. The PAQ was administered twice under two different instructional conditions. In the first condition, the students rated self-reported masculinity-femininity; and in the second condition, the students reported typical male-female college student characteristics. Data were analyzed by computing tests of significance (t-test and F-ratio) and step-wise multiple regression analysis.  Data analysis compared responses of 156 male and 211 female members of the three ethnic groups. Findings included: sex and ethnicity were clearly related to attitudes toward women and masculine-feminine stereotypic attitudes; sex was the single, most influential variable on the two scales; males reported a more traditional, conservative attitude toward women and women's roles; Blacks held a more traditional view of women and their roles; Chicanos had a higher self perception than Blacks; both males and females reported a highly conservative and traditional role for men; and females had a more liberal attitude toward women than the males.

        "description":"The study examined whether significant rural-urban differences still persisted in selected factors affecting a community's fertility level. The factors selected were education, occupational class, income, and the participation of women in the labor force. Tested was the hypothesis that the educational development, occupational class, economic status, and proportion of women working had direct negative effects on a community's fertility level; and these effects varied with place of residence. The 1970 census of Ohio's 88 counties was used in the analysis. The 31 SMSA's (Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area) in Ohio were treated as urban counties and the 57 non-SMSA's as rural counties. The t-test and path analysis were used to test the hypothesis. The first statistical finding  from the t-test was that rural-urban differences were significant in each of the selected variables. The path analysis was then used to test the effects of these variables on fertility in rural and urban areas. No rural-urban difference was found in the relationship between fertility and occupational class. They were inversely related in both rural and urban areas. In rural areas, education had a direct negative effect, income had a positive effect, and women working had no effect on fertility. In urban areas, education and income had no direct effect on fertility, while women working had a positive effect on fertility. (Author/NQ)",

Ten characteristics of humanistic teachers are listed. Teachers, lay persons, administrators, and hiring personnel were asked to rank order five characteristics deemed necessary for a potential biology teacher. Humanistic attitudes toward students ranked first or second for all three groups. Next, the same groups were asked to interpret what is meant by humanistic teacher behavior. The results are given for all three groups. In the second part of the paper, the author lists survival competencies  associated with humanistic teaching. These are grouped into three problem areas: personal, school, and community.

The practice variety factor had three fixed levels: broad-, narrow-, and no-practice. Students learned computer programming rules either from a context or a rule booklet on Day 1 of the experiment. Students in the broad and narrow practice groups received either a broad or a narrow practice booklet consisting of ten practice instances with feedback on Day 2. All students took a posttest 11 days after initial learning. An analysis of variance on retention scores found both the broad and narrow  practice groups scoring significantly higher (p &lt; .01) than the no-practice groups.

Data were summarized for the entire group and for two subgroups defined as low and average socioeconomic status (SES). In general, the error rate was higher on horizontal format problems. Over all problems, the average SES group performed better than the low SES group. Appended to the report are data summary tables, a testing schedule, and copies of the tests. (SD)",

Following instruction, these tests were given again with a test on factors and primes. Data analysis indicated that pretraining significantly improved the reliability of the Arithmetic Reasoning Test for Chicano students; no differences in reliability were found for non-Chicanos nor on the Missing Words Test.

Both experiments involved the same fifth-grade students; the experiments were administered consecutively in a 5-day period. Students were pretested using arithmetic reasoning, geometry, and missing words tests. They were then given one of two programmed geometry texts depending on the treatment group (all practice immediately after concept vs. practice interspersed). The geometry posttest was followed by work with programmed texts on polygons  and the polygon posttest. Four treatment groups were used for polygons; these were defined by many vs. few examples and many vs. few practice problems. Results indicated that overall there was no difference attributable to massed vs. dispersed practice problems although the effectiveness of distributed problems increased with mathematics ability. Neither variable in the polygon experiment was found to make a significant difference. (SD)",

A battery of fraction tests consisting of 78 items was developed; tests were classified according to cognitive level as computation, comprehension, or applications. Tests were given to average eighth-grade students. More than 1500 students took 10-item parts of the battery. Results indicated that students do not have the fractional skills needed to compute or to solve problems. Responses to number line and diagramatic items indicate they understand fractional concepts; however, performance on other items  indicates a poor understanding of the structure of the rational number system.

The report includes guidelines on the purchase and use of calculators as well as advice on gaining community support for such a project. Issues related to classroom management are discussed; in particular, the desirability of providing students with their own calculators is explained. Six areas of mathematics in which the calculators were particularly useful are described, and sample problems from each are provided. These areas are: word problems, arithmetic mean, probability, adding to produce palindromes, functions, and decimals. In conclusion, the authors observe that pupils were interested throughout the year and that they accepted the  calculator as a tool which allowed them to be more independent and proficient in mathematics.

The basic design consisted of a treatment versus control group using a posttest designed to measure the various components of the PLT materials. Participation required covering a specific set of core lessons with the students and administering a test at the end of the lesson exposure. Approximately 4000 students participated in the evaluation. The results indicated that PLT materials had the greatest impact on intermediate students, especially in the transmission of specific information.

Early in the fall, a battery of instruments was administered; these included a computation test of division, four simple geometric questions, some non-routine problems, and an arithmetic reasoning test. A week later a reading test which utilized the Cloze procedure was administered. Near the middle of the school year a battery parallel to the pretest was given. Tests were scored and submitted to regression analysis. Results indicated that the best predictor of computation ability at midyear was computation at the beginning of the year; a similar relationship was observed for problem-solving ability.

A sample of 421 students from grades 9 through 12 was divided into three groups on the basis of amount of mathematics coursework completed. Students were given four pretests (numeration, arithmetic reasoning, bases, and problems) followed by a pre-program designed to familiarize them with programed text materials. They were then assigned to treatment groups for instruction; materials were identical for the two groups except version F had only 1 or 2 examples for each explanation while version M had 4 or more. The posttest consisted of the Negative Number Base Achievement Test and Word Association Test. Means, standard deviations, and  reliabilities were computed for all tests and subscales and data were submitted to regression analysis. Results indicated that increasing the number of practice problems improved student learning; there was an interaction between students' mathematical sophistication and the levels (e.g., comprehension) at which the improvement took place.

The data presented are based primarily on a series of surveys conducted by the National Science Foundation (NSF) between 1953 and 1977. Highlights of the report include the estimate that total R&amp;D spending will reach $40.8 billion in 1977 and account for 2.2% of the gross national product. About 53% of this support comes from the Federal Government. Approximately 542,000 R&amp;D scientists and engineers were employed in 1976. The report includes descriptions of R&amp;D funding patterns and examines work  in three areas: basic research, applied research, and development. The funding and manpower patterns in each sector of the economy are analyzed. Appendices provide statistical tables and technical notes. (SD)",

        "description":"Many American educational materials present biased or inaccurate views of Africa. Although these problems are found in a range of media, this study examines printed matter only. A representative sampling of materials indicates that four approaches are generally used in a study of Africa: geographical, historical, cultural, and case study. An overview illustrates problems within each of these four categories. Although the trend in the study of geography has been to present man's interaction with his environment, African texts still discuss only the country's physical aspects. Historical materials are often slanted; for example, they often favor European colonialism without considering the African's point of view. Culture is portrayed not as different and valid, but rather as  exotic and strange. Case studies contain large amounts of descriptive information with little analysis. Generally, too many materials offer a superficial treatment of Africa in language that has condescending or negative overtones. As a solution to such problems, African sources should be consulted when preparing materials. Bibliographies for both educators and students are included in this booklet. (KC)",

        "description":"The first part of the paper discusses how changes in ideology and power at the local and national level may have contributed to the increase in advanced degrees for women. The remainder of the paper discusses how these ideological and political factors have affected the participation of women at the Westcliffe Business School. Changes at the Westcliffe School of Business from 1968, when the proportion of women among first-year students was 2%, to 1974, when the proportion of women students was 19%, are described and explained by members of the school and by sociologists. The period since the student unrest of the 1960s is noted to have produced changes in ideology and power on national and local levels. Among pressures described for educational changes are feminist challenges to  traditional sex roles, and the use of federal power to combat sexism in graduate education. Considered are aspects of change at the Westcliffe School of Business, including an increase in female applications and admissions, a more open attitude toward women students, changes in administration, more liberal admission policies for women, recruitment activities by women students, and general ideological changes in attitudes toward advanced degrees for women. The author agrees that, although these local and school-centered changes are significant, national ideological influences and political events have played a larger role in increasing the number of advanced degrees awarded to women.

        "author":["Whitehead, Tony Larry"],
        "description":"This paper presents an ethnographic analysis of a controversial research project, the Putaney Study, as an argument for the involvement of anthropologists in research that is perceived to be potentially controversial. A research team from Putaney University initiated a research project to document the fertility attitudes and practices of 600 employed male heads of households receiving financial aid to dependent children (ADCU) from the Warsaw County Office of Public Assistance. The rationale for the paper is that a study of the factors which led to the success or failure of a particular research project can sometimes be as valuable as the data that the research was designed to collect. The ethnographic techniques of participant observation, taking detailed notes of events  observed, and studying the whole as an integrated system of interacting parts, are well suited for such a study. The term \"system\" refers not to the structural subsystems of a project, but rather to the ideological ones which can cut across these subsystems. These ideologies can potentially lead to four levels of conflict which are analyzed in separate sections of the paper. The conclusion is that, to avoid opposition, ideological congruence must be attained within the research team and cooperation gained from the study population. If the latter process is successful, the potential opposition from other structural groups might be dramatically reduced. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"A community development project employed the performing arts to focus community consciousness on local issues and problems in five towns in western Massachusetts. Performing artists and community development personnel organized town residents to hold workshops and, ultimately, theatrical productions to explore town issues. The team spent two weeks in each town. Concerns of program design included staff characteristics, training, and implementation procedures that depended on quick establishment of high quality relationships with townspeople. The area of western Massachusetts is described as rural but becoming populated by professional city workers who seek a quieter residence. Friction between natives and these newer residents was common. The fun bus program involved an advance  team which visited each town several weeks before the arrival of the fun bus. The team made use of existing town communications channels to announce the bus' objectives, to gain support of a local organization and one local \"academic humanist,\" and to arrange lodging. When the bus arrived, initial workshops were held to facilitate communication among townspeople and to identify important issues. Subsequent sessions focused on theatrical training for the program's culmination, the \"town show.\" A review of problems cites a need to spend more time in each town, an internal fun bus staff facilitator, and a provision for follow-up discussion after each culminating town show.

It was presented to the annual conference of the Ford Foundation's International Division on September 22, 1975. The time between the end of World War II and 1964 was characterized by the dominance of private interest and activity. The period 1965 to 1970 was characterized by a proliferation of government family planning programs and by the entrance of bilateral government agencies as supporters of population and family-planning activity. The years 1970-1974 brought large increases in monetary support for family planning and increasing dominance in the field by the Agency for  International Development (AID) and the multilateral agencies. As for future prospects, the author concludes that social progress should be given precedence over economic progress in development and that population phenomena should be viewed in the context of the entire constellation of development phenomena. Following the essay is a review of the Foundation's own programs in population, both past and present. (Author/RM)",

The first six suggestions deal with documenting teaching experience. Graduate teaching assistants should keep a file containing descriptions of specific teaching methods, grading techniques, outlines of lectures, and syllabi. The file should also contain written evaluations by students, faculty, or fellow graduate students. Experience in broad survey courses and in courses related to the student's field of interest is recommended. Experience in other settings such as community colleges is also useful. Membership in professional sociological associations ensures awareness of the current state of the field. Suggestions seven through 11  explain how to construct a job vita. It should include concise descriptions of major teaching experiences, and should indicate that additional materials can be furnished upon request. Persons identified to give job references should have first hand knowledge of the student's teaching abilities. Suggestions 12 through 18 focus on interviewing techniques. Students should be able to express their philosophy of teaching sociology, be up to date about issues in the field, be ready to teach a mock course, and provide course outlines for specific courses they would like to teach.

The first five ideas are about publicizing the position and initial screening of applications. Jobs should be announced in professional journals and at graduate departments with good reputations. Standardized forms should be sent to applicants asking them to describe their teaching experience, plans, and qualifications. In initial screening, candidates who give specific evidence of teaching expertise or training are the best. Seven suggestions about the final screening process emphasize acquisition of additional background information from applicants and screening by a variety of faculty members and students. Persons contacted for job references should  be asked to comment on the candidate's teaching performance. Eight concluding suggestions are made for interviewing prospective teachers. These stress the usefulness of having candidates interviewed by a cross section of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as by faculty and teaching/learning specialists. Candidates should be asked how they would organize certain courses and how they would handle hypothetical situations. They might be asked to prepare a sample classroom presentation. Information concerning the institutional and departmental resources available to teachers should be provided for all candidates. (AV)",

A major objective is to provide students with competencies and skills necessary to cope with the interpersonal relationships and stresses faced by individuals and families in a rapidly changing society. The curriculum design focuses on four major topics: self and others, tradition and change, independence and interdependence, and present and future. The plan divides the topics into four maturity levels, which can be broadly applied to early childhood through adult education. The beginning level deals with exploring the human environment, the intermediate level focuses on becoming oneself,  the advanced level examines relationships, and the highest level stresses helping learners develop commitment to mankind. Objectives for including core areas are then listed for each of the four maturity levels. Another section offers suggestions for curriculum development and provides examples of actual instructional strategies for implementation. Twelve pages of print and nonprint resources for students and teachers follow, most of which were published after 1970. The listing includes prices and publishers' addresses. (Author/MK)",

Researchers had two objectives: one, to determine the possibility of developing a typology of peer helping behavior within the classroom; and, two, if possible, to use this information to determine whether the extent of helping behavior related to school attitude, self-concept, peer social acceptance, and reading growth. Helping relationships are defined as either social or academic, teacher or student initiated. Third, fourth, and fifth grade students contained within the same classroom were subjects. Results showed that development of a typology is possible and that a relationship exists between peer  helping behavior and school attitudes. This monograph explains the research methodology, describes classroom experiences, and summarizes results. Statistical tables, monitoring and evaluation forms, and instruments used in data collection are included.

        "author":["Leventhal, Gerald S."],
        "description":"This paper presents an alternative to the predominant equity theory for studying the concept of fairness in social relationships. According to the equity theory, or merit principle, fairness in social relationships occurs when rewards, punishments, and resources are allocated in proportion to one's input or contributions. The basic problems of this theory are that it employs a unidimensional concept of fairness and that it emphasizes only the fairness of distribution, ignoring the fairness of procedure. In contrast, the alternative to this theory is based on two justice rules, the distributional and the procedural. Distribution rules follow certain criteria: the individual's contributions, his needs, and the equality theory. These criteria are considered relative to the  individual's role within the particular setting or social system. A justice judgment sequence estimates the individual's deservingness based on each rule. Final judgments evolve from a rule-combination equation. Preceding the final distribution of reward, a cognitive map of the allocative process is constructed. Fairness is judged in terms of the procedure's consistency, prevention of personal bias, and its representativeness of important subgroups. Opportunities to apply this concept of fairness exist in field studies of censorship, participatory decision making, equal opportunity, and representativeness of social institutions. (KC)",

Mao's regulations were revised by the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in 1947 as follows: obey orders in all your actions, do not take a single needle or piece of thread from masses, and turn in everything captured. The &quot;Eight Points for Attention&quot; were revised to include the following: (1) speak politely, (2) pay fairly for what you buy, (3) return everything you borrow, (4) pay for anything you damage, (5) do not hit or swear at people, (6) do not damage crops, (7) do not take  liberties with women, and (8) do not abuse captives. The &quot;Code of Conduct&quot; for American soldiers, intended to inform them of behavior expected of them during war time, contains six statements: I am prepared to give my life in defense of my country; I will never surrender of my own free will; if captured, I will continue to resist; if I become a prisoner of war, I will keep faith with my fellow prisoners; when questioned, I will make no statements disloyal to my country; and I will never forget that I am an American fighting man.

His emphasis on \"real\" weapons suggests that there exist in our world today \"false\" conceptions of what truly leads to peace. The three sections of this booklet relate to these false conceptions and their sources. The first section, \"Liturgy,\" emphasizes the need for prayerful preparation and reflection on the issue of war and peace. The second section, \"Focus,\" examines the tension between the weapons of peace and the weapons of war, human rights, and national security. The final section,\"Process,\" attempts to countermand ignorance by serious study. The real weapons include a knowledgeable and politically astute public, willing to effect changes in national policies toward the genuine pursuit of justice and peace.

The evaluator is concerned with the quality of curriculum, teaching methods and materials, and with the actual content the student has learned. Both cognitive and affective domains must be evaluated to ensure that the student knows and applies relevant facts. The first step is for the evaluator to set up a logical framework which defines the goals of the course and the methods of evaluation. Suggested methods include interviews, research projects, and objective and essay tests. Interest scales, semantic differential scales, and Likert scales, which determine student attitudes, are also recommended.  Directions for the construction and use of a logical framework, testing models, and a glossary of terms relevant to education and testing are included in appendices.

It is intended as background reading for University of West Florida officials involved with evaluating applications for admission of students from Ireland. The Irish educational system can be divided into primary (elementary), post primary (secondary), and tertiary education (higher education), basically a 6-(3-3)-3 system. Attendance is mandatory from age six to age 15, covering the years spent in the primary schools and in the junior cycle of the post-primary school. The free national schools, where most students receive their primary education, allow students to move at their own pace. At this level the Catholic religion is considered the most important of all subject areas. Other curricula include the Irish  and English languages, mathematics, social and environmental studies, art and craft activities, music, and physical education. The three year junior cycle of the post-primary school provides students with a general education through a core curriculum of Irish, religion, civics, and physical education. Having completed the compulsory education, the student must decide whether to continue attending school for at least two more years or to seek employment and arrange to attend school part time. The student who decides to attend school full time and earns the Intermediate Certificate or the Day Vocational Certificate must then decide whether to pursue the academic track which leads to the Leaving Certificate or pursue another senior cycle program. The Leaving Certificate qualifies students  for university admission. Ireland also has many programs for the mentally and physically handicapped and for adult education. (Author/RM)",

Chapter IV discusses education for the future, including social change, preparation for  working life, and self-training. In chapter V, problems which arise from the extension of the school's sphere of action are discussed, followed by description of the school as a participatory community in chapter VI. Chapter VII focuses on adult education, which is described as the most stimulating sector of educational activity over the past 10 years. The final chapter discusses trends and problems of present day school-community relations and identifies values which must guide this relationship in the future, including open-mindedness, creativity, commitment, and autonomy.

It includes background materials and a study guide for parish leaders and other educators. The central question pertaining to the Panama Canal concerns the rights of the United States according to the 1903 treaty. This treaty states that the United States can exercise &quot;in perpetuity&quot; power and authority over the ten-mile strip of land along the Canal route. The question over these rights is addressed to those who believe Christians have a valid contribution to make in regard to national and international policymaking. This issue was chosen because it represents a test of how a large and a small nation can relate in an  interdependent world, and also because churches in both countries can facilitate debate in and between the two nations. The issue has substantial moral content; the treaty not only restricts Panama as an agent in its own development, but also detrimentally affects its economy. The moral challenge for churches is to see that the test is one of justice rather than one of power. Statements by both U.S. and Panamanian clerygymen, a play, study guide, and summaries of both sides of the argument are included in the text. Statements issued by conferences of both countries and a general statement by the Delegation of National Council of Churches are reproduced in appendices.

        "description":"This study finds that the women's movement has had a significant impact in expanding the outlook and changing the attitudes of American women. According to this representative survey of 1,552 women, American women perceive their roles as either traditional, balancing, or expanding. The traditional outlook, generally shared by women over 50, views homemaking as woman's primary role. The expanding outlook favors more options and flexible lifestyles. This outlook, held by women under 35, regards women on an equal basis with men, not only in employment, but also in the sharing of household responsibilities, alimony, child support and custody. In the middle of the spectrum are those women who share a balancing outlook, combining the views of the traditional and the expanding. These  women are generally in their 40's or of Black or Spanish-American heritage. The survey reveals that (1) most women are still employed in low-level or female-dominated fields, (2) a gap remains between salaries of men and women, and (3) most women believe government assistance with child care is needed. The study concludes with a list of predictions for the future, based on the idea that \"when outlooks change, behavior follows.\" An expectation is that women will pursue lifestyles which combine careers and homemaking with more shared responsibilities in marriage. Chapters discuss women's opinions; their work; marital status; motherhood, family planning, and childhood; leisure activities and the media image of women; and the effect of the women's movement. Statistical tables, a copy of the  19 page questionnaire, and a bibliography are included. (KC)",

Statistical tables project the population increase annually from 1977 to 2000, and in less detail from 2000 to 2050. The author stresses that these reports are projections rather than predictions, given the uncertainty of certain variables such as the birth rate. As of July 1, 1976, the U.S. population was 215 million. Projections indicate that the population will increase to between 246 million to 283 million by the year 2000. Limitations of the report are: (1) projections are based on the assumption that no major catastrophes such as wars or epidemics will occur; and (2) the assumed level of immigration at 400,000 per year  does not include illegal immigration or emigration patterns. The introduction to the report explains the methodology of the research. Text and detailed tables form the major portion of the report. Fertility, mortality, and immigration data, projections regarding components of change in relationship to age and sex, plus an estimated completeness of coverage are included in appendices. (KC)",

The research was limited to his teaching years at the Bauhaus and the Dusseldorf Academy, 1921 through 1933. Klee's own writings served as primary sources, and other sources included his son, a close friend, and Bauhaus contemporaries. Most of Klee's own writings were amassed on a class-to-class basis. They are a mixture of theories, instructions, philosophies, and exercises. He explored ideas on student achievement, the art process, artistic creation, and form. The thesis contains seven chapters. Included are a short biography; a review of Klee's art training and artistic development; settings in which he taught at the Bauhaus and the Dusseldorf Academy; his  role in those schools and the type of teacher he was; his beliefs as expounded in his writings and expanded with comments by recognized representatives of other disciplines; his written theories; the manner in which he presented his theories; and his concern for the development of total vision in his students.

The hypothesis was that openness of social studies classroom climate would be related to change in social and political attitudes toward school and, to a lesser extent, to change in general social and political attitudes. Attitude data were collected each spring from students in ten midwestern high schools from March 1974 to April 1976. The four basic attitudes were trust, integration, confidence, and interest. Classroom climate was assessed through student perceptions of three characteristics: frequency of controversial issues exposure, range of viewpoints encouraged, and openness of student opinion expression. Each climate variable was found to be related  directly to each school-related variable for the three-year period, with more open perceived classroom climate associated with more positive school attitudes of trust, integration, confidence, and interest. Overall across-time attitude trends show a decrease in political confidence, possibly an effect of the Watergate scandal. Implications of the study are that controversial issues should be included in social studies curricula, and that teacher objectivity enhances positive student attitudes. (Author/AV)",

It is hoped that the research will lead to an understanding of the role of information in the research process and will ultimately be of use in the design of new information systems or the reorganization of existing systems. The first section contains a review of previous research, including studies which considered historians' use of sources through citation analysis. Fifty-two academic historians, representing faculties at Cornell University and the University of Rochester, were surveyed. The main objective was to identify the specific stages of research in progress and to isolate different sources of information behavior at each point in the research process. Methodology involved the critical  incident technique applied in a self-administered mailed questionnaire. Five stages of research were identified as problem selection, detailed planning, data collection, analysis and interpretation, and writing-rewriting. Some conclusions were that there are different information needs associated with the different stages, and that primary materials or data of historical research are the most important information source in almost every stage.

The first article describes social trends, such as the breakdown of the traditional family, which have increasingly shifted education for responsibility from the family and the community to the school. In the second article, the development of student responsibility in response to teacher values, school rules, and peer attitudes is described. The third article focuses on development of self-actualization and decision-making skills in children, followed by identification of the essentials of responsibility education in the fourth article. The fifth  article discusses personal ethics in the world of work and identifies themes such as the good provider, independence, and success which have effected the work ethic in the past. Global issues of responsibility are identified in the sixth article, including international law, food and energy supply, and ecology. The concluding article suggests ways of incorporating responsibility education into the curriculum, including development of new courses, integration into existing courses, independent study, mini-courses, and special projects.

        "description":"A study was conducted with social studies teacher trainees in a southern university to determine if videotaped microteaching produced changes in their self-concepts. The problem under investigation was whether or not student teachers would develop a positive self-image as a result of their videotaped microteaching experiences. Sixty subjects were randomly assigned to (1) a fully experimental group, (2) a control group, or (3) an experimental group receiving no pretest. The fully experimental group and the control group completed the pretest prior to the videotaped microteaching in which the two experimental groups participated. Following the experimental treatment all three groups took the first posttest. A second posttest was administered upon completion of the student teaching  experience. The instrument employed for all tests was the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale, a multivariable instrument that yields phenomenological and empirically derived scores of attitudes toward self. Results showed significant improvement on self-criticism scores. This indicated that the videotaped microteaching did change student teachers' self-concept by increasing willingness for self-criticism and for acceptance of criticism by others. Data tables and suggestions for further research are included. (Author/AV)",

Information presented for each issue includes definitions, a history  of political and military action in connection with the issue, consequences of negative action, and proposals to accomplish the stated goal. Section II presents guidelines for assessing political desirability and feasibility of specific issues and for considering an issue's potential for education and mobilization. Section III identifies six proposals which offer the highest potential for action: reduce military budgets, a no-first-use pledge, comprehensive test bans, nuclear weapon free zones, general and complete disarmament, and the establishment of a transnational peace force.

Section one, a civics curriculum, presents a sequential program focusing on the contemporary Jewish community. Concepts and related learning experiences are described for primary, intermediate, junior high, and senior high grades. For example, to illustrate how American Jews are simultaneously part of two cultures, students might conduct a seminar discussing contributions of various ethnic groups to the overall society. Section two contains a teaching strategy  on Jewish identity through the concept of \"tzedakah,\" which is \"the sociological end result of the psychological process where identity is really formulated.\" The program bases learning on the study of individuals familiar to students. It outlines goals, learning opportunities, and evaluation measures. Section three contains five units on topics such as responsibility to Israel and respect for the elderly. Section four, an idea corner, describes over 50 innovative projects from schools, temples, and bulletins of the Bureau of Jewish Education. (Author/AV)",

Many of the activities involve students in recording birth and death dates, comparing ages of death of men and women during various periods, analyzing epitaphs, and identifying the social causes of death such as war. An  open-ended sentence completion activity encourages students to describe their feelings about death and life goals after having spent some time in the cemetery. A number of activities with a science orientation involve the students in identifying and studying the plant and animal life within the cemetery. Parts of flowers are to be identified, scientific names of leaves are to be researched, and insect life is recorded. Sketches or photos of plants, rocks, and animals are encouraged. Classes will have to make several trips to the cemetery in order to accomplish most of the activities. (AV)",

A social movement is defined as \"a group venture extended beyond a local community or a single event and involving a systematic effort to inaugurate changes in thought, behavior, and social relationships.\" In the first half of the paper, the author describes integral parts in the formation of a social movement, including the role of a communications network, organizational form, leadership, and goals. The women's movement has been able to grow due to the effective use of modern, mass media. There are two branches, the reform or \"women's rights\" branch, and the radical branch. Within the  paper, the National Organization for Women (NOW) is discussed as an example of how the reform branch works within the system toward reforming social and political institutions. The radical branch, which has rejected a formal organizational style, is more liberal. Various crises are reviewed which prompted formation of specific women's movement groups on national, state, and local levels. Ten common goals are identified, including revision of divorce and alimony laws, Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) passage, and change in educational and political systems to assist and admit women.

        "description":"The report contains 39 speeches by cultural affairs ministers at a 1976 Council of Europe conference in Oslo, Norway. The focus is on four themes: (1) the challenge of cultural policy in a changing society, (2) cultural policy as an instrument for improving the quality of life, (3) encouraging artistic creation, and (4) European cultural cooperation. The conference dealt with topics such as nonmaterialistic values, definitions of culture, commercial exploitation, cultural policy as devised by various governments, cultural statistics, industrial mass culture, international cultural relations, European cultural heritage, and amateur versus professional values in cultural affairs. In the closing speech, the Norwegian Minister of Education identified the major contribution of the  conference as one of consolidation of the desire for cultural cooperation among European nations. The ministers presented eight resolutions aimed at ensuring stronger and more coherent cooperation in European cultural affairs through increased governmental support, stimulation of individual cultural development, dissemination of information, and coordination of cultural policy with policies in other sectors of social life. A list of participants and an index of speeches are presented in the appendix. (Author/DB)",

A supplement to a previous Phi Chapter publication, \"Office Education Case Studies\" (1973), the case studies are intended to create class discussions and help students acquire the ability to analyze problems and make decisions. Each case is divided into two parts. The first part describes a situation which illustrates a business or economic principle, or which illustrates a situation a student might encounter in the business system. The situations are brief. The first portion of the case concludes with one or more questions that will direct the student to the problem to be solved. The second part of the case, Points to Consider,  includes questions which students might ask and wish to discuss to obtain further information needed to solve the problem or answer the question indicated in the case situation. Topical areas covered include the business environment, the business enterprise, labor relations, consumer credit and money management, consumer rights and responsibilities, banking and finance, insurance, and social responsibilities of business.

        "author":["Walker, Don D."],
        "description":"The paper states that the fragmentary character of knowledge makes unified study of a subject such as American Studies an illusion. Two aspects of the interdisciplinary approach are discussed: (1) the failure of subject fields such as American Studies to accept the predicament in which modern scholarship finds itself; and (2) the homogenizing of disciplinary integrities. The predicament is elaborated through comments by a psychologist, an economic historian, and a geographer. These three scholars maintain that as conceptions widen, they tend to become abstracted and lose their concrete particulars and conceptual unity. For example, typical training in American Studies includes a little history, a bit more English, a little anthropology, a cluster of classes in political science,  and perhaps a course or so on the history of jazz. Whereas this training is viewed by some as acquiring the discipline of American Studies, it is viewed by others as learning no discipline at all. History is discussed as an example of a discipline which relates to economics and literature, but nonetheless retains a separate and distinct character. In conclusion, the effort to bring disparate disciplines together in the name of American Studies or another interdisciplinary field, blurs important and irreducible differences. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"The pamphlet is an adaptation of social studies objectives for 17-year-olds and adults developed in 1974 by the National Assessment of Educational Progress. It is to be used by schools in Kansas as a guideline in evaluating and developing local social studies programs. Its contents have not been field tested. The objectives are presented as strands, goals, and behavioral objectives. Strands are areas within social studies in which students need competency by the end of high school. They are threads which span grades K-12 and to which each grade level can contribute. Goals are long-range indications of needed student competency for each strand. The pamphlet identifies five strands: (1) knowledge base for understanding human beings and their relationships with their environments,  (2) understanding of values, (3) ability to use intellectual and human relations skills, (4) positive self-concept, and (5) sense of and commitment to rational participation. Eighteen goals and more than 100 behavioral objectives are listed as related to the strands. For example, one goal in developing a positive self-concept is to help students become aware of their relative strengths and the strengths of the groups with which they identify. Another goal is to help students recognize societal barriers to full development. (Author/AV) Aspect of National Assessment (NAEP) dealt with in this document: Assessment Instruments (Objectives).",

The results are compared with those of a similar survey conducted in Florida. In 1975, a four-page questionnaire was mailed to 375 schools in Mississippi. Of these, 198, or 52.8 percent, were filled out and returned. Data were collected on school, course, and class characteristics; popularity of psychology courses; course objectives, content, and methods; textbooks used; need for audiovisual instructional aids; and teacher and student characteristics. The study revealed that 17.7 percent of the Mississippi secondary schools surveyed offer psychology as a separate course of study for credit. In the Florida survey, approximately 53  percent of schools surveyed taught psychology. Ninety-one percent of the Mississippi teachers reported that they needed more audiovisual instructional resources to help them with their courses. One unexpected finding of the study is the similarity that exists between the types of psychology courses taught in the secondary schools of these two southern states. (Author/RM)",

The overview discusses development and dissemination of curriculum materials, training provisions for faculty and students in higher education, cooperation with organizations having special interest in ethnic groups, and use of project results. The assessment task force determined that single-year grants do not allow adequate time for curriculum material development, dissemination programs must be permanent and comprehensive, goals for teacher training  should be better defined, and community ethnic group leaders should be involved in the training. Projects that most fully used community and local ethnic resources in materials development and training seem to be the most successful. The 39 individual project summaries give information on recipient of grant, name of project, ethnic focus, curriculum materials development, dissemination activities, training, ethnic involvement, use of outcomes and impact, and field testing.

The activities are organized into three major sections. Section one deals with stereotyping and helps students examine what they believe and why they believe it. In section two students examine how  culture affects our behavior and who we are. The third section contains activities designed to raise students' consciousness about discrimination and racism. The activities are self-contained and all handouts are included. The following are provided for each activity: an introduction, objectives, grade level, time needed, materials, teaching procedures, discussion questions, and evaluation techniques. (Author/RM)",

The materials are not a complete history of Colorado or a complete textbook; instead, teachers are provided with 14 teaching activities for use in elementary and secondary social studies or history classes. The book is divided into three sections. Section one contains a series of introductory activities on personalizing history and familiarizing students with their state and its history. Section two focuses exclusively on community and local history activities. The third section is designed to spur students' interests in the multicultural makeup of their state as well as to illustrate Colorado's interdependence with the rest of the world. Each activity is  presented with a short introduction, objectives, grade level, time required, materials needed, procedure to follow, and debriefing or follow-up suggestions. All necessary teacher instructions, handouts, and master sheets are included. An annotated bibliography about Colorado's history, the handouts, and an evaluation questionnaire conclude the book.

A map of Mexico and the American Southwest is included. The second unit is especially  designed for use in bilingual programs. Seven songs are on the tape in Spanish. The guide explains the historical background of folk songs; describes specific song types such as the romance, decima, and corrido; and provides song words in both Spanish and English. The songs include lullabies, Christmas carols, animal stories, and marching songs. Teachers are encouraged to involve parents and grandparents in the learning experience.

        "description":"A radio program about arts in American schools includes interviews with students, art teachers, parents, and heads of research panels. The commentators point out that many people think of art as something done by geniuses. The American attitude toward art must be changed, and children should be given the opportunity for creative expression in schools. David Rockefeller, Jr., was a member of The Arts, Education and Americans Panel which recently published a report on the status of art in the schools. He recommends that art be as basic to the curriculum as mathematics, writing, and history because the arts can be basic tools of learning. Inquiries to three State Art Directors about state spending on art programs revealed that only local school districts have accurate figures on art  budgets. Most are very low. Several interviews present exemplary programs. The Artists in the Schools Program, funded by the National Endowment for the Arts, places artists in specific schools so students can learn what an artist does and what his methods are. Architects, musicians, and poets are interviewed. Another program at the University of Massachusetts teaches children fundamental concepts of geometry through body movement, music, and large rubber bands. Concluding comments stress the need for art teachers to defend their discipline. (AV)",

In the present evaluation, questionnaires (mailed to the same individuals queried in the previous survey) solicited information on (1) on-going activities of Texas teacher centers affecting the SBTE project's goals; (2) extent of dissemination and diffusion of SBTE concepts and products; (3) their rate of dissemination  and diffusion; and (4) the state of networking among Texas teacher centers, especially with respect to the SBTE innovations. The data obtained serves to inform future decision-making by SBTE project staff and indicates to what extent the objective of involving teacher centers in an SBTE network are being met. The general conclusion is that the SBTE project has been so far successful in the development and use of diffusion strategies. (Authors/MJB)",

The studies were systematized into three broad categories: (a) satisfaction and morale; (b) effectiveness and productivity; and (c) leadership and supervision. The findings of the studies reviewed seemed to indicate that, with few exceptions, teachers seemed to favor participation in decision-making. Most of the investigations consisted of descriptive reports of the perceptions of faculty and other educational personnel. Part of the reason for this may be the difficulty at arriving at operational definitions for certain concepts, such as, participation, influence, climate, etc. Without operational definitions, these concepts become hard to measure. This review of the general  literature on teacher attitudes toward participation in decision-making may suggest some avenues and ideas for hard research. (Author/MJB)",

Traditional definitions of physical education have limited it to a profession of teaching in the traditional school system normal children ages six to eighteen. By expanding the concept to the study of &quot;human movement,&quot; one opens the way to realizing a much broader field of potentialities: the field of public fitness. This includes movement study in business and education; alternate careers in the military, in sport, and in rehabilitative medicine; preparation for extra-terrestrial, no-gravity environments and their opposite--the treatment of severely brain damaged children  who need to cope with gravity. Physical education as human movement also concerns a lifetime learning process. Present programs, mostly encompassing seventh to twelfth grades, are forced to play catch-up in teaching students things they should have learned in the first seven years of life. Adulthood is similarly ignored, as is human movement until death. And movement currently involved in work processes will increasingly become recreationally oriented, another ignored field. Preparations for alternate careers in human movement education involve curricular change, an example of which is the Oregon State University's &quot;Applied Fields Option,&quot; a graduate careers program in which individualized curricula in expanded human movement careers are developed by students and their advisors during  undergraduate years.

The basic change required of physical educators is an awakening to the possibility and necessity of educating groups other than the traditional seventh to twelfth grades. In addition, physical educators must begin to actualize the concept that physical education is as broad a field as mental education and to specialize in various aspects of the discipline. A listing of specializations would have to include the following: athletic training, sport broadcasting, commercial fitness, work skills analysis, sports administration, pre-therapy, sports medicine, tension control, infant development, and senior citizen rehabilitation.  For the profession to develop, physical educators must change their value system--must internalize the fact that physical education spreads over a broad spectrum of human activity and is not limited solely to the field of teaching.

        "description":"A followup study of high school students graduating in 1970 from Cleveland, St. Louis, Los Angeles, and Edmonton (Alberta) area schools, investigated protest activity involvement during high school and present political/social activities and concerns. Educational targets of student unrest at the time are indicated as being (1) curriculum relevance, (2) instructional methods, (3) student civil rights, (4) personal treatment, (5) societal civil rights, and (6) teacher indifference to social ills. Attitudes of various categories of students toward the educational process are discussed: the majority (who viewed school in a lackluster way), those who viewed it as a center for social activities, those who were intellectually motivated and college directed, and those who saw the school  system as an extension of political and social control. Common attitudes from all these groups were (1) school was a place to act and conform, (2) out-of-school activities were more relevant to social and political maturation, (3) curriculum was generally irrelevant and uninteresting, (4) the amount of student choice-making was minimal and generally related to the social status of the student, and (5) teachers were generally insensitive to the needs and feelings of students. Based on trends in the ensuing years of survey participants' lives, it is summarized that student activists of that time: (1) tend to be presently more politically active; (2) agree more with educators than the general public on the importance of emphasizing basic skills, career development, moral education, and  teacher inservice; and (3) value independence and personal motivation more than nonactivists.

The minor theses state that (1) the fate of most educational change is determined in the field and not by the appropriateness of the change to a learning theory or educational need; (2) the success of the change has little to do with the expertise of the planners; and (3) institutional and noninstructional influences rather than the worth of the change determine successful implementation on a broad basis. Institutional and educational influences that limit change are: (1) type of school; (2)  conflicts in teachers' roles; (3) problems in programs planned by experts for non-experts and average people who are teachers. Noninstitutional influences discussed are: (1) society's priorities in resource allocation; (2) decisions of political and appointive bodies; (3) city, county, and state planning decisions and real estate practices.

Papers deal with broad concepts of the subject, educational demands in changing societies, and nonformal education in developing countries. Curriculum innovations are the topic of the third section. New curriculum content is described, education for peace and achievement motivation are discussed, and a program for the clinical preparation of  teachers is examined. Educational technology is the subject in section four. Ways in which a more scientific approach to teacher education can be introduced and how they may be implemented are discussed in the papers presented in this section. Section five is devoted entirely to the subject of inservice education in Asia. Specific activities in eleven Asian countries are described.

Teachers were questioned on (1) feelings toward ISTE in general (relevance, definition, and organization); (2) roles of entities responsible for ISTE; (3) the definition of substance, with emphasis on professionalism, preferences for training objectives, and differences in experience; (4) incentives and convenience of training; (5) issues concerning the training process: who should be trained? When? Who should conduct the training? and Who should evaluate the training?; (6) how to develop connections between teacher needs and available programs; (7) the\"ownership\" of ISTE; (8) issues concerning mainstreaming, and (9) multi-ethnic/bilingual education; (10) emphasis on humanistic education; (11) alternatives to present fiscal support programs; (12) problems in ISTE organization and governance; and (13) problems in creating natural and planned variation experiments in inservice teacher education. Educators concerned with the formation of educational policy at the state and national level perceived many of the same problems with ISTE as did the classroom teachers. A comparison of the answers of teachers and educators on the ISTE question reveals a widespread frustration with the lack of efficacy of inservice teacher education programs which seems to be due to structural reasons. It was concluded that the first step in determining the future  of ISTE will be to solve the problem of organizing the various groups who have an interest in inservice teacher education into a single structure allowing for diversity but at the same time maintaining common goals and means for attaining them.

        "description":"As one of its institutional missions, the P.K. Yonge Laboratory School at the University of Florida focuses on the problem of utilization of research and development for the improvement of instruction. In an effort to reduce the time lag between the discovery of new information and the general adoption of practices based on that information, the School has developed a model for educational change which begins with problem identification and continues through classroom-based research to utilization of research results in the state public school system. Steps identified in this process are: (1) problem determination; (2) search of existing information for possible solutions; (3) formulation of a research project if no solutions already exist; (4) implementation of the project in  the Laboratory School; (5) field testing and modification of the project in selected public schools; (6) compilation, publication, and distribution of a report to the state school system; (7) receipt of feedback from educators; (8) drive-in conferences and workshops for school personnel interested in implementing the project; and (9) maintenance services (consultation, sharing sessions, etc.) for schools using the project products. Activities of the Yonge Laboratory School since 1970, when research and development for public education was made its main mission, illustrate the fact that it has a workable model for utilizing research and development processes to improve instructional programs.

The philosophy expressed in her narrative is that learning begins when children seek the answers to their own questions and that curriculum can be developed out of children's immediate environment. The teacher must become a diagnostician who observes the child, listens to the child, takes cues from the child, and then plans for the child's progress in learning. Field trips and exploration of the community and environment arouse interest and curiosity in children. From this beginning point, the teacher can build a flexible curriculum incorporating the basic skills of reading, writing, and mathematics into a learning experience that relates to the  world outside the classroom. The enthusiasm and interest of the teacher is of great importance to this method of teaching. The feeling of learning with the children rather than &quot;teaching&quot; them helps the teacher to grow as an individual and a professional. (JD)",

The educational process begins by specifying essential competencies for which the students are to be trained, then moves to selection of appropriate training methods, then to an evaluation of learner needs and progress. Competency-based education's dependence on the principles of modern systems management means a focus for all operations on the desired ends. It better assures a prospective employer that the job applicant is trained to perform adequately on the job, not simply have knowledge about it, before he is hired. (MJB)",

The Productive Language Assessment Tasks (PLAT) were designed to assess the impact of this program. This task-oriented instrument is suitable for measuring nontraditional objectives, and serves as an alternative to standardized tests. The PLAT was administered to second and third grade children enrolled in the Follow Through program in five different U.S. locations. A comparable non-Follow Through sample was located in four of the five sites, and given  the same test. Writing samples were produced as a result of the test, and reviewed for a number of variables. These include fluency; syntactic maturity; vocabulary diversity; descriptive quantity; diversity and scope; reporting quality; narrative organization; explanatory statements; and decodability. Results indicated that by the third grade, positive effects of the Follow Through program were evident. Reports and narratives written by Follow Through Children were more complex and more fluent than those written by non-Follow Through children. (GDC)",

The attitudes of government officials, educators, and researchers toward assessment and their own evaluation needs are discussed. Various approaches to evaluation are briefly described; the author emphasizes informal methods as opposed to standard psychometric measures. Instructions for estimating costs of an evaluation project are not provided, but suggestions for effective use of funds are included. Advice is given for evaluators in planning an evaluation study and negotiating an agreement with the monitoring officials. Hypothetical conversations between an official and a prospective evaluator are included as examples  that will help the reader start an evaluation properly. (GDC)",

One hundred and thirty-four senior officials in Ghana and Thailand provided 492 reports on: (1) indicators of participant achievements; (2) impact-producing characteristics; and (3) contributions attributed to participant training. An evaluation kit, or methodology, was field tested in Korea, the Philippines, and Brazil. Three hundred and sixty-four local officials reported 2,871 critical incidents. The data clearly showed that AID participants trained in the U.S. made significant contributions to the development of their countries, and that 58% of these contributions could be linked to some specifiable aspect of the participant training. The  author predicted that participants would continue to make beneficial contributions in areas such as agriculture, economic planning, health, and public administration. Follow-up studies that would provide useful policy guidance were suggested. (Author/GDC)",

Based on curriculum analysis and site visits PIPs were found to induce projects which were adequate copies of what was packaged; however, what was packaged was not sufficient to implement the same curriculum across sites. Particular emphasis was given to the statistical procedures used in comparing the extent to which the PIPs were implemented in the test sites and in determining gains on the Metropolitan Achievement Tests (MAT). The MAT and the associated norm-referenced analysis were closely examined. The assumption that PIPs, if fully implemented in appropriate school settings, would cause an increase in MAT  scores was found to be false. This relationship was also not detectable at all grade levels. Analysis revealed that teacher responsiveness, rather than PIP implementation, was more often associated with gains in test scores. Suggestions for future evaluation methods and the manual of procedures for PIP testing are included. (GDC)",

Reading scores for second and third graders have been improving since 1966, but the 1975-76 scores show little improvement over the 1974-75 scores. Results for sixth grade reveal that students improved in all four areas tested. The greatest improvement was in mathematics and the least in written expression. For the second year, grade six scores have improved after several years of decline. Students taking the twelfth grade test improved in all areas of the test. Greatest improvement was recorded in spelling; least in reading. 1975-76 was the first year of  improvement for students in grade 12 after 5 years of declining scores. Analyses of the specific test results and comparisons of the performance of California students to national averages are presented. Test scores are analyzed in terms of school characteristics and student background factors such as ethnicity, language, and socioeconomic status. (EVH)",

In order to study the instructional process it is essential to select or develop instruments that can describe a total event. Understanding the classroom process necessitates having a record of the environment, the materials, the interactions, and activities of the teacher and children. The first step in studying instructional process is to examine and specify the critical components of the classroom or the teaching program being studied. The next step is to identify or develop an observation instrument to record these critical components reliably. It is especially important to select appropriate statistical procedures since observation data often form  J-shaped curves that defy analysis using conventional parametric procedures. (MV)",

The French Cloze test was administered to students within five levels of French classes and the results were scored by four different raters. Three specific generalizability coefficients are discussed along with implications of imposing three additional restrictions on the method by which future data are collected. The results show a very high item and student by item variance component and little variance due to the rater component. For this study adequate generalizability of students' scores was obtained for all generalizability coefficients using half of the total number of items on the exam and only one rater. Results indicate that in future  decision studies involving tests of this nature each student should repond to the same set of items. Also, sufficient reliability may be obtained using only one rater per student but not all students need be rated by the same rater. (Author)",

Two matching instruments were constructed; each contained 72 items in 6 categories of skills. One assessed teachers' perceptions of their competence on behaviorally stated generic teaching skills, and the other assessed teachers' actual performance on the same skills. The items represented verbal information, concept identification, or problem-solving skills that teachers need to perform the skill objectives; and skills that could realistically be assessed using pencil and paper questions. One hundred seventy-five classroom teachers were paid to participate in the study. Results showed that teachers' perception scores were significantly higher than their  actual performance scores in all six content areas. Using teachers' perception scores to predict actual performance scores on teaching skills appeared to be an invalid practice; this finding held true for three different types of questions: recall of verbal information, concept identification, and problem-solving questions. It was also recommended that instructional needs of teacher education programs be determined by the teachers' actual performance rather than their perceived skills. (MV)",

It has been demonstrated that the Dade County Systems approaches are viable alternatives to non-systems approaches to reading and/or mathematics instruction. Results of the study of second and third year participation in Dade's Systems programs provide clear evidence that: (1) participants performed better the longer they were in the programs, and (2) after a second year in the program the percentages of communication and mathematics skill items answered correctly on the Florida State Assessment Test was higher than the percentages achieved by non-systems pupils. This held true for all categories  of objectives and the total as well. Participants of the High Intensity Reading Program, on the other hand, have for the second year, demonstrated negative results in reading comprehension and communication skills tests. Consequently, Dade Systems programs are recognized as a more beneficial mode for delivering basic skills instruction than non-systems programs and are unequivocally recommended as appropriate diagnostic/prescriptive programs into which to phase non-systems pupils.

Using generalizability theory as the statistical basis for data analysis, the number of measurement occasions required to reach the 0.7 level of generalizability for five clusters of classroom interaction variables were identified.

This research was an investigation of construct validity for attitude toward mathematics. The Mathematics Attitude Scale developed by Aiken and Dreger (1961) was administered to 148 tenth graders. A principal components factor analysis of the scores revealed two factors: (1) enjoyment and (2) fear or anxiety that together accounted for 64 percent of the total variance. Thus, attitude toward mathematics appears to be a two-dimensional phenomenon that mathematics teachers and teacher educators might address with specific strategies. The 20-item scale and factor structure coefficients for each item are included. (Author/GDC)",

The review is organized in four sections. The Overview is a presentation and discussion of research dealing with the philosophy of science education, its goals, objectives and priorities, and research related to the status of the science education research enterprise. The second part, Ex Post Facto and Survey Research, includes studies which attempt to explain a phenomenon that had already occurred and surveys about the characteristics of students, teachers, or others. The third part, Experimental Research, focuses on those studies reported in 1977 which evaluated the effect of some variable, such as a specific  curriculum or method of teaching, on students or teachers. And the fourth part links the major findings in 1977 with trends and issues of the past five years of research in science education. (Author/BB)",

The 1979 federal budget presented in January 1978  reflected greater austerity in regard to R&D programs than did the three previous ones in which overall R&D growth exceeded inflation each year. R&D programs emphasized were those that met direct federal needs, general social and economic needs, or the need to accelerate private R&D efforts because of overriding national interest. (BB)",

        "description":"This technical summary describes the changes in science performance on exercises included in both the first and second science assessments and on exercises included in both the second and third science assessments conducted by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). Using the same exercises for adjacent assessments, with some exercises common to all three, National Assessment was able to measure improvements and declines in achievement between 1969-70 and 1976-77. Each assessment utilized a deeply stratified, multistage probability sample design and a professional data collection staff. To the extent possible, administration conditions were kept constant across assessments. The document contains a brief introduction and four chapters: chapter 1 contains background  information about the project, chapter 2 presents national results by age levels (9 years, 13 years, 17 years), chapter 3 reports group results for 9-, 13- and 17-year olds, and chapter 4 contains a discussion of the adult science assessments. Four appendices are included: (1) A-Technical Procedures: Sampling and Estimation of Standard Errors; (2) B-Estimated Population Proportions of Reporting Groups Based on National Assessment Samples, 1969-70, 1972-73, and 1975-76; (3) C-Changes in Procedures Between Assessments; and (4) D-Nonresponse in Assessment Samples.

Learner outcomes are formulated according to knowledge, skills, and attitudes gained. Knowledge of institutions and of major issues past and present is necessary. Inquiry, interpersonal, and action skills as well as attitudes of commitment and respect should be developed.

        "description":"Classroom teachers need to make sound judgments and decisions concerning curricular and instructional issues. The teachers who wish to become more effective in the classroom should learn to develop their own research designs since educational research reported in journals is often inconclusive, conflicting, or not relevant to the classroom teachers. Experimental studies can be particularly helpful to teachers if they investigate the effects of variables such as textbooks, tests, and homework assignments on one or more other variables such as student knowledge, student attitudes, and length of time required to complete a test or homework assignment. Factors to be considered when designing an experimental study include experimental validity (comparing and contrasting results with  results from a control group or situation), internal validity (extent to which the observed effect appears to be due to one's experimentation), and external validity (determination of persons and circumstances to which the results apply). The conclusion is that teachers can do valid classroom research if they combine simple descriptive statistics with common sense and exercise care in maintaining experimental validity when they gather information.

Section I, &quot;Origin and Early Years, 1904-1920,&quot; explains that NCEA developed from the uniting of three separate Catholic educational organizations. Thomas J. Conaty, NCEA's first chief executive officer, established three small organizations to promote uniform standards of education at existing Catholic institutions of higher and secondary education. Section II, &quot;Dimensions of Ministry, 1920-1944,&quot; explains how NCEA moved from an emphasis on preserving traditional scholastic liberal arts education to a cautious embracing of the more scientific progressive approach. This change was most apparent at the elementary level. Section III, &quot;The Hochwalt Years,  1944-1966,&quot; reviews growth in NCEA under the direction of Frederick G. Hochwalt. During this time NCEA became a strong, active organization with membership from almost every Catholic educational institution in the United States. NCEA staff, membership, and income increased, and programs of research, membership services, and legislative involvement were initiated. Section IV, &quot;The Post Vatican Era, 1966-1978,&quot; notes changes in NCEA membership, activities, and internal management. There is now an emphasis on cooperation with other private educational associations, compilation of national data needed for educational planning, and encouragement of parental involvement in educational decision-making.

Intended for use by policymakers, administrators, curriculum specialists, and consumer educators, the manual defines consumer education as including consumer decision-making, economics, personal finance, and consumers' rights and responsibilities. Section I provides a comparative overview of each state's policy. Presented in chart format, the data include whether the state has a policy; year of adoption; who developed the policy (i.e., legislature, state board of education); type of policy; specific requirements at state, local, and student levels; instructional format  required; and program content required. Section II presents each state's policy. Information is given on source and adoption of each policy, exact wording of the policy as furnished by each state to ECS, and comments about related activities that go beyond the specifications of the existing policy. In section III state-level policies and programs have been combined to provide an analysis of each state education agency's activities. For each state, tabular data indicate program content areas, types of students who receive instruction, program structure, availability of performance studies, and relationship of the consumer education program to existing basic competencies programs. Section IV lists resource materials and personnel for consumer education in each state. (AV)",

Possible activities include collecting oral histories, community mapping, charting urban growth, measuring community social mobility, using community archives, and researching local history. Such activities would enable  students to meet the objectives formulated by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) for social studies as they (1) evidence interest in their communities; (2) obtain information from other people, libraries, maps, and pictures; and (3) understand some of the services and institutions in their communities.

        "author":["Erlanger, Steven J."],
        "description":"This monograph focuses on the working class in Boston during 1775, the period just before the American Revolution. Seven sections describe Boston's geographical and political background; working conditions, employment, and controls; income by industry and occupation; standards of living; social life; mobility and the situation of minorities; and the role of the Boston worker in the Revolution. Boston of 1775 is described as a city of 16,000 with strong political tensions, little money, and many poor. England had retaliated for the Boston Tea Party by closing the Port of Boston and issuing the \"Intolerable Acts.\" The faltering economy, brought about by a trade deficit with England, caused the apprenticeship system to deteriorate. By the eve of the Revolution, the unemployed and  propertyless had increased enormously; the richest 25% held 78% of the assessed wealth. In general, laborers were badly paid; artisans and farmers earned somewhat more and became small property owners; professional men and shopkeepers had good incomes and merchants and lawyers were well-to-do. Debt was a recurrent problem and many debtors were sent to jail. The legal system provided a kind of equality for women who were seen as more versatile, active, and successful than their European counterparts. Finally, the Boston workers comprised the \"ragtag army\" which hounded the British in the early days of undeclared war, and benefited from the change that revolution produced. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"This paper describes a study to determine whether students can, with appropriate instructional materials, develop and apply a knowledge of art concepts. An opening section reviews research on concept acquisition. This study utilized a concept acquisition model developed in 1970 by R. Gagne. Gagne's model proposed that concepts are learned through a hierarchy of processes including verbal information and problem solving. For the study, curriculum materials were developed based on art concepts of drawing, form, space, composition, line, and proportion. Subjects were 70 seventh and eighth graders from two schools in Mississippi. The students were divided into four classes: the two control classes received normal art instruction and the two experimental classes received instruction  supplemented with occasional classwork and discussion based on the specially-developed curriculum materials. A posttest for all four classes required students to write critiques of a drawing and a painting. The critiques were analyzed for correct use of concept terms, number of value terms (\"good,\"\"bad\"), and length. Results indicated that students in both experimental groups used concept terms more frequently and more correctly, and they wrote longer critiques. (AV)",

Eighteen discussion groups focused on Constitutional  rights and identified problems related to the exercise of these rights. Rights identified as fundamental included fair and speedy trial, equal justice under law, freedom of speech, and the right to dissent. Civic responsibilities identified as attendant to these rights included voting, obeying duly enacted laws, paying taxes, supporting the armed forces, opposing subversive persons and organizations, and putting public interest ahead of private advancement. Suggestions for increasing constructive citizenship action included increasing civic participation, improving citizenship education in schools, reducing discrimination, increasing neighborliness, and reducing civic apathy.

Fourteen undergraduate students who had completed student teaching were interviewed. Results indicated that students were confused about the nature of the field. The data showed the continuing domination of the field by history--most students majored in history, taught it during student teaching, and perceived it as the subject most likely to be taught and of primary importance in social studies. Respondents did not seem sure of their answers concerning social studies definition, purpose, and content. Some held the primary purpose to be indoctrination, the content to be history, and the definition to include social sciences, issues, and human interaction. Others  considered the purpose to inspire critical thinking, the content to be history, and the definition to be humans and the environment. No respondents indicated social action, social criticism, or personal development as purpose, content, or definition. In addition, respondents did not indicate familiarity with the literature in the field. The study raises a number of questions concerning teacher education, curriculum, teaching decisions, and the long term effect of this confusion on teaching. (Author/KC)",

Monthly variations in use of the sick room, utilization by grade level, consistency of usage, complaints presented, and absenteeism were the main foci of data analysis. Results indicated that elementary students use the school sick room in a manner comparable to the way adults use the physician's office and clinic. Females make more visits than males. There is good evidence that many visits are unnecessary. Implications point to a need in health education to address the problem of improper use of health care systems. (DS)",

To achieve this goal, an initial course is offered called the \"Teacher as Learner.\" The objective of this course is to help the individual assess personal strengths and weaknesses and to expand professional horizons. The second segment of the program involves practicum experience. A flexible program structure provides for individual choice of work.

Six value systems for both teachers and students are identified: (1) tradition oriented; (2) individualistic; (3) structured; (4) scientific; (5) group oriented; and (6) meaning oriented. Instructors participating in this research project were given questionnaires for themselves and their students designed to clarify individual learning and teaching styles and preferences. Upon completion of the questionnaires, norms for the student population and the faculty were generated. Results of these findings are presented in tabular form, and several case studies are presented to  exemplify difficulties caused by poor matching between teaching styles and learning styles. It is suggested that the use of value level plus cognitive style would produce an instrument that would identify appropriate teaching methodology and study skills for each value level. (JD)",

Teachers, reacting to a tighter job market in their profession, feel that specializing in certain areas--remedial reading or dealing with the handicapped for example--will get them jobs in governmentally funded programs. Also, specialization enhances professional status and personal sense of power. Many schools currently use differentiated staffs with specialists occupying a dominant role. The drive for mainstreaming has increased this tendency. The dangers implicit in this situation are discussed, not only from the point of view that tension is created between specialists and regular teachers, but that generalist education may be endangered from this  trend.

The concept of a method factor in the test is also considered as a part of the validity. The possible effect of scoring for partial knowledge on such hypothetical tests is considered together with the logic of these hypotheses. The application of latent trait theory to a mathematical model is used to provide estimates of the expected gain in information as a function of the increase in inter-item correlations. Finally, these concepts are combined with the concepts of tailored testing. Two aspects of tailored testing are considered,  tailoring test length and tailoring test difficulty. The possibilities of adapting tailored testing to non-dichotomous item scoring are considered in order to adapt tailored testing to the use of partial knowledge in the test score. (CTM)",

        "description":"Using estimates of item ease and item discrimination, procedures are provided for computing estimates of the reliability and percentage of failing scores for tests assembled from these items. Two assumptions are made: that the average item coefficient will be approximately equal to the average of the estimated coefficients and that the score distribution for the test will be approximately normal. The predicted mean test score is equal to the sum of item ease coefficients, and the predicted variance is equal to the square of the sum of item discrimination indices divided by 4.5. The fail point is always sixty percent of the number of items. Normal curve tables are used to estimate the percent of score below the fail point. A normal curve probability table is provided, as is a  computer program in BASIC for using this method. The results of using this procedure with seventeen tests are presented and compared with the obtained score distribution statistics for samples of either 51 cases or 201 cases. Kuder-Richardson formula 21 reliability coefficients may also be obtained from this procedure. (CTM)",

The four groups of predictor variables that were investigated were background, mental ability, parental involvement, and school program. Commonality analysis uses multiple regression procedures to partition the variance among the four groups. The criterion scores were vocabulary and comprehension scores from the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test post-tests. Pre-test scores were included in the mental ability group of predictors. The results indicate the proportion of explained variance unique to each set of predictor variables plus the proportion common to the eleven combinations of  sets. The interpretation and the advantages of commonality analysis, as well as the interpretation of negative commonalities were discussed. The technique of commonality analysis was judged to have several advantages over more traditional types of analysis. (Author/CTM)",

Hypotheses regarding the standardized growth expectation (SGE) are also presented; SGE refers to the amount of growth (expressed in standard deviation form) that a student must demonstrate over the treatment interval to maintain standing in the norm group. SGE may also be conceptualized as the difference between the pretest percentile and the posttest percentile.  Hypotheses are presented regarding the decrease in SGE which accompanies grade increases, and the variation in SGE according to the achievement test used. Further research topics investigating the validity of the SGE phenomenon are suggested. (Author/GDC)",

Test forms (MC and TF) were randomly administered to 50 undergraduates, to investigate the validity and internal consistency reliability of the two forms. A Kuder-Richardson formula 20 reliability was computed for each form. Reliability of the MC form was then adjusted with the Spearman-Brown formula to equate testing time, since the MC form took three-fourths as much time to complete as the TF form. Adjusted reliability coefficients of the TF and MC forms were .80 and .73, respectively. To compare validity, a Pearson product moment correlation was computed between test score and grade point average; validity coefficients were .49  (TF) and .52 (MC). Results support the use of TF teacher made tests as alternatives to MC tests with no loss in reliability or validity. However, as previous studies have shown, these results are not obtained when MC items are revised and the range of the TF form is restricted. (CP)",

The majority of Title I students achieved below the national norms for reading and mathematics at all grade levels except first, and fell progressively behind through the fifth grade. Needs were identified in the areas of reading and mathematics achievement and attendance. Coordination of Title I  activities with other compensatory programs was minimal. The program's use of school staff and parents did not produce improved achievement. No answer was available about the best grade level for delivery of Title I services. The methods for identifying Title I schools and students were successful in locating schools with the lowest average achievement, and students within those schools with the lowest achievement levels.

The School and We Questionnaire (SAW) and a Swedish translation of the High School Personality Questionnaire were completed by 1,319 students. Secondary data analysis was conducted at two levels of aggregation: pupils within classes, and differences between classes. The same factors were found at both levels: (1) attitude toward school and schoolwork; (2) attitude toward teacher; (3) relations with classmates; (4) social relations in the entire class; and (5) class behavior or discipline. At the two levels of data analysis, these factors accounted for different amounts of variance. At the class level,  factors reflecting attitudes toward teacher and characteristics of the entire class were strong; while at the individual level, factors reflecting school attitudes and the individual's relations with classmates were strong. Impulsivity accounted for the most variance in SAW scores. Within a class, impulsivity was negatively correlated with attitudes toward school and teacher. Between-class analysis indicated a high negative correlation between impulsivity and class discipline. Introversion was negatively correlated with peer relations, while stability was positively correlated. (Author/GDC)",

A study reported by M.J. Behr is reanalyzed. This study investigated relations between verbal and figural aptitude variables and outcome variables within one verbal and one figural treatment, teaching modulus seven arithmetic to prospective elementary teachers. The relations between latent aptitude variables and latent outcome variables are studied in four LISREL models with either one or two latent aptitude variables (interpretable as a general factor and verbal and figural ability, respectively), and with two sets  of latent outcome variables (interpretable as learning/retention and computation speed/understanding). No significant interaction is found, but tendencies towards interaction are noted. It is concluded that LISREL has several advantages in the analysis of ATI studies, but also that the power of the test of ATI effects is low, particularly when there is a high correlation between the latent aptitude variables.

Proximity of the other dolls to the one representing the  student was the dependent variable. Positive attitude change was indicated when the proximity of the dolls increased from pretest to post test.

This instrument was administered to approximately 10,000 military personnel in a variety of research designs to determine the impact of race relations training programs on attitudes and perceptions. This training included 18-hour unit training programs, 4-hour courses in formal schools, and 2- to 4-week race relations discussion leader courses. Training impact, in general, was found to be very small as measured by change on RAPS scale scores. Where changes occurred, they tended to be in the following directions: higher scores, for perceived discrimination against blacks and attitude  toward racial interaction, and lower scores for feelings of reverse racism. No conclusions were made regarding perception of racial climate. Trained subjects scored higher on content-type questions than did untrained subjects, and training was generally considered valuable. Course instructors appeared to have diverse instructional goals. A significant testing effect was noted when untrained control group subjects were administered the test twice; scores declined on the post test. The RAPS was found to be useful in evaluating race relations programs, but should be used along with other evaluation methods. (Author/CP)",

It was applied within the simulated context of performance testing of military trainees. These parameters included: (1) the number of assumed mastery states--master, nonmaster, and perhaps intermediate (likely to soon achieve mastery); (2) the prior distribution of scores from similar examinee groups; and (3) the number of test trials or items administered. The results of several simulations showed that the degree of confidence that a decisionmaker can have about the testee's mastery is markedly affected by the values for the three parameters, and the effects of their combination.  Using the Bayesian model, test length and costs could be reduced--as long as the prior information was accurate and valid for the particular group of examinees. Results of the simulation also showed that a test may be too short to be of decision-making value. (Author/GDC)",

        "description":"The Racial Attitudes and Perceptions Survey (RAPS) was developed to obtain information from black and white military personnel, including reports of the frequencies of specific discriminatory behaviors and the tension levels associated with each race. The instrument was evaluated in terms of its construct validity and its reliability. Attitudes and perceptions were measured in four areas: (1) perceptions of discrimination against blacks; (2) attitude toward racial interaction; (3) feelings of reverse racism; and (4) racial climate. Evidence indicated the instrument was valid, and reliability estimates were satisfactory. Analysis across demographic variables indicated that several variables were related to RAPS results, with race being the most important. Results indicated that  blacks perceived more racial discrimination than whites: both blacks and whites favored racial interactions: and more whites than blacks felt the racial climate in the military was favorable. Several recommendations are made regarding the use of the RAPS at the local and command levels. The test itself is appended. (Author/CP)",

        "description":"Sex restrictiveness and sex bias in occupational interest scales are reviewed, and some alternative solutions are briefly discussed. Traditionally, it was thought that sex restrictive interest inventories merely reflected the inherent differences between males and females. The author defines sex restrictiveness according to the degree that the distribution of career options suggested to males and females is disproportionate. Conversely, an inventory is not sex restrictive if each career option is suggested to similar proportions of males and females. The sex restrictive test is not necessarily biased, however, since it may have to be restrictive in order to be valid. Different definitions of validity may affect this judgment. A sex restrictive test may still be defined as sex  fair if its publisher has demonstrated that its restrictiveness is necessary for its validity. A brief review of various studies about the interest of college bound and college students indicates that vocational interest inventories do not have to be sex restrictive in order to be valid. Study of the unisex edition of the American College Test interest scale (UNIACT) indicates that sex balanced reporting procedures, suggesting similar interest patterns for males and females, have promising validity.

Mathematics retention tests matching the instructional objectives of both schools were constructed to measure the understanding of arithmetic concepts and the ability to perform computations and algorithmic operations. Inter-school comparisons were made with respect to the types of errors made: computational, algorithmic, and omission. Fifth grade students in one school made significantly fewer computational errors than in the other school. In the remaining grades, there were no significant differences. Additional practice exercises were recommended to correct this error. Other students made  significantly more algorithmic errors and a four-step approach to teaching algorithms was outlined to alleviate this weakness. Significant inter-school differences in omissions errors were noted in grades 5 and 6--the students concerned would also benefit by a more systematic approach to algorithm teaching. In sum, the error classification scheme can be used to evaluate instructional programs and to suggest instructional improvements. (CP)",

Site visits raised several issue statements. First, what was the effect of staffing--specifically, the use of outside consultants, and the method of selecting evaluators? Second, did institutional tradition, campus governance, and state coordination alter the evaluation? Third, were the effects of formal evaluation structures, (checklists, protocols, schedules, task forces) a healthy boost to either institutions or to subsequent evaluations?  Fourth, was there an advantage to linking program evaluation systems to budget systems? An assessment of these issues led to the conclusion that formal systems in higher education were new and significant modifications of more traditional program review activities such as accreditation, national ratings, institutional research, and institutional self-study.

It is seldom necessary, however, to move more than one grade down.

The ceiling of most tests becomes a handicap when three-quarters of a group can answer the most difficult items correctly. In this case, the mean is substantially lower than the median and a more difficult test should have been chosen. In general, the level of a test is suitable when the raw score of the group is equal to or above a third of the maximum  score, and somewhat less than three-quarters of the maximum. In norm-referenced evaluations out-of-level testing is possible with most standardized achievement tests because they provide tables for relating raw scores on out-of-level tests to in-level percentile norms.

The current state of the art, recommendations for use of the model, further needs, and controversies are described for the three stages of test construction: (1) definition of the content of the test and item writing; (2) item analysis; and (3) test calibration. The Rasch model is defined as specifying that the probability of a person's correctly answering a test item is a function of two parameters: the person's ability and the item's difficulty. Calibration refers to the process of estimating the two sets of parameters, and evaluating the fit of these data to the model. The Rasch model has been found to work for achievement tests, both criterion- and norm-referenced, as well as other  types of tests. The model helps to identify poor test items, but does not help to write better items. Mean square fit statistics are recommended for item analysis. Questions are raised regarding unidimensionality, the robustness of the model, sample size issues, and the definitions of sample-free and item-free. The authors conclude that test developers can feel comfortable, albeit cautious, in using the Rasch model. (Author/GDC)",

For more than three centuries, American society and its institutions have segregated and excluded minority groups, especially blacks, on the basis of racial features. In 1947, Clark and Clark tested the effect of racial identification on self-concept by interviewing 253 black nursery and primary school children in the segregated south and the integrated north. As part of the study, children were asked to choose either a white or a black doll. Most of the children, even as early as 3 years old, preferred the white doll. Numerous subsequent studies conducted with more refinements and greater controls found the same positive attitude  toward light skinned dolls. However, these studies tell us very little about how black children feel about themselves in various situations. Only when the research begins to examine the total environment of black children can we begin to understand how they adapt to living in a racist society. (Author/WI)",

        "description":"The culturally different child has traditionally been characterized as belonging both to a low socioeconomic status and to a racial minority group. The culturally different child is also characterized by a poor self concept and a slower rate of learning. These characterizations can be traced to the differences in environment that the child experiences at home, and the typical middle class oriented school environment. In order to rectify this situation, an organized, well-defined approach to behavior change must be undertaken. Teachers must be able to understand and work with related traits specific to each child classified as culturally different and must give consideration to the child's relationship to the curriculum. Goals that teachers establish must also be realistic.  Strategies which seem most successful with the culturally different include a language experience approach to teaching the total language arts, peer tutoring, real life experiences such as field trips, and films.

Major attention is directed toward &quot;second order effects,&quot; particularly in relation to family composition, and potential female labor force participation. With respect to female labor force participation, major factors considered are: (1) the position of the female labor market, which continues to be secondary to that of males; (2) present views of mother labor force participation; and (3) the effects of varying full employment definitions on expectations for women. Additional discussion is directed toward the potential impact of  these &quot;second order effects&quot; on the originally prescribed policy goals and objectives. (Author/EB)",

        "description":"Twenty children, one boy and one girl in each of ten second grade classrooms from four different experimental programs, were each observed over the course of a single school day. Each 30 second interval of approximately 80 hours of transcribed behavior stream observation was analyzed to determine whether the teacher, the learner, or the teacher and learner jointly controlled selected aspects of the activity, and to determine the learner's main or alternative task orientation. Relatively consistently controlled settings were observed for more time than inconsistently controlled settings in enrichment subject activity, but not in basic subject activity. Successively more inconsistent combinations of controls were associated with successively lower percentages of main task  orientation in basic activity, but not in enrichment activity. Analysis of the discrepant cases shows that consistency of control between pacing and feedback from materials and/or peers was associated with relatively high engagement for both basic and enrichment activity. The research is linked to other research which has examined on-task behavior as both an index of the efficiency of an educational setting and a predictor of achievement in the setting. (Author)",

        "description":"Anthropologists studying children in their own society may tend to assume that children and adults speak the same language and have shared knowledge; children's values reflect what they learn at home, their school experience is much like the anthropologist's school experience, and school is primarily a place where knowledge is passed from teacher to student; desegregation is working if there is no reported incidents of violence, multicultural training is provided, and desegregation is begun with young children; and schools can solve social problems. A year long study of children's social relations and communication in a desegregated urban \"magnet school\" challenges these four assumptions. Data indicate that children's play, body language and trust in adults influence schooling;  the contingencies of a new era of youth and black assertiveness must be recognized; and successful desegregation requires more than a public record of nonviolence, multicultural education training, and interracial mixing in the early grades. Anthropologists must understand that children's perceptions and experiences of what it is like to be a student may present a reality that mocks adult ideals and the policies meant to realize them.

It should be the priority for each State legislature, State Board of Education, and chief State school officer to consider what methods can be employed to meet equal opportunity/ desegregation standards, to devise and implement strategies to overcome deficiencies, and, thereby, to assure the educational rights of all students. The State Education Agency (SEA) is in a position to define desegregation, to include educational outcomes expected, and to adopt programs to effectively implement its goals and objectives. The SEA must also, by policy and example, set standards for affirmative action programs in employment for local school districts. In addition, the historical reasons for the limited role of the States in  desegregation have become less and less valid, and a new State/Federal partnership is a pressing need. States must demonstrate the ability to coordinate and implement desegregation and equal opportunity as well as the commitment to doing so. The Federal government should in turn permit States which demonstrate both ability and commitment the opportunity to enforce Federal desegregation programs within those States. (Author/EB)",

Particular attention is given to the fact that, while many rural schools have been successfully desegregated in the past decade, the majority of blacks and Hispanics who live in large cities remain in racially isolated schools. Causes and feasibility of metropolitan school desegregation are discussed. Findings indicate that excessive busing and loss of local control are not necessarily indicated by desegregation plans. Benefits of desegregation are identified as socioeconomic integration, neighborhood stability, increased learning opportunities, and balanced class size. Alternatives to urban school desegregation are listed and Federal Court rulings are discussed. Implementation methods for various  metropolitan desegregation plans are examined and the role of the State in implementation is discussed at length. Recommendations include: (1) creation of a metropolitan-wide school district; (2) consolidation and reorganization of school districts; (3) inter-district student transfers; and (4) shared services.

Possible circumstances contributing to the use of excessive force on the part of police officers and guidelines governing the officers' use of force are discussed. State laws limiting a police officer's use of deadly force to arrest a felony suspect are described. It is pointed out that these laws are not uniform and that the decision to use force is often left to the officer. It is also pointed out that there is a definite trend  emerging that indicates local police departments are voluntarily imposing more stringent limitations on their officers than are required by State laws.

Black and non-Hispanic white laborers and service workers are more segregated from one another than are their racial counterparts in other occupational categories, once the relative supply of black workers in each occupation is accounted for. Black and white women at each occupational level are more segregated from one another than are black and white men, although differential employment in high and low segregation industries accounts for much of the sex differences. The racial composition of an establishment's work force in one occupation is strongly related to its racial composition in  other occupations, especially within the blue collar and white collar subgroups. For certain occupational categories--namely professionals, sales workers, and clerical workers--the black proportion of the work force is higher the more the total establishment's employment is concentrated in that occupation.

Based on samples of over 3,000 trainees during fiscal year 1976, it was found that job placement and retention (approximately one-third kept their jobs after six months) were low, while the cost per placement was high, ranging from $1,500 to $15,100. While factors such as the participants' capabilities and motivation affected the success of the training programs, it appeared that the programs needed substantial improvement. The following shortcomings were found to exist: (1) program sponsors did not adequately assess applicants  before career planning; (2) counseling services were not provided; (3) dropouts occurred because of lack of motivation or transportation; (4) training was offered for occupations that had low demand in the job market; (5) trainees did not attain skill levels required for employment; and (6) participants were placed in jobs that were not related to their training, were seasonal, had a high turnover, or paid little more than minimum wage. It was also recommended that program management be improved, that performance standards be developed, that more comprehensive and accurate management information systems be devised, and that more adequate monitoring and evaluation be conducted.

Section 2 and appendix A summarize the research studies and results that are the foundation of the training. Section 3 explains the workshop objectives, gives a schedule of the several units that make up the workshop, and  tells what is expected of the workshop participant.

First, a framework for the plan is given, covering the aims of the fiscal 1978 and 1979 activities which stress research, evaluation, and demonstration projects. In the next section, which provides a progress report on the knowledge development efforts for fiscal 1978, the following programs are highlighted: (1) the Entitlement Program, (2) Community Improvement Discretionary Projects, (3) Youth Employment and Training Programs Discretionary Projects, (4) the Summer Program for Economically Disadvantaged Youth (SPEDY), and (5) the Job Corps. The  section devoted to fiscal 1979 provides a plan for continuing the programs from 1978 and trying to fill gaps, establish better coordination of the programs, and focus on priority knowledge development areas. In recognition of the formidable array of projects being conducted in fiscal 1979, the next section assesses the feasibility and outlines the implementation strategy for each project. The final section explores the knowledge development payoff on sixteen issues--i.e., what will be learned and when. A time schedule is established for information that will be available at three different dates. (ELG)",

These competencies cover the following areas: attitudes toward life and careers; job search method and job adjustment; community resources; parent involvement; relationship of language and science areas to careers; communication skills; and career choices in relation to abilities and interest. A curriculum team of educators developed, field tested, and finalized a set of instructional material packages (CE 019 666-672) based on the seven career education competencies. An instructional team trained twenty-five secondary language arts and science teachers  to function as a statewide cadre to conduct inservice training sessions for interested local education agencies. Evaluation was built into each major stage of the project. The final stage, involving the actual cadre training sessions, was assessed by a third-party evaluator.

        "description":"A study was conducted on the factors which influence young women to marry or have their first child at a given age. The data used were taken from the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Women conducted by the Center for Human Resource Research at Ohio State University, during which a sample of 5,159 young women aged 14 to 24 in 1968 were interviewed yearly between 1968 and 1973. It was found that taste for market work, school enrollment, and mother's education all decrease the likelihood of a first marriage or birth at a given age. Young women in the South and those in rural areas are likely to marry and have their first child earlier than those in other regions or in urban areas. Black women are less likely to marry at almost any age than are white. The analysis showed that  while in early adulthood current employment status has a small positive impact on the likelihood of a first marriage or birth at most ages, those variables which indicate a preference or preparation for future employment cause postponement of family formation. The analysis also provided evidence that the current trends in timing of family formation, women's educational attainment, and labor force participation are linked to a rise in general level of preference for market work among young women.

Generally, the papers deal with influences upon the possible demand for lifelong learning in the future. In the first paper K. Patricia Cross synthesizes findings from thirty-one state and national studies concerning the patterns of participation and interests of adults in further education. She examines participation rates by subgroups and by certain demographic variables: age, race, sex, educational attainment, and region. Obstacles (situational, dispositional, and institutional barriers) to participation in organized learning activities are also discussed. In the second paper Kjell Rubenson explores participation in recurrent education (education following basic education completion  or discontinuation) and the problems of the undereducated and underprivileged. He provides a paradigm of recurrent education recruitment and presents findings about motives for and impediments to recurrent education participation. Also, he points out the influences of self-evaluation and the value of member and reference groups. In closing, Rubenson discusses program possibilities in terms of curriculum, information, and finance. In the final paper James Broschart presents a conference review. He emphasizes two important areas of concern addressed at the conference: assessing learning needs and designing research to assess learning needs. In addition, he identifies various emerging lifelong learning issues. (CSS)",

        "description":"To study internal psychological barriers to women's equity in formerly male education and occupational domains, Matthew's scale of attitudes toward women's roles in society was administered to 294 male and 261 female graduate students pursuing degrees in one of six professional areas, three male-dominated and three traditionally female-dominated. In measuring attitudes toward women's societal role, it was found tht men and women differed in perceptions of appropriate women's roles, perceptions of general male attitudes toward women's roles, interest in child care, support for early socialization of girls as homemakers, and views that parents prefer daughters' early marriages. Men were consistently closer to the traditional, stereotypical position on these scales than women, with  one exception--women expressed greater liking for children and the traditionally feminine child care role. Sex differences followed consistent patterns across career groups, and professionals, regardless of gender, differed in attitudes according to their career pursuit. Some attitude differences among career groups did parallel divisions by gender dominance. For example, law, business, and medicine groups expressed lower interest in child care than did those in traditionally feminine professions--social work, education, and nursing. (Author/CSS)",

The rationale for the program is presented through a brief social learning analysis of the effects of long-standing periodic lack of control of one's behavior, (that is, having seizures). The procedures taught in the program's social skills classes, derived from clinical behavior therapy and established self-control and stress-management techniques, are described in detail. Also presented is a description of the development of three skills-training classes. A framework for evaluating the effects of the classes is included, as well as a discussion of several issues  relevant to developing a skills training program within a medical setting. (Author)",

Experiences with training clinical psychologists to consult with pediatricians are reviewed. Disparate training backgrounds and problematic models of collaboration are seen as barriers to learning effective consultation. To meet these potential obstacles, training approaches should stress observation of staff interaction, participation in viable consultation structures and intensive clinical training. With optimal supervision, psychologists at a variety of levels can be trained to consult successfully with pediatricians.  (Author/BN)",

Results indicate that: (1) when social pressure is low, behavior is a smooth, monotonic function of disposition; (2) when social pressure is high and disposition is low, behavior is low; and (3) when social pressure is high and disposition is high, relevant behavior will be bimodal with some people engaging in low levels of behavior and some engaging in high levels of behavior. In dynamic terms, shifts in dispositions at high levels of social pressure result in discontinuous i.e. &quot;catastrophic&quot; changes in behavior, and increments in  social pressure at high levels of disposition result in divergence, i.e. bimodality.

Female college students worked on an art activity either with or without the expectation of external evaluation. In addition, subjects were asked to focus upon either the creative or the technical aspects of the activity, or they were given no specific focus. Finally, some subjects expecting evaluation were given explicit instructions on how to make their artworks. As predicted, subjects in the evaluation groups produced artworks significantly lower on judged creativity than did subjects in the nonevaluation control groups. The only evaluation group for which this pattern was reversed had received explicit instructions on how to make  artworks that would be judged creative.

After presenting some negative illustrations of current conditions at local levels, it generalizes broadly about how they represent the instability of counseling services for nonwhite youth. The guide offers some suggestions for counseling various groups of nonwhite students, and then describes specific programs found at elementary, high school, and postsecondary levels, and in community agencies, that are designed to respond to nonwhite student needs.  The paper concludes with a plea for persons in the helping professions to chart new directions in cross-cultural counseling, to abolish velvet racism, and to do everything possible to make true integration a reality.

Most sexual victimization took place within the child's family, not with strangers, as \"child molesters\" have traditionally been stereotyped. While the problem cuts across social and economic lines, it seems to be more prevalent in families of lower social class and rural backgrounds, indicating that social isolation may play a key role in victimization and family violence. Mothers are crucial in protecting their daughters from sexual abuse; girls whose mothers were absent, ill, poorly educated or alcoholic were much more likely to be victimized. Children were most vulnerable prior to puberty, and most of them did not reveal the experience  to anyone at the time it occurs. Experiences involving force were much more traumatic than those not involving force. (Author/BP)",

        "description":"From about age four to age eleven, a child's concept of &quot;word&quot; develops from a lack of conceptual differentiation about things and events to an awareness of words as meaningful elements in themselves. Piaget's theory of cognitive development offers a perspective from which this phenomenon can be evaluated. The preoperational and concrete operational stages have characteristics that match the development of word concepts. In addition, children have a tacit awareness of language and print that they use at a subconscious level. There seems to be a development from centering on a subjective system to centering on an objective system at the tacit level of language development. Tacit and conscious knowledge together interact as children develop the idea of word as content and word as  form. As a child develops, teachers or parents can give assistance. An illustrated alphabet strip in the child's bedroom, dictated experience stories, labeling objects in the home, and categorizing games with words are strategies that help children along to a wholesome concept of words.

Although empirical studies by those testing the levels of processing framework have demonstrated that mnemonic strategies employed by children are the critical component of memory performance, this result is not dependent on a levels of processing formulation. It also does not clarify the three critical issues in understanding the developing memory system: what the particular mechanisms are that might operate in the different rehearsal strategies; the importance of the structures and content of the knowledge base; and apparently involuntary memory processes such as those involved in attention,  pattern recognition, and memory inferencing.

The propositional inventory was used in two teacher surveys: the first included 602 teachers and sought to determine their conceptions of reading; the second included 257 teachers and attempted to establish relationships between their demographic data and their reading conceptions. Three major findings resulted: teachers do think in conceptual patterns, these patterns do not match the theoretical categories discussed in the reading literature, and teacher conceptions seem to be associated most strongly with years of experience. The field study involved 33 teachers and  produced the following findings: teachers have more than one conception of reading, some teachers possess more complex conceptions than others, conceptions seem to vary in stability from teacher to teacher, a teacher's reading conception may be related to the grade level taught and to the ability level of the students, and teachers do modify and change their conceptions of reading and reading instruction over time. These findings indicate that teacher conceptions of reading are reflected in instructional practices. (FL)",

Teachers who have few skills to utilize questioning strategies tend to use teachers' guides which are generally of little help because they have no planned sequence of questioning and they are too cumbersome. In order to use questioning more effectively, teachers need to learn to use a basic questioning classification system. After learning such a system, teachers need to consider the questioning sequence, asking questions to establish the facts first, then asking questions to elicit  convergent thinking, and finally asking questions that obtain divergent or evaluative thought. (A table of categories of questions is included as is a questioning framework providing samples for each category.) (TJ)",

In the second experiment, 13 students listened to recorded texts and then tried to recall them. As was predicted, text type had a significant effect on recall, with stories being recalled more fully than were instructions or definitions.

The objectives were to determine whether student attention was higher when the teacher directed instruction to the entire room than when the teacher directed instruction to a group of students within the room, if there was a difference in student attention when there was one instructional group or more than one in a classroom, and the relationship between student involvement and various school level characteristics, including scores on standardized reading tests and the percent of students from poverty-level families. It was found that the average percent of students not involved in instruction was much  greater in classrooms where the teacher was oriented to a group, that involvement was lower in classrooms when there were two or more groups than when there was only one, that student involvement is significantly related to reading achievement, and that poverty is correlated to the percent of students not involved in instruction.

It describes how a student's schema for reading might develop and how an inappropriate schema for reading may be one factor contributing to ineffective reading comprehension performance. Next, it presents data consistent with this position along with a brief summary of other factors that affect reading comprehension performance. Some data gathered in pilot research are also discussed, together with an explanation of an improved  methodology for assessing students' schemata for reading. Finally, the paper suggests some directions for future research and how this research might affect education.

Main effects were found for strength of prior knowledge, and question type. Simple effects tests indicated a significant prior-knowledge effect on the inferrable knowledge but not on explicitly stated information. A follow-up study was conducted to verify the fact that the question-type effect was not due to the chance allocation of inherently easier questions to one of the two  question types. The findings revealed a reliable decrease in question difficulty attributable to cuing propositional relations explicitly in the text. The data were interpreted as supporting and extending the arguments emerging from various &quot;schema theories.&quot; (Author)",

Separate sections are then devoted to the following topics: characteristics of Chicago journalism in the 1890s, which show the close relationship between the emergence of symbolic interactionism and the appearances of new  journalistic perspectives; the link between symbolic interactionism and Progressivism; ways in which the American liberals who were the architects of Pragmatism and symbolic interactionism sought ways of releasing individualism from the forces of privilege; a major shift in American sociology, from theoretical discussions to urban research, in the early twentieth century; and reasons for the recent resurgence of interest among social scientists in symbolic interactionism and among historians in the Progressive period.

Stressing the priority and value of listening instruction, the introduction discusses the need for more attention to listening and calls for greater systemization in instruction. The first chapter suggests two approaches to a definition of listening, while the second chapter defines the term according to the operations of a proficient listener. Chapter three deals with listening comprehension as it relates to instructional objectives and teacher needs. The final two chapters examine criticisms and rationales applicable to both formal and informal listening tests and  set standards to assist teachers in reaching specific objectives. The appendixes contain lists of commercially published listening materials and classroom listening materials intended to ssupplement those presented in the text. (MAI)",

        "description":"Before teachers can heed recent calls for planning literary experiences that expose children to books about people in other cultures, they need to evaluate the books on the many ethnic booklists. This evaluation process can be confusing, due to the varying quality of multiethnic literature for children. There are five questions that teachers should consider in evaluating multiethnic books: (1) Are there stereotypes in words or pictures? Stereotyping frequently occurs in language, in the patterns of daily life presented, and in the pictures. (2) What does the story imply? The plot, theme, or tone may contain hidden meanings that convey a distorted view of an ethnic group; further, stories may deal only with the past history of a culture or may omit major aspects of a culture in  their portrayals. (3) What are the author's qualifications? The author must have knowledge of the customs, habits, and attitudes of a group to present them accurately. (4) When was the book published? Many older books reflect outdated attitudes, contain offensive vocabulary, and portray stereotyped situations. (5) What is the literary merit of the book? The literary elements of a work must be carefully drawn, insightfully developed, and adequately concluded. In conclusion, teachers must evaluate the available literature and offer those books that present the best, most honest picture of our multiethnic society. (GT)",

        "description":"Although the importance of writing is well recognized, it is largely neglected in the elementary curriculum because of the current emphasis on reading; to change this trend, teacher educators must influence teachers to adopt positive attitudes toward writing. They should help teachers derive satisfaction from writing experiences, demonstrate desirable teaching methods in which the learner is the prime performer, show how theory and practice are related, help teachers learn to teach language arts skills as they relate to the purpose of communication, and emphasize processes that develop divergent thinking. A seminar for graduate elementary education majors develops divergent thinking through \"invention process\" activities in which students consider a familiar concept or story in a  new way. After an oral exchange of ideas about the many ways of viewing a familiar storybook character, students rewrite the story in various styles, experimenting with writing techniques and vocabulary. They thus learn that creative thinking and synthesis are related processes, and they learn several important language arts generalizations with implications for teaching. (Excerpts from students' versions of \"Little Red Riding Hood,\" written in a variety of styles, including biblical, Shakespearean, and poetic, are included.) (GT)",

The four 90-minute exercise units dealt with basic communication principles and competencies for strengthening a relationship, for productive conflict, and for changing and maintaining a relationship. Exercises were designed for skills practice and awareness raising, and included meaning clarification, relationship messages, eye contact and physical distance, open ended questions, nonverbal communication practice, objective nonverbal description, voice practice,  and structured self-disclosure, among others. Twenty couples participated and were tested; results indicated that neither the reported frequency of verbal aggression nor the amount of communication changed significantly, although the nature of the communication became much more positive and relationship cooperation and conflict-handling ability were enhanced.

The subjects participated in one of two treatments. In the first, they were randomly paired and participated in social conversation for 15 minutes. Following the conversation, they rated their communication satisfaction and their perceptions of relationship intimacy with each other. In the second, the subjects recalled either a recent satisfying or dissatisfying social conversation and also rated their perceived communication satisfaction and perceived relationship intimacy. A self-report instrument was used to measure communication satisfaction, and a checklist on which subjects indicated their perceptions of  the other party in the conversation as a friend, acquaintance, or stranger was used to measure relationship intimacy. The results showed that communication satisfaction among friends was characterized by interaction management. It was also determined that when satisfaction was measured immediately, the process of communication emerged as an important determinant; however, for recalled conversations, one's intentions prior to the interaction and one's feelings of being understood afterward emerged.

The preparation begins in midsummer, when the prospective teachers are sent handouts and teaching materials for the course. It continues, just prior to the beginning of fall term, with a university-wide \"professional development program\" and a more specific departmental training session that provides experiences in the speech activities the teaching assistants will soon direct. Other parts of the training program continue through the school year, including weekly staff meetings (to  discuss grading procedures, effective teaching techniques, and other concerns), class visitations by the \"t.a.\" director, required participation in a one-credit teacher education course, and optional enrollment in a four-credit course about teaching interpersonal and public communication. The rationale for such a multi-faceted approach to preparing teaching assistants is to offer a subtle combination of structure and flexibility; the program's design gives direction to the t.a.'s but on a wide path that yields consistent experiences to the group without constricting the individual.

The two groups, one composed of 45 homosexual and the other of 95 heterosexual college students, were then asked to evaluate the show and the characters' interactions by means of a questionnaire. The questionnaire was divided into three sections: background information, including media habits and attitudes; perceptions of the television show and its characters; and information concerning interpersonal relationships. An analysis of the responses revealed that the homosexual sample felt that the homosexual television characters were partially unrepresentative of  their culture and that they were stereotyped. Heterosexuals with homosexual social contacts more readily agreed with the homosexuals' evaluation of the stereotypic nature of the television characters than did heterosexuals with no gay social contacts. Both groups of heterosexuals, however, indicated that the characters were partially representative of the homosexual community. The findings also indicated that homosexuals are most offended by stereotypes in general on television, followed by heterosexuals with homosexual social contacts. Those least offended by television stereotypes in general were the heterosexuals with no homosexual social contacts. (FL)",

        "description":"California Assembly Bill 65 (AB 65) attempts to equalize California school finance and improve school programs. The school finance portion of the bill arose as a response to the 1976 Serrano v. Priest decision in which the California Supreme Court said that the existing school finance system was unfair to both students and taxpayers. AB 65 provides additional state assistance to increase per pupil expenditures in low-wealth districts and imposes new limits on the growth of expenditures in districts with high per pupil property values. The bill also establishes the School Improvement Program designed to increase the quality of public education primarily through state planning and implementation grants to participating schools. One section of AB 65 modifies the legislature's  proficiency standards in basic skills for students in grades 7-12 and extends these requirements to specified elementary grades. Also funded through AB 65 is a staff development program that helps teachers and other school staff members design and implement professional development activities tailor-made to meet specific local school needs. Regarding exceptional children, AB 65 provides for a Special Education Master Plan to ensure that all physically and mentally exceptional children receive appropriate services. The bill also merges state funding of separate programs for compensatory and bilingual education into a consolidated system called Economic Impact Aid. (Author/JM)",

The second paper presents a model for the ongoing assessment of work undertaken by trainees at an activity therapy center. Steps  of the model include beginning initial assessment, identifying appropriate tasks, surveying antecedent and subsequent events, formulating hypotheses for intervention, selecting data collection techniques, beginning ongoing assessment and establishing a baseline, implementing intervention, deciding whether the results are acceptable, and assessing for generalization.

Other findings discussed include that most schizophrenic Ss had prenatal and birth difficulties and had been separated from their parents early in life. Evidence that the schizophrenic process in women may differ from that in men is considered. It is explained that Mednick views schizophrenia as an &quot;evasion of life&quot; which is a learned behavior: he suggests that the schizophrenic learns to avoid stress or anxiety by switching into irrelevant thinking.

Twenty-two Ss identified as neurologically suspect or abnormal on more than one of the infant examinations consistently performed far below control Ss on all measures, with almost one-third having Stanford-Binet IQs below 70. One-hundred and fifty-six Ss neurologically suspect or abnormal on only one infant examination performed significantly less well than 1066 Ss never suspected of neurological abnormality in infancy. Results suggested that evidence of even transitory neurological abnormality observed during the first year of life may be an indicator of risk  for developmental impairment.

Academic locus of control was tapped by the Intellectual Achievement Responsibility Questionnaire. Strong differences were observed between the LD and control Ss on these three affective variables. The history of school failure which typifies LD students appeared to be associated with more negative self-perceptions of ability, external attributions of responsiblitity for school successes, and lower expectations of future success in academic tasks.

        "description":"The simplification of legal language is required by President Carter's Executive Order requiring &quot;clear and simple English&quot; in government regulations. A major problem in the simplification process is the absence of any adequate description or classification of legal language. This paper defines some specific features of legal language, its functions within the legal community and society as a whole, and discusses some aspects of the simplification of legal language. Like any dialect, legal language serves separating, unifying, and prestige functions. In addition, it requires a lengthy acquisition process, undergoes change and growth, and has identifying syntactic features. Recent research suggests that there is more to legal language than lexicon. For example, a study of the  comprehension of standard jury instructions points out several linguistic features which appear to typify legalese but are not common in other varieties of English. Attempts to simplify legal language have been generally of two types: (1) readability indices or formulas which measure symptoms of incomprehensibility; and (2) a rhetorical or editing approach that emphasizes the reader's point of view. It is suggested that research in the comprehension of nonlegal language can provide insight into the linguistic barriers to comprehension of legal language. (Author/AMH)",

        "description":"This study investigates the role of inferencing in cloze test performance and the factors that facilitate that inferencing. Four groups of high school students learning French as a second language completed sets of cloze passages under four treatment conditions. Three conditions provided a potential cue to inferencing, while the fourth was a control condition with no additional aids. The results indicated significant differences in performance attributable to the four classes, the position of the story in the set of passages, and the inferencing treatment condition. A more detailed analysis examined the relationship between experimental condition, type of error committed, and the form class of the original word required by the text. Differences in these patterns were apparent,  although non-significant. It was found that certain inferencing cues can have a facilitating effect on students' cloze performance although the pattern of facilitation is different from that found on other criterion tasks. Furthermore, it is possible to encourage students' inferencing behavior through classroom training, thereby improving cloze performance. (Author/AMH)",

Three groups of children in the third and fifth grades participated in the study: French native speakers, Anglophone children learning French in an immersion setting, and Anglophone children in a French school (submersion). Each child listened to a story read to him or her by the examiner. On the second reading, at the end of each paragraph, the child was given three (3) pictures corresponding to that paragraph and was asked to retell the story. The extent to which five syntactic structures were avoided was analyzed. Results indicated that the extent to which avoidance occurred differed according to structure,  grade level and group. In addition, common strategies of avoidance, such as paraphrasing, could be identified for all children. (Author/AMH)",

The course, open to men and women, was designed to provide more equitable educational opportunities through hands-on laboratories, career education, and role-model lectures on energy, environment, transportation, biomedical engineering, and productivity. Six standardized tests were administered to evaluate the effectiveness of the laboratory experiences in increasing knowledge in technical areas. To evaluate changes in goals, interests, attitudes, perceived capabilities, and experiences, a survey was administered. The evaluation instruments were administered before and after the program to two course groups, one containing primarily women  and one containing about half women and half men, and to two control groups. The hands-on laboratory resulted in substantial, although not complete, gains in technical knowledge for women in the experimental group compared to men in the control group. Student journals showed evidence that a great deal of thought was going into the formulation of specific career plans after each role-model lecture/discussion session and career counseling session. Increased self-confidence of women in their technical knowledge and laboratory skills was indicated from the survey scales. Final course evaluations by students indicated that they were generally pleased with the course. (SW)",

The types of tutorial systems were voluntary, compulsory, and combining voluntary and compulsory tutoring. The sample consisted of all freshmen who participated in the Developmental Education Program in the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh in the fall semester of 1978. The students were admitted into the program on the basis of a set of social, economic, and educational criteria and all participants were considered underachievers. Results from a one way analysis of variance showed no significant differences in grade point average among recipients of the three different tutorial systems. The low utilization rate of voluntary tutorial  services suggests that it might be more practical to offer tutorial services on a compulsory basis to special services program participants. (SW)",

Problems have arisen from the activities of the private or semi-private corporate consulting organization in higher education. Taken as a whole, the uncritical use of business principles has led to sets of recommendations and proposals that threaten the future of higher education. Often these firms provide public relations assistance to force the acceptance of predetermined changes in policies. The total absence of considering the concept of quality or the purposes of higher education is the worst aspect of this management trend. References are made to the recommendations of specific consulting firms.  The issues involved in the serious shortage of jobs and proposals for tenure quotas are considered. Although such factors as the shortage of public funds have affected higher education, much of the present state of affairs is due to lack of fiscal responsibility on the part of management. Faculty members need to change their position of powerlessness when acting individually through collective bargaining and unionization. (SW)",

Two types of outcomes were set as priorities in the design and implementation of the problem solving sessions: small group peer interactions as instructional and evaluative resources; and issues relevant to the process of clinical problem solving. The small group discussions focus on three critical issues relevant to clinical problem solving: the multiple dimensions of a health problem (biopathological, psychological, and socioeconomic); the use of a systematic clinical problem solving strategy to resolve these problems; and the documentation of the clinical encounter. It is proposed that educational innovations in  clinical problem solving should be grounded in as much theory as possible and that medical students should practice their clinical reasoning processes during their undergraduate years through group discussion of simulated clinical cases.

The first part of the study consisted of a series of statistical analyses of institutional and departmental patterns in women's full-time graduate enrollment and full-time employment in sciences and engineering in the 50 leading doctorate-granting institutions. The second phase consisted of case study site visits to a sample of nine institutions selected to represent the diversity of the original sample in geographic location, urban/rural environment, institutional  size, type of control, and proportion of women scientists employed. The case study institutions were the University of Arizona, Harvard University, Louisiana State University (Baton Rouge), University of Michigan, Northwestern University, Purdue University, University of Southern California, Texas A &amp; M University, and the University of Washington. The statistical analyses employed were designed to identify distinctive trends, to move beyond presentation of numbers and percentages to search for significant and distinctive differences. The report was exploratory and descriptive in nature, without specific research hypotheses. The analyses and results are described, with some graphic illustration. (Author/MSE)",

Recently funded at approximately $5 billion, the programs of this legislation serve over 3 million students through financial assistance and nearly the full range of traditional higher education institutions and many proprietary vocational/technical schools. The primary focus of the Higher Education Act is student assistance, which accounts for some 94 percent of the funds appropriated for the Act. Focus in this report is on four student aid-related issues: consolidation, coordination and simplification of the aid programs; the financing of higher education through loans; impact on students' access to higher education and choice among institutions; and the extent  of fraud, abuse and waste in these programs. Institutional aid-related issues are discussed briefly with attention paid to such topics as the need for construction support and the Federal support of traditionally black institutions.

The roles of various participants in the budgeting process and the form of their participation, with emphasis on centralization of authority in the budgetary process, are analyzed, and the problem of equity, or allocation of similar resources for similar needs, is explained. The roles of various types of information, particularly that pertaining to the costs and outcomes of the educational experience in budgetary decision-making, and the burdens of information reporting are discussed. The heritage of current budget-planning approaches in postsecondary education is traced. The  approaches to budgeting in private industry and the development of budgeting practice in the public sector during this century are considered. Problems associated with budgeting in postsecondary education and the influence of the business and public-administration approaches are discussed. The following five budget-planning approaches are described in detail: incremental budgeting, formula budgeting, program budgeting, zero-base budgeting, and performance budgeting. An analysis of budgeting roles and responsibilities existing at different organizational levels is presented. Budget-request strategies and budgeting review techniques are considered. Recommendations for further research are offered, and a bibliography is included. (SW)",

The influence of social and economic factors on childrearing practices and family relationships, particularly among low income blacks, is discussed. Special attention is given to the role of parents as the primary educators of their children, and the potential impact of intervention programs on this role. It is pointed out that both active (Head Start, Follow Through) and passive (Competency Testing) intervention approaches assume that there is something wrong with the family and that this assumption compounds educational and family problems. In addition, evidence is presented to show that neither active nor passive intervention programs alter  the caste-like barriers to social mobility for poor families. It is concluded that parenting programs and home based interventions often undermine the strengths and competencies of low income parents and that steps should be taken to provide remediation within the classrooms rather than in the homes. A model program for achieving such a goal is presented. (Author/EB)",

The study is arranged chronologically, with each successive chapter covering a cluster of relevant events. The author discusses: (1) the history of urban education; (2) the dynamics of organizational change; and (3) some alternative strategies. The project's birth, implementation, and change are discussed in detail. The project's goals  included reviving the interest of citizens in their schools, retraining teachers, revising the curriculum to make it more relevant, providing marketable skills to students, allowing students to self pace their learning, and serving a section of the city where need was greatest. The ultimate demise of the project after 11 years was due to a number of factors including: (1) the lack of money; (2) the loss of community enthusiasm; (3) the resentment of the D.C. school personnel; and (4) the loss of a constituency.

        "description":"According to this report on the results of a 1977 survey of 163 correctional education programs throughout the United States, the general state of education in correctional institutions has improved, but funding is a major problem that is reflected in the quality of administration, lack of resources, and inability to offer meaningful programs on a continuing basis. The conflict between custodial and treatment functions in some institutions is found to have a negative influence on the work of the corrections educator. It is concluded that improvements must be made in the area of program evaluation, that the relationship between work and educational programs needs to be clarified, and that prison administrators must emphasize the importance of education to rehabilitation.  Information concerning program funding, administration, resources, materials, program design and evaluation, and relation to work programs is provided, and a bibliography and a chart showing inmate flow through a generalized education program are included.

        "description":"This paper discusses the extent and significance of black suburbanization from the late 1950s to the mid-l970s in 19 of the nation's largest metropolitan areas (SMSAs). The basic question addressed is whether blacks are moving more rapidly to suburban areas in the 1970s than in previous decades. A second focus is on the socioeconomic characteristics of suburbanizing blacks. Data on migration between cities and suburbs from the Current Population Survey and the Annual Housing Survey are compared with equivalent information from earlier census data to examine recent black migration trends and to determine how black suburbanization differs throughout the nation. It is concluded that black migration patterns have shifted since 1970 in all of the SMSAs studied but that black rates of  movement from city to suburb remain below those of whites in most of the SMSAs. It is also suggested that black suburbanization to date represents choice rather than displacement, since blacks who have moved to the suburbs are found to be above average in education and income.

Procedures consisted of identification of priority occupational areas within the scope of vocational education, selection of candidate military courses for review, acquisition of course materials, and review and evaluation of materials. Some 150 military courses were identified as relating to thirty-five priority occupational areas. From these, twenty courses in allied health, environmental health, and occupational safety and health were selected for review in the first year. Course review guides were  derived from an analysis of the components of vocational curriculum development as contained in contemporary Instructional Systems Design (ISD) models. Vocational education subject matter specialists, curriculum development specialists, and a commercial publisher performed the reviews. Conclusions were that military curricula (1) are available to meet curriculum needs, (2) generally have well-stated course goals and objectives but require attention to lesson objectives, (3) demonstrate a high degree of technical accuracy, and (4) usually include a variety of instructional strategies but often lack classroom management strategies.

Part II presents seven actual case studies which illustrate ten specific evaluation techniques. These techniques are as follow: descriptive survey, interviews, self-evaluation, followup, comparison groups, criterion testing, item analysis, hypothesis testing and sample size, case study, and process evaluation. The techniques described in the case study are presented by three areas of emphasis:  area wide, school district wide, and local program. Finally, Part III discusses seven evaluation issues. These are the following: evaluation design and decision-making; preparing a needs assessment; appropriate measuring instruments; abstracting the report for reader utility; incentives for evaluation; politics of evaluation; and finding your own role as an evaluator.

The focus is on the interrelations among participation, employment and unemployment, with particular emphasis on the participation rate as a prime determinant of the labor market experience of various demographic groups. The first section of the paper briefly reviews the evidence indicating the importance of participation fluctuations. An empirical model is described and several variants are discussed. The second section discusses empirical results for various groups. Differences in labor market experience by age, sex, race, and marital status are considered. From the findings, the importance of the participation  rate in affecting the cyclical behavior of both employment and unemployment is concluded. Another finding is that young workers bear a disproportionate share of cyclical fluctuations. The third section analyzes the impact of aggregate demand policy on high unemployment demographic groups. It is concluded that failure to consider participation has led to undue pessimism about the effects of aggregate demand policy on high unemployment groups. The fourth and final sections of the paper summarize the conclusions and discuss some of their implications. (JH)",

Because of problems with the production of the FACIT materials, the field test of an evaluation model could not be carried out. Instead, the project sought a model that could be easily adapted to the evaluation of any competency-based program. To meet this revised goal, an in-depth literature review of evaluation models for competency-based programs was undertaken, using a set of criteria that would satisfy the requirements of program description and evaluation. As a result of this review, the Stufflebeam model was identified as  one that would provide comprehensive guidelines for planning the evaluation of competency-based programs. This model, however, did not provide sufficient guidance in the description of programs to be evaluated. Therefore, the project developed program-description guidelines that incorporated elements of the Stake evaluation model and the Concerns-Based Adoption Model. (Appendixes to this report provide information about evaluation questions and contain various instruments that can be used in evaluating competency-based programs.) (Author/JH)",

Educational leaders are exploring the concepts of lifelong learning and recurrent education. The primary goal is to break up the present age-segregated youth ghetto of education and create multidiversional systems infused with concepts of lifelong learning for all age groupings. Within the work sector, education should become a valuable adjunct, intermeshed with ongoing labor efforts. The future possibilities of this interchange make this option  to adult learners a very attractive one. Finally, the concept of leisure is changing as our society is changing. It has value and importance for the self-explorational, creative side of human beings.

The GAO's review showed that only about 16 percent of flight-trained veterans and 34 percent of correspondence-trained veterans have full time jobs related directly to their training. Also found was that the employment survey reports submitted to the Veteran's Administration (VA) by vocational technical schools do not show whether most veterans obtained training related employment or to what extent such employment represents the veteran's primary vocational  pursuit and major source of occupational income. Based on the findings, the GAO supported the proposed legislation submitted by the VA to terminate GI bill benefits for flight and correspondence training. (JH)",

The extent of exposure to environmental irritants during a 17-day baseline period was tested, and the efficacy of two simple behavioral strategies in reducing smoke were documented (requests to stop smoking, by nonsmokers to smokers, and avoiding being with smokers). While the tactics were efficacious, their use generated considerable negative as well as positive reaction. The first tactic, actively avoiding smokers, reduced rates of daily smoke exposure from 40 minutes to 29 minutes. The second approach, avoiding and confronting smokers (i.e., politely asking them not to smoke), succeeded in practically eliminating  exposure to smoke. Although rates of smoking increased during the final baseline period, levels remained lower than the initial baseline and avoidance phases. (Author/LS)",

To determine whether the relationship between irrationality and psychological adjustment holds for adolescents, one hundred and eighty-four boys in the seventh, ninth, and twelfth grades were administered the Common Beliefs Survey III, to measure irrational beliefs, and the Neuroticism Scale Questionnaire. The advisors of each of the boys were also asked to rate the boys on the Behavior Problem Checklist. Data analysis revealed that the developmental trends for the irrational beliefs were generally different from those for neuroticism and behavior  problems. The results suggest that the scales for irrational beliefs, neuroticism and behavior problems are not measuring the same entity during adolescence. These results were confirmed by correlational analyses since very few significant positive correlations were found among the scales. (Author)",

Over a nine-month period, community members identified the target issue and supplied personnel to mount the &quot;dog interventions.&quot; The University group provided guidance, support and expertise in planning and evaluating the intervention. In introducing evaluation, community members needed to be apprised of potential benefits in evaluating  the project and the importance of standardized procedures, comprehensive training sessions and supervision.

In order to implement effective tutoring programs, there is a need to delineate precise tutoring behaviors employed, as well as the requisite behaviors of supervisors. A multiple baseline design was used to document the establishment of supervising behaviors (corrective feedback, restating questions, contingent praise) in a class of eighth graders. The eighth graders then successfully used prompts to teach peer-tutoring behaviors to an entire class of first graders. The continued usage of peer-tutoring skills in the absence of prompting by university observers suggests that eighth graders can effectively implement  a peer-tutoring program without adult supervision once they have recieved appropriate supervisory training.

In support of a prominent theory of classroom learning, appropriate effort was strongly correlated with student achievement even when differences in student aptitude were controlled. Finally, achievement motivation was shown to be related to both the effort and achievement variables. A path analysis indicated that the influence of achievement motivation on achievement was determined primarily by the relationship of achievement motivation and effort. (Author)",

The use of a single-criterion, dichotomous scoring procedure on a fantasy-based measure of the construct produced moderate to high inter-scorer reliabilities. Although there was only a modest sex difference in the overall level of FOS motivation, significant effects of social reaction were observed in both sexes. The FOS construct appears to have experimental validity when the social conditions sufficient for its arousal are established. The results also raise the possibility that FOS motivation may be a highly situational phenomenon. (Author)",

The present experiment held piece-rate pay constant at two levels and varied relative pay (80% higher, the same, 80% lower) reported by co-workers. Significant manipulation checks for relative pay were obtained. Significant performance differences for quantity and fewer pieces for lower relative piece-rate pay, were opposite predictions from inequity theory. No significant effects were obtained for quality, but the pattern of means was also the reverse of inequity theory predictions. This finding of  effects due to social comparison which are the reverse of predictions from inequity theory raises questions both for inequity theory and for the portions of the more general equity theory which rely on social comparison processes.

There were no significant differences among test system grades; however, there were significant differences in the students' evaluation of the test systems. The PSI system was seen more favorably on all evaluative and dynamic items, and was seen as stronger. The interaction between test section and personality yielded no significant differences on grades and one significant effect on students' evaluation of how informative the test system was.

In one group of six psychotic children, these behaviors were frequent in demand situations, and rare in nondemand situations. Further, when stimuli correlated with the termination of demands were presented, problematic behaviors decreased dramatically. These problems were treated in two ways--by an escape-extinction procedure in which the child was prohibited from leaving the demand situation as long as disruptive behavior was occurring, and the introduction of strongly preferred reinforcers to attenuate the aversiveness of the demand situation thereby reducing the motivation to emit escape responses. Such an approach was successful in  eliminating the aggressive and self-injurious behaviors of two children and the tantrum behavior of two others. (Author/PJC)",

Type A persons have distinct patterns of responding to opponents' strategies for lowering hostility. Since minimum retaliation allows the opponent control over one's behavior, the strategy should effectively lower Type A aggression. However, a passive person allows his opponent no control over his behavior. Therefore passivity will not effectively reduce Type A anger. Type B persons, who are not concerned with interpersonal control, should be responsive to both strategies. It was found that: (1) type A males escalated their noise settings more than did Type B's in a competitive task, (2) passivity was the more effective deescalation strategy for Type B's, and  (3) type A's showed their greater need for environmental control by reducing more to minimum retaliation and being slower to deescalate and quicker to reescalate to their opponent's passivity.

Tapes were shown immediately preceding practice of the skills. All students met in groups of three or four with an advanced graduate student or faculty monitor for 90 minutes while practicing the skills for each module. Students received immediate feedback on their performance during these sessions. Students were evaluated on their performance on probe interviews conducted during both the first and last weeks of classes, and they were required to complete a module evaluation form following the completion of each  module. Performance and improvement ratings of all students were comparable throughout the semester, the sole excpetion being that students who saw the modeling tapes evidenced a significant decrease in percentage of responses coded as requests for descriptions of covert behavior. The modeling tape group spent significantly more time on the course than the control group. However, they did not rate the time spent as excessive, and they rated the individual modules higher. Providing models who emphasized overt rather than covert behaviors in their interviewing behaviors seemed to fill a gap in the training of behavioral clinicians. It was concluded that modeling tapes should be offered but not required as a part of the course instruction. (Author/PJC)",

        "description":"The creative oral language elicited from 45 preoperational and 40 concrete operational first grade students was analyzed to study the relationship between cognitive development and the types of case relationships produced. Each child's language was analyzed for eight noun/verb relationships, including state, process, action, experience, location, direction, duration, and instrumentals. The findings indicated that the type of language a child produces is limited by the child's cognitive capacity. The preoperational youngsters produced more static language because they were functioning with static and immobile thought. The concrete operational subjects, on the other hand, were more used to operating with dynamic thought processes, so their language reflected a more dynamic nature,  such as the increased production of extranuclear sentence elements like locatives, ablatives, durations, and instrumentals.

The subjects, who were involved in a larger experimental study that used the PRI as a criterion measure, were 92 third and fifth grade students. Initial assessment with the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills revealed varying student achievement that necessitated the administration of various levels of the PRI on a pre/posttest basis. After these tests, the students were classified as masters/nonmasters using three separate criterion scores (66%, 75%, and 90%). The Harris Index of Efficiency was computed for each criterion score to determine which score proved most efficient at sorting the pupils into two separate  groups. The results suggest that the criterion score of 66% was the most efficient cutting point with the PRI; a much less efficient sorting of the subjects was evident when using the 75% and 90% levels. The results also indicate that the Harris Index is an effective descriptive measure that can help to determine at what cutting point a test might yield the most information for instructional purposes.

A total of 96 students in grades four through six read text passages two grade levels below reading level, at reading level, and two grade levels above reading level and then judged whether original, paraphrase, meaning change, and distractor sentences were the same or different in meaning from sentences in the text. Analysis of the proportion of correct responses and of scores based on a criterion-free measure of response accuracy indicated that the technique was sensitive to text difficulty. The sentence verification technique has a number of possible uses in such areas as development of instructional materials, reading  diagnosis, and comprehension measurement in experimental research. It has an advantage over other comprehension measurement techniques popularly used in standardized testing in that it is not influenced by inferential reasoning ability or general world knowledge.

The first section is concerned with dynamic processes of story understanding, with emphasis on the integration of information. The role of prior knowledge in accommodating parts of stories received at different times to each other is illustrated, and schema change and schema maintenance as a basis for integration are considered. The second section emphasizes characteristics of prior knowledge as determinants of selectivity in memory. The issues discussed include: the expected future derivability of information, the degree of constraint provided by schemata, and the performance biases produced by attitudes. The third  section investigates variability in the employment of schema-based processing. Among the factors shown in this section to affect the relative utilization of schemata in understanding stories are characteristics of texts and reading tasks and differences between individuals in discourse processing styles. Finally, future directions for schema-theoretic research are suggested. (FL)",

The students were matched both within and across grade level on nonverbal IQ and within each grade level on age. The skilled and less-skilled reading groups were also matched on reading achievement across grade. Each student's oral reading was individually tested on two types of task: the cloze procedure and transformed text. The extent to which the syntactic and semantic constraints of the text guided their performance was then assessed. Both on the cloze procedure and the transformed texts, skilled readers made greater use of grammatical and  contextual information than did less-skilled readers. In addition, there was minimal improvement across grade levels in the proportions of syntactically and semantically appropriate responses. The stability of differences between skilled and less-skilled readers suggested the possibility that differential utilization of syntactic and semantic cues by beginning readers might contribute to differences among them in the development of reading skill.

The test was designed to meet four primary criteria: to judge student ability to create discourse, to yield specific evaluative information, to involve all academic divisions in test design and evaluation, and to serve as a diagnostic tool. The exam was designed to assess basic writing skills and combines a standard essay format of approximately 500 words on one of four pilot-tested questions with an editing passage that requires students to find and correct certain grammatical errors. Limitations of the exam are that it is not a comprehensive measure of a student's writing skills and that it evaluates those skills in an  artificial setting. Advantages are that it underscores the importance that the entire college places on writing, offers students the opportunity to rewrite the exam, and encourages all faculty to share the responsibility for improving student writing skills.

Using both projective and behavioral measures, the study explored media use patterns and story preferences. In particular, it investigated the effect on reader interest of manipulation of story treatment. Treatments used were \"conflict,\"\"impact,\"\"affinity,\" and \"personification.\" Significant differences in interest scores for stories across treatment were found. In addition, these differences were in the direction that news flow research would predict, with violence having the highest interest score. However, the conflict treatment manipulation did not result in interest scores comparable to those for  violent subject, suggesting that the observed journalistic tendency to emphasize the negative aspects of events is not consistent with public interests and selection. The findings suggest that if journalists wish to enhance a foreign news item that might not otherwise attract interest, they should emphasize the home country angle (\"impact\" or \"affinity\") rather than the negative or conflict dimensions.

Defining the basic unit of classroom language as the independent clause or T-unit, it is possible to generate four basic categories of classroom interaction: the informative clause, the elicitation, the directive, and the boundary marker. Classroom interaction is dividied between teacher and student, with teacher structures to inform, direct, or elicit, and student structures to inform or elicit. Rules can  be generated for successive interaction sequences, maintaining the option of the teacher to persist or desist in a line of questioning as crucial, and it is possible to typify macrostructures using this system.

However, unless teachers and students share the process of developing meaning in writing, it is probable that the teacher will dominate the conference. By cooperating and collaborating with students, teachers can avoid the possibility of dominating the psychological processes involved in shaping or forming meaning in writing. Teachers must let students do most of the talking during the conference, and the subject of that talk most often must be the subject of  the student's writing, not the conventions of written language.

The paper first describes three methods traditionally employed in the description of the language of the English classroom--live observation systems, coding systems based on transcripts, and ethnographic studies--and indicates which of these methods was used in each of 22 studies. It next characterizes the studies (and two additional studies) according to five types of research designs outlined by M.J. Dunkin and B.J. Biddle: process occurrence, presage-process, context-process, process-process, and process-product. The paper then reports some of the results of the studies, concluding that the findings suggest that English teachers  make their classrooms into very dull places, and notes that the findings do not yield much information about the effects of teacher training on the beginning English teacher. It concludes by stating some assumptions about what research should be and by stating that future research studies into the training of English teachers should be holistic and longitudinal, should investigate the process of how teachers learn to think like teachers, should reflect the divisions of the field of English teaching, and should focus on the language of the classroom.

The findings revealed that about one-third of the respondents fell into one of three nonviewer categories: nonviewers of both local and network news, nonviewers of local news only, and nonviewers of network news only. A socioeconomic analysis of the nonviewers showed that young adults were more likely than older adults to be nonviewers. Adults with high education levels and income were more likely found in the nonviewer of both local and network news and nonviewer of local news only  categories, while poor and uneducated adults were found in the nonviewer of network news only group. No differences were found between men and women in their attention to televised news.

Among the major conclusions are the following: blacks spend less time reading newspapers but more time viewing television (except during prime time) and listening to radio than do whites. High socioeconomic status (SES) blacks read more newspapers and magazines and view more prime time television than do low SES blacks. Although minorities view more television than whites, they are more highly critical of television than are whites, with blacks especially critical. Minorities are still underrepresented in magazine presentations and television programs. Race  related items are given little attention in newspapers, and newspapers seldom present minority views on race related issues. Minority participation on newspaper staffs is low, probably because more numerous employment opportunities exist in the broadcast media. The percentage of minority students enrolled in journalism schools is low, but the percentage of minority faculty members is lower. Except for a few studies on Mexican-Americans, other minority groups besides blacks have been ignored in the literature, providing a decidedly unbalanced picture of minorities and the media. (RL)",

The categories of gratifications, derived from a number of studies of television and political news, were (1) general information seeking, (2) decisional utility, (3) entertainment, (4) interpersonal utility, and (5) parasocial interaction. Telephone interviews were obtained from 327 heads of household in Lexington, Kentucky, with phone numbers selected through random sampling. GS and GO were measured by responses to 15 items, and six factor analyses were performed to examine the dimensions of GS and GO and the dimensions of GO for certain subsamples developed according  to viewing preference. Findings led to three major conclusions: first, individual GS are moderately to strongly related to corresponding GO; second, the degree of dependence on a particular program is positively related to the strength of the GS/GO relationship; and third, the dimensions of GS and GO from television news differ and are due to general within-program characteristics such as use of videotape and eye contact. Other indications were that entertainment and parasocial interaction are independent motives for television news viewing, and that viewers may distinguish two values of TV news information, for decision making and for social information.

Current research on the composing process suggests a conceptual change from that of a rigid sequence of clearly demarcated stages to a more recursive, hierarchically structured model. Until recently, the role of invention in writing has been ignored. One of the most serious effects of the current/traditional model of the composing process has been its negative influence on students' psychological expectations and attitudes. The teacher's function as a role model is critical in introducing students to the composing process by sharing with them a retrospective protocol of writing experiences, including copies of all scraps and rough drafts.  Class members can then be asked to write their own retrospective protocols of the processes they follow in composing. Other methods include reading anecdotes by professional writers about their writing habits and asking ordinary people whose careers involve a fair amount of writing to talk to students. Student writers need to be reminded of the need for flexibility and common sense as they approach the writing process. Implementing these methods may be impeded by large composition class loads, the current teaching assistant system, dependence on part-time staff, and the low regard with which composition teaching is often held by English instructors.

The focus of the program is on written language and its four major functions: communication, self-expression, knowing, and values formation. The General Motors Foundation funded week-long institutes for faculty from various disciplines to concentrate on writing and talking about writing for five summers at the rate of two or three institutes a summer. Shorter  two-hour workshops on campus throughout the school year and a newsletter network for participating faculty have also been established. Classroom strategies emerging from the institutes suggest maintaining teacher and student journals, using essay questions as effective learning tools in lieu of homework problems, and incorporating revisions of formal papers in the classroom structure before final submission. The general pedagogical principle guiding the program is that students learn to write by writing and rewriting often to serve different purposes and different audiences. (AEA)",

Student participation in all three parts provides better motivation and demonstrates to students that grammatical terminology and analysis have some practical point. To analyze composition, a short passage that clearly performs the function for which it was intended is selected. Each sentence of the passage is then copied on a separate file card and every finite verb structure is underlined. The kinds of sentences used are identified, with the main clauses of complex and compound sentences marked. Finally, each main clause is  analyzed into its principal constituents along with accompanying structures. Once all sentences have been analyzed and sorted into similar clause structures, the optional structures which accompany the most frequent main clause in the passage are identified, and a formula is written which briefly expresses all this information. Students practice writing single sentences from the formulae until the process is clear, and then write their own compositions. From an examination of many passages of different functions, it is clear that there is a close correlation between function, sentence structure, and distribution of sentence kinds, and the formulae and proportions of use merely reflect the style of each function.

        "author":["Raimes, Ann"],
        "description":"A semester-long faculty seminar at Hunter College involved teachers from 14 disciplines in weekly meetings regarding writing in the subject areas. Although the teachers read literature on writing and heard from outside writing experts, they spent most of the time working together on designing and criticizing writing assignments for their classes and on examining students' papers. Among the learnings of the teachers were that fundamental writing skills do not vary across disciplines and that students gain understanding of a subject through writing about it. The group eventually wrote a report including recommendations for writing across the curriculum, for types of writing assignments, for course changes, and for a college-wide committee to monitor writing requirements and  college-wide policies on the amount of writing expected in different types of courses. Among the insights gained by the English teachers who moderated the seminar were that writing teachers should move students from personal to academic writing as soon as possible and should choose writing topics based on key concepts in other disciplines, that the teaching of the basics of acceptable writing belongs in basic writing courses or in tutorial centers, and that writing teachers must assign writing topics that enable students to write to learn at the same time that they are learning to write.

        "description":"Although the diagnostic testing of writing is still quite primitive, error analysis and protocol analysis hold promise for writing diagnosis. True diagnostic testing does more than aid in placing students; it identifies the nature of needed instruction. Tests in writing have not been developed to reflect approaches used in diagnostic testing in other areas. Reviews of existing standardized writing tests suggest shortcomings in all three categories of tests identified: objective tests, objective tests corresponding to individualized writing sequences, and essay tests. Information about error analysis, one of the areas that holds promise for writing diagnosis, has been drawn from teachers of English as a second language, who have moved from corrective error analysis to contrastive  analysis and finally to the analysis of errors as clues to inner processes. The other promising area, protocol analysis, involves analyzing subjects' oral descriptions of everything they think while performing a task, as a means of identifying inner processes and obstacles encountered. An examination of the writing protocol of a subject in an experimental study reveals the process through which a writer understands a topic. Although protocols are incomplete representations of inner processes, they provide far more information about writing processes than does simply examining the writing outcome. (The paper includes 27 lines of the writing protocol discussed and a chart showing various approaches to error analysis.) (GT)",

        "description":"A college-level Southern studies course, team-taught by a history professor and a speech communication professor and designed to integrate the study of history with the study of public address, is described in this paper. After pointing out the interrelation of public address and its historical and political context, the paper lists the topics of the five course modules: the impact of the Civil War on the South, the South and the Depression, the &quot;New South,&quot; the black experience, and the South today. It then explains how the instructors work together in teaching the course and suggests that the approach is well suited to other topics and eras. To provide examples of the approach used in the course, materials from two modules are included in the appendixes. A reading list of  selected references that place Southern oratory in the context of Southern history is also given. (GT)",

        "description":"Many educational administrators are too overwhelmed by paperwork and too short of time, resources, and training, to be effective leaders. Yet some educators and schools are finding ways to make good leadership easier through improving time management skills, providing assistants, instituting administrative training programs, and cutting paperwork. Most literature on leadership effectiveness centers around one or more of three requirements: an appropriate leadership style, effective decision-making structures, and a healthy educational climate that fosters good relationships with staff, students, and community. An integration of all these factors will produce the most effective leaders. This paper summarizes and analyzes information from many authors in the field and contains  thoughts from 17 school and school district administrators who were interviewed concerning good leadership.

        "description":"This study attempted to formulate a method of assessing teachers' affective states that can predict the course of teacher contract negotiations. Researchers attempted to analyze and quantify teachers' feelings of professional role deprivation (PRD) and attitudinal militancy and to assess the relationship between the two. Professional role deprivation was defined as the discrepancy between desired and achieved professional status. Questionnaires were used to assess attitudes of Alberta (Canada) teachers in 1977-78. Results indicated that a higher level of PRD in regard to recognition for teaching and responsibility for fostering high standards is associated with increased receptivity to political activism. It was also found that a higher level of PRD in regard to control over  working conditions is significantly associated with increased receptivity to the use of political activism and strikes during negotiations. A major conclusion was that in 1977 there was very little attitudinal militancy among Alberta teachers. Support was also found for the theory that higher PRD is correlated with a more supportive attitude toward militancy. The matters on which larger amounts of PRD were registered are largely controlled by the provincial department of education. The research has yet to determine how the PRD and attitudinal militancy found were related to actual negotiations proceedings. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The major premise underlying this presentation is that every employee has a right to economic democracy, that is, participation in those affairs that impact on his or her life. It is first argued that there is a dialectical relation between the educational system and the world of work. In this dialectic the educational system both reinforces and undermines the production of wage labor. Schools help prepare wage earners who fit into the present economic system through highly structured regulations and an atmosphere of competition and alienation. However, they also undermine the economic system by providing a surplus of overeducated workers who are frustrated by low-level jobs. This situation threatens both the educational and work processes. Although many attempts are made to  remedy this situation, most, such as career education and lifelong learning, are largely ineffective. It is suggested, rather, that employers may tend to respond to the higher expectations of the more educated worker by relying increasingly on integrating workers into the work process by increasing employee participation or democratizing the workplace. Examples of several forms of economic democracy are presented. The author concludes that in response, schools may begin to emphasize cooperation, group decision-making, autonomy, and other prerequisites for economic democracy. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This paper focuses on a system of recurrent education in which individuals would have the opportunities to undertake educational and training activities in alternation with periods of work. Underlying the paper is the assumption that the financing approach to such a system would have to encompass most forms of postcompulsory education and training, attempt to more nearly equalize access to and benefits of such training, promote the expansion of employment opportunities, and provide flexibility for supporting a large number of unorthodox educational and training alternatives. This paper develops a financing plan for recurrent education that would provide individual entitlements that could be used for any eligible programs. Each person would become eligible for such entitlements at  age 16 or when compulsory schooling terminates. These entitlements could be used in any program that meets government eligibility requirements. Such programs could be sponsored by governments, nonprofit agencies, or profit-seeking institutions. Evidence on the potential of individual entitlements is drawn from the GI Bill. Also included are a presentation on the implementation of an individual entitlement plan as well as a discussion of criticisms of the approach. (Author/JM)",

Rather, Brown seemed to legitimate the case for equality and initiate the rise of black political activism, further legal challenges to racial discrimination in voting, employment, education, and housing, and the creation of a favorable climate for the passage of subsequent civil rights legislation and the War on Poverty.

The lack of noise and distractions helps teachers keep the attention of their students. Underground structures can protect people against a broad range of natural and man-made disasters, and schools offer the additional advantage that they are generally located central to the highly populated regions where emergency shelters may be most needed. In many cases, these shools were built with the understanding that the schools would provide sanctuary for the community in the event of tornadoes. There are indications that revenue requirements for energy and maintenance of underground schools are likely to be significantly  less than requirements for comparable above ground schools. There are possibilities of making dual use of available land by building underground. Case studies of 12 schools show capacity, construction costs, floor plans, and photographs. (Author/MLF)",

This paper proposes a strategy for the dissemination of educational innovations that must be accompanied by substantial changes in adopters' attitudes. A critical element in the strategy is the shifting of responsibility to potential adopters for the development of materials/processes to be used in subsequent dissemination activities. A three-year networking consortia strategy using a variety of types of institutions and personnel is advocated. In addition to traditional dissemination outcomes (namely, spread through implementation), the strategy also results in a cadre of change agents in a  substantial number of organizations who, because of the commitment to the innovation fostered as a result of their developmental activities, are likely to continue dissemination efforts after external funding ceases.

The procedures in the program deal with conceptual sequential, and spatial skills and are designed to substitute for language in receiving, processing, and expressing abstract concepts that are fundamental to mathematics and reading (i.e., the concepts of space, sequential order, and class). Based on the hypothesis that children who are deficient in linguistic processing may be able to use spatial processing to solve problems and develop concepts, these  procedures are designed to stimulate abstract thinking and reasoning and to develop readiness for mathematics and language. Three studies are described, in which handicapped children showed significant gains in expressing concepts of space, order, and class as a result of these new art procedures. (DLS)",

The relative efficacy of word and sign codes in processing and retrieving information was studied by systematically varying the mode of presentation and the mode of retrieval of information, thus producing four conditions of the experiment: sign-sign, sign-word, word-sign, and word-word. Among the findings were that there was an overall performance difference in recall between deaf and hearing students, with hearing Ss doing better than deaf Ss; and that, more importantly, there was an overall imagery effect which showed that imagery facilitated memory for words  and signs for both deaf and hearing Ss. This facilitating effect was, however, absent in the word-sign condition for both groups. Findings suggested that words and signs are processed in a similar fashion. (Author/DLS)",

        "description":"Role play with toys was modeled to develop communicative language function in 14 visually impaired Ss (ages 8-26 years) who also were mentally retarded. Before treatment, Ss' language was non-communicating and characterized by echolalic and stereotypic verbal responses. Few questions and little narrative speech was present even in those Ss who had fully developed sentence structure. Among the findings was that the Ss acquired dialogue behavior as they learned to role-play. Communicative function was established with shared referents (play themes and toy props) and cooperative social routines (role play). Play themes which were of personal interest elicited the greatest participation. Nonverbal Ss did not develop symbolic play, but did establish communicative responses as they  began to anticipate and express preference. No change was noted in the level of syntax or vocabulary development in verbal Ss. Verbal expression increased and narrative and question forms appeared. Language behavior became more communicative and meaningful as social interaction increased. (Author/DLS)",

Child advocacy programs were visited and evaluated along criteria in five areas: prevention and identification, intake and assessment, treatment, followup, and reporting. Fundamental differences in the services' child advocacy programs are described. The Department of Defense (DOD)'s limited involvement with the military child advocacy programs is cited, and obstacles to cooperation between military child advocacy programs and civilian social welfare programs are noted. Among conclusions reported are that each of the three military services has established its own program to deal with child maltreatment without any overall DOD guidance, leading to inconsistent  policies. Recommendations made for improving the child advocacy programs include giving greater priority and resources to the programs while increasing education and training efforts. Reporting problems are cited, and a recommendation is made for establishing a single DOD policy concerning reporting procedures. (CL)",

Ss were given an assessment battery which included three major parts: tests for determining presence or absence of learning disability, an observational schedule to assist with the determination, and a set of marker tests designed to be used in a subsequent analysis for construct validation. A final decision rule for learning disability absence/presence was devised with a sequence of 10 decision points (such as a difference of 15 points between the reading and math tests). Among findings were that 3% of the nondelinquent sample were classified as learning disabled (LD) on the basis of wide  discrepancies within their performance on the tests or the presence of other indicators, but somehow had been able to achieve at least average scores for their age in reading and math, and were reclassified as non-LD by step 10; while in contrast, only on delinquent, less than a third of a percent, showed such a pattern.

The 105 universities responding to the questionnaire were organized according to the following categories: (1) organized bilingual institutions, that is, those having a person in charge of the organization of bilingualism and requiring all students to know both languages; (2) &quot;de facto&quot; bilingual institutions, or those which  require knowledge of both languages even though no one is in charge of the bilingualism; (3) unilateral bilingual institutions in which the majority of the courses are given in the language of one of the groups whose members can then easily not become bilingual; and (4) bilingual institutions comprised of &quot;two solitudes&quot; in which there is little contact between the two linguistic groups. Of the four types, the first one is in the minority with ten universities represented. Two appendices provide the questionnaires and a list of the universities in each category. (AMH)",

The findings are based on recorded samples of her speech in both languages elicited at three times: (1) immediately preceding the trip at age 3 years, 8 months; (2) 2 and l/2 months later; and (3) again 2 and l/2 months after her return to the United States. Three types of speech were elicited: vocabulary, structured narrative and free conversation. Before the vacation the child was English dominant; during it, her pronunication became perfectly French but her vocabulary and syntax included a good deal of interference from English. Two and one half months after her return, English was again dominant, but French was still active and much better than before the trip. The  taping sessions yielded data on vocabulary production that fall into five major categories: (1) bilingual maintenance; (2) patterns of forgetting; (3) patterns of learning; (4) indications of English dominance; and (5) absent lexical items at all stages in both languages. A summary of the child's narrative and conversation skills in the 3 stages, and samples of English interference in French at the end of stage 2 are provided. The overall picture is one of progress regarding the child's bilingualism. (AMH)",

Tasks that require the student to use inferential reasonsing or evaluative judgments develop comprehension of meaning. Attention to the global features of the grammar facilitates the recognition of word and phrase relationships within substantial structures.

It is suggested that faculty must be consulted in order to arrive at a mutually agreed upon structure, incorporating such areas as which sources should provide the information or data on which the evaluation will be based. Another consideration is the aspect of functional validity--how to insure that the instrument will be accepted and used by the faculty or institution. In order to assure that functional validity exists, a faculty role model must be established that the majority of the faculty believes to be an appropriate one for the institution. Among the roles generally established by faculty are advising, teaching, faculty service, research, and professional  status. Once functional validity is determined, psychometric validity can be established with accepted measurement and validation techniques. The next step is the development of a procedure to produce a singular index that is readily interpretable and will provide information that can be utilized for promotion, tenure, and merit-pay decisions. In order to allow for individual differences in faculty assignments while still allowing for comparison, a series of steps is outlined. An equation is presented which permits the overall composite rating of a faculty member to be computed in order to arrive at a merit pay increase based on the faculty evaluation procedure. (PHR)",

The various types and orientations of the studies reviewed are discussed and analyzed. The topic of sex discrimination was found to dominate a majority of the research on faculty women. Two types of discrimination studies are discussed: descriptive and explanatory. The descriptive research tended to produce similar conclusions: faculty women's mobility, promotion rates, salaries, access to research and opportunity networks, are all subject to discrimination in relation to men. The explanatory studies examine such questions as why there is discrimination and how it works. Productivity and success elements are also examined in  these studies that focus on the significance of the differences between males and females. The theme of discrimination was found to be central to the research on women administrators. In general the research shows that administrative employment patterns vary substantially by race and sex, and that salary differentials are most consistently related to sex. Examples from specific works are cited in the analysis of research on both women faculty and administrators. It is concluded that this literature review provides an assessment of the efforts to equalize the opportunities and advantages available to women. Recommendations for further study are included as well as an extensive bibliography. (SF)",

Supply is defined as the number of entrants into the job market, and demand as the number of job openings in that year. The data provide an update of information compiled in an earlier report for 1980. Information about the job market for college graduates in general and for various major fields of study is presented to assist students in making career choices. The figures presented are based on the South's share of projected degrees in the U.S. according to the U.S. Office of Education. Graduates are classified in 21 field of study categories and definitions are provided for the supply  and demand terms used in the data analysis. Employment prospects are discussed for 1985 graduates in the fields of health, architecture, accounting, engineering, library science, communications, law, social work, psychology, fine arts, computer sciences, mathematics, agriculture, biological and physical science, home economics, public affairs, and liberal arts. Supply and demand comparisons for 1985 are tabulated for several occupational fields showing average annual job openings and the number of degree recipients available in the related field. It is suggested that decisions about going to college and the choices of majors be based on several factors including employment outlook. Appended are data on 1985 degree recipients and a list of occupations included in the supply/demand  comparison. (Author/SF)",

IEP enables peer institutions to compare information about their resources. The major research universities formed a task group to determine the use of IEP's focus points: costing methods and possible alternative approaches to information exchange. The alternative methods to information exchange are examined in this document, which is one of the three documents that constitute the final report of the NCHEMS Major Research Universities Task Force. Areas examined are: the nature of major research universities; the role of management in these institutions; information and its interpretation; and information exchange and comparability. The data formats and  definitions are organized into seven major categories: program statement; student information; personnel information; finance information; instruction measures; research measures; and academic support information. Formats and definitions are offered based on the information needs of an academic department or other academic units. Together these formats and definitions constitute the conceptual structure of the information to be exchanged. The Major Research University-Information Exchange Procedures (MRU-IEP) concluded that by facilitating exchange among major research universities, this procedure manual will contribute to their more effective program. Possible improvements will be in such areas as: improved information formats, secured accountability protection, and improved diagnostic  tools for internal evaluation. Included are example charts, instructions on how to use the given format, and complete definitions in the various areas discussed. (LC)",

Evaluation of the IEP costing methods are examined in this document, which is intended as an appendix to &quot;Evaluation of the IEP Costing Procedures.&quot; A step-by-step commentary on the implementation and analysis of the NCHEMS cost-study procedures is presented, including suggested modifications. The six universities taking part in this study were: University of Colorado; University of Illinois; University of Kansas; Purdue University; State University of New York at Stony Brook; and University of Washington. Areas examined were: Student Programs and Academic Disciplines;  Student-Registration Data; Faculty Activity Data; Institutional Expenditure Data; Direct-Cost Data; Full-Cost Data; and Relation between Student Enrollment and Faculty Activity. It is noted that the universities often exhibited more similarity than dissimilarity; e.g., in their procedures for collecting data within their organizational departments. However, when findings were applied to the Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS) codes, clarification was needed, and a task group recommended a clarification of the HEGIS definitions. Each university's individual response is displayed in this document followed by the task group's evaluation and recommendation to NCHEMS. Included are graphs, tables, and statistics. (LC)",

        "description":"A selected population of 2,430 white, native-born, college freshmen women (under 22 years old) who remained at one institution for four years were studied to determine the effects of institutional and other variables on their career aspirations. Variables selected included background, career plans and self-esteem (after one, four, and five years), and college characteristics (including aspects of prestige, size, public/private, sectarian/nonsectarian, coed/women's, percent of women enrolled, percent of women in faculty, percent of BA's awarded in student's area, career indecision among freshmen, academic competitiveness, and perceived concern of faculty for students). Among conclusions were that women who enter college with BA/MA plans and low achievement are most likely to raise  their career plans if they attend highly selective women's colleges; women who enter college with high achievement and high self-esteem but BA/MA career plans are most likely to raise their career plans if they attend women's colleges, highly selective universities, and low selectivity nonsectarian coed colleges. Overall the effects on career plans and self-esteem are negative for large, public institutions with low selectivity, and positive for highly selective nonsectarian women's colleges.

        "description":"Trends and issues in the shift of four-year colleges and universities in adding associate degree occupational programs are considered. After a brief historical overview, the status of occupational programs at four-year institutions is discussed, with emphasis on the patterns of organization at various institutions. The shift in mission of the four-year institution is examined in light of its potential impact on community colleges. The following issues are addressed: admissions policies, the dominance of liberal arts influences, the two-plus-two concept (a technical two-year curriculum articulated with a two-year upper-division baccalaureate program), the adequacy of student services, coping with learning deficiencies, the labor market focus, granting credit for occupational  experience, and the formation of a new relationship with nontraditional segments. It is contended that the movement of the higher education community into occupational programs will be met either through self-initiated articulation or state-imposed regulations. It is concluded that the redirection of the institution's faculty, the revision of the curriculum, the redesign of the support system, and the reallocation of resources are all required in the process of adopting an occupational education focus. These questions must be considered as states reassess their master plans in higher education due to shifts in enrollment patterns. A 66-item bibliography is appended. (PHR)",

        "description":"The impact of selected aspects of the collegiate experience on changes in undergraduates' occupational preferences and personal goals is examined in this study. Two aspects of the college environment are assessed: the social structure and the students' perception of the institution's ability to facilitate the attainment of personal goals. The joint effects of family background, family socialization, and experiences at college on career choices are closely examined. Data were compiled from several national surveys of students and faculty in American colleges and universities. Undergraduates from 72 different institutions and majoring in either English, mathematics, history, or political science were surveyed. The academic department is viewed as an important influence on both  faculty and students. Multiple regression analyses are provided for each major field by sex with prestige of upper division career choice as the dependent variable. Results indicate that the single most important predictor of career prestige aspirations was the prestige of the occupation to which upper division undergraduates aspired at entrance to college as freshmen. Faculty seemed to be more influential with respect to students' values than career aspirations. The results indicate the importance of examining conceptually defined organizational units when studying college impacts on career aspirations. (Author/SF)",

The effects on the institutions and medical programs were examined by analyzing the information regarding: (1) the school's decision to convert to a three-year program, (2) the process by which such programs were adopted and conducted, (3) the attitudes toward the program by the school administration, department chairman, faculty, and students, (4) graduate appraisals, (5) the curricular characteristics, and (6) the comparative nature of financial, admissions, student, and related institution variables with those of selected schools conducting four-year programs. Study schools were classified on  the basis of their provision of a required or optional program. Further distinction was made for old schools and new schools. A total of 18 institutions participated in the project. Data were derived primarily from: the study schools, the Institutional Profile System (IPS) maintained by the Association of American Medical Colleges, the survey instrument developed for the study, and the institutional site visits to 16 schools. It was found that the major impetus for change to a three-year program came from the deans or the administrative staff and major opposition came from the medical basic science department chairman. Included are the questionnaire, questionnaire responses, and several tables and charts. (LC)",

Demand was measured by the dependent variable of number of applications received by the institution. A model of independent variables that determine the demand was presented, including both exogenous variables, such as demographic patterns, national and regional economic conditions, the cost of competing institutions, and the economic benefit of a college education; and endogenous variables, such as costs of the institution, financial aid available, alumni assistance, students enrolled, recruiting effort, and public relations effort. Two anonymous case studies of institutions that were analyzed by this method are presented. A regression analysis was applied, and those measures of the  variables that explain the most variation in the dependent variable were determined. It was concluded that this approach is one with much potential for specific institutions, but that the results obtained are not yet generalizable. It is suggested that further research with several institutions be undertaken to determine those factors which seem to be most determinant of the demand for college education. (Author/PHR)",

The general posture of the associations appears to be limited to expressions of support for resolutions of affirmative action in hiring and admissions. Data on minority enrollment was limited and sometimes conflicting. The best and most timely information came from law and medical associations. The problem of certification and credentialing are explored: often it is currently assumed that if a minority individual is certified it is because the standards were lowered, or because of special treatment. It is suggested that  associations could play a vital role in disseminating information on successful programs, and that their participation would increase minority participation in academic training. It is stressed that the passive role which associations have played in minority participation is not adequate, that they have a responsibility to actively lead in the promotion of minority involvement in academic and professional training.

While efficiency is primarily concerned with cost minimization concepts, effectiveness is concerned with the achievement of organizational goals. Management information systems--which gather data and organize them into meaningful, timely flows of information for the decision-making process--must consider the characteristics of amount, form, and flow of information, as well as the effectiveness and efficiency criteria of successful decisions. If it is accepted that colleges do in fact have an impact on student outcomes and are concerned  with how they contribute to those outcomes, then it is appropriate to consider how data about such outcomes can be included in the information systems used by the colleges in making decisions. The data bases used must include data relevant to the defined student outcome goals and objectives of the institution. Several efforts made to develop data bases that do include information relevant to student outputs are described. A management information system that incorporates student outcomes has been developed which may make it possible for the academic decision-making process, as well as future evaluations and accountability studies, to address directly a more comprehensive group of efficiency and effectiveness criteria.

The objectives of higher education include the personal development and education of students, not merely the certification of students by conferring degrees.

Such indicators are needed as input to the administrative process for use in planning effectively and efficiently and in allocating resources to the various alternatives intended to achieve the defined objectives. A review of the literature concerned with the planning  and resource allocation process in non-profit environments is presented. A conceptual mode is developed which demonstrates a means by which administrators may incorporate data and information about student outcomes in the planning and resource allocation process. The model uses student inputs, institutional environmental characteristics, and student outcomes in a process designed to develop and implement programs and activities designed to accomplish defined goals and objectives. These variables are evaluated in a feedback link against desired levels defined in the initial steps of the process. A scheme for developing and collecting the kinds of information needed for the analytical evaluation of program impact on students and for integrating that information into the planning and  resource allocation process is provided.

The major objective of the study was to isolate and describe the differences that exist in the rates and modes of attrition among students who entered the college as freshmen under: (1) the regular admissions program; (2) the Equal Opportunity Program; and (3) the Regional Service Program. Attrition rate for males and females within each of these three programs are examined. Students admitted under special admissions programs were found to leave early in greater proportion than students who entered under the regular admissions program. The rate and mode of attrition did not vary among men and women in  general. Admitting students under special admissions programs appears to add between 7 and 12 percent to the total attrition rate.

        "description":"Four federal programs were investigated for inconsistencies in awarding financial aid to college students: the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, Basic Educational Opportunity Grants, College Work-Study Program, and National Direct Student Loan Program. Their methods for determining student need and their legislative histories are described. The allocation of campus-based funds is examined and it is concluded that the formulas allotting campus-based aid to states are inadequate and inconsistent in their treatment of need. It is also suggested that institutions inflate the amounts requested on applications for aid. Different systems used for determining need are discussed, that produce different measures of need assessment and increase processing costs. It is recommended  that a single need analysis formula be instituted. Inconsistent distribution of aid to students is examined in terms of over-awards and unmet needs. It is suggested that too often the neediest students are not always awarded the most aid. Identifying overlaps with other aid sources such as veterans assistance and athletic scholarships is recommended to insure equity, and maintenance of academic standards is considered an important criteria for awarding aid. A glossary of terms is provided. Appended are an overview of Office of Education student aid programs for fiscal years 1974-78, information used in selecting postsecondary schools for this study, and a letter from the Office of Management and Budget.

        "description":"The transcript of joint hearings on college assistance legislation before the Senate Committee on Human Resources and the House Committee on Education and Labor is presented. The hearings concern amendment of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to improve the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant (BEOG) program. Witnesses included Joseph A. Califano, Jr., Ernest Boyer, and Michael O'Keefe. Discussion focused on providing or altering aid programs to compensate middle-income students. A majority of the aid proposed would be channeled through the BEOG program. Increased funding is also discussed for the Supplemental Grants and College Work-Study programs. The increased funding would be aimed at families with incomes between $8,000 and $16,000. It is estimated that in 1979 this would mean  an eligible pool of 640,000 students, more than doubling the number of awards in federal student assistance programs from 3.2 million in 1978 to more than 7 million in 1979. Also discussed are tuition tax credits, aid to parochial and private schools, elementary and secondary schools, loan defaults, and state insured loan agencies. Several alternative methods of delivering higher education assistance to middle income students are also examined. Also included is information on states that are starting their own student loan agencies. (SF)",

        "description":"An update, as of 1977, of four National Center for Education Statistics reports concerned with changing patterns in degree awards to women is presented. Separate chapters are devoted to bachelor's, master's, doctoral, and first-professional degrees. Each chapter consists of an overview, an examination by field of study of the percentage representation of women among degree recipients in 1977 as compared with 1971, and an examination of the relative popularity of different fields of study for men and for women, and how this has changed between 1971 and 1977. An overall finding of the report is that most of the trends identified in the four small reports continue to be evident in the 1977 data. Among findings are that at all four degree levels women continued to increase their  percentage representation among degree recipients; that in 1977 women accounted for 46.2 percent of the bachelor's degrees, 47.1 percent of the master's degrees, 24.3 percent of the doctoral degrees, and 18.7 percent of the first-professional degrees; and that at both the bachelor's and master's levels women tended to show the greatest increases in those fields in which they have traditionally had small representation.

Two assumptions are explained on which the analysis is based; i.e., that the mission of higher education is teaching, scholarship, and service to the community and that public higher education is rightfully under the authority of the governor and legislature of the state. Possible objections to the second assumption are discussed and a third assumption is addressed--that there has been a sharp increase in the volume and techniques of state regulation in recent years. Ten techniques for regulating higher education, such as regulation of the structure and power of the governing boards, are listed. It is stressed that this trend is likely to continue and limitations in the  regulatory techniques make it difficult for an elected official to effectively exercise responsibility for higher education. The consequences of regulation are examined and it is suggested that the thrust of the controversy over regulation should focus not on the authority of government to regulate, but on the manner in which the authority is exercised. Arguments for the delegation of authority are considered and means of that delegation to public higher education, while still remaining effectively accountable, are explored. (PHR)",

Divided in two sections (Regional Action for Change and Resources for Change), various authors present information on target areas for improvement. Such areas include competency-based education, programs for faculty improvement, improving instruction for undergraduates, and the development of human resources. Some changes suggested are: (1) off-campus education in the form of internship programs as well as credit given for past learning; (2) variations in the duration of education, such as the three-year bachelor's degree; (3) increased student participation in program development; and (4) changes and  variations in teaching methods in the form of tutorial programs, independent study, and use of the media. Several methods of implementing change were adapted such as: a clearinghouse of information about programs of change and new directions; study areas in which change is contemplated or is taking place; establishment of authoritative bodies charged with making recommendations for change; and a program of information directed to those influential segments of the community likely to be interested in promoting educational change. Future SREB plans consist of putting into action the recommendations and ideas within this report. A listing of the regional resources for change in undergraduate education is appended. (LC)",

An assessment instrument was developed to assess teaching effectiveness. Analysis of the results seemed to indicate that instructors in Anthropology were rated differently by their students in spite of extensive research findings to the contrary. On careful examination of the data it was discovered that the female instructors were teaching a disproportionately higher number of courses at the freshman level than their male counterparts. Since there had been extensive research evidence reporting more favorable ratings being assigned by graduate and/or upper division  students the data in the present study needed further examination. When the ratings for the male and female instructors were reexamined within each course level all significant differences disappeared except at the freshman level, where the males were rated significantly more favorably than the females. It is noted that there were more females teaching multiple sections of a single course at the freshman level than males, which may account for the rating variance. (Author/PHR)",

It is proposed that UNESCO/IFLA organize a scheme of international cooperation in education for librarianship in order to ensure wider utilization of resources. Teletuition, staff exchanges, and sharing of educational software are some methods suggested. (Author/JEG)",

        "description":"ARAP-SIS, Arapahoe Community College's (ACC's) student follow-up system, consists of seven subsystems. Between 1976 and 1978, five of these were implemented. Data from the goals and intent subsystem revealed that 60% of the students who declared a goal intended to receive an associate degree in an academic field, though many were occupational majors. The course withdrawal subsystem focused on reasons for withdrawal and potential benefits from counseling, while the college withdrawal subsystem looked at students' major, reasons for withdrawal, use of student services, and intention to return to ACC. In both studies, the most frequently cited reason for withdrawal was conflicting job hours. Another subsystem considered students who enrolled for courses but did not show up during  the first two weeks. Discounting the many students who actually desired to be reinstated, 26% of the &quot;no shows&quot; or &quot;walk ins&quot; did not attend because of conflicting job hours and 25% because of personal or family reasons. The graduate follow-up subsystem investigated selected student characteristics, career and educational objectives and present status, employment background, transfer problems, relatedness of ACC training to job, interest in returning to ACC, satisfaction with college services and preparation, job prospects, and salaries. Summarized findings are provided and tables present selected data for each subsystem. (AYC)",

Among the mutual interests and topics discussed were: community involvement in planning and conducting programs; changing needs for trained workers; lifelong learning; basic literacy education; problems of reaching disadvantaged adults with educational programs; use of professionals as part-time teachers; sending students to work and learn with practitioners at work sites; and opportunities for international cooperation and technical assistance among institutions providing short-cycle programs. Representatives from the following countries discussed  advancements, trends, and problems on a national level: Netherlands, Great Britain, Iran, Taiwan, Jordan, Norway, Australia, India, Venezuela, Yugoslavia, Barbados, Costa Rica, and Ireland. Much discussion centered on programs for adults and variations in problems and approaches from country to country. Among examples presented were: the Open University in Great Britain; study circles in Norway; correspondence courses in India; language variations in Iran; teacher shortages in Venezuela; and experiments with new modes of teaching in several countries. The report concludes with a review of recent United Nations Economic and Social Council (UNESCO) activities in the field of non-formal, post-secondary education. (Author/AYC)",

Data for this study were collected from approximately 475 children at the beginning and end of kindergarten and at the end of third grade. Measures included achievement tests for several subects, a paper-pencil intelligence test, and paper-pencil self-report instruments on aspects of social-emotional state such as self-acceptance, social maturity, and school affiliation. Findings showed that home background, intellect, social-emotional factors and achievement were related to each other in different ways depending  upon sex-race group, in addition to differences existing for either sex or race alone. The identification of apparently influential roles played by certain factors other than intellect for the achievement levels attained by the separate sex-race groups was interpreted as indicating that it is simplistic to ascribe critical importance to racial differences in intellectual ability as the Jensen approach does.

The major sources of data were daily logs kept by parents of the type and frequency of programs watched by their children over two-week periods four different times during the year; concurrent observations and ratings of overt physical aggression directed toward other children on property during free play in nursery school; and family interview questionnaires concerning daily routines in the home, patterns of  discipline, leisure activities, TV viewing habits, and indications of family difficulties. Data from the parent logs and observations were based on a sample of 141 three- and four-year-olds, while the interviews were given to a subset of four groups of children (N=10 per group) who represented the extremes in both TV viewing and aggression. Correlations between weekly TV viewing and aggression (r=.35) were significant, even with the effects of socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and IQ partialed out. Further analyses suggest a causal direction from heavy TV viewing to aggressive behavior. Results of the family interview study indicated significant differences among the groups of extremes on the level of order and organization in the family, and on the degree of outside activities engaged in  by the family.

        "description":"Studies investigating selected aspects of children's television viewing are described and the findings are used as the basis of a theoretical formulation in which young children's television viewing is seen as a transactional process similar to other normal information processing activities. According to this formulation, the child's motivation to understand what he or she is viewing is a primary driving force of attention to television. Children develop a sophisticated strategy which allows them to effectively divide their visual attention between television and other activities, such as toy play. This strategy depends heavily on the children's use of program attributes as cues to whether the current content is or is not informative. If the attribute signals informative content,  the child pays full attention to the television and actively attempts to understand the program. Attributes such as children's voices, peculiar voices, women's voices, sound effects, auditory changes, applause, and laughter have been shown to elicit and maintain looking at the television. It is argued that the effects of these attributes stem from the information which they provide the child about the likely comprehensibility of the content. For example, peculiar voices on television almost always mean content meant for children. It is suggested that with time, the child comes to learn these characteristics of the television medium and employ them to direct attention. (JMB)",

Empathic distress must be viewed as only one component of a person's response when observing someone in distress. Studies of empathy should be designed to rule out or control the non-empathic components insofar as possible. The importance of perception and cognition for affective empathy has probably been overemphasized. While it is commonly held that role-taking (a cognitive skill) is necessary for empathy to mediate helping, a case can be made for the proposition that empathy often fosters role-taking rather than the reverse. The question of age differences in empathy remains an unresolved issue. Research studies utilizing cognitively oriented measures tend to find age differences while  those employing non-verbal measures do not. An ideal empathy index would include evidence that (1) affect has been aroused in the observer and (2) the affect experienced by the observer is sufficiently close in quality and direction to the affect experienced by the model that it can be considered a vicarious response. The use of facial response as an index of empathy seems promising enough to warrant further investigation. Attempts have been made to circumvent certain ethical, value issues by proposing that children be trained in affective empathy which will contribute to prosocial behavior rather than being trained for prosocial behavior directly. This approach raises ethical questions of its own which need to be discussed. (JMB)",

        "description":"This report provides articles on several topics related to the education of young children. In the introduction High/Scope President David P. Weikart suggests that public investment in preschool education is a wise and economically sound social policy. New studies of the long term effects of preschool are demonstrating the staying power of early education experiences that took place almost 20 years ago. William Fabricius places Immanuel Kant's conclusions about reality and knowledge in the context of Enlightenment and Romantic philosophy, and explores some parallels and divergencies between Kantian and Piagetian theories. Robert Halpern discusses economic issues pertinent to international policy for preschool programs. James T. Bond, Lynne Tamor and Robert D. Matz discuss  High/Scope research on a range of measures of children's writing abilities. Robert L. Egbert and Margaret E.G. Brisch argue that early childhood programs derived from a single pedagogical perspective are more likely to produce coherent and consistent results than the eclectic approaches that until recently have marked the field. Bernard Banet envisions increased uses in education for tiny, inexpensive computers and related electronic devices. Ann S. Epstein and Judith Evans discuss results of High/Scope longitudinal research which indicate positive and negative dimensions of parent-child interaction which predict children's scholastic performance. Their findings point to the conclusion that the mother-child relationship both influences and is influenced by children's early learning  styles. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Deficits involving metamemory (knowledge about memory) were investigated for elderly individuals in unfamiliar laboratory tasks. In Experiment I, 23 college age subjects and 23 active, community dwelling elderly subjects, roughly matched on socioeconomic status, were given a picture span estimation task, a test of actual span, and then a recall readiness task. In the recall readiness phase, each subject was given subspan (span minus 2), span, and supraspan (span plus 2) lists of pictures and told to take as much time as needed to insure accurate serial recall. The community dwelling elderly individuals were found to recall span and supraspan length lists more poorly than young subjects. The elderly also took considerably less time for study (in the supraspan condition, 30 seconds  as opposed to 59 seconds for the young subjects). In Experiment II, prompting a chunking-rehearsal strategy led to somewhat improved performance in the elderly, but merely requiring the elderly to take sufficient time for study led to virtually perfect recall. The data suggest that the older adults were not strategy deficient, but rather may have failed to monitor their readiness to recall so that they did not know how long to study. Since metamemory deficits do appear in laboratory-type tasks, such deficits may, at least in part, account for the frequent poor performance of the elderly in such situations. (Author/JMB)",

A procedure for assessing the sophistication of spontaneous play in 1- to 3-year-old children is described, and the relation of play to general cognitive functioning in the same age period is discussed. Evidence supporting the use of play as a cognitive assessment tool is presented from longitudinal studies of children tested periodically with Piagetian and psychometric developmental scales, from research correlating play sophistication and Bayley Mental Scale performance in 1 1/2- to 2-year-old  normal children, and from research relating play and cognitive functioning in autistic and mentally retarded populations.

An 8-factor solution was accepted as the best one and cross-validation analyses showed it to be stable. A comparison with a 7-factor solution previously obtained in a group of 3- to 10-month-old infants revealed high similarity in dimensional structure between the two age groups. Apart from an additional eighth factor appearing in the older sample, the same seven dimensions were obtained. These were named Intensity/Activity, Regularity,  Approach-Withdrawal, Sensory Sensitivity, Attentiveness, Manageability, and Sensitivity to New Food.

A method which indexed developmental changes in the understanding of both intersubjective rules of interpersonal behavior and subjective individual perspectives was devised to research questions concerning (1) the relation between causal inferences and formal operational thinking skills or context dependency, and (2) the relationship between perspective taking-ability and person perception. Boys and girls clearly characterizied by either concrete operational transitional, and fully formal operational skills were formed into sex balanced groups of 20 subjects each. Cognitive ability level was assessed and the vocabulary subtest on the  WISC or the WAIS was administered. Subjects were then individually presented three fairy-tale segments, with pictorial sequences. The stories chosen included causal chains of events which were available to the subject, but which lent themselves to different interpretations by characters in the stories. Each subject was asked to retell the story as presented to him or her, relate the story first from the perspective of the protagonist and then from that of a late-arriving bystander, and answer questions after each story. Story reconstructions were content analyzed. Among the results, formal operational subjects were more interpretive and psychological in their responses than both their concrete and transitional counterparts. Concrete and transitional subjects did not significantly differ.  (Author/RH)",

The objectives were: (1) to establish the asynchrony between class inclusion and role-taking on an Irish sample and a French sample of preoperational children, and (2) to investigate whether this asynchrony is merely a function of the difficulty of the measures used or whether a developmental sequence is entailed by the sequence. Subjects were 72 Irish 5- and 7-year-old children and 72 French 6- and 7-year-old children. Six tasks were used to measure class inclusion. Three cartoons, each of which was followed by two role-taking questions, were used to measure role-taking ability. Following pretesting, subjects were assigned to either a control group or one of two  training groups, class-inclusion or role-taking training. Training procedures emphasized verbal inducement of conflict. Results indicated the following: First, a developmental asynchrony was confirmed in which class inclusion emerged prior to role-taking. Second, training in class inclusion and in role-taking significantly increased the skill trained as indicated on posttest scores. Third, training in role-taking, which was successful only with 7-year-olds, significantly increased class inclusion scores at this age level; successful training in class inclusion, however, did not increase role-taking significantly. It is concluded that the form of role-taking measured includes the mental operations necessary for class inclusion. (Author/SS)",

        "description":"The ability to empathize, or experience the emotions of another individual, has frequently been suggested as an important factor in the child's moral development and expression of prosocial behaviors. The present investigation sought to explore the relationship between the young child's empathy (as assessed by the Feshbach and Roe measure) and the parents' self-reported empathy, affection, and emphasis on another individual's feelings in discipline and nondiscipline situations. A total of 54 preschool and kindergarten children, 26 boys and 28 girls from two-parent families in a small middle class community in northeastern Kansas, took part in the study. All but two of the children were Caucasian. The age range for the entire sample was 47-77 months, with a mean of 62.54 months.  Over 75% of both the mothers (mean age = 32.00 years) and fathers (mean age = 33.35 years) had had at least two years of college education. No relationship between boys' empathy scores and the parent measures was found. Heightened empathy in 4- to 6-year-old girls was found to be associated with a particular, sex-stereotyped pattern of mother-father empathy in which mothers reported high empathy and fathers reported low empathy. Many of the factors believed to enhance the development of empathy were reported to be more prevalent in the mother's interaction with the child than in the father's. (Author/RH)",

The purpose of this manual is to assist educators and concerned lay persons in establishing an outdoor education program with an instructional strategy that will manipulate students into becoming responsible, ethical, respectful outdoor citizens. Both lay persons and educators can use the detailed manual explanations, directions, and hints to guide them through the entire process of designing an Environmental Respect curriculum package, from program inception through approval and implementation to evaluation and modification. Five sample Curriculum Lesson Ideas (Investigating Wildlife, Investigating Hunting, Investigating Fishing, Investigating Hiking and Camping, and Survival) attempt to  bring out the unique qualities of this outdoor education philosophy which emphasizes developing environmental respect by utilizing the outdoor sports. Respectful behavior is the essence of the units which begin with an introduction and a topic outline. For each topic there is an overview, a basic approach, and behavioral objectives with activities for achieving them. A resource section lists sources of appropriate teaching materials for each unit. Additional resource material sources such as federal and state agencies, associations, and companies are listed in an appendix. (SB)",

        "description":"Planning an expedition, particularly an expedition to climb Mount McKinley, can appear monumental. Not only must the obvious items like food, equipment and personnel be carefully planned, but attention must also focus on &quot;insignificant&quot; items like applications and reservations which, if forgotten, could mean the difference between a successful or unsuccessful expedition. Climbing partners should be selected for their skill, dependability, compatability and reliability. Practice climbs beforehand will help the group learn to function as a team and test new clothing and equipment. Team members should contribute to expenses from the very first; with money actually invested, people are less likely to back out at the last moment. Both physical and mental conditioning should be  undertaken before the trip; embarking on an expedition in poor physical condition is a miserable way to get in shape and a dangerous one, too. Food planning must take into account such considerations as that at high altitudes it takes more fuel and time to cook foods, the body tends to dehydrate, and the metabolism loses its ability to fully utilize fats. Food should never be packed in the same bag with fuel; strange new flavors may result. Other areas for expedition planning discussed in this paper include equipment and clothing needs, climbing strategy and tactics, and collection of equipment and packing. Additional information sources on expedition planning, mental conditioning, medical information and routes are also given. (DS)",

        "description":"Outdoor leaders constantly face problems created by water shortage and, to act effectively, must thoroughly understand the body's use of water and the ways to delay dehydration when water shortage occurs. Dehydration begins when there is a negative water balance, or more water lost than ingested, and progresses from the stage of dryness, to the &quot;cotton mouth&quot; stage, and finally to the stage of structural degeneration. The symptoms of dehydration progress from thirst and general uneasiness to sensory impairment and inability to think rationally. Dehydration can be counteracted by increasing water intake and reducing water loss. The body assimilates fresh water most easily, but other water sources are available to the knowledgeable person. For example, urine of a fully hydrated  person may be ingested while urine of a dehydrated person should not be ingested, though it can be used to lower skin temperature through evaporation; wash wounds, stings, and bites; or operate a solar still. Reduction of water loss is accomplished by proper ingestion of available water, preventing perspiration, using clothing to protect from heat and evaporation, and avoiding all types of dehydrators, i.e., alcohol, blood, salt, proteins, and fats.

        "description":"To aid communities with similar concerns, this bulletin shares the proceedings of a workshop which focused on local issues surrounding rural crime and its prevention. Eight members of the Fairfield County (Ohio) Resource Development Committee assessed the need for and support of a workshop, invited speakers, scheduled a meeting place, printed an agenda, and wrote newspaper publicity articles; 32 participants were recruited representing local businesses, Chamber of Commerce, service clubs, juvenile court, law enforcement departments, churches, and all elementary and secondary schools. These participants represented two separate interests--lay persons and school teachers. Teachers' discussions emphasized the schools (especially grades 4-8) as a relevant mechanism to address the  rural crime problem and reviewed available teacher's guides, while the lay oriented discussions focused on identifying the nature and scope of county crime problems and what the county, community, and individual property owners can do to prevent or reduce crime. Evaluation of the workshop by 24 participants revealed that 46% rated its overall helpfulness as excellent and 46% rated it as good. As a result of the workshop, &quot;hopes&quot; for the future are that the entire community can be motivated, that community leaders can be made more aware of crime prevention, that school programs will be implemented, and that a crime prevention program will be initiated in Fairfield County.

        "description":"In order to determine the cognitive development of Navajo children in terms of Piagetian conservation of number, mass, and continuous quantity, 168 Navajo children at seven different age levels from 5 to adult were presented with a series of three conservation tasks. The tasks consisted of a standard object and an equivalent object that could be made to vary quantitatively and perceptually. The resulting incidence of conservation was low. Conservation was both age and task related. Subjects under 9 years of age did not conserve, but conservation increased towards adulthood, with adults measuring 78% conservers. More conservation occurred on the number task than on either of the others. The data support the Piagetian thesis that children develop cognitively according to a  predetermined order of stages, but the low incidence of conservation among Navajo children suggests a &quot;time-lag&quot; in cognitive development for the group as compared to the dominant Western culture. This leads to the idea that Piagetian theory may be ethnocentric. (Author/SB)",

        "description":"In an experiment designed to determine their use of relational terms, 168 Navajo children aged 5 to adult attempted three relational tasks regarding the concepts of upward, downward, and equality comparison in the areas of mass, number, and continuous quantity. All subjects used the relational terms of &quot;more&quot;, &quot;less&quot;, and &quot;same&quot; correctly in all three content areas. However, the spontaneous use of the term &quot;same&quot; was significantly greater than that of &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less&quot;. The mean number of subjects aged 11 who spontaneously used the term &quot;same&quot; was 22, while the age 11 means for the terms &quot;less&quot; and &quot;more&quot; were 2 and 3, respectively. The Navajo language apparently treats the concepts of &quot;more&quot; and &quot;less&quot; differently from the concept of &quot;same&quot;, even though all are absolute concepts.  Children whose first language is Navajo may continue to conceptualize in an absolute, non-relational manner even in subsequent uses of English. If the use of relational terms is a predictor of Piagetian conservation acquisition, a &quot;time-lag&quot; in attaining conservation is expected in speakers whose first language is Navajo.

It is suggested that research on other constructions can lead to implications for teaching these constructions when there is sufficient convergence of research results. The following areas are surveyed and then related to certain principles of language learning and acquisition: (1) strategies of formation across languages; (2) use in oral/written and planned/unplanned speech in English; (3) acquisition in English as a first language; and (4) acquisition in English as a second language. Results suggest that certain types of relative clauses are easier to  learn in a formal classroom situation, while others might be better acquired outside the classroom. Results also suggest that if relative clauses are to be taught, they should be taught only for certain purposes. (Author/AMH)",

This research describes three methods of analyzing the problems in foreign language learning and suggests their complementary role in predicting and explaining difficulties. It is limited to phonetic problems in French encountered by English-speaking students. Specifically, the following topics are treated: (1) the respective roles of contrastive analysis and error analysis; (2) a study of the contribution of the method of Students' Perception of Difficulty (SPD); and (3) exploration of the possibility of complementary use of the three methods for predictive and diagnostic  purposes. An introductory chapter describes the state of the question regarding the three approaches. The contrastive analysis method of Lampach and Martinet is translated and adapted in the second chapter. Following this, an experiment in error analysis and the SPD approach is described and the results presented. It is concluded that not one of the methods is adequate by itself, but that a combination of the three approaches could predict learning difficulties and the data of the contrastive analysis could explain them. Further, the results of error analysis could validate the predictions of a contrastive analysis approach. (AMH)",

        "description":"The linguistic situation in Nigeria might be represented as a pyramid with a base composed of 400-500 native languages of which about 100 have been alphabetized. Of these, 51 with more than 100,000 speakers each, are considered regional languages; ten, with more than 1 million speakers each, are considered inter-regional languages; and three having more than 10 million speakers each are national languages. Besides these, there are three languages with special sociolinguistic functions: Pidgin, the contact language; English, the official administrative and educational language; and Arabic, the language used for religious purposes by a large segment of the population. This situation is the context for the discussion of the following: (1) education in general; (2) Nigerian languages  and education; (3) the position of English, Pidgin, Arabic, and French with regard to education; and (4) the standardization of Nigerian languages and education. It is concluded that a uniform and centralized policy could not be applied to the entire country, but that each state, and even each ethnic group, would have to find a workable formula adapted to local, regional, and national needs. A solution might be to use the native language of the children involved for elementary education. This would be followed by education in either a second Nigerian language or in English, depending on the part of the country. (AMH)",

At present Zaire is regaining its authenticity especially through the effort to promote its native language and literature. At the same time, French is also gaining ground due to the increase in formal education, still almost totally in French. Summaries of the research are given in the following areas: (1) population trends; (2) situations of French usage, including a discussion of direct and indirect use of the spoken and written language in relation to social milieu, sex, and education level; and (3) a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of French instruction on all levels. It is concluded that the adoption of methods of teaching French as a second language will allow the child and adolescent to  establish a balance between the discovery and affirmation of his or her own identity and the desire to be open to the outside world. This balance would favor a better knowledge of French, not as a vehicle of civilization, but as a communication tool. (AMH)",

        "description":"The goal of this study is to discover the phonetic difficulties encountered in the acquisition of French as a second language by English-speaking children. The children are studying French in a total immersion situation without benefit of structural exercises or special French language laboratory classes. Of particular interest here is the extent to which the difficulties of English-speaking children are due to characteristics proper to French, to interference from English, or to the conditions under which they were learning French. To this end, ten subjects, 12 years of age, made three recordings each. The recorded data covered the following areas: (1) a three-minute conversation in which the subject spoke about film he or she had seen the previous day; (2) repetition of model  sentences chosen for their phonetic difficulties; and (3) reading and writing of these same sentences by each student. Isolation and classification of the errors was done so that their nature, frequency, and level could be analyzed. From this analysis, the six phenomena studied here were isolated: (1) opening of high voewls; (2) devoicing of oral consonants; (3) the affrication of unvoiced occlusives; (4) variation of tone and retarding of nasalization; (5) liaison and elision; and (6) accentuation.

Of particular interest was the extent to which language requirements and language training are included in corporate planning. Also investigated was the extent to which occupationally oriented special purpose language training is included in the language training provided to corporate employees. Responses were obtained to a 12-page questionnaire from 129 American firms doing business abroad. Among the findings are the following: (1) Spanish is the language most studied by U.S nationals going abroad to work and also the language most involved in translation and interpreting; (2) U.S. corporations doing business abroad rely primarily on English as the  business means of communication; (3) language training is provided to a majority of U.S. national employees going overseas and outranks technical, cultural, and managerial training in the type of training provided; (4) languages for special purposes training is only rarely included in U.S. national employees' preassignment language instruction; (5) English is generally the language in which technical training is given to non-U.S. national employees overseas; and (6) a far greater commitment exists to language training (specifically English language training) for non-U.S. national employees than for U.S. national employees.

The students judged American knowledge of Japanese culture to be meager, but were in general confident in their own grasp of American culture. This knowledge of the American way of life was not attributed to secondary school programs in Japan, which were perceived to be weak in the area of cross-cultural training. Limited English-speaking ability was identified as the most important but not the only factor in the communication barrier between Japanese and Americans. Although the students tended to minimize their adjustment problems, they may have been overestimating the degree to which they  had successfully adjusted. The overall results of the survey indicate an awareness of cultural differences and a confidence that these are being coped with, notwithstanding an apparent lack of sufficient academic preparation to justify this confidence.

Later-emerging &quot;wh&quot; forms were used with a greater variety of verbs than earlier forms, in a pattern that suggests the involvement of both the syntactic function of individual &quot;wh&quot; forms and the semantics of descriptive verbs. Finally, the use of ellipsis in forming &quot;wh&quot; questions emerged with the development of the capacity to formulate contingent queries for further information. (JB)",

Chapter 2 presents the cultural context surrounding puebloan forms of Indian English as an integral part in the descriptive  facets and educational implications of the study. The description of the spoken language data in Chapter 3 concentrates on San Juan English and Chapter 4 is a comparison of San Juan and Laguna English. Chapter 5 considers in detail the question of spoken language influence on reading and writing in San Juan and Laguna. Chapter 6 concludes with educational implications of varieties of English in the pueblos. (NCR)",

The study of groups represents, therefore, a good vehicle to reveal the most significant validating systems of Quebec society. The presentation of this study has five parts: (1) the formation and composition of the MQF with emphasis on the significance of the presence within the movement of representatives of labor unions and agriculture; (2) analysis of the situation, specifically of the ideological discourse of the MQF with regard to its position on the French language, bilingualism, and its solution to the problem; (3) an analysis  of the organization itself and its objectives with emphasis on its resources, strategies, modes of action, and factors working against its stated objectives; (4) an analysis of the goals which motivate the positions and actions of the MQF, in particular as they are expressed in the concepts of authority, participation, and change; and (5) a general conclusion presenting the results of the study as compared with the hypotheses, an analysis of the MQF's value system and the degree to which variations in its activity might have affected its feelings of competence, power and self-confidence, and suggestions for changes which might increase the influence of the MQF.

The second part of the report outlines a comprehensive state-wide foreign language and international studies program. Basic premises of such a program assume that each student should have the opportunity to learn a foreign language, and that successful foreign language learning requires high standards from specific curricula. To meet  learning objectives, a comprehensive program design provides for various approaches to foreign language instruction, including immersion and bilingual programs, at the preschool, elementary, secondary, and continuing education levels. Finally, general recommendations and specific action steps are set forth which cover state and regional advisory structure, visibility and awareness activities, curriculum and resource development, state office leadership, and student-focused activities.

Among findings from the 22-item survey, 84 percent of which were returned, were that 80 percent disagreed that licensing examinations should differ for graduates from the ADN/Dip Nursing Programs and the Baccalaureate Nursing Programs (BSN), 88 percent of the respondents disagreed that plans should be made to develop and implement the BSN as the entry level for Florida, and 90 percent disagreed that the BSN degree should be the minimum entrance level for professional nursing. Other findings revealed that 90 percent disagreed that all nurses should have a BSN,  and 81 percent felt that all graduates should take the same licensing exam. Comments indicated that both the associate and the baccalaureate degree programs must be revised to include more clinical experience in each curriculum. Articulation mechanisms must be created to allow any who wish to advance from nurse's aide to any higher degree without penalty and repetition of content. Appended are the survey instrument, cover letter, and a map showing the sample coverage. (Author/PHR)",

        "description":"The proceedings of the 28th annual Legislative Work Conference of the Southern Regional Education Board are presented. Facts and issues surrounding faculty salaries and compensation are discussed in articles by David Spence and Richard Chait. Among trends to emerge from the articles is the fact that faculty salaries in the South have halved the gap between that region and the rest of the nation in the past five years. Senator Pat Frank (Florida) and Gordon Davies discuss access, quality, and competition in graduate education. The articles stress the need for upgrading the quality and concentrating graduate education in urban centers. The Chairman's Address by Governor Bob Graham of Florida focused on a governor's ability to influence state policy and funding decisions about  higher education. Robert Stoltz reported in his paper on teacher education and certification that states should adjust their certification procedures and not rely solely on a test at the end of the teacher education program to improve teacher quality. Robert Berdahl reviewed current state developments and offered suggestions for evaluating state coordination and governance. In articles on governor's perspectives on higher education, George Busbee and Julian Carroll emphasized the importance of goal-setting and the need for state officials to work together to arrest declining national productivity. In a paper on vocational/technical education Gene Bottoms suggested several actions for states to improve this area of their educational programs. A roster of delegates is appended.  (Author/PHR)",

The role of the community college in advancing new concepts--such as open admissions, equal opportunity, and community involvement--is recounted. The development of higher education in the United States is traced, and problems created by the recently instituted policy of open admission are examined. The heterogenity of students necessitates a change in instructional practices that are based on a very homogeneous population. The development of effective and inexpensive individualized instruction is proposed as the solution to the problem of student diversity. Modified schedules to accommodate adult learners, greater learner participation, peer tutoring, and cooperative learning projects are all  modifications that will better meet the economic and academic needs of the student. Technological advances facilitate individualization, both in communication to students and in instruction, and teachers need to reexamine their roles as educators in the future. (PHR)",

The project also supported the initiation and implementation of equity goals on the part of individuals and administrative units. It supported the development of a regional network for enhancing leadership opportunities for professional women in higher education, and offered intensive leadership training to  leadership teams from institutions of postsecondary education in Federal Region VII. Project staff compiled a leadership manual, &quot;Design for Equity: Women and Leadership in Higher Education,&quot; to be disseminated to individuals and institutions working for increased representation of women in leadership positions. Project staff also developed a battery of bias-free instruments for the self-assessment of qualities related to sex role attitudes and values, role satisfaction, decision-making strategies, and leadership style. These instruments were pilot tested with samples of male and female faculty and administrators from Federal Region VII, and the instruments were administered to similar groups in a national validation sample.

The study group consisted of 5450 individuals at a major midwestern university as of June 1971. The subjects included 4541 men and 908 women research assistants and associates, deans and vice presidents, editors, project directors, consultants, curators, and faculty. Findings demonstrate that achievements are the dominant income-determining variable for both sexes, but women's payment rates are lower and less subject to the variation of race, citizenship, and internal location; and that the ascribed and location characteristics also have sex-separate effects. It is concluded that while an achievement value governs reward, a  universal sex standard does not. The achievement ideology operates, but it is practiced under sex separate standards and therefore academic income forms a dual reward structure. It is explained that sex work separation, and the normative structure of science, are among the mechanisms permitting and promoting the dual income structure. Extensive tables are included.

        "description":"The state of undergraduate general education is examined with particular emphasis on the trend toward providing a common core curriculum for college students. A decline in the number of degrees awarded in the traditional liberal arts fields is noted with a corresponding increase in recent years in the number of degrees awarded in occupationally-oriented fields. According to the Carnegie Council, from 1969 to 1976 enrollments in humanities majors dropped from 9 to 5 percent of all undergraduates. It is suggested that the preoccupation of college graduates with preparing for the job market has steered students toward career-oriented majors. The dominance of departments within the structure of American colleges and universities is also cited as having hindered the struggle of  general education. Students majoring in professional, career-oriented fields are the least likely to confront breadth or general education requirements. Various approaches to general education are discussed including the core curriculum and interdisciplinary approach. Each approach emphasizes the importance of basic skills for both the liberal arts and professional-area majors. Declining SAT scores and complaints that many college graduates cannot write are strong underlying forces for curriculum reform. It is suggested that students in the 1980's will have less latitude in curriculum choices as the general education reform movement strengthens. (SF)",

        "description":"Various organizational modes for implementing desegregation in higher education are examined with specific reference to the effects of programs at the University of Washington, the University of California at Santa Barbara, and the University of California at Berkeley. Each school established Equal Opportunity Programs (EOP) that differ structurally and operationally. The University of Washington program illustrates a self-determination model, a unified, self-contained, and relatively autonomous office. A partial-determination model was used by UC Santa Barbara where EOP operates under a somewhat decentralized system. EOP at the UC Berkeley follows an integration model where all EOP clients use regular student services for advice and assistance. The extent to which each of these  models may lend itself to or embody institutional racism is examined. It is suggested that wherever racial disparities exist in an institution, institutional racism exists. Enrollment figures, relative academic performance and general sense of well-being of EOP students are all factors that should be examined when measuring institutional racism. The EOP program at the University of Washington, designed and run by minorities, is viewed as the least vulnerable to institutional racism. Since EOP at UC Santa Barbara has less autonomy it may be more susceptible to institutional racism. The decentralized program at Berkeley is viewed as the most vulnerable to institutional racism since its clients have the least amount of internal control. (SF)",

The survey findings demonstrated that an overwhelming majority of residents were pleased with the general hall environment. There was little difference between the overall satisfaction level of freshman and upperclass residents, while women were slightly more pleased than men. In the area of hall relationships, policies and programs, students were most pleased with their roommates,  their security (and that of their possessions), the sense of community and morale on their corridor, and the reasonableness of most hall rules. However, a sizeable number of students were unhappy with the university's visitation policy and conditions for sleep and study on their corridor. Residents were thoroughly satisfied with the performance of the hall advisory staff.

The most revealing question in the survey was probably an open-ended item that asked students to describe their major reason for leaving Miami. Responses were organized into one of eight categories: curriculum, personal circumstances, motivation, student life, academic ability, financial concerns, environmental problems, and instruction. &quot;Successful dropouts&quot; (those who left the college in good academic standing) tended to leave  because they found another institution offering a curriculum of courses more suited to their needs, because of personal reasons only marginally related to Miami University, and because they felt out of place with other students or with Miami University's conservative environment and conduct regulations. &quot;Unsuccessful dropouts&quot; tended to withdraw because of poor academic performance, loss of interest in attending college, and personal circumstances.

Data indicate that the School of Pharmacy attained its participation goals with respect to the externship program and that both the externs and the teaching associates were generally positive about the value of the experience and the performance of the students. Data also are presented describing students' pre-externship and post-externship responses to a 73-item  attitude questionnaire. Student responses generally were in the positive or desirable direction both before and after the externship, and the externship contributed to an enhanced perception among students that they had been well prepared for the practice of pharmacy. Student and teaching associate open-ended comments on the questionnaires as well as interviews indicated that many of the students felt the teaching associates went out of their way to provide a wide range of beneficial learning experiences.

        "description":"The electives program at the University of Missouri at Kansas City School of Medicine was evaluated. The program provides opportunities for learning in community hospitals, physicians' offices and clinics, the main campus of the university, and other health-resources locations in western Missouri. The School of Medicine emphasizes primary care in its overall curriculum and its electives. Many of the primary care electives are located outside the Kansas City Metropolitan Area. At the completion of each elective, the physician is asked to complete an evaluation instrument which requests that he comment on how well the student achieved these objectives, and students rate the effectiveness of the experience and add explanatory comments. Students generally felt that they had performed  well in their electives as compared with other students at the same level, and very few students perceived any aspect of their electives to be unsatisfactory. Students' responses regarding learning support materials indicate that improvements should be made in providing appropriate materials. The physician evaluations of students were similar to the students' self-evaluation in their generally high ratings on the 11 evaluation dimensions. Eleven student interviews were also conducted to obtain additional information. Some of the students' responses to the 12 interview topics are included. (SW)",

Data were collected from a 2-stage cluster sample of 271 grade 6 children using a questionnaire; tests of intelligence, self-esteem, and comprehension in social studies; and a diary of television viewing over a period of seven days. A questionnaire was also completed by the subjects' teachers. Statistical analyses involved simple descriptive statistics, bivariate correlation and multiple regression analyses, and canonical  analysis. The hypothesizing and subsequent testing of causal path models of the interrelationships between variables enabled the study to cope more efficiently with the complex interrelationships between variables. Results confirmed the important influence that television has on the lives of children, and the importance of home background variables and personal characteristics in influencing television viewing patterns.

The IIDA computer software system consists of four main programs, three in the exercise mode--a preliminary introduction to searching, a practice search exercise, and more advanced training, and one in the assistance mode designed to assist the user in the performance of a search of his own choosing. Twelve principles are enumerated and described for the analysis of such a search: string and cycle analysis, repeated commands, null sets,  unused sets, thrashing, dwelling, relevance, print control, use of null sets, time, syntax, and slack and help requests. Diagnostic rules given are concerned with the general configuration of the search and procedural diagnostic rules. Adapting rules deal with the nature of rule adaptation, the assignment of rules to classes, and the evaluation of rule adaptation. Seven references are listed. (CMV)",

As part of its investigation, the study group reviewed earlier efforts to develop and use such programs on the part of the Department of Defense, the Auerbach Corporation, H. Lucas, the Mitre Corporation, and the Department of Agriculture (USDA). Several issues dealing with the implementation, maintenance, cost-benefit, and acceptability of standard benchmarks emerged as a result of this review. The problems encountered by the study group, notably the lack of an accepted definition of\"representativeness,\" prevented it from arriving at a definitive statement of feasibility. However, several areas that were identified as topics requiring further investigation are presented in this report.

Findings of the spring 1979 self-study provided a basis for comparative  analysis with an earlier summer 1978 study and allowed for refinement of data collection techniques and operational methodology. These related to the system only; a more detailed analysis by branch, along with comparison with 1978 findings, yielded further insight into user satisfaction and user activity.

Five discussion groups were organized to consider (1) the current status of international information flow, (2) overcoming barriers to international information flow, (3) impact of current technology on international information exchange, (4) economic aspects of international information exchange, and (5) uses and users of information internationally. The reports from each group include issues, recommendations, and commentary. An overview of findings emphasizes improvement of information flow to less developed countries, coordination of U.S. information policies with  world-wide developments, creation of a mechanism for coordinating U.S. information policies, improvement of domestic acquisition of foreign materials, assessment of the impact of technology on the availability of information, and improvement of standards for facilitating information flow. The transcript of a speech in which Thomas R. Pickering discusses international information policy conflicts is appended. (SW)",

The study was prompted by a realization that, although competency-based programs for school library media specialists are increasingly being adopted by state agencies as a basis for certification and by educational institutions as a procedure for educating media professionals, the effort in developing these programs has been heavily weighted toward the generation of competency statements with little attention being paid to the perhaps more difficult problem of competency assessment. The methodology for this project involved working back and forth between literature review and theoretical  model development, and the collection of empirical data testing various aspects of the model with formal and informal interviews of various experts to critique the developing model. A cost-effectiveness approach was selected as the most appropriate method, with the ultimate goal of providing educational decision-makers with an array of assessment strategies for each individual competency, together with the costs and effectiveness measures associated with each strategy.

Exterior barriers on each campus, such as the lack of ramps and adequate handicapped parking facilities, are then listed and located on two maps. A list of barriers within each building points out the  lack of elevator access in multi-story structures and inaccessible rest room facilities, water fountains, and public telephones. The report then outlines 12 recommendations including the completion of all ramps and curb cuts during the summer of 1979, the preparation of preliminary cost estimates for the construction of elevators during the summer of 1980, the publication of a brochure describing accessible facilities, and the creation of a part-time Coordinator for Handicapped Students.

        "description":"College staff must understand the nature of hearing impairment, its effect on communication, and teaching methods that accommodate functional limitations in order to provide for the special needs of deaf students. Since the extent of a student's ability to communicate is determined by whether the student became deaf before or after he/she established the use of English and by his/her degree of hearing loss, the teacher should determine what the student can hear and when his/her hearing was impaired. As lip-reading, speaking, and the reading of abstract and idiomatic language are often problematic for deaf students, especially for those who became deaf at an early age, communication is best facilitated by the use of sign language and an interpreter. To improve the learning  environment and compensate for the difficulties that may be encountered in group discussions and in note-taking, the teacher can, among other things, give a visual signal to the student before speaking, use body language, and have a light on, not behind, his/her face. A student's ability to lip-read never replaces the need for an interpreter. Provisions should be made to assure that the interpreter is clearly visible, that the teacher adjusts his/her pace to the interpreter, and that the interpreter is provided with an outline and new vocabulary before the lecture.

A description of the study methods and instruments follows, by which student gains criteria (as measured by a pre-course exam,  a written post-test, and a performance examination) are correlated with instructor variables determined by peer and supervisor evaluation and by tests used to measure instructors' subject knowledge and general intelligence. The report then outlines the statistical criteria interrelations and validities and summarizes the study conclusions.

        "author":["Lombardi, John"],
        "description":"As enrollment in transfer programs and the relative number of students who transfer to four-year institutions decrease, transfer education is losing its preeminence as the principal function of the community college. From 1907 to 1940, transfer education comprised 60-70% of enrollment and maintained its preeminence through the mid 1960's. By 1973, however, its share of total enrollment dropped to 43%. Although college and state board studies rarely explore the question of the ideal percentage of transfers, they do indicate that the growth rate for transfers has been lower than that for enrollment and that full-time students are more likely to enroll in transfer programs than part-timers. Therefore, states with a high proportion of part-time students, as well as low selective  admission policies and large minority populations, will have a lower percentage of transfer students. Other forces detrimental to transfer education are: (1) the increasing demand for vocational education, (2) the growth of new curricular functions such as continuing education, (3) the need to provide remedial education, (4) the competition for students with four-year institutions, and (5) the aging of the student body. However, the reluctance of educators to break their ties with higher education and the increased demands for improved humanities curricula will assure transfer education a vital, though smaller, role at the community college.

        "description":"This study examines the longitudinal relationships between mastery motivation and differentiated measures of intellectual development assessed at 1 and 3 1/2 years of age in a sample of 35 children (21 boys and 14 girls). At one year three types of mastery motivation were assessed using structured tasks: (1) producing effects (engaging in behaviors that produced immediate perceptual feedback), (2) practicing emerging skills (putting blocks in a bottle), and (3) problem-solving (getting a toy from behind a transparent barrier). The mastery score was the percentage of time the infant engaged in task directed behaviors. The infant's intellectual functioning at one year was assessed by the Bayley scales of infant development. Four components were derived from the Bayley items:  problem-solving, practicing spatial relation skills, perceptual discrimination, and language. At 3 1/2 years of age a similar approach was taken in that both overall and component measures of mastery motivation and intellectual functioning were obtained. However, because of the many developmental changes over this time span parallel measures were not possible. Therefore, the mastery motivation was assessed by using two measures: persistence at solving difficult problems, and curiosity motivation. The intellectual functioning at this age was assessed by the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities. Results showed that the pattern of correlations differed considerably for boys and girls; for boys significant longitudinal correlations were found mainly for later mastery motivation, while for  girls correlations were found only with later intellectual functioning. These findings indicate moderate continuity from infancy to early childhood. The theoretically important link between early mastery motivation and later intellectual development was found only for girls. (Author/MP)",

Videotapes were made from behind a one-way mirror when infants were 2, 26, 52, and 78 weeks of age; each tape represented a five-minute free play session in which mothers were instructed to play with their children as they normally would at home. Results showed that while the amount of maternal speech was similar for boys and girls at 2 weeks of age, mothers vocalized and verbalized more to daughters than to sons at 26, 52, and 78 weeks of age. It was also found that while mothers responded more quickly to their sons' utterances at 2 weeks of age, they responded more  quickly with a vocalization to their female children's vocalizations at 26, 53, and 78 weeks of age. For girls there was a high correlation between frequency of vocalization and rapidity of maternal vocal response at all four ages. For boys there was no correlation between frequency of vocalization and rapidity of maternal vocal response at 2, 26, and 78 weeks of age and a significant negative correlation between the two at 52 weeks. It was concluded that the frequency of boys' vocalization apparently is independent of maternal responsiveness and that girls are more influenced by maternal or vocal reinforcement than are boys. Data from five additional mother/infant dyads in which the mothers were emotionally disturbed formed the basis for claiming that the measure of maternal  responsiveness used in this study was a valid measure of the broader concept of maternal sensitivity.

In the absence of firm evidence that moderate drinking of alcoholic beverages leads to FAS and uncertainty concerning the effectiveness of labeling of alcoholic beverages, a decision on these problems was made by the Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. It was decided that the Bureau would work with appropriate federal agencies, with members of all segments of the alcoholic beverage industry, and with other interested groups to develop and implement a program of public education rather than require product labeling at this time. The report includes summaries of experts'  comments and an outline of the plan of action to educate the public. Addenda to the report include a review of scientific findings related to alcohol ingestion and fetal outcomes, plus the full texts of the experts' reports. Extensive references to the related literature are included. (Author/RH)",

Four issues taken into consideration are (a) biology and environment, (b) structure and function, (c) traits and situations, and (d) mechanistic and organismic approaches to development. The following ideas represent in part the behavior analysis position on the issues discussed. Physiological structure and functioning influence the behavioral structure of a child's interactions with the environment and determine the broad behavioral processes which occur within child-environment interactions. Structural and functional analyses are complementary. The structure and function of child-environment interactions are mutually determined by development.  Stimulus functions and response functions develop together and are defined with respect to one another. It is impossible to view stimulus functions as having more control over behavior than response functions. Organismic and mechanistic world hypotheses should not be viewed as necessarily antagonistic to one another. In summary, behavior analysis need not be exclusively environmentalistic, solely functionally oriented, situationist, or mechanistic. It is emphasized that philosophic assumptions influence the work of every scientist and are too important to be ignored. (Author/RH)",

Seventy-five classroom process variables were selected from Stallings and Kaskowitz data and entered into poly-nomial regression analyses. Thirty-two of ninety-five relationships tested were found to be nonlinear. (This, of course, is well beyond chance.) Fourteen of the nonlinear functions were quadratic in nature, eleven were cubic, and seven were quartic. Fifteen of these functions were related to mathematics achievement, and seventeen were  related to reading achievement. These results generally support the view that relationships between some classroom process variables and student achievement are probably curvilinear. In turn, this finding seems to raise a question about recommendations for instructional improvement that are made based solely on linear analyses of process-product study data. This finding also provides additional support for the argument to employ both linear and nonlinear analyses in classroom process-product research. (Author/MP)",

Fifty-eight early education and day care classrooms in central Pennsylvania that met the criteria of enrolling both handicapped and nonhandicapped preschool age children and being willing to participate provided the  sample for this study. From each classroom, one handicapped child was selected randomly and was matched with a nonhandicapped child on the basis of sex and chronological age; 116 subjects participated in the study. Child-child interactions and teacher-child interactions were recorded during thirty-minute observations during free play activities. The trained observer used a twenty-second rotating time sampling procedure; recording first the behavior of one child then the behavior of the \"match\" child. The data suggest that, although handicapped children are not socially isolated or rejected, there are quantitative differences in their levels of social behaviors that differentiate them from their nonhandicapped classmates. Areas of future research and suggestions for environmental  intervention are discussed. (Author/RH)",

The first component, empathic affective arousal, is discussed and six involuntary psychological mechanisms which underlie it are described briefly. These mechanisms, in the order in which they appear developmentally, include: reactive newborn cry, conditioning, association, mimicry, symbolic association, and role-taking. The cognitive-transformational component of empathy is discussed next and four levels of empathic response are described that result from the coalescence of empathic affect and the cognitive sense of the other. These levels are: (1) global empathic distress, (2) empathic distress which is experienced with the  awareness that another person and not the self is the victim, (3) empathic distress which is experienced with the awareness that other people's feelings are based on their own reaction to events and are independent of self feelings, and (4) empathically aroused affect which can be aroused by the plight of an entire group or class of people. The third component of empathy discussed is the motivational component. Altruistic or prosocial motivation refers to the behavioral disposition of a person experiencing empathic distress to do something to relieve the victim's distress. Socialization experiences which will increase a child's empathic abilities are discussed and relevant research is summarized. The question of whether a motive to help others is a part of human nature is discussed.  (JMB)",

The Head Start program incorporates the services of a local consultant to promote the mental health of children and parents. The specialist's role is to assist staff and parents to better understand the relationship between their actions and the affective growth of their children. Successful implementation of the mental health component demands the same type of careful planning and coordination as the other components. The Head Start program staff should consider the following general areas in developing a comprehensive mental health component: (1) coordination of the mental health consultant's services,  (2) the specific services to be performed by the consultant, (3) planning meetings to clarify expectations and responsibilities, and (4) procedures for documenting the activities of the mental health component. One staff person should be designated to coordinate mental health component activities. Responsibilities of the consultant include teacher inservice, classroom observation, and teacher/parent consultation. Detailed plans for consultant services should be made early in the year. Forms to use in the mental health component are described and sample forms are included. A consultation model suggesting scheduling and costs is provided. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to investigate the degree to which both object familiarity and motivational factors influence infants' search behavior in an object permanence test. Infants' search behavior for an unfamiliar test object was compared with search behavior for (a) an experientially familiar object that each infant had played with daily for a week and (b) an attached object, such as a bottle, which the mother reported comforted the infant in times of stress. Thirty-six infants (15 males and 21 females) between 8 and 13 months of age were tested in three experimental conditions: unfamiliar object condition, familiar/object condition, and attached object condition. The Uzgiris-Hunt scale of object permanence was used to assess substages in the development of object permanence.  Comparison between subjects' scores in the unfamiliar and familiar object conditions provided no evidence that object familiarity alone influenced test performance. Whether or not the infants' search behavior significantly increased for attached objects depended on which of two examiners administered the object permanence test. It is concluded that the results are best explained by motivational factors and that this has important implications for object permanence testing. (Author/MP)",

The investigation employs measures of maternal attitudes toward self, toward parenting, toward the child, a measure of the quality of the home environment, and measures of children's self-concept, school achievement, and intelligence. The sample was composed of 28 high-risk and 31 low-risk kindergarten and first-grade children and their mothers. The high-risk group included only black children and the low-risk group was predominately white. A preliminary issue was the comparison of high-risk and low-risk children and their mothers on each of the measures employed. Of further interest were the relationships between maternal attitudes and child  self-concept. No significant differences between the self-concept of low-risk and of high-risk children were found. There were significant differences between the self-esteem scores and perceptions of low- and high-risk mothers, however. The high-risk mother perceives her child to be more impulsive and less sociable than does the low-risk mother. This finding is consistent with previous comparisons of disadvantaged and middle-class parental self-perception. Figures showing how maternal attitudes relate to children's self-concept, intelligence, and school achievement are presented, first for combined groups and then for the high-risk group only.

Subjects were 112 families, each with a previously hospitalized parent for a psychiatric disorder and a child of age 4, 7, or 10. Measurement of the parent's overall impairment was obtained by the Spitzer-Gibbon-Endicott Global Assessment Scale based on symptomology and levels of social and employment functioning.  Diagnosis at the time of the study was made using the DSM-III criteria. Findings supported both hypotheses, suggesting that the usual, ongoing impairment of the &quot;patient&quot; parent is more important than the current diagnosed disorder in producing the developmental difficulties shown by these children in relinquishing egocentric thought patterns.

A discrepancy (above, below or at the same stage) between each subject's pretest modal stage and a partner's modal stage was used to define an external disequilibrium condition for each subject. To explore relationships between peer interaction and developmental change, an observer coded utterances between partners and assigned each pair an involvement rating. An observation system permitted subjects' overt behavior during exposure to external disequilibrium to be related to changes on  posttests. Results confirmed a significant effect of discrepancy between peers at differing stages in promoting developmental change. External disequilibrium due to developmental differences between partners both within and between stages produced similar patterns of change. Pair involvement rating and frequency of on-task discussion were also found to be significantly related to advance. (Author/SS)",

Although the change in definition caused a reclassification of approximately 1.5 million persons from rural farm to rural nonfarm for 1978, use of the previous definition indicated no significant change in farm population from the preceding year, possibly signaling that the more than fifty year decline in farm population has finally come to an end. About 1.4% of the farm population was of Spanish origin, compared to 5.7% of the nonfarm  population. Blacks on farms represented 5.4% of the total farm population and 1.4% of all Blacks. The farm population has a higher proportion of Whites than the nonfarm population. The median age of farm residents in 1978 was 33.8 years, as compared with 29.5 years for nonfarm residents. The farm population had about the same proportion of children as the nonfarm population, a lower proportion of young adults, and higher proportion of middle-aged and elderly persons. The median income of farm families, $12,235 in 1977, continued to lag behind that of nonfarm families. In 1978, 3 out of every 4 agricultural wage workers were nonfarm residents. (NEC)",

The report discusses major accomplishments of 1978: nearly 56% (1700 miles) of the Appalachian Development Highways System was completed or under construction, 102 water and sewer projects were approved helping to alleviate a major public facility need, $6 million was approved for housing programs in nine states, 259 primary health care clinics were certified for reimbursement under Medicare and Medicaid, 88 vocational education projects were funded, 52 of the 69 local development districts were using the areawide action program thereby coordinating their districts' planning and  development activities. Separate chapters summarize projects in the areas of transportation; community development and housing; enterprise development; energy, environment, and natural resources; and human development (health, education, and child development). The role of multicounty planning agencies, the involvement of local citizens, and the planning and research activities of the ARC are outlined. Appendices contain total project funds approved in fiscal year 1978 for each of the 13 Appalachian states and a directory of local planning districts. (JH)",

The research focuses on four components: 1) appropriate research designs consistent with the model used, 2) appropriate, reliable, and valid posttest attitude tests consistent with the expressed goals and aims of the model used, 3) appropriate statistical analysis linked to the design and data being used, and 4) appropriate claims made for the materials and model used based upon the data reported. Studies in the area of values/moral education have come under increasing criticism because of a number of problems with the research design, treatments, instrumentation, and statistical analyses. This study sought to obtain and examine content and  attitude product variables related to the expected outcomes of the use of values dilemma activities based upon the Casteel-Stahl model. Eighteen 11th grade American History classes were selected and randomly assigned to experimental and control groups following the Groups-Within-Treatments Design. Experimental students used six values dilemmas based upon the model. Findings showed experimental students scored significantly higher on posttest retention of subject matter content and also showed significantly higher attitudes as measured by attitude instrument developed to test the effects of this particular model of values/moral education. The conclusion is that the Casteel-Stahl model is a viable model for developing values dilemmas for subject matter content classrooms and is capable of  effecting a positive ways content retention and attitudes.

Conceptual differentiation is a person's ability to identify individual political issues, acts, and events which compete for attention in the news media. Conceptual integration is a persons ability to synthesize individual issues and ideas into abstract terms. The study involved 137 hour-long depth interviews concerning national politics which were tape recorded and transcribed. Conclusions are that depth interview data strongly contribute to the interpretation of more routinely gathered poll data; that two-thirds of the mass electorate make only marginal use of political abstractions in their evaluation of the political system; and  that there is no indication that those with lower scores on conceptual differentiation and integration are more easily manipulated by political symbols or arguments. Separate sections of the technically written paper describe ways in which people relate the conditions of their own lives to those of their fellow citizens and political authorities and discuss the measurement of conceptual differentiation and integration as related to political issues, units of government, organized political groups, general constituencies, and political figures. Later sections describe the levels of differentiation and integration to variables such as educational level. (KC)",

The activities are keyed to the economic education color television/film program \"Trade-Offs,\" (developed jointly in 1978 by the Agency for Instructional Television, the Canadian Foundation for Economic Education, and the Joint Council on Economic Education). Major objectives of the lessons are to give teachers a wider range of activities from which to choose, facilitate individualized and independent learning, provide experiential activities, and develop and reinforce economic vocabulary. Lesson topics focus on economic choice, factors involved in decision making, earning power, income, selling  techniques, and costs and benefits. Activities involve students in class discussion, cutting out pictures and comparing prices of desired items from catalogues, creating charts and graphs, participating in simulation and other games, learning and vocabulary terms, filling-in blanks, solving word puzzles, making bulletin boards, and playing word games. For each lesson, information is presented on behavioral objectives, vocabulary, learning activities, follow-up activities, and a written and/or pictorial description of a learning center for individual and small group projects.

Ethnographic and cognitive components of the curriculum were examined. The specific objective of the research was to examine the behavioral effects on students, teachers, and schools of the curriculum materials and to adapt the materials to student and teacher needs prior to dissemination of the curriculum. The methodology involved observing curriculum use among 1,200 tenth grade students in eight urban high schools in northern California, becoming knowledgeable about social organization patterns in a public high school, and evaluating cognitive learning among pupils using the curriculum. Evaluation of the  ethnographic studies component focused on teacher and student psychological and cultural orientations, community context, student-teacher interaction, and responses of school personnel to innovative programs. Measurement of cognitive achievement among students who participated in the course centered on discussion of cognitive research strategies as they relate to learning complex concepts, processing social data, identifying status positions, and on applying research in these areas to the anthropology curriculum. Recommendations for curriculum improvement included that teachers be better prepared to deal with anthropology content and that ethnic studies be incorporated into the anthropology curriculum. It was concluded that anthropology course experiences increased student ability to draw  inferences about societies from artifacts and written anecdotes and to process and apply ideas from anthropology to social realities. Appendices are included. (DB)",

        "description":"The document contains three essays, written in the 1940s, about the role of the social studies in general education. The first considers the significance of social science research. An understanding of what is involved when a social problem is studied scientifically is a major element in modern general education. Also, every student should know that there is a social science as distinct from common-sense knowledge about society and social reform. Direct participation of students and teachers in social science research is suggested. The second essay discusses the significance of the concept of an integrated culture to education. An integrated culture is one in which all parts (customs, institutions) contribute to the functioning of the whole. One contribution is that the student  can understand that human beings are reared in societies with ways of life characteristic of that society. The significance of the concept to teachers is that teaching itself is an element in an integrated society. Also, in a modern, non-integrated society, the teacher is the perpetrator of old integration and a builder of the power to meet disintegration. The third essay briefly discusses two elements of general education provided by the social studies and concentrates on a third. The first two are historical knowledge of the development of our values and analytical understanding of facts and assumption relevant to reasoned convictions. The third is the analysis of social concepts. This element may be realized through the study of a specific culture. The essay concludes with suggestions  for implementing such a study. (KC)",

The study of ethnocentrism (a people's assumption that their way of life is the right way) allows students to share in the methodology of historiography, helps them to be aware of the importance of ideas and attitudes as historical data, and leads them to question cultural stereotypes. Ethnocentrism may be introduced in several ways. Students can discover how tribal peoples regard themselves by examining their group labels, by examining the concept of manifest destiny in American history, and by reading descriptions of American Indian cultures, autobiographies, and other ethnographic accounts in which custom appears as an integral element of a functioning culture. A brief  description of the culture of the Plains Indians is provided as an example. (KC)",

The development involves four steps: selection of the most significant topics from the rich mass of anthropological information, identification of the relevance of each topic to the high school student's experience, isolation of the essential aspects of each topic, and the development of methods for helping students understand the data and concepts used in anthropology. The experimental unit, &quot;Study of Early Man,&quot; examines race formation and classification. During the four-day unit students construct a chart of the physical traits of the major races, measure the frequency and range of height or skin shade of their classmates and  draw conclusions about variance within a race, and study mating practices by examining matrimonial advertisements in the Bombay Times. The unit should make the student aware of the confusion of criteria in the conventional classification of peoples into racial groups. (KC)",

It explains how teachers can help students understand events and trends in American history by investigating general concepts such as capitalist institutional development, the interaction of historical circumstances, and basic American values. Specific concepts (defined as tool concepts) which help high school students interpret historical data include culture, custom, mores, values, enculturation, acculturation, culture lag, manifest function, latent function, role, and institution. Questions which can be posed in an inquiry approach in social studies classes stress one or several of these concepts. Sample questions include &quot;how do Americans  reach to authority?&quot;&quot;what is the role of the individual in a pre-literate society?&quot;&quot;why do Americans place such a high value on liberty?&quot; and &quot;how has economic development in the United States been influenced by American cultural values?&quot; (DB)",

The sections on individual law and civil law are broken down into the subcategories of freedom of speech, search and seizure, family law, and environmental law. The activities in both Parts II and III include 65 reproducible student handouts. Part IV suggests additional resources such as print materials for students, teachers, and resource persons; media kits; and filmstrips, games, and simulations. (KC)",

        "description":"The participation of the United States in the programing and budgeting process of UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization) is reported. The document is presented in four chapters. Chapter I, the introduction, traces the growth of the United Nations system, UNESCO background, U.S. representation to UNESCO, and efforts to improve the effectiveness of U.S. participation. Chapter II examines U.S. participation in UNESCO relative to policy objectives, priorities, and effectiveness of representation. Chapters III and IV describe UNESCO program planning and budgeting and the role of the United States in that process. Conclusions concerning U.S. participation in UNESCO are that procedures for establishing current explicit statements of U.S. program  objectives are inadequate; development of a new policy analysis process is lagging; performance of some U.S. representatives at UNESCO forums is reduced because of inadequate preparation time and inexperience; and domestic agencies and professional constituencies concerned with UNESCO are not involved early or deeply enough. Concerning the UNESCO program and budget, the report concludes that the usefulness of the goal/cost approach was diminished because the plan addressed only direct program costs, descriptions of program objectives were vague, and opportunities for effective input from member governments were limited and had little or no effect on the final documents. Recommendations are for the United States to participate earlier and more actively in the development of the UNESCO plan  and budget. (KC)",

        "description":"A history of the employment of women in the Department of State and the Foreign Service is presented. Thirteen chapters consider the status of American women from 1776 to the present; women in the Department and at international conferences, 1800-1940; applicants and employees for overseas employment, 1851-1943; the Foreign Service examinations; the impact of war on employing women; the postwar period, 1949-1970; and the present and future role of women in the Department of State. In summary, it was not until the Civil War that the government began to hire women in full-time positions. Although men and women in the Department of State received equal pay for equal work, men were promoted more quickly than women. For the first 35 years all women in the Department filled clerical  jobs; in 1909 the first woman was appointed to a semiprofessional position. Today, the Department has a higher percentage of women at the senior, middle, junior, and support levels than the government as a whole. It has been more difficult, however, for women in the Foreign Service. The Department reluctantly allowed women to take Foreign Service examinations in the 1920s. Although from 1930 until the end of World War II, no women made the grade by the examination process, since that time more women have been admitted to the Foreign Service. By 1978 one woman had reached the level of Undersecretary, one as Director General of the Foreign Service, a few as Assistant Secretaries, and several as Deputy Assistant Secretaries. Finally, 26 women have reached the epitome of success as Ministers  Plenipotentiary and Ambassadors Extraordinary. (KC)",

        "description":"Current regulatory trends, policies, and procedures greatly affect social studies research using human subjects and evaluation of that research. The legal source of protection of human subjects is the National Research Act of 1974. The law stipulates that rights of research subjects must be protected and that the responsibility is on the researcher to inform the subject of procedures and possible consequences of the research. Problems occur because local review boards monitor the research activities of their organizations. They have the potentiality to extend and abuse their role through their power to define what constitutes research and to determine what research they can control. In reference to some policies and procedures instituted by human subjects committees of  educational institutions, it appears that the rights of researchers themselves are violated. In regulating research, possibilities of violation of the first amendment, the American system of justice, and academic freedom exist. Social studies research is affected by reduction in the amount of experimental research and the number of subjects involved, and by the fact that subjects must have prior knowledge of the purpose, nature, and direction of the research. Also, a great deal of time and money must be spent in obtaining consent. The conclusion is that any external control of the research community should not go by unchallenged. (KC)",

        "description":"Evaluations of the relationship of curriculum programs to Jean Piaget's developmental psychology theory are reviewed. These programs include Science Curriculum Improvement Study (SCIS), Man: A Course of Study (MACOS), Family of Man (FOM), and Social Encounter and Research Curriculum for Humanization (SEARCH). Piagetian based research results are also included. Results of the SCIS study indicate that the curriculum is superior for developing the processes of scientific investigation, and that SCIS students are more diverse, creative, and show greater gains in reading, mathematics, and social studies than control groups. MACOS results show that students retain a significant amount of information, boy/girl differences associated with achievement disappear, group participation and  interaction increase, and positive change in teaching style occurs. FOM results indicate a strong relationship between concrete, manipulative materials for children, and increased pupil achievement. Research examining the relationship between social studies instruction and Piagetian theory found that elementary social studies programs should focus on the cognitive stages of concrete operations, materials should be concrete objects, that a discovery approach is best, and that group discussions improve thinking. The author states that the SEARCH project may be the innovative curricular program that applies Piagetian thought to social studies. Also, social studies education would benefit from Piagetian based research by development of curriculum, Piagetian-based methods texts for preservice  and inservice teacher education, and a concentrated effort to relate Piaget's psychology to learning.

        "description":"A project is described in which slow learning high school students in British Columbia investigated community housing problems. The objective of the project was to show how investigation of contemporary community problems can help slow learning students develop knowledge, skills, and attitudes conducive to responsible citizenship. Methodology involved assessing how a study of community housing problems influenced 225 slow learning students' interest in contemporary problems, attitudes toward fundamental freedoms, open-mindedness, critical thinking skills, self-esteem, and reading comprehension. Students participating in the experiment were involved in reading assignments, field studies, interviews with community resource people, and surveying housing needs and costs. Statistical  analysis of pre- and posttest differences between students in experimental groups and in control groups using more traditional curricula indicated that the community investigation project was well received by students and that participation in the project encouraged students to read and understand newspaper headlines, be less dogmatic, think more critically, and improve their self-esteem. On the basis of this project, it was concluded that slow learners can conduct, enjoy, and benefit from studies into problems of the local community and that community problems can provide a suitable pedagogical environment for developing citizen-related competencies.

While reaction time to the reversal signal, (Reversal multiplied by Time sub-two) increased consistently under all speed conditions as ISI decreased, the trends were not adequately explained by single-channel theory since there appeared to be some extra delay that increased with ISI.

Thirty-seven experienced elementary school teachers were observed to determine overall management skill level and actual response to problem behavior. Teachers were divided into two role orientations: one group stressed the instructional role and the other the socializational role. Following observation, teachers responded to a series of written vignettes depicting 12 types of problem student behavior. While both teacher role emphasis and ability did affect teacher responses, the most powerful factor was the type of student behavior depicted. The research suggests that socialization  problems (disobedience or disruption) provoke more intense and less effective teacher responses than do instructional problems. (Author/LH)",

The focus is on providing instruction to students from the orientation of educational psychology and in the context of elementary schools for students from low socioeconomic status groups. A tentative list of twenty variables is categorized in eight categories: time, instructional articulation, teacher characteristics, instructional integration, instructional organization, teacher/student interactions, classroom control, and instructional materials. The rationale for these variables and categories is presented, based on educational utility and research support. Procedures for measuring variables are suggested. The  operation of these variables is explained with reference to a chart relating school district variables, school variables, teacher characteristics, classroom variables, student characteristics, student mental processes, and student learning outcomes. The final section discusses research strategy, generally recommending a number of comparatively small studies aimed at indicating relationships rather than testing hypotheses, and taking into account the possible complex interrelationships that may exist between variables.

Madaus supported the use of statewide norm-referenced achievement tests. Mark R. Shedd and R.

Attitudes toward instructor, course, and media effectiveness, and opinions about various environmental features (such as noise and temperature) were measured. Attitudes were measured at the unit level and for the course as a whole. It was concluded that: reliability and content and constuct validity were acceptable; attitude scales were appropriate; personnel felt all units were fairly effective; and the  course was evaluated favorably by the enlisted airmen and generally unfavorably by officers.

It was felt, however, that the relationship would have been stronger if certain methodological problems were reduced. The following suggestions were offered: (1) use engaged time (time-on-task) as a more valid estimate of instructional time than time allocated by teacher logs; (2) use a causal model for achievement to interpret correlations; (3) use achievement tests having a substantial overlap  with curriculum; (4) minimize the probability of making a Type I error by not including a large number of variables in the observation; (5) sample as much instructional time as funds permit; (6) minimize data collection errors and ceiling effects; and (7) investigate other variables such as sex, socioeconomic status, ability level, grade level, or instructional content; then causal models for achievement can be formulated.

Four case studies are presented relating to areas in which the activists of the 1970s sought to change educational policies and programs. Each study describes the definition of equality espoused by the protagonists, the organization of the advocacy groups, the strategies they employed to obtain desired action by politicians and educators, and the present status of their efforts. Each study is then compared in terms of issues and the interest group involved, the interplay of judicial,  legislative, and administrative actions, and the cost considerations applying to the new programs. Some general observations about the historical and political aspects of educational reform and several alternative views about the fate of the educational system in years to come are offered. A topical bibliography is included. (Author/EB)",

Marjorie Blaufarb discusses the physical and psychological inequities that exist in the traditional approach to physical education which provides for separate programs for boys and girls. Dorothy Harris reviews the state of research on physiological sex differences and emphasizes the fact that observed differences are mediated by physical fitness levels rather than by sex. A. Mae Timer examines the requirements of Title IX regulations for physical education and athletics and suggests ways for developing supportive measures necessary to make  compliance meaningful. Her paper holds that an understanding of the legal aspects of Title IX and well designed strategies for its implementation may help us to reevaluate current practices and to ascertain whether they contribute to the perpetuation of sex discrimination.

In one the differences in the African American child are viewed as deviance from the Euro-American norm and therefore inferior or pathological. In the other, the differences are viewed as deviant but adaptive forms of behavior for living in environments of oppression and poverty. In both these interpretations it is assumed that the norm is the behavior of the middle-class Caucasian child. The result of these ethnocentric assumptions has been the continued educational failure of the African American child. African American scholars should investigate specific behavioral patterns in the African American lifestyle in order to formulate theoretical  notions and programmatic interventions which take cognizance of these patterns without necessarily seeking to modify them. Areas for further study include African American linguistic patterns, oral communication, people vs. object orientations, visual and motor skills, body language, thinking and problem solving, and spontaneity.

The Missouri Advisory Committee, in viewing the impact of GRS on St. Louis City and County, received evidence regarding: (1) the nature of GRS-funded expenditures; (2) the limits of citizen participation; (3) the extent of job or facility discrimination in activities funded with GRS money; (4) the consequences of methods for calculating entitlements; and (5) the extent of Office of Revenue Sharing supervision. All of these suggested to the Advisory Committee the need for change. Among the findings were: neither city nor county used GRS funds to support long term programs specifically designed to benefit those with greatest need,  minorities and the poor; neither sought to improve the effectiveness of ongoing social programs or to provide for newly identified social needs; neither city nor county provided ample opportunity for citizen participation.

Five general conclusions emerged: (1) the urban school and the urban district must be viewed as an integral part of other systems; (2) urban schools and educational policy and research have survived numerous traumas in the last decade; (3) the effective management of urban school systems in support of student learning and  development should be a primary issues for the 1980s; (4) there has been little consensus about the development of priorities for the revitalization of urban education as a component of national urban policy; and (5) the prospects for a new wave of urban reform and revitalization have never been brighter.

Using information obtained from observations and from interviews with officials, staff, and inmates, the investigation focused upon the impact of the system on minorities and women. In the process, the larger areas of incarceration and parole were reviewed. This report presents the findings of the study through 1972. The racial/ethnic composition of correctional staff (less than 8% minority) is contrasted with that of the inmate population (72.5% minority) in the ten State institutions for men. Changes in policy and conditions since 1970 are reviewed. Included in this discussion is information on the role of correctional  personnel, censorship, inmate assignment to institutions, racism, inmate works assignments, and educational programs. The Clinton and Auburn correctional facilities and the women's division of the Bedford Hills correctional facility are described in some detail, in terms of race/ethnicity of the inmate population, temporary work release programs, and health and medical care provided. The procedures and effectiveness of the State parole system are reviewed and criticized. A list of recommendations for the correctional system and for specific institutions is presented. (GC)",

Meetings were held in which businessmen, representatives of technical assistance organizations, government officials, and bankers examined the question of whether, or to what degree, minority businessmen are denied loans, loan guarantees, and other forms of credit by the traditional money markets because of race. This report summarizes information obtained through interviews and from presentations during the open and closed meetings. Discussed are criteria for determining bank loans, minority businessmen's views of banks and the Small Business Administration (SBA), and the views of  technical assistance personnel toward banks and the SBA. Bankers' responses to criticism levelled against their institutions are also presented. Approaches taken in various cities toward solving the financial difficulties of minority businessmen are outlined, as are legal approaches to the problem of discrimination in lending. The Advisory Committee's recommendations for preventing further discrimination are presented. Appended to the report are a petition directed toward Federal regulatory agencies, letters from District of Columbia banks regarding their lending policies, and statistical data on loans granted to black and Hispanic businessmen.

        "description":"The Levittown v Nyquist court case is bound to have serious repercussions for New York State. In dispute is the legality of the State's system for financing elementary and secondary education. The case was initiated in 1974 by Levittown and 24 other suburban and rural school districts who claimed to be unable to generate an adequate level of local revenue. The plaintiffs assert that the State formula for aid to schools does not compensate for uneven distribution of wealth. After the suit was filed, the school boards of the State's four largest cities, New York City, Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse, entered the lawsuit as intervenors, charging that the State's distribution formula does not provide equal education to all because it ignores educational problems unique to urbank  localities. The intervenors assert that by measuring local capacity to support public education solely in terms of &quot;property value per pupil in attendance,&quot; the State formula treats large cities as &quot;wealthy&quot; and less deserving of aid. They argue that in fact, city districts do not have adequate resources for their public education programs. This is the first lawsuit to call for a redress of alleged inequalities in distribution schemes that result in reduced aid for large urban school districts. Whatever the outcome of the court case, politics will play a major role in the process of State financial reform. (Author/RLV)",

The South's formerly rigid caste system has come to resemble the more flexible Northern social order, which has always been open to blacks in times of labor shortage. A number of important social and economic phenomena (such as a rise in the standard of living, changes in the labor market due to World War II, the economic and cultural integration of the South, and the internationalization of the race issue) helped to bring about this change. The subtle and covert qualities of the conditional segregation which now exists nationwide have led some analysts to suggest that our present form of racial segregation is a temporary residue of historically defunct  behaviors. However, this viewpoint does not explain the continuing lack of economic progress among blacks. Therefore, alternative views of black socioeconomic status must be considered. A model which combines the theses of (white) interest group benefit from discrimination, institutional racism, and internal colonialism predicts that unequal race relations will be maintained even with continued economic growth. In order for racial barriers to be eliminated, white privilege must either decline or be redistributed. (Author/GC)",

However, although Fort Wayne has successfully desegregated its secondary schools within the past 10 years, progress to eliminate racial isolation at the elementary school level has been considerably slower. The present study reviews that progress over the past two years. The data on which the report is based were obtained from written statements, letters, personal interviews, and telephone interviews with individuals knowledgeable about the community and its public schools. Additional information was drawn from testimony presented at a 1978 public hearing. The history of school desegregation in Fort Wayne is briefly outlined. The current desegregation climate is described, with a focus  on the areas of school reorganization proposals, community response to these proposals, and the involvement of State and Federal agencies in monitoring and in the enforcement of desegregation statutes. Findings of the study are summarized in terms of student and teacher assignment, State directives and guidance, Federal involvement, and coordination between the Federal and State governments in the enforcement of civil rights laws. Recommendations concerning school reorganization, legislative repeal, the development of consistent legal guidelines, cooperation between State and Federal offices, and future investigation and data collection, are presented.

        "description":"The Emergency School Aid Act (ESAA) states that the Act's purpose is to provide Federal assistance to eliminate minority group segregation among students and faculty in elementary and secondary schools. One section of the Act declares an educational agency ineligible for assistance if it has in effect any practice which results in disproportionate dismissal, demotion, hiring, promotion, or assignment of minority personnel. The request of the Board of Education of the City School District of New York for funds under ESAA was denied by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW), because of a study showing racially disproportionate assignment of minority teachers. The Board of Education then brought suit in District Court and presented justifications for the statistical  disparities. The District Court remanded the case to HEW for further consideration. HEW determined that the justifications did not adequately rebut the evidence, and the District Court thereupon upheld HEW's finding of ineligibility. The Court of Appeals rejected New York City's contention that HEW was required to establish that the statistical disparities resulted from purposeful or intentional discrimination in the constitutional sense. The Court held that: (1) discriminatory impact is the standard by which ineligibility under ESAA is to measured; and (2) a prima facie case of discriminatory impact may be made by a proper statistical study, and the burden of rebutting such a case is on the petitioner. The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals. (RLV)",

Findings of the study include the following: (1) 270,000 personal victimizations were reported to have occurred inside schools over the course of a year; (2) most of the in-school crime was either petty theft or assault resulting in minor injury to the victim, and weapons were rarely used; (3) 78% of in-school victimizations were reported by students; (4) most of the in-school offenders were perceived by their victims to be young males of black or other minority races; (5) nine out of ten of the in-school victimizations suffered by students and four out of five of those suffered  by teachers and others were not reported to the police.

The diocesan survey attempted to assess the involvement of the dioceses with blacks, the participation of blacks in diocesan activities, and types of programs designed, directly or indirectly, for blacks. The school survey attempted to assess, similarly, the involvement of diocesan school systems with blacks and black participation in the school systems, as well as the processes being employed to close or consolidate schools in black communities. Of sixty dioceses contacted for each survey, 23 responded to the former and 47 to the latter. Data  from these responses are presented in this report. A copy of the first survey is included with enumerated responses to questions regarding black parishes, blacks employed in religious and non-religious positions, black representation on diocesan committees, recruitment of blacks for religious vocations, and community outreach programs. The second survey is also attached, with data enumerated on Catholic school closings, racial composition of areas in which schools have closed or consolidated, reasons for closings, and current black enrollment in Catholic schools.

Instructional strategy included guest speakers, visits to agencies, group discussion, individual  research, and small group research projects in which vocational educators and CETA personnel were forced to work together to address areas of mutual concern.

(1) An advisory group was formed to provide advice and assistance during the developmental stages. (2) It was determined to base the plan on an assessment of student needs. (3) Goals in the areas of career awareness and exploration were evaluated and prioritized by members of the business, labor, industrial, government, and educational communities. Following the distribution of 5000 (1,273 returned) Career Education Priority Assessment instruments, a career education student competency assessment instrument was developed. (4) The Oregon Counsleor Training Needs Assessment was developed to ascertain the extent to which training and retraining of educational personnel is needed. (5) State  and nationwide resources were identified by the Program Coordination Center. Additional information was obtained from the &quot;State Career Education Resource Guide&quot; developed on request by the National Center for Career Education at the University of Montana. (6) Following this, short and long range plans for program development and implementation were developed and (7) evaluation methods were developed in a two-phase approach.

        "description":"This report presents six papers resulting from a symposium held June 28, 1977, to debate the validity of three assumptions on education-and-work programs, particularly in relation to youth employment. Question 1, &quot;Who should say what a child should prepare for: the child or the community?&quot;, is answered by Peter Schrag and Margaret Fallers, both of whom agree that adult intervention is necessary but disagree on the methods to be used. Question 2, &quot;Can we predict which skills will be saleable?&quot;, is responded to by Garth L. Mangum and C. Arnold Anderson. Mangum says, given that U.S. occupational structure is fairly stable, we should concentrate on developing criteria for determining individual skills and look closely at the important issues of career education. Anderson states that  because the job possibilities for students cannot be forecasted reliably, appropriate preparatory classes cannot be specified in more than general terms. The third issue, &quot;Collaboration between education, labor, and business--is there sufficient impetus?&quot;, is discussed by Willard Wirtz and David K. Cohen. Their papers examine (1) the effects of unemployment and underemployment; (2) the transition from youth to adult; (3) the applicability of foreign education and work strategies to the United States; and (4) the collaboration efforts to date of schools, labor, and business. The last paper, by Steven P. Heynemann, summarizes the debates on the three issues. (ELG)",

Originally designed as a thirteen-week course, the program grew to fifteen weeks. Beginning with an orientation to equipment and textbook assignments, succeeding units included the study of light and the study of species and varieties of gem materials, including a fifty-hour unit on diamonds. Student progress was evaluated several times during the course, and  bi-monthly conferences were held with each student. The final examination included an oral presentation, a written exam on general gemology and diamonds, and gem identification and grading. Results indicated the achievement of objectives through the completion of an instructional manual, incorporating objectives into the curriculum, and the use of project results as a guide for developing similar programs.

The discussion of the needs and concerns of this population makes reference to (1) answers to questionnaires (appended, together with compiled data breakdown) distributed at the dialogues; (2) recorded discussion and documentation that occurred in the small-group sessions of each dialogue; and (3) panel discussion and dialogue with participants. Topics covered include barriers to participation in postsecondary education and training, such as faculty attitudes, admissions practices, and lack of money and time. Other problems discussed are lack of on-the-job training opportunities,  compounded by lack of opportunities for women once trained; discrimination; lack of counseling and biased or traditional counseling attitudes to women; and why some \"solutions,\" such as educational benefits on the job, have not worked. The report gives recommendations arising from the dialogues, including (1) strong enforcement of federal anti-discrimination laws; (2) a demonstration program to establish costs and benefits of stimulating, by tax and other incentives, employer subsidies for employee education and training; (3) funding to augment local counseling service availability, especially to promote nontraditional occupations; (4) government support for flexible working hours; (5) government support for more child care services; and (6) greater range and availability of training  courses during evening and weekend hours.

        "description":"Although there are several fine education and training programs in our nation's correctional institutions, most are substandard. There are two primary reasons for this: the confusion existing in our society over the purposes of imprisonment and the effects of reform on the correctional system. The focus of correction is continually shifting as reform movements exert their influence. Robert Martinson's work, extensively cited and attacked, suggests that \"rehabilitation efforts have had very little effect on recidivism.\" Optional Programming, the policy guiding the Bureau of Prisons' activities, allows optional inmate participation in vocational programs due to the belief that forced attendance may cause resistance. Optional Programming allows inmates to choose from a wide variety  of programs with the hope that the chances for successful post-release adjustment will be increased. Continued support for education and training in corrections depends on tying education and training to the work program of the institution. Improvement of educational programs rests in staff education and development, upgrading job qualifications, and improving job benefits and salary. The success of a strong base for education, training, and work in prisons depends on the ability of the staff to recognize its importance.

The plan consists of a rationale or stated need and general goals, policies, and procedures. As a component of the plan, local school goals were related to student needs in the form of twenty-two student goals. Additionally, improvement practices designed to meet student goals were written as teacher and administrator objectives and divided into seven categories of general competencies. Identified in the next section of plan were operating policies, procedures, and special considerations followed by a section addressing educational personnel needs  assessment. Specific procedures in the preparation phase of the plan were established and certification records were signed by the director once these procedures were completed. A system for on-the-job assessment was also established. Training agreements, developed cooperatively, were designed to assist in developing competencies to match indicated needs. There are advantages for schools who do develop a comprehensive plan, such as constancy in some procedures for different activities and the identification of policies and objectives prior to training activities. A comprehensive plan must still be designed to accomodate the needs of the school system where it will be used. (FP)",

        "description":"In developing modules for training vocational educators in nondiscriminatory practices, the authors of this paper saw a need for a new approach to competency identification--one that would enable teachers to use skills generalizable across many areas. A detailed review of the literature, from which twenty major project studies in competency identification were chosen for closer analysis, revealed problems in this area. Many competencies identified, for instance, lacked specificity; there was a high level of duplication of competencies across special needs areas, yet none of the lists encompassed all the special needs groups now appearing in vocational classrooms. Hence, the authors' approach to module development included the following: (1) competencies were identified from  scratch using the DACUM (Develop a Curriculum) method and adopting a national perspective; (2) the 384 competencies identified, at a high level of specificity, were clarified and combined to produce a single list for teachers working with all special needs students; (3) the list was submitted to verification panels to be ranked; (4) the competencies were grouped into major areas of application. Each of the fifteen modules to be developed covers a skill applicable across special needs (and &quot;normal&quot;) groups. The vocational teacher can be assisted in serving all students, mainstreamed or not, individually and effectively by acquiring these skills, such as &quot;Instructional Planning,&quot;&quot;Student Evaluation,&quot;&quot;Promotion of Peer Acceptance,&quot;&quot;Materials Selection/Development,&quot; or &quot;Special  Instructional Techniques.&quot; (Summary abstracts of the twenty studies are appended.)

Individual commitment to professional growth and administration allocation of time and resources are seen as prerequisites to implementation of any program. In discussing program types, the report cautions that large group programs, which use often-expensive outside consultants, are rarely tailored to specific district needs and should be added to extant programs only after local talent has been exhausted. The individual and small-group approach is considered best suited to the many schools with a high proportion of part-time faculty. Responsibilities are outlined for administrators, who are encouraged to visit and observe classes and to take responsibility for setting  a mood of cooperation to improve morale. Administrators are also urged to attend to problems and remember that improving learning in the classroom is a major goal. Teachers' and counselors' responsibilities are outlined; these individuals are urged to keep up with their fields, use new materials, share their expertise, and contribute to a \"Teacher's Idea Bank.\" A staff development program is not needed, the report maintains, to create a desire for growth but rather to enhance that desire which already exists. The appendix contains staff questionnaires and an outline of an individualized program. (CP)",

A workable plan should address the twin &quot;how's&quot; of deinstitutionalization and service delivery, with provision for supportive services to ease the transition to community life. Such services, to meet the mentally disabled's need for emotional support and the elderly's needs (which are often physical), can be home delivered or group centered in focus. Beyond essentials, such as health care, meals, chore services, and transportation, information and  referral services may be organized for employment, recreation, group support, and crisis intervention suitable for home, half-way house, foster home, or community-based group residence. The best-designed plan should be consonant with financial resources at the community's disposal, and should include some built-in evaluative mechanism to monitor effectiveness of services, delivery systems, and client need assessment over time. The main focus, above all, should be on that which is viable and appropriate in the given community for the clientele served. (CP)",

        "description":"Prospects for local purchase of plants, resulting in community-employee-owned firms (CEFs), as an alternative to shutdowns, are examined in this three-part study. Part 1 considers the nature of plants in terms of industry-community relationships and the effects of a closing. Part 2 evaluates, through a cost-benefit approach, the strategy involved in a community investment. After examining an actual case in detail, the authors consider alternatives along with the difficulties of estimating costs, both social and economic. Part 3 evaluates cost-benefit methodology itself in terms of strengths, limitations, and how it applies to CEFs. A final chapter examines the CEF for its ability to maintain local control and worker participation in the long run. In looking at the issues from  both statewide and local perspectives, the study notes that (1) local CEFs represent reassertion of control over one's personal fate in an increasingly centralized society, (2) economists and policy makers have tended to believe that corporate decisions to close plants are based on sound economic calculus (though such decisions relate costs and benefits to a company, not a community), and (3) the analysis in the report should serve as a model and as a tool to inform government officials who might support or reject CEF attempts. It shows the possibility that a company abandoned by a larger corporation can be run successfully by a community. (CP)",

The next essay, Participatory Research: Should It Be a New Methodology for Adult Educators? (Griffith and Cristarella), answers several questions about participatory research: (1) What is participatory research? (2) How does it compare with established methodologies? and (3) Should all adult educators be taught to carry out such research? The third paper, Participatory Research: Breaking the Academic Monopoly (Hall), also deals with the concept of participatory  research, especially with its future directions. Next, Boshier presents a conceptual and methodological perspective concerning research on participation in adult education.

        "description":"The increased attention to measuring career skills has resulted in more instrument development, more testing of students, and more test administrators. There are three key areas of concern. The first area is that of identifying purposes to be served by assessing career skills. Purposes include permitting descriptions of the current status of individuals or groups, and evaluation (effectiveness, utilization in program improvement, allocation of resources, and allocation of money). The second area is that of becoming an informed user of career skills tests--Is the instrument designed for the test audience?; Is the reading level appropriate?; Is the test reliable?; Is it valid?; and Is it free of sexual and cultural stereotyping? The third area concerns limitations in test design  and use. There are two principal concerns about the design of paper and pencil career skills assessment materials. They are (1) indirect measurement and the problem of sampling in assessing career skills, and (2) the effects of verbal ability on student performance on measures of career skills. Appropriate caution should be observed in using tests of career skills. (CT)",

Herr's comprehensive review and synthesis, &quot;Research in Career Education: The State of the Art&quot; (ED 149 177). Herr's major findings have been summarized in a list of statements. For example, two of these statements are as follows; (1) successful programs tended to show considerable community involvement and the bringing together of students and working adults in some way, and (2) several studies indicated that parents are still the most influential factor in students' career development. Several key observations also are presented regarding the impact and nature of the research conducted. The following are representative: attitudinal and affective outcomes,  such as changes in self-concept, were achieved less commonly than cognitive content; there was little evidence that institutional effects were considered; and in many projects the conceptual framework was obscure, thus making it difficult to know what changes in students or in teachers could be anticipated. The remainder of this document focuses on comments and questions teachers might want to consider and to ask researchers. These questions are based on guidelines in &quot;Ways to Evaluate Different Types of Career Education Activities: A Handbook of Evaluation Models&quot; (Anita Mitchell, et al.). (BM)",

Most of the research studies deal with teachers' occupational competencies and experience and use the task-analytical approach. The standardization of occupational competency tests is now the focus of several research efforts. One area which has attracted little research is the problems of teacher recruitment. An area where more research is recommended is that of personnel and materials resources and the disparity from state to state in availability of these resources,  especially money for funding. Another area, one in which much significant research has been done, is that of performance-based teacher education, which continues to grow and spread throughout many states. Other research has dealt with alternative techniques for dispensing system content and the ways to organize this content. It was concluded that, at present, vocational teacher education remains an ancillary activity, due partly to lack of financial support and sparseness of research in the field. (CT)",

The five sections each address one of the major concerns of an administrator: identifying students with handicaps, the individualized education program (IEP), student placement, monitoring and evaluating special services, and managing human resources. Definitions of the handicapped and nine categories of handicap offered in the 1976 vocational education legislation (Public Law 94-482) are provided as well as suggestions for establishing identification procedures (part 1). Detailed planning for each student is discussed in terms of the IEP--its  definition, participants, teacher's contribution, and format, content, and process (part 2). Implications of student placement by the administrator into the least restrictive environment are discussed next, including placement alternatives, admittance requirements, and program accessibility (part 3). An IEP status reporting system is recommended to monitor the program, and a procedure for evaluating the effectiveness of services is presented (part 4). Active teacher involvement is emphasized as important for successful implementation of program ideas and new procedures (part 5). Organization, conduction, and funding of inservice programs are discussed. A brief note on effective advisory councils to expand education and employment opportunities follows. (YLB)",

A section on pupil personnel service workers examines the necessity for such workers and the federal laws affecting education programming. The section on career development is divided into discussions of personal-social development needs (such as realistic work experiences) of handicapped individuals. The next section explores five elements of vocational assessment: (1) the importance of vocational assessment; (2) parents as partners in the assessment process; (3) federal laws and testing requirements; (4) special considerations for testing the  handicapped; and (5) the role of the counselor. This section also includes short descriptions of ten vocational evaluation systems. The final section explores the transition from school to work, including suggestions concerning job seeking, job development, job placement, and job follow through. (CT)",

        "description":"This paper explores the procedures utilized in developing a program model to assist parents of handicapped students in learning about their roles in enhancing the development of their children's skills and attitudes necessary for the work world. The first section discusses three basic assumptions about parents and their role in education: (1) their concern about their children; (2) their right to be involved in their child's educational program; and (3) their effectiveness as teachers. Questions that parents have about such topics as career education, parental support of the school, career development at home, parental support of their child's job selection and procurement process, and information resources are examined briefly in the next section. The third discusses a program  delivery system, including such elements as program goals, duration, resources, and evaluation. Appended materials include six career education objectives for the handicapped child, suggested parent activities, a directory of organizations related to the handicapped, and a fact sheet concerning the problems faced by parents of handicapped children.

        "description":"To alleviate the economic problems of youth, the Australian Education Council has expressed the need for a comprehensive youth policy whose aim should be to provide young people with options in education, training, or employment. Facts show a declining rate of retention to completion of secondary schools for males due to the present low employment levels and increased unemployment benefits. Conversely, a sharper decline in full-time employment opportunties for females and a reluctance to accept unemployment benefits influences females to stay in school. Student enrollment directly from school at universities, colleges, and technical and further education (TAFE) institutions has declined; the shortage of jobs, less value placed on degress, and unattractive scholarship plans act as  disincentives. A decline in full-time employment is almost offset by an increase in part-time job opportunities but, unemployment benefit policies discourage part-time work. Full-time students hold most part-time jobs. A youth policy will provide options which will make unemployment the least acceptable alternative as full-time employment opportunities decrease. Success depends on (1) responsible schools teaching the basic skills, (2) a counseling system emphasizing pastoral care, (3) a rationalized education and training allowance scheme, (4) institutional responsiveness, and (5) work opportunities. Too hasty emphasis on the role of vocational education and TAFE should be avoided. (YLB)",

A Homemakers Re-entry Program (HRP) addressing these needs was developed using CETA (Comprehensive Employment and Training Act) funding. It enrolled groups of women every three months following an assessment and testing preselection phase. The HRP, stressing individual development rather than skills development per se, involved orientation for self-assessment and study of career options, a work experience component consisting of two two-month  stints working for nonprofit agencies, and a final two-week job-readiness seminar or series of workshops. Some women chose basic education or other training prior to the work experience, and some were referred to CETA for courses following graduation from the HRP. Weekly seminars and peer support continued throughout the five-month HRP. As-yet incomplete evaluation of HRP's model (i.e., first-year operation) indicates considerable success, although low job retention of graduates is troublesome. Increased counseling and followup services should accompany program continuation. (Relevant evaluation forms, agendas, and questionnaires are appended.) (CP)",

Both the problems and alternative solutions are largely drawn from (1) the personal experience of the author in implementing and operating a state evaluation system; (2) the experience of providing technical evaluation assistance to several states; (3) consultation, conversation, and survey of a number of state evaluation coordinators; and (4) the input of the author's evaluation  colleagues. Problems are operational, procedural, and content-oriented. More specific topics concern follow-through, communication of results, systemization of evaluation efforts, employer cooperation, information utilization, effectiveness of the evaluation system, and emphasis on outcome evaluation. Following a discussion of each problem, two to six alternative solutions are listed with their respective advantages and disadvantages. Recommendations and observations specific to the problem and its alternatives then follow. (YLB)",

        "description":"The knowledge explosion dramatizes the need for education throughout peoples' lives, while technological change in particular fuels business, industry, and labor's imperative to cooperate closely with education to prepare people for work. In order to obtain the training, retraining, upgrading, and recycling of persons and skills, changes in work and life patterns, as well as incentive, will be needed. Numerous factors are altering the heretofore standard linear life pattern--factors such as inequitable work distribution among the population's three major age groups, a sense of job stagnation of underutilization, sex-role changes, and people's desire to pursue several educational or career tracks. Cyclic life patterns offer some relief from pressures and problems of linear life  pattern inflexibility, while also helping to deal with various social problems simultaneously. Possible academic-business cooperation in this area might include work leaves for education and flexitime to permit part-time, extended education. Educational institutions, in turn, must assess their courses, scheduling, and all factors affecting the way they meet adult learners' needs; they must encourage diversity of teaching and learning styles. Community colleges will need to help persons progressing in or changing careers. Business-industry-labor conferences, such as the one held at the National Center for Research in Vocational Education in 1978, can also help states to increase input into staff development and lifelong education for work.

        "description":"Career Education, which emphasizes individual development in all life roles (personal, social, economic), holds unique promise for educating the handicapped. Almost any model of career education is adaptable for use with handicapped children, and blending career education with the academic program of a handicapped child can become a significant aid to mainstreaming. All teachers of the handicapped should then be trained to use and adapt career education techniques and materials in mainstream settings. Nystrom (1977) developed a model for use in educating teachers which delineates the design of instruction in terms of descriptions of (1) the learner; (2) general instructional objectives with specific techniques, media, and support services; (3) evaluation criteria and methods; and  (4) specialized support materials and equipment. Project RETOOL at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, provides continuing education for teacher educators through workshops whose objectives are to inform teacher educators engaged in preparation of teachers of the handicapped about career education for the handicapped, to assist them in providing career education to their students, and to promote exchange of career education information among teacher educators. A summer career education workshop provided Tennessee public school teachers, counselors, and principals with a model for integrating career education into the curriculum. (YLB)",

Short-run business conditions are analyzed by measuring the behavior of a set of economic indicators covering three major categories: labor market, construction, and banking activity. Part 1 of this two-part study discusses data and methods used to measure local business activity and presents a comparative analysis of behavior in the eleven metropolitan areas. Part 2 presents detailed descriptions of what happened in each area. The eleven sections include brief introductory  discussions of the area economic structures and a detailed look at local business conditions, with some data presented via charts.

The test condition consisted of two different kinds of test, multiple-choice and short-answer, each containing two different levels of item complexity, knowledge and concept.

Looking at neurotic disorders requires the examination of guilt which burdens individuals as they realize their failure to fulfill responsibilities to themselves and others, and also the resulting anxiety caused by hurtful experiences which may impede mature responses in the future. The condition of neurosis, which is virtually impossible to quantify statistically, does present one significant finding from numerous research studies, i.e., neurotic individuals frequently come from homes with a high proportion of persons having neurotic symptoms. Several therapeutic views  provide strategies for dealing with neurosis, particularly psychoanalytic theory, behavior therapy, and humanist-existential therapies. Different types of neurotic disorder can be classified: anxiety, depersonalization, depression, hypochondria, hysteria, neurasthenia, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and phobias. (Author/HLM)",

An extensive literature review of research from 1950 to 1976 provided the basis for classification of career counseling outcomes. Issues emerging from this review included the following: (1) use of inappropriate criteria; (2) the tendency on the part of career counseling researchers to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; instead of building on each other's work; (3) a preponderance of self-report measures rather than measurement approaches; (4) relative infrequency with which validity or reliability data are reported for the instruments used; and (5) methodological shortcomings  concerning subject randomization, selection of appropriate comparison issues, and choice of type of statistical analysis. Although originally written for an Army project, this report can be used by career counseling researchers as a tool for selecting outcome measures. Numerous tables delineating the study, criterion or variable, and measurement procedure are provided for the user. (Author/HLM)",

Differences between experimental and control groups in health outcomes were also compared, and patients were identified for whom the new services might prove more effective. Day care is defined as a program of services provided under health leadership in an ambulatory care setting for adults who do not require 24-hour institutional care. Homemaker services consist of home management, personal care, supportive activities and health care management services. Subjects initially numbered 1,871 and were divided into three study groups: (1) day care patients and a control group, (2) homemaker  patients and a control group, and (3) patients who received both services and a control group. Findings reported that day care patients had fewer days per year (four) in a skilled nursing facility as compared to their control group (nine). Those using homemaker services spent the same amount of time in a skilled nursing facility as did their control group (four each). Also, the proportion of patients in the combined services experimental group who died during the study year was significantly lower than that of the control group. (Author/BMW)",

Among the findings were the following: (1) The Right to Read model was not useful for addressing all of the improvement-related problems faced by the schools. In particular, it seemed too cumbersome for the straightforward program changes some schools needed to make and too limited for addressing complex problems with political and fiscal sources. (2) The model had to be altered or adapted in order to use it in several schools. The most frequent adaptations included tailoring the model for use in secondary schools, supplementing it with the use of additional tools and strategies for diagnosing  problem areas, and incorporating activities to help school staffs clarify their values and assumptions about program improvements. (3) The model was helpful in aiding schools in considering questions about where they were, where they wanted to be, and how they should get there. (Appendixes contain checkpoints for the evaluation project and a chart comparing the model's implicit assumptions about program change with the &quot;real world&quot; constraints that the project encountered.)

Reading diagnostic tests also need to assess &quot;entry&quot; skills for the assignment of pupils to instruction, and &quot;exit&quot; skills at each grade level. The 21 benchmark skills for reading diagnosis that have been identified include reading comprehension, which is conceived as being measured through cloze procedures. Arranging these skills by grade level exhibits their cumulative nature, showing how more complex skills are built from simpler ones. Diagnosis of reading skill deficiencies can be accomplished by assessing the enabling skills in sequence, beginning with the more comprehensive and  proceeding to the simpler skills. (Author/RL)",

The project, which focuses on social, cognitive, and educational consequences of different patterns of language function and use, has involved collecting samples of the naturally occurring speech of 40 preschool children representing an equal number of black and white, lower and middle class children. The research was guided by questions about whether there are differences in the way black and white speakers structure portions of the lexicon and between vocabulary used in the home and in the school, whether phonology plays a greater role than grammar in producing teacher/student  misunderstanding, the extent to which children rely on nonverbal as opposed to verbal cues, the extent to which they are likely to adopt a hypothetical stance toward linguistic information, whether children adjust their speech to reflect the contextual needs of a situation, what children's metabehavioral activities are, whether there are situational differences in adults' language in structured situations, and what the proportion of different uses of questions is across different cultural groups. Analysis of the data might focus on lexical analysis, on analysis of mother/child interaction, or on investigation of constraints on conversation. (GT)",

        "description":"The traditional method of teaching writing to students in universities by correcting their errors supposes a generally well-developed sense of written language structure and formal English language discourse. The new population seeking higher education does not always possess such a background. An alternative instructional method is to use the systems of language structure to offer positive models. Sector analysis is one such scientific study of language that can be used to fuse the remedial needs of the inner-city student with college-level language awareness. Sector analysis, or X-Word Grammar, is a linguistic system developed by Robert L. Allen. Its particular strength is that it is a system for examining written English in relation to obligations or expectations that must be  fulfilled in conventional English. In X-Word Grammar, the sentence is defined as a series of slots or positions. The basic positions of subject, used in reference, and predicate, used in predication, are defined in terms of an X-Word that moves to the front of a yes/no question. A knowledge of positions and constructions combined with reader anticipation establishes a groundwork for critical and logical development of thinking. (MKM)",

The poor and the blacks in the 1960s and the aged and the handicapped in the 1970s turned to the media as they sought freedom to move, rejected separation and isolation, and sought access and independence by breaking the barriers of accommodations and architecture. The results of a year-long sampling of stories in major big-city daily newspapers point out that the new minorities of the aged and the handicapped are accumulating media coverage in the areas of community development, economics, human and group relations, power and resources, and environment and ecology. Minority stereotypes are being rejected in books and on television, and a new position of  respect for the aged and the handicapped is being promoted by politicians. In the future, other fragmented minorities, particularly those with physical limitations, will also insist that their needs be heard. (AEA)",

Sixty-six percent of the respondents annotated the composition itself, 5 percent responded only with letter grades, and 29 percent commented only in a space provided with no marking on the composition. Other responses tallied covered kinds of comments, classifying the student as to ethnic background, the validity of placing the student in a college level English  course, praising the student, and criticizing the assignment.

In addition, the FCC has defined diversity solely in terms of what any one station broadcasts regardless of what other stations in the same service area may be programing. Diversity as a goal of broadcast regulation can be examined in the context of three hypotheses: it is mandated by the First Amendment; it is necessary to remedy a structurally deficient system of broadcasting; and it yields pluralistic programing, which is itself a \"meritorious good.\" Of the three, the latter may be the most significant according to economist Bruce Owen, who suggests, however, that format duplication may increase consumer  satisfaction. Listeners who prefer a particular kind of programing comprise a \"community of taste\" and these communities delineate a market's need for pluralistic programing even though a particular community of taste may not be of enough economic interest to advertisers to support a station. One solution might be for the FCC to establish local boards to identify communities of taste and assign stations to each. This would necessitate some form of subsidy for those stations assigned unprofitable communities of taste. (TJ)",

The results supported previous research on local news credibility, suggesting that television was the more believable medium, even in a local context. Although similar instruments were used in both cities, differences between Detroit and Grand Rapids credibility data suggested that cross-city comparisons may not always be valid. Different reasons for using media were found in the two cities, suggesting that future research in media credibility should consider the effects of media environment, life-cycle position, community size, and community structure on media use before  considering credibility. The lack of perceived conflict in news presentation between local television and newspapers suggested that hypothetical conflict situations may not be valid assessments of credibility. (Author/RL)",

Characteristics of the high risk group (n=207) observed during 1962 are discussed, and a theory which suggests that schizophrenia is an evasion of life is explained. Among results of a diagnostic assessment conducted 10 years later with high and low risk samples (20 to 30 years old) were that all of the mothers of the high-risk Ss were seriously schizophrenic, that the birth of the schizophrenic group was relatively difficult; and that ANS (autonomic nervous system) recovery rate was found to predict very well to later schizophrenia. Separate analyses were conducted for male and female high risk individuals to examine the effects of seriousness of illness of  the mother, separation from parents during early life, pregnancy and birth complications, and ANS recovery and responsiveness on development of schizophrenia. Some tentative reflections regarding sex related findings are offered. It is concluded that the form which schizophrenia takes in men and women may be different along with withdrawal-activity dimenison and that these differences may be related to the hypothesized role of ANS factors in the learning of avoidance-withdrawal.

        "author":["Szwedek, Aleksander"],
        "description":"An important feature of the sentence in any language is its thematic structure, new/given information organization. It has been found that in English, where word order is grammatically determined, the thematic structure is signalled by the place of the sentence stress. If an indefinite noun (new information) is present in the sentence, it bears the stress in non-contrastive intonation, no matter what its function and position is. In the presence of a definite noun, the stress falls on the element in sentence-final position, or on the preceding element if nothing follows the noun. Any violation of word order or the place of the stress gives a contrastive reading. In Polish, where grammatical functions are indicated by endings, the thematic structure is signalled by word order and  sentence stress. Neutrally, the stress falls on the new information, i.e., on the non-coreferential noun, and it is placed as far to the end of the sentence as possible, new information moving with it. Thus, in English, the stress on new information and SVO order are constants, given/new information organization a variable; in Polish, stress on new information and given/new order are constants, SVO order a variable. Any violation of one of the constants leads to a contrastive reading. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the relationship between language proficiency and intelligence. In particular, the paper is concerned with the elements of intelligence testing which creep into tests designed to determine language proficiency, and the proliferation of testing of all types and the kinds of interpretations made of these tests. Particular reference is made to the non-native adult speaker of English who is frequently subject to these types of tests. Native-speaker data indicate that the reading section of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) presents difficulty for the native and non-native speaker of English alike, and that both groups find this section the most difficult of the test. A comparison of TOEFL and Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores for foreign  students applying for admission to Texas A&amp;M University did not show a very high correlation. A Swedish study which attempted to examine the relationship between proficiency in English as a second language and various intelligence factors was also unable to find high correlation between the two types of test. Indications are that the GRE and similar tests are not appropriate for determining second language proficiency. More investigation is needed of the relationship between language and intelligence; in particular, joint research on this question by linguists, psychologists, and measurement specialists is needed.

        "description":"Most instructional materials developed in the past 10-15 years do not provide for sufficient activities to allow the student to become involved in anything other than drill and memorization. Furthermore, in those situations where &quot;communication activities&quot; do occur, they are designed to teach the sentence as a structural, grammatical element of the language, rather than utterance as it is used in the performance of acts of communication. It is possible, desirable, and appropriate to structure class activities, even at the first stage of instruction, to emphasize &quot;purposeful&quot; communicative language use, i.e., where sender and receiver interact to accomplish a mutually defined goal or objective. This paper considers the theoretical and practical issues as they relate to the  incorporation of actual communication training in the elementary level ESL class. The vehicle employed for communication training is the task-oriented dyad--a simple system which allows for face-to-face purposeful communication between two individuals while providing the opportunity to manipulate variables such as interactant characteristics, feedback availability and task difficulty. The paper, specifically considers dyadic communication tasks appropriate for teaching and testing skills in three broad categories of communicative speech acts--requests, manipulative instructions, and descriptions. Sample protype classroom-tested tasks are appended. (Author/CLK)",

        "description":"This paper presents arguments in favor of using partial dictation as a test of foreign language proficiency. In this kind of test, subjects listen to recordings of material in the foreign language and are required to fill in missing words in a written version of the recordings. Partial dictation is preferable to ordinary dictation in that: (1) it makes possible the use of different voices and speech situations; (2) it is more economical; and (3) the testing situation is more natural, being subject to fewer interruptions. In addition, partial dictation appears to be reliable and to correspond very well to other measures of foreign language proficiency; it is easy to construct, administer, and score; and it is useful, not only as a measure of listening comprehension, but as a  global estimate of language proficiency. An incomplete analysis is presented of errors found in connection with this test, on the levels of phonology, lexicology, and grammar. Appendices contain two sample passages used in a partial dictation test, and a listing of average scores for each item, from a random sampling of 20 subjects. (Author/AM)",

MONIQUE is not designed for computer-assisted instruction or testing but for supplementary drillwork, affording the student unlimited access to drills. With minimal editing MONIQUE can be converted into computerized drills in any language. The cost factors involved in using MONIQUE are relatively small. The time factor for the teacher is equally small--it involves no more time than that needed for creating a 20-25 item daily classroom quiz. Benefits gained from  using the program are primarily motivational since it provides the student with readily available drills based on material currently being studied in class and with ungraded mini-tests for practice.

In these studies, bilinguals showed higher levels of general intellectual skills, higher levels of divergent thinking, a more analytic orientation to language and greater sensitivity to feedback cues. However, studies conducted in \"subtractive\" environments, where the less prestigious first language is in the process of replacement by the second language, have tended to report that bilinguals experienced difficulties in expressing their intelligence through language. The competence that a bilingual gains in his two languages may act as an intervening  variable in mediating the effects of his bilingual learning experiences on cognitive growth, i.e., there may be threshold levels of linguistic competence which bilingual children must attain in order both to avoid cognitive deficits and to allow the potentially beneficial aspects of becoming bilingual to influence cognitive growth.

They indicate further that this learning experience should involve a total climate of learning. (LBH)",

        "description":"The two techniques for advanced standing treated here are (1) the Advanced Placement Program administered by the College Entrance Examination Board and (2) the various plans that enable superior students to take courses in nearby colleges and universities while they are completing their high school programs. Some outcomes of advanced standing practices are: improved communication between the high schools and colleges; greater emphasis on program planning to accommodate individual student abilities and achievements; the opportunity for advanced standing students to include in the collegiate programs studies that they might not normally have had time to pursue; and financial savings to students whose stay in college is shortened by acceleration. More than 25 percent of the  four-year colleges and universities subscribe to the principles of the CEEB program, and a number of institutions have developed other advanced standing programs. Reports on the performance of advanced standing students indicate a high degree of satisfaction with this means of motivating superior students and providing them with opportunities to progress at the rates at which they are capable.

        "description":"Increasingly wide differences in abilities and experiences of entering students, changing student and institutional objectives, and changing teaching-learning techniques have led educators to reappraise the traditional credit system and to modify the strict use of class time as a quantitative measure of student progress. Three modes of deviation from formal class-hour credits are currently in use: (1) flexibility in class-hour requirements, as in independent study; (2) credit by examination, where students are able to demonstrate the required competence in certain courses in lieu of class attendance; and (3) comprehensive examinations, which require more than the accumulation of credits, in an effort to provide evaluation superior to marks in isolated courses and to encourage  integration of subject matter. Because the credit system effects student outlook, institutional program planning, and the utilization of staff time and physical facilities, the cooperative development of an improved system for recording and communicating evaluations of student progress may be an important factor in improving the processes by which students become educated.

This report deals with the general status of programs of group study abroad as of the academic year 1959-60 and discusses objectives and problems of accreditation and evaluation of such programs. Individual study abroad is not included. Four program patterns of group study abroad are identified: the organized year abroad; the academic term abroad; the summer session abroad; and the study tour. The effectiveness of study abroad is dependent upon precisely defined objectives and creative integration of the foreign experience within the student's educational framework on the home campus. A careful evaluation of outcomes should also be made as a basis for continuous program improvement. Institutional  cooperation and coordination of efforts are needed to broaden objectives and opportunities and to maintain standards. The problems of finance are not so much one of financing the program as one of financing the student. (Author/LBH)",

Three general types of practices leading to curricular flexibility are emerging: (1) Substituting courses permits omission of certain courses in which the student demonstrates the required proficiency. (2) Course patterns designed to provide curricular flexibility place primary emphasis on special courses or special sections for exceptional students. (3) Teaching-learning techniques may provide for flexibility through instructional practices of individual teachers and through other teacher-student relationships in the  learning process. It is concluded that the success of practices resulting in curricular flexibility depends not on artificial devices but on the campus atmosphere, the quality of instruction and of the student body, the personality of the faculty, and their interest in planning and implementing program arrangements best suited to their particular student clientele.

It is an area in which the role and responsibilities of the state and of the institutions are frequently matters of contention. Several reasons have been given for this state interest: the growth of state government, the increasing complexity of higher education, and more widespread interest in college and university education. Centralization of control of public higher education has increased from twelve states in 1932 to all states at present. The state role can be traced from the normal school movement in the 1830's and 1840's, through the Morrill Land Grant Act and the G.I. bill to the present development of state coordinating boards. The significance  of the statewide coordinating board is that it represents a structure that can address the issues of postsecondary education while reasonably accommodating the historical role of public higher education and providing state government with sufficient assurance of accountability.

        "author":["Giles, Geoffrey J."],
        "description":"Quebec colleges remained firmly entrenched in the pure classicism of prerevolutionary France until well into the twentieth century. Formal Roman Catholic Church control of Laval University, a Jesuit university, ceased in 1965 at a time when the institution and its administration were expanding greatly, and the faculty quickly began to resent the rule of bureaucrats over their affairs. Major changes had already been set in motion by the 1963 royal commission of inquiry into education in the province. Access to education was democratized, faculty was expanded, and budgetary economies and accountability were imposed. One result was the lowering of Laval's previously high faculty salaries. Unionization occurred, but in a haphazard fashion. There were several faculty concerns at  Laval: the absence of collegial governance, the extremely precarious position of untenured faculty, and the lack of a fixed salary scale. A faculty union was established in early 1975 at Laval, but collective bargaining was slow, and a 108-day strike begain in September 1976. The sharing of power that the administration was willing to grant was minimal in real terms, even after the strike gained in intensity. A return-to-work agreement was signed on December 23, 1976, and the collective agreement was signed in January 1977. The contract runs until the end of May 1978, and represents a compromise on issues. A fixed salary schedule has been established, the faculty have been granted much greater job security, procedures for selection and hiring are spelled out in great detail, and the right  of appeal of promotion and contract renewal decisions is specified.

Presently, one out of every four faculty and professional staff, or approximately 120,000 individuals (two-thirds of whom work in four-year colleges), are members of a labor organization. The literature on the topic has evolved from anecdotal discussions to more sophisticated and analytical materials. The key predictors of faculty unionism are: institutional transition and growth; size; public versus private affiliation; the presence of enabling legislation; and poor faculty and administration relationships caused by structural and functional change. The use of data gathered in attitudinal studies may produce invalid predictions of faculty bargaining behavior. The impact of faculty  unions on governance--particularly faculty senates--is of special concern, as is the topic of the student's role in bargaining. Similarly, the union's impact on faculty salaries and fringe benefits is a topic of debate whose end is not in sight. Research on faculty-administration interaction has produced little data and much speculation. Researchers and practitioners have, however, discovered that unionism is neither the panacea that some had seen it as nor the peril that others had feared. (MSE)",

Attainment is contrasted with competence as a basis on which to award college degrees in terms of their respective characteristics, assessment practices, and accountability for standards. A case is made that attainment, the educable enabler of competence, is preferred to competence itself as the basis on which to certify learning outcomes of educational programs. (Author/LBH)",

Forty-four interested volunteers were divided equally into a treatment and control group on the basis of pretest scores on the Study Techniques Survey, Study Organization Survey, and Study Motivation Survey, sex, age, class status, and high school rank. All subjects were posttested immediately following the final seminar of the workshop. Statistical T-analysis revealed that those resident freshmen participating in the study skills workshop significantly improved in all three study skills areas tested as compared to the control group. It was recommended that an ongoing  campus-wide developmental course in study skills be established, and that further research on study skills programming examine the resulting effects on overall satisfaction, grades and attrition rates.

Yet there has always remained the belief that the college experience can transform the lives of students. Descriptive procedures and formal instruments for the assessment of the transformation have been prepared.

As war and militarism declined as dominant issues provoking campus unrest, assaults on the structure of higher education sharpened. The experience of the University of New Mexico was typical: faculties became polarized between those defending traditional academic practices and standards and those taking an antiestablishment stand. Frequent and acrimonious debates occurred over grading practices, academic regulations, curriculum requirements, student participation in governance, and tenure and promotion policies, among others. An empirical study at the university  undertook to specify factors or characteristics predicting faculty receptivity to antitraditional or radical educational values. Responses to a questionnaire were analyzed. Three themes were present in the questions, each counterposing two ideologies: (1) egalitarianism versus meritocracy; (2) science as the objective search for truth versus science as ideology; and (3) positivism versus personalism in pedagogical methods. Results are discussed as they relate to faculty militancy and unionization. (MSE)",

The first, an experiment using 176 fifth graders, tested three hypotheses: (1) When content is held constant across messages, different formats of a medium differentially call for mental skills. (2) Formats which call for the same skills in different ways affect learners differently. (3) The TV formats identified as critical differentially interact with initial skill mastery in the service of knowledge acquisition. The results indicated that different formats differentially affect mental skills, that there is a different pattern of correlation between skills and knowledge acquisition within each format group, and that the kinds of skills a code calls for are partly dependent upon what the learner perceives as the task requirements. The  second study was a cross-cultural comparison between Israeli and American samples of fourth and sixth graders. Four hypotheses were tested: (1) Literate exposure to TV correlates positively with mastery of the relevant mental skills. (2) Such correlations are to be found particularly among younger children. (3) A group with heavier exposure to TV also displays better mastery of the relevant skills, but not of the irrelevant ones. (4) Groups with similar amounts of exposure to TV but of different SES backgrounds have more similar levels of relevant skill mastery than other skills. The first three hypotheses were supported, though the fourth was not. The report concludes with the reconsideration of certain assumptions relative to codes.

        "description":"This is the second volume of a two volume study. The first volume examined the literature to identify authoring aids for developing instructional materials, and to identify information clearing houses for existing materials. The purpose of this volume was to develop a means for assessing the cost versus expected benefits of innovations in computer-based training systems. A three-pronged approach was used to address the problem. First, a descriptive model of a generalized, computer-based training system was developed. Second, a predictive model was generated to describe student performance in a computer-based training environment. Third a computer program incorporating the predictive model was developed to estimate the cost of implementing one particular training innovation, i.e.,  revision of a conventional instructional program into a self-paced instructional program. A linear prediction model was developed to predict the time required for a student to complete a unit of self-paced instruction, thereby demonstrating the time saved by converting from a conventional instructional mode. This was combined with the Rand Corporation's MODIA cost analysis program. The study demonstrated that a viable time savings and cost model can be developed, given a sufficient data base from which to draw the necessary course content and student characteristics descriptions.

School libraries have made significant developments in integrating audiovisual media into traditional programs, and are becoming learning resource centers with a variety of media; academic and public libraries are moving at a slower pace. An increase in cooperative activity between the library and audiovisual fields is apparent. In this information rich world, contemporary media provide information for the masses, yet there is reluctance to accept these forms of communication in the school and library. We need to ask not what audiovisual media and technology can contribute to the library, but what types of people are seeking what types of  information and how successful they are in fulfilling their needs. We must ask ourselves how well prepared we are for a future of increased: (1) independent study; (2) need for meeting clients' needs; (3) knowledge of special contributions to learning by each type of media; (4) recognition of future development of technology; and (5) acceptance and use of a behavioral approach to community information problems. Library schools need to encourage originality, boldness, and flexibility for dealing with the future. (Author/KP)",

This paper reviews the model found most useful for the analysis of barriers to the adoption of telecommunications technologies. Characteristics which have been found to be related to the degree of innovation adoption are: (1) status of knowledge and engineering; (2) value attributes; (3) trialability; (4) complexity; (5) communicability; (6) regulation; and (7) autonomy of operation. Relevance, compatability, and relative advantage are examined as characteristics of application which influence the innovation process. Results show that: (1) radio and telephone have the least number of barriers; (2) there  are many barriers to cable television use, including technical and distribution problems; (3) time, cost and need to aggregate demand limit autonomy of operations; and (4) regulation and the complexity of telecommunications technologies are barriers to adoption.

Five experimental groups studied a set of eight passages under different prequestion-postquestion combinations. Twenty-five subjects, volunteers with high school degrees, were randomly assigned to each group. A final retention test had 32 items classified along two dimensions: one dependant on whether the inserted text questions prompted attention to the item, and the other dependant on whether the item required factual or inferential learning. The CAI format facilitated control over exposure to questions and passages, as well as data collection on performance measures like referral to passages, time spent on inserted questions, total study time, and scores  on postquestion sets. A combination of prequestions and postquestions led to a 20% increase in student study time relative to the use of either question format alone, but did not facilitate relevant retention beyond the facilitation found with just prequestions or just postquestions. The use of prequestions interfered with incidental learning. While equal to the prequestions format in study time and effect on relevant learning, the postquestions format seemed preferable since it was not accompanied by depressed incidental learning.

It divides relevant research into three areas of instructional modeling: models of the subject matter; models of the learner's state of knowledge; and models of teaching strategies. Within these areas, work sponsored by Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) plays a prominent role in theoretical advances. ARPA sponsored research has concentrated both on the development of instructional systems teaching subjects like programming and problem solving, and on research basic to the improvement of adaptive instructional systems in general. The review concludes that as a CAI system becomes more responsive to natural language input, the number of extraneous skills a student  must develop in order to interact with the program decreases. Also, providing an author with the opportunity to interact with the computer in natural language lessens the time required to create CAI materials, as well as the constraints imposed on those materials by working in a programming language.

        "description":"As a follow-up to a 1975 study of Waubonsee Community College (WCC), a survey was undertaken in spring 1977 to determine the strong and weak points of WCC, to gain an overall view of student attitudes, and to provide data for later comparison. The survey instrument, Student Reactions to College, was administered to a random sample of 555 WCC students. Of the 174 items, only 22 were found to have significantly different responses from the previous study, including student approval of food services, a preference for graded courses, and an approval of student government. Also expressed was a preference for continuing compulsory student fees, and a greater difficulty compared to 1975 respondents with math, reading expectations, and talking with teachers outside the class. Overall the  college received the same favorable rating as in 1975. Appended tables give the rankings of the median scores for 1977 and 1975 along with Spearman rank order correlation values. (KJC)",

Major reasons for leaving DCCC were transfer to  another institution (22.4%), home or work obligations (12.2%), financial problems (10.2%), and moving from the area (9.1%). Asked to choose three factors which, if changed for the better, would encourage respondents to stay at DCCC, the scheduling of classes, course content in major fields, and counseling/guidance services were ranked highest. The majority of respondents expressed satisfaction with their experiences at DCCC and expected to return at some future date.

National trends among community colleges that emerged included (1) the development of distinct purposes and identities; (2) funding mechanisms which increasingly resemble those of four-year institutions; (3) legally distinct governance and funding; (4) budget review procedures with line-item appropriations; (5) an increasing state share of support with decreasing local support; and (6) the development of the &quot;community college&quot; concept with a wide variety of programs, courses, and activities. Levels of support for  students, the arguments and consequences of state/local funding, the variety of finance mechanisms, finance formulas related to affirmative action, and the issues of educational equity and tuition and fees were also explored. Two major conclusions were drawn: before adopting any finance system a state must (1) decide the basic issues of mission, breadth of offering, and student body composition, and (2) recognize the great force among two-year colleges of tradition and local circumstances. The survey questionnaire and details of the Florida cost-analysis model are appended. (RT)",

The E-B model emphasizes small-group instruction, using sequenced daily lessons in reading, arithmetic and language designed by Engelmann and published under the trade name DISTAR. Data on almost 12,000 disadvantaged students in E-B programs in 20 Oregon school districts is presented in tables and accompanying text. Half the children had started the program in kindergarten, half in 1st grade. Achievement was measured by the Wide Range Achievement Test, the Metropolitan  Achievement Test and the Slosson Intelligence Test. Results indicate model effectiveness in building basic skills for a wide variety of disadvantaged students. On all measures, children were at or near national norms by the end of 3rd grade. Follow-up testing of 5th- and 6th- graders demonstrated continuing effectiveness two and three years after the program in spite of losses against the norms. Testing losses in reading comprehension after 3rd grade are seen as due to the sudden shift to an unrestricted vocabulary in reading comprehension tests and 4th-grade textbooks. Report recommendations emphasize an early start to basic skill instruction, systematic expansion of basic vocabulary and the extension of follow-through programs until minimal adult competencies are met.

        "description":"This speech presents observations, made on a trip in June 1976, of the aesthetic environments of children in China, Japan, and Hong Kong. Home, school and day care environments are compared in terms of living and play space, room decor, the presence of art and toys, dramatic play and performance, music, nature and outdoor appreciation, food and clothing. A limited amount of residential space was evident in all the countries visited. Space available to day care centers and kindergartens fluctuated greatly in China and Hong Kong, whereas in Tokyo generous amounts of outdoor space were provided as a policy for kindergartens. In China, children's art was confined to art classrooms. Folk art and traditional art forms were highly encouraged, however, and Chinese children often showed a  high level of skill. Hong Kong child care centers and Japanese kindergartens were filled with colorful posters, toys, and children's art; Japanese kindergartens also provided children with exposure to traditional dress and ritual. In China, emphasis was placed on public performance of dance, drama, and music featuring real-life themes related to national goals. Dramatic play was observed in Hong Kong and puppet dramas were common in Japan but there was little emphasis on public performance in either site. Exposure to beautiful outdoor plant and flower arrangements was available in Japan; in contrast, outdoor space was generally used for vegetable gardening in China. It is concluded that the growth of aesthetic sensibility and artistic skills is encouraged in each of the sites visited,  although different factors are emphasized in each milieu. (SB)",

A total of 546 elementary and secondary school students served as subjects for the studies. The tasks for all of the studies involved deriving the pattern for a sequence from a given sample so as to be able to generate a continuation of that sequence. Materials for the sequences consisted of geometric shapes and colors arranged according to rules for patterns of varying complexity. Performance was scored on the basis of the product completed and the strategy used to go about the task. Results indicated that observation of a model had the greatest impact on children who had a beginning understanding of the  sequential patterns but who were not yet able to handle them competently on their own. Results are discussed in relation to the role of imitation and in relation to the role which specific contextual variables such as task design and mode of testing play in cognitive functioning.

One interpretation is that the lateral looking responses of the infants are attributable to maturational effects on the infants' physiological capacity to orient toward the lateral sound stimulus during the displacement condition. The second interpretation is that violations of the intermodal person schema occurred when the infant was presented with displaced face-voice pairs, which resulted in increased looking, head turning, or general exploration. A sample of 7 one-month-old and 10 four-month-old full-term, home-reared Caucasian infants of both sexes were tested  individually. There were four general experimental conditions: (1) normal: either mother or adult female stranger presented to the infant with her voice transmitted through the center speaker; (2) displacement: mother or stranger presented with her voice transmitted through a side speaker; (3) discrepancy: either mother or stranger presented with the voice of the other transmitted throught the center speaker and (4) control: face or voice of mother or stranger presented alone. Results were interpreted as supporting a differential pattern of responding by infants as early as the first month of life to violation of the person schema through distortion in the visual-auditory organization of that schema.

Designed as an attempt to meet children's developmental learning needs the project represents an attempt to put the developmental theories of Piaget, Bruner and other psychologists into practice. The project involved first familiarizing school personnel with the theory and principles to be applied, then designing a relevant curricular framework. The cognitive area, specifically reading development, was chosen as the focus of the first year program, and Guilford's Structure of the Intellect was selected as the theoretical perspective for the program. The Formula Phonics Reading Chain was chosen as the basic reading  program because of its emphasis on reading as a problem solving process and because it encouraged small group, ungraded instruction. Staff and parent orientation and involvement were emphasized. First year results indicated significant gains in reading achievement for the Cornelius students at all socioeconomic and ability levels. Implications and suggestions for expansion and replication are discussed. (BD)",

Raters assigned subjects' responses to one of three categories: pre-logical, concrete-logical, and formal-logical.

Thus, in addition to a category of imcomprehension, six types of explanations of health and illness were developmentally ordered with chronological age utilized as a gross index of developmental status. Each type of explanation is described. Types include:  Phenomenistic, Contagion, Contamination, Internalization, Physiological, and Psycho Physiological. (Author/SB)",

A step-by-step procedure for doing a developmental assessment is outlined. The steps include determining the goals and specific objectives of the program, choosing the best ways of gathering information, gathering the information, using the information to plan the program, reassessing to check the child's progress in the program, and planning again. Special emphasis is given to ways of gathering information, which include using published  instruments, locally-developed instruments, systematic observation, parent interviews and questionnaires and samples of the child's work. Also discussed are changing concepts of testing, assessment and evaluation, formative and summative evaluation, normative and criterion referencing, and commentaries and conflicting views on the place of tests, testing and assessment in evaluation.

Most instruments are designed to measure whether or not the respondent has the same information pool, language, and organizational system as the designer of the test. It is proposed that the proper approach to assessment is not to ask \"Do you know what I know?\" but rather \"What is it that you know? Can you speak your native language? How do you organize?\" An assessment procedure for Black  children that works within their whole historical, traditional, and cultural background is discussed. The interactive nature of any assessment procedure is noted, and it is suggested that assessment should be used for solving specific pedagogical problems rather than for labeling or prediction.

All children walked through the model three times. Half the children at each grade level constructed the town after each walk; the other half constructed the town only after the third walk. Accuracy of construction improved as a function of motor experience with the town (number of walks) for children at all grade levels. On the first construction, fifth graders placed buildings more accurately on both topological and Euclidean measures than did  younger children. On successive constructions, age differences diminished greatly on both measures. No significant sex differences in performance were found in any of the analyses.

The focus of investigation was the relationship between role structure in the community and player organization in games; the expressive nature of games as defined by specific values reflected in games and game behavior was also investigated. Due to the reserved nature of the Tununak people, the method of investigation was primarily observational, although questions were addressed to and answered by an atypical girl, two established white teachers, and an island native living off the Island who had returned for a summer visit. Results indicated: that there was a correlation in traditional Eskimo society between complexity of societal role structure  and player organization in games; that while culture change had affected community role structure dramatically, such role changes were not reflected in game role organization; that Eskimos had adopted many new games and new types of games, but the organization of players remained essentially similar to that of their traditional games (it was suggested that this was due to the influence of conservative cultural values still operative in this society); that values had not changed at the same rate as other aspects of this Eskimo culture, and games preferred by contemporary Eskimos here were still those in which game role organization and rules were consistant with the traditional cultural value system.

Objectives of Phase I were to produce a preliminary planning guide which provided a compendium of research, survey, and demonstration projects at the state and national levels, included a plan for a short term study and assessment with a time-table of scheduled tasks for implementation of the plan, and identified legislation affecting the migrant farm population. The study plan was designed around four major areas: education, health, employment and job training, and other social services. Each of these areas was studied in terms of Federal, regional, state, and local applications. The research design was a basic 4x5 matrix,  with each cell examined across five levels of participation and involvement: Federal, state, regional, local and individual (the migrants themselves). Each cell also represented a major study objective. The main research thrust was to determine which cell indicated success toward coordination or magnified lack of coordination. To facilitate discussion of the study plan, each major activity is discussed in terms of an objective; pertinent information, rationale for inclusion, funding data, etc.; proposed task statements; and schedule of tasks. Also included are a brief discussion of the relevant legislation, the review of literature on coordination, a 70-item annotated bibliography, and brief descriptions of six Federal agencies which provide funding for adult and family programs.

        "description":"Since the resurgence of bilingual schooling in the early sixties, the southwestern states have provided substantial leadership in facilitating the growth and development of cultural pluralism and bilingual education. Visible are two types of bilingual education programs: assimilation models which are designed to produce ethnic language shift, and pluralistic models which tend to foster native language and cultural maintenance while acquiring the second linguistic code and culture. Although the earliest bilingual programs in the Southwest were predominantly oriented to the Spanish speaking, current programs have diversified to include various Native American and Asian languages. As bilingual-bicultural programs grow, the need for increased supporting services, adequate teacher  training, and effective program evaluation becomes critical. The paper reviews the incidences of bilingualism and lack of educational achievement of non-English minorities in the southwestern states and the steps taken to provide educational programs responsive to the needs of these students; gives a statement of definitions; and discusses the rationale, programs, structure, and implications of bilingual-bicultural education in the Southwest. Appended are guidelines for: Arizona's bilingual teachers; the professional preparation for the Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Specialist; the evaluation of individual teacher performance in a bilingual setting; the evaluation of bilingual programs in California.

In previous years the K-4 portions of the program were pilot-tested; during the spring of 1977 the portions for grades 5 and 6 were pilot-tested with 932 students in 8 schools. Pretests, progress tests, and posttests were administered; pilot teachers recorded daily experiences; and tests on the customary system of measurement were administered to two control schools and one pilot school. On the posttest, 79.5% of the fifth graders and 81.3% of the sixth graders responded correctly to the items. Students using THE 4M COMPANY learned significantly more about the metric system and about the customary system than did students studying only the customary system. Test scores and analyses are  reported; teacher comments are summarized by topic and grade level. Sample test items are also included. (MS)",

The authors have developed a taxonomy which organizes legal education materials according to their objectives into six categories: (1) role of law in society, (2) concepts related to law, (3) constitutional law and civil rights, (4) criminal law and the criminal justice system, (5) contemporary issues, and (6) substantive law. Each piece of material is tagged by category  to aid teachers in the selection process. The individual analyses of the materials contain hard data about the publisher, author or developer, publication date, grade level, and cost. The rationale and objectives for each program, intended user characteristics, time necessary for implementation, major teaching/learning strategy, and content focus are also included.

        "description":"The paper highlights economic and social problems that current population trends in New York State are likely to create. Major features of population change in New York are: (1) transition from steady growth to near stability; (2) an end to metropolitan growth statewide and the onset of decline in four of the state's ten Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas; (3) intensification of growth in selected nonmetropolitan areas; and (4) wide variation in the rate of population change for different age groups. Changing distribution of age groups among New York State's counties is examined in light of fiscal and political accommodations which will be required. For example, the decreasing number of children of school age will affect school and college enrollments, whereas the increasing  number of elderly persons will require additional social services. Two widely held beliefs about migration are examined--one that low-income migrants go to major urban centers as welfare seekers, and the other that rural-urban migration transplants rural poverty to an urban setting. Findings indicate that both beliefs are erroneous. It is concluded that demographic analysis has numerous specific applications at the state level and should be taken into consideration by policy makers whether they formulate policy as problems come up, project trends into the future and devise social mechanisms accordingly, or designate explicit future goals and devise plans to achieve them. Charts, tables, and maps are included in the document. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"Persons responsible for ethical education policy formation in the United States must consider two factors: (1) variations in ethical awareness of a pluralistic society; and (2) the current status of ethical education in the public schools. Recent Gallup Polls indicate public demand for ethical education in the schools, although there is no consensus among parents and teachers as to the specific nature of ethical behavior and/or moral behavior. The document identifies key issues and problems of public policy for ethical education, including content and procedure of ethical education in the schools, school/community and student/school relationships, and student attitudes towards ethical education programs. The paper refers to existing recommendations by educational authorities for  addressing these issues and problems and reviews state educational agency programs in moral reasoning, personal development, law-related education, community awareness, school community relations, and economic-political education. Instructional assessment by state departments of education, objectives, and criteria for success of ethical education programs are considered. A major demonstration of the success of ethical education would be public demonstration of democratic values through ethical action and manner of practice. The conclusion is that public policy makers should take advantage of public desire for ethical education and make the schools a catalyst for renewal of public cooperative actions of an ethical nature.

Class size and organization were found to have an effect on average number of friends and on the number, size, and stability of cliques. Fewest children excluded from cliques were found in the sixth grade. While some cross sex friendships were reported, a total sex cleavage existed between  boys' and girls' cliques in every class.

The basic aim of a multicultural instructional program is to help students to accept themselves and other persons as having dignity and worth. To achieve this aim, a multicultural program should place emphasis on similarities and differences among individuals and groups and should be cross-cultural and interdisciplinary in nature. So that indicators may be prepared to fulfill their responsibilities in multicultural education, staff development must be specifically aimed at their acceptance of the need to implement changes. The guide recommends a  comprehensive approach to staff training that makes use of normative reeducative strategy of change and the dialogue-inquiry process. This strategy and process place emphasis on human interactions and help teachers become aware of and reevaluate their beliefs, attitudes, and values. The guide also contains a system model for school district planning for multicultural education, definitions of terms and concepts, and two analysis instruments for ethnic studies curricula.

However, John Dewey's exceptionally coherent life of scholarship combined with social and political activism demonstrates that it is both possible and desirable to integrate the two. According to Dewey's philosophical pragmatism, the purpose of inquiry is to deal with &quot;the problems of men.&quot; His theory of inquiry and his social theory lead directly to social action. For Dewey, once we know how to go about developing intelligence, we ought to try to do it. Thus, philosophers and social scientists have a special responsibility to act as public educators, engaging in intelligent political action to demonstrate to others how it is done. Moreover, social scientists have a uniquely compelling reason to exercise  civic virtue, in order to test theory through practice. Therefore, Dewey's philosophy makes social and political action mandatory for scholars in general and social scientists in particular. Dewey carried his own ideas into action in an exemplary way of integrating scholarship and citizenship. He thought through the problems of his time sensitively and seriously and then did what he could to remedy them. (Author/KC)",

Part of a crossnational study to assess organizational membership impact on politics in eight western democracies, the paper reports only on data for the United States. Theoretical concerns of the study focus on changing trends in political protest, characteristics and  motivation of individuals involved in protest, and the relationship between economic deprivation and political action. Survey respondents were asked to identify membership and classify level of activity in 19 types of organizations. Results were classified by sex, educational level, age, and race. An organizational activism index was created. Findings concerning the importance of organizational involvement for conventional participation are supported by the data. However, these analyses do not confirm the presumed impact of organizational involvement on reducing protest, dissatisfaction, and distrust in government. (Author/DB)",

Data from literature on schools, citizen participation, and organizations were reviewed in conjunction with a survey of midwestern elementary school principals. The hypothesis was that schools experiencing high levels of community involvement and support have higher achievement levels than those experiencing low levels of involvement and support. Data were gathered from official documents made available by the school system and questionnaires sent to principals in a sample of 135 elementary schools. Care was taken to control for school socioeconomic status and school structure variables such as enrollment, class size, average pupil mobility, specialization, and percent  minority teachers. Data on rules, regulations, and characteristics of a specific school were treated to factor, multiple regression, and correlation analysis and related to a standardization scale. Findings indicated that several dimensions of community involvement and support are moderately positively related with achievement in both high and low socioeconomic status schools. No relationship was found between achievement level and community participation in decision making. Additional research utilizing more than one grade level is needed. (Author/DB)",

Chapter III outlines necessary qualifications of dance teachers as opposed to professional dancers, identifies the contacts a dance  resource specialist should make, describes possible contributions to dance education from physical education and art teachers, and suggests community resources for teaching dance. Chapter IV presents a resolution urging arts, civics, and educational groups to develop and support dance programs. (AV)",

        "description":"This document examines the concern of teachers at the school level for continuing, relevant inservice training, the disatisfaction they are experiencing with traditional inservice programs, and the ways in which local education associations (LEA's) can help improve inservice education. Teachers are now demanding that inservice (1) be related to day-by-day needs, (2) be developed through teacher self-assessment of needs, (3) be planned with teachers having a preeminent voice in determining both content and delivery methods, (4) be related to a teacher's total professional development, and (5) not duplicate offerings available elsewhere. Three categories of needs for inservice exist--the institutional need (for teacher improvement in specific curriculum areas), the professional  organization's need (for the general proficiency of its members), and the faculty or individual need for personal growth). Assuming the LEA considers it in the best interest of members to attempt to include inservice education in the teacher contract, provisions may be negotiated to preserve existing programs and/or to develop new ones. If the association chooses the second course, the opportunity arises for developing policy changes in time allowances, reimbursement, teacher involvement in planning, instructional approaches, and program planning participation. Implementation of the program guidelines could be done using school district staff or a neutral joint committee composed of administrators and faculty. (MJB)",

At the University of Illinois, Urbana, TA's from several departments met for seminars during the year, while at Lehigh University, Pennsylvania, the seminars were conducted before the semester beqan and each department's TA's met separately. Both courses consisted of six two-hour seminars whose topics included (1) lesson planning, (2) writing effective exam questions, (3) teacher-centered and learner-centered teaching methods, and (4) self-evaluation methods. Incentive for attendance was secured by offering graduate credit, requirinq the course for further employment as a TA, or through offering a stipend. Surveys indicate that participants felt they would gain more if seminars  were offered both before and during the semester. Also participants expressed a desire for interaction with TA's from other departments as opposed to working exclusively within their own. Directors should be aware that specific subject content courses require additional training as teaching assignments change, whereas seminars in general teaching approaches are applicable to subject matter areas. Of utmost importance is securing a director who is a good teacher or is experienced in teacher training. Whatever the approach, the training of TA's represents a department's commitment to foster good teaching and gives graduates tangible evidence of teaching competence. (KC/MJB)",

        "description":"This study describes research on the impact of three intensive health curriculum models (respiratory, circulatory, and nervous systems) administered at the fifth-, sixth-, and seventh-grades on the knowledge levels, attitudes, and health behaviors of teenage students. The hypotheses of the study were that students enrolled in one or more units of the model would be statistically different after a time lapse of two to four years from students who were not enrolled. Primary expectations were that they would (1) possess more knowledge about the resoiratory, circulatory, and nervous systems, and (2) engage in more acceptable health practices designed to protect their bodies against disease. Secondary impact expectations related to smoking attitudes and behavior and to positive  school-related behaviors. Problems arising in the process of conducting the study (attrition in the number of school districts and students participating, delay in gaining approval of measurement instruments, and the impossibility of conducting a true longitudinal study) imposed severe restrictions on applying the research results. However, analyses of these results supported hypothesis one, in that the greater the curriculum exposure, the higher the level of health knowledge. A significant relationship was found between curriculum exposure and health behavior scores for ninth- (but not for tenth-) grade followup study participants. No difference was found for the third hypothesis, related to smoking attitudes, though smoking behavior was found to be significantly related to curriculum  exposure for ninth- (but not tenth-) graders. School-related behavior failed to vary on the basis of whether a student had or had not been enrolled earlier in the curriculum model. Tables and test instruments are presented in appendices. (MJB)",

        "description":"The authors propose a format for conducting workshops whose goals are the development of programs of continuing education for teachers. The rationale for such inservice teacher improvement is based upon (1) the need to more capably deal with the individual differences among children; (2) the changing nature of the inservice education enterprise; and (3) the interrelationship of the dimensions of governance, mode, delivery, and substance in inservice education programs. The workshop format aims at improving the effectiveness of the continuing (inservice) education process by attending to the improvement of all four dimensions at the same time, since improvement to only one or two of the dimensions has little effect on the value of the entire process. Conduct of workshops is  predicated on the interaction of individuals gathered first into role groups (e.g., teachers, administrators, school board members) which, in three meetings, examine existing inservice programs, develop a rationale of needs for training, and revise these needs into a new inservice program. Participants then meet in team groups (e.g., project, university, school district) to examine inservice proposals, develop general goals and activities for realizing them, and construct a plan for continued team functioning. At the conclusion of this procedure, a collaborative relationship should exist among the concerned participants of the continuing education program, and three products should have been created: a model of continuing education, a rationale, and follow-up action plans.

        "description":"This is the final report on a three year project designed to investigate the development of problem-solving strategies in elementary school children. In this project the personality of the child as it is reflected in problem solving style is examined. The hybothesis that reflective children are more competent problem solvers than impulsive children was tested. Some evidence suggests that reflection/impulsivity is related to task-oriented and social behavior in the classroom as well as to individual differences in academic achievement. Four separate tasks were selected which permitted a detailed analysis of hypothesis-testing strategies in sequential problem solving. Each task was administered to a sample of reflective and impulsive 7, 9, and 11 year olds in 1974, and available  subjects were retested in 1975 and 1976. The primary objective of this research was to describe the development of problem solving strategies in reflective and impulsive children during the elementary school period. A second major objective for this research was to determine the effects of training impulsive children to use more efficient problem-solving strategies. The final objective for these studies was to assess the construct validity of the reflection/impulsivity dimension by determining whether reflective and impulsive children differ in observed classroom behavior. Collectively, these studies provide rather strong support for the notion that cognitive style, as indicated by response tempo in situations of response uncertainty, reflects individual differences in the development of  essential problem-solving skills.

        "description":"This study was an initial step to determine the feasibility of matching student teachers (ST's) with cooperating teachers (CT's) on the basis of similar educational beliefs. This project grew out of the concern of Oklahoma State University student teaching supervisors that the mismatching of ST's with CT's on the basis of dissimilar perceptions regarding educational beliefs and practices often leads to a nonproductive relationship between the ST and CT. During 1976 fall semester, all OSU ST's enrolled for elementary student teaching and their CT's (N=132) were asked to participate. Prior to the commencement of student teaching, 31 CT's and 50 ST's completed and returned inventories assessing educational beliefs. Inventories were: The Study of Beliefs Inventory (PBI and TPI),  Beliefs about Teaching and Learning Inventory (BTLI), and the Behavioral Problems Inventory (BPI). At the termination of the student teaching semester, eight university supervisors of the ST's assessed the quantity, severity, and nature of conflicts perceived to have occurred during the ST-CT relationship. It was predicted that ST-CT pairs who experienced conflict, as perceived by the university supervisor, would significantly differ on responses to the measures of educational beliefs. Analysis of comparisons between ST's and CT's in the ten conflict pairs indicated no significant differences on responses to the inventories. Results indicate that the inventories do not discriminate between ST's and CT's in terms of educational beliefs, and the CT's and ST's may be more alike than  different in their beliefs about education. Interpretation of the conflict data indicated that personality may play a greater role in producing severe conflict than differences related to educational beliefs. It may be that differences related to educational beliefs are more easily resolved by ST's and CT's while personality conflicts are more difficult to resolve and often require outside intervention.

Differences include preference for cooperative versus competitive tasks; for working alone versus in a group; for structured versus unstructured learning situations; or for individual versus group reward contingencies; social class and racial differences; language differences; interactions between motivational structures and responses to reward versus punishment; and sex differences. The assumption that schools should pitch to strengths and attempt to avoid weaknesses is called into question on two grounds. First, this assumption usually includes another, less explicit assumption, that different paths will lead to the same ultimate goal. However, pitching to strengths  and avoiding weaknesses usually will increase group differences, not decrease them. Secondly, remediation of weaknesses is also needed if the weaknesses are of societal importance. Thus matching instruction to learner characteristics is seen as requiring value judgments about what is or is not desirable both for the students and for society at large. (Author/MJB)",

Three techniques are explained for delineating problems: the integrative theonomy, facet analysis and design, and componential analysis. It is suggested that these delineation techniques have two applications in the training of researchers: (1) as content, which might be taught to the researcher-to-be, and (2) as tools to examine the area of  research instruction.

Contrast is made between the manner in which development is conducted when regarded as operating within the boundaries of educational research and practice and when it is regarded as operating within the wider area of scientific knowledge and technological capacity in general. The contrasts are made in terms of dominating paradigms, disciplines, institutions, and time frames. It is argued that the current state-of-the-art of development in education  justifies a radical restructuring of the conduct of development, based upon the efforts of other developmental enterprises (defense, space, and industry). Eleven alternate routes for modifying an educational system are described, among them administrative organization, authoritative analysis, legislation, training, and trends. A number of dilemmas (e.g., independence/dependence, competition/ cooperation) are examined, which must be accommodated in order for effective development to take place.

Module Cluster One, Developing Commitment to Participatory Governance, seeks to provide students with a means for developing commitment to participatory governance, through the study of eight modules on the minor role that teachers play in governance, ideal models for such participation, and a comparison of actual and ideal states. Cluster Two, Implementing  Participatory Governance, provides in three modules opportunities for students to practice group dynamics techniques simulating those already used in participatory governance of the profession. Cluster Three, Achieving Participatory Governance, presents two modules designed to provide graduate students with opportunities to devise techniques for initiating participatory governance where it does not exist. Each cluster presents: (1) cluster topic description, (2) performance objectives, (3) rationale, (4) prerequisites, (5) topics within the cluster, (6) performance objectives within the cluster, and (7) suggested time allotment for the cluster.

        "description":"Praise and criticism data were collected during a two-year correlational study of a selected sample of second- and third-grade teachers chosen for their consistency in producing student learning gains averaged over four years, and these data were analyzed to determine the effect that praise, criticism, rewards, and punishment had on learning gains. Data on motivations, incentive, and punishment differed considerably by socioeconomic status (SES). In low SES schools, praise was regularly but weakly associated with learning gains on several measures, but it was relatively unimportant in high SES classes. Criticism was negatively related in low SES classes, but positively related in high SES classes (although absolute incidence of both types of evaluative comments were low).  Symbolic rewards (stars, smiling faces) were moderately effective motivators in both high and low SES classes, but verbal praise and the \"reward\" of monitoring duties were not. In low SES classes, neither these symbolic rewards nor punishment of any sort were strongly related to student gains. The most effective way of dealing with misbehavior in these classes was through an individual conference with the student. The main factor in the low SES classes was the teacher's ability to motivate the student to become actively engaged in the learning process to the point that he or she would answer questions in public response situations and work persistently on seatwork. Successful teachers in both kinds of schools communicated high expectations, but the successful teachers in high SES schools  did so through a critical demandingness, while the successful teachers in low SES schools did so through patience and encouragement.

The report describes three different definitions of appropriateness and the related systems for measuring teacher behaviors.

        "description":"A complex two-stage sample selection process was used in designing the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972. The first-stage sampling frame used in the selection of schools was stratified by the following seven variables: public vs. private control, geographic region, grade 12 enrollment, proximity to institutions of higher education, percentage of minority group enrollment, community income level, and degree of urbanization. Six hundred strata determined the initial sample of 1,200 schools; later, a random sample of 18 seniors per high school was selected. This report considers the effects of stratification, oversampling of schools by percentage of minority group enrollment and community income level, clustering of students within a school and unequal  weighting on the variances of the resulting statistics and therefore, on the precision of the sample statistics. Results suggest that school stratification variables reduced the variances of national estimates to twenty percent below what would have been expected with unstratified cluster sampling. Of the five major stratification variables: socioeconomic status, size of school, type of control, geographic region, and proximity to college or university; region is the strongest variable and type of control is the weakest.

Data were collected from 2,229 students enrolled in 93 classes taught by 53 instructors in 12 academic disciplines at the University of Windsor, Ontario. Internal consistency of the SOST was moderate to relatively high on three sections; however alpha coefficients for two sections were unacceptably low. Low but significant positive correlations were found between eleven of the SOST items and student achievement in an introductory psychology course. These findings provided evidence that the instrument possesses a certain degree of criterion-related validity. Five factors accounted for 55% of the  variance in item responses: instructional skill, student teacher interaction, work load, instructor's organization of the course, and feedback. Results indicated that a student's major may affect his or her evaluations of courses and instructors, upper-level students tend to rate instructors more favorably than lower-level students, superior or above average students tend to give their instructors better ratings, and elective courses are rated more favorably than required courses. The author suggests that although the SOST is valid and reasonably stable, the instrument should not be adopted in its present form without revision and further testing (MV)",

Data on student background characteristics such as age, sex, previous education and employment, and country of origin were also collected. Results of the statistical analysis indicated that teaching style did affect student gains in proficiency, particularly for certain types of students. The analysis--which considered student background, classroom interaction patterns, pretest performance, and final proficiency--indicated that there were four combinations related to superior classrooms. (1) Students with  more education, more previous English instruction, and higher level jobs learned more with a free response mode and a question and answer paradigm. (2) Students who had been in this country longer, had higher level jobs, and had studied English previously demonstrated exceptional gains when instruction included direct-read and/or ask questions along with free response, and question-answer-corrective feedback-prompt-answer interactions. (3) Well-educated, well-employed women with superior English training in their country of origin demonstrated high achievement with the interaction pattern, teacher direct-student read and/or ask question. (4) Younger, less well-educated male students who had recently arrived from Western Europe learned well when interaction patterns were supportive and  individualized. (Author/MV)",

Measures of speaking facility were either direct measures of proficiency, such as the Oral Proficiency Test, developed specifically for this project, or were other measures of knowledge of English. Classroom observations provided a continuous record of both teacher and student behavior during class sessions and between the two tests assessing the students'  speaking proficiency. Factor analysis and canonical discriminant function analysis were used to reduce both student-performance data and teacher-performance data to their underlying dimensions. Multiple regression, canonical correlation, and factor analytic methods were used to relate the dimensions of teacher performance to those of student performance. This study revealed the interactions among student characteristics, initial proficiency, classroom interaction patterns, and final achievement. The classes with higher achievement fell into three distinct groups which used different methods of instruction, and whose students shared similar background characteristics. (Author/MV)",

        "description":"In 1976, New Jersey public law established uniform statewide minimum standards in the basic communication and computational skills for publicly educated students in the state. To implement the law for the year 1976-77, the New Jersey Educational Assessment Program administered tests to all fourth, seventh, and tenth grade students. These tests were used as the indicator of minimum basic skills proficiency. Students who did not correctly answer at least 65% of the test items did not satisfy the minimum proficiency requirement in that subject. Statewide, 90.4% of the fourth grade students met or exceeded the minimum standard on the reading test. In fourth grade mathematics, 72.1% of the students surpassed the minimum standard. In seventh grade, 74.2% of the students exceeded the  statewide proficiency level in reading, while 60.4% did so in mathematics. Tenth grade results indicated that 77% of the students met the statewide criterion in reading, while 74% did so in mathematics. More students from higher socioeconomis status districts surpassed the minimum proficiency level than did students from lower socioeconomic categories. Also, more students from suburban and regional school districts exceeded the minimum level than did students from urban and rural districts. Behavioral objectives for reading and mathematics in the three grade levels are appended. (Author/MV)",

The information in this data base was then analyzed in conjunction with information concerning reading and mathematics achievement, program adoption, and demography, to determine correlations with ESEA Title I programs. The following conclusions were drawn from the analysis: (1) Those school districts with higher average staff Title I salaries usually reported poorer performing students in both reading and mathematics. (2) Those districts with a larger ratio (more students per instructor) were the poorer performing districts. (3) Those schools allotting more time per student per instructor for Title I instruction  were the better performing schools.

Analyses of data from the first academic year focused on relationships between TSWE scores and grades, and analyses of the second academic year focused on relationships between TSWE scores and scores on graded writing samples. No important group differences were observed in traditional correlational analyses for either grade or essay prediction, or in either correlational or regression analyses of the second year essay data. Analyses of correct and incorrect placement decisions (hits and misses) at  specific TSWE cut-off scores revealed no significant group differences whether outcomes were based on English course grades or on freshman year writing performance. The proportion of incorrect decisions (misses) was less for minority students than for any of the groups. For all groups, the TSWE appeared to predict freshman year writing performance as well as or better than pre-course writing samples, high school English grades, or high school rank in class.

The rationale for attempting to use ICC theory in an achievement framework is summarized, and the adequacy for adaptive testing of a classroom achievement test item pool in a college biology class is studied. Using criteria usually applied to ability measurement item pools, the item difficulties and discriminations in this achievement test pool were found to be similar to those used in adaptive testing pools for ability testing. Studies of the dimensionality of the pool indicate that it is primarily unidimensional. Analysis of the item parameters of items administered to two different samples reveals the possibility of a deviation from  invariance in the discrimination parameter but a high degree of invariance for the difficulty parameter. The pool as a whole, as well as two subpools, are judged to be adequate for use in adaptive testing. It is also concluded that the ICC model is not inappropriate for application to typical college classroom achievement tests similar to the one studied. (Author/MV)",

The results of a random 10% sample of the 55,000 students in college preparatory programs were compared with the results of the 93,000 students taking the test statewide. College preparatory student results were higher than the total state scores for all reading and mathematics items and approximated the results in the school districts with the highest socioeconomic status. The results indicated that college preparatory students mastered most of the basic skills concepts in reading and mathematics as measured by the statewide tests. However, the  NJEAP may not be a good predictor of college performance, since other tests administered by New Jersey colleges to their students show that 30-50% of college students are deficient in the basic skills of reading and mathematics.

The use of PLATO IV at five community colleges, and an evaluation of its educational impact on participating students, instructors, and colleges are described. The PLATO system was found to be operating essentially as planned by its developers. The system provided a medium for instruction with substantial appeal to both students and instructors, but it had no consistent positive nor negative effects on student achievement nor attrition. The cooperative effort between instructors and developers was successful in that a substantial number of PLATO lessons were designed, developed, and integrated into ongoing  community college courses in the five targeted subject areas: accounting, biology, chemistry, English, and mathematics. The usage of PLATO by students and instructors exceeded initial expectations although the extent of usage in classes was somewhat less on the average than had been projected originally. According to the evaluators, the critical factor which accounted for the high acceptance and usage of PLATO was the control that instructors had over its use.

        "description":"The cumulative adverse impact of residential white flight from large central cities on the residual population has led policy makers to be wary of instituting programs which will further exacerbate the process. Recent policy debates have evolved over the question of whether white city-to-suburb movement is affected more significantly by racially-motivated causes on the one hand, or by the general economic and ecological conditions in the city on the other. The present study assesses a number of previously suggested racial and nonracial factors for 1965 as &quot;pushes&quot; and &quot;pulls&quot; to 70 white city-to-suburb movement streams in 39 standard metropolitan areas. Utilizing a two-stage model of mobility, this analysis suggests that most factors, both racial and nonracial affect white flight  less through the decision to move, than through the choice of destination. Fiscal and ecological features of the metropolitan area are demonstrated to be just as important as racial factors in the explanation. Finally, a path model is constructed which shows that the greater level of flight exhibited in Southern cities is only marginally explained by racial causes. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This paper evaluates the effectiveness of governmental actions from 1967 to 1974 to integrate public schools in the nation's cities. Data used were obtained from the Office of Civil Rights and were drawn from school districts in the 100 largest metropolitan areas. The results of this evaluation indicate there are substantial indications of progress in both the North and the South. Federal courts overturned most of the delaying tactics which southern cities were using to avoid integration. In most southern cities, black and white children now attend the same schools and the level of segregation is low. Beginning in the early 1970's, increasing pressure was applied to northern cities. The courts ruled that school board policies were partly responsible for the high levels of  segregation still obtaining in many of the northern metropolitan areas. This paper concludes that although progress has been made in reducing segregation, there is still much to be accomplished. A few southern and many northern cities have schools which are as segregated today as they were a decade ago. The litigation process and HEW compliance proceedings are time consuming, and a reluctant school board can still delay integration. A more serious impediment, however, to the integration of big city schools is the city-suburban disparity in racial composition. (Author/GC)",

        "description":"This paper is concerned with the relationship between social participation and family structure. A theory is developed in the framework of George Herbert Mead's analysis on the development of a consistent self in response to a generalized other. According to this theory, the influence of the family is implicated as one of the social-psychological dynamics which encourages social participation. The theory was tested using data collected from a population of high school students. Results of the study indicated that family integration is more closely associated with social participation than is the strength of the parent-child relationship. Close relationships were not found to be in themselves predictive of participation in school social activities. Rather, students who perceived  their families as well-integrated, that is, having roles, norms and goals, were those who took part in social activities and events. The theoretical reasons suggested by Durkheim and Mead suggest that the structure of the family is important in learning how to participate in other social groups. The data from this study suggest that the integrated family provides the structure of Mead's 'generalized other'. (Author/GC)",

A sociometric measure was administered to two grade levels of this school on a repeated measures design. The grades were the first and the fifth. Each child was asked to complete the sociometric measure which asked for three positive choices in a play situation and three positive choices in a study situation. Basically each child was asked to state which three persons in the class he would most like to play with. Then he was asked to name those three he would like to study with. Findings indicated the following: (1) Neither grade displayed a tendency to group on cross sex within their own races. Cross race groups, however, were noted in all  administrations and did not appear to either increase or decrease in frequency over time. (2) There appeared to be a difference in the pattern between grades. The first grade children appeared to remain rather stable in the pattern of the groups, and to have smaller grouping than did the fifth graders. Females at the fifth grade level appeared to be slightly more clique oriented. Several large groups of all female white or all female black composition were noted. (3) There did not seem to be any differences between the questions of play and study. (4) The size of the group may have had an effect on the composition. (5) The major conclusion is that these children did not seem to have broken into four static groupings on the basis of sex and race. (Author/AM)",

The study was intended to ascertain the effectiveness of the occupational program in enabling graduates to secure employment and to hold a job, and to assess the relation to and influences on occupational graduates of other background and school variables. The actual employment experiences of occupational graduates and the relation of their training to these experiences were studied and the effects on students just completing a two- or three-year occupational program in 1973 were examined. A baseline survey was carried out concurrently with the follow-up survey, and personal interviews were conducted to supplement the  results of the follow-up survey and to provide a cross-check on them. This report is organized as follows: Chapter 1 outlines the scope, objectives, and method of the study; in chapter 2 the results of the follow-up survey in the three areas of school, job, and background information are examined. In chapter 3 these responses are discussed with reference to patterns of variation by school variables. A more in-depth view of the world of the occupational graduate is presented in chapter 4, based on interviews with graduates. In chapter 5 the responses to the baseline survey are discussed, with additional reference to patterns of variation by sex. Chapter 6 discusses findings and conclusions.

Information was provided on (1) the proportion of women who can be classified into each career pattern in the system(s), and (2) relationships of career development variables to the career patterns. The first career pattern system was based on the milestones of leaving school, marriage, and the acquisition of the first child, with the intensity of work between these milestones in terms of the percentage of time spent in the labor force taken into account. The second set of career patterns was based on Donald Super's system of career patterns. Both career pattern systems were analyzed separately for  black and white women. Means, standard deviations, and correlations were calculated for each career pattern in both systems for career development variables, including education, relative desirability of occupational assignment, age at milestones, proportion of time spent in the labor force, income, family related variables, and attitudes toward work. In this report, detailed findings are reported on career development variables, and five areas of implications of the data are presented: career patterns, career development, number of children, base data, and educational implications.

Field interviews were conducted in nine state employment security agencies (SESAs), five regional offices, and the U.S. Employment Service. The major findings were (1) SESAs with high performance tended to differ systematically in their organizational structures and style from SESAs with low performance, (2) SESAs differed in their adaptiveness to change and their receptivity to federal assistance, (3) the generally low performance of  ES offices in urban areas seemed due in part to organizational factors, (4) SESA linkages to state level politics and other agencies were a secondary but important influence on ES operations, (5) SESA linkages to local level politics and other agencies were another secondary but important influence on ES performance, (6) the U.S. Employment Service has limited ability to guide and assist SESAs, and (7) political constraints and policy issues at the national level must be dealt with if the employment service is to improve.

It focused on seven questions: (1) What is their educational status? (2) What are their postsecondary educational objectives? (3) What is their employment status? (4) What architectural conditions are available to help them pursue postsecondary educational training? (5) What special supportive services are needed to help them pursue postsecondary education/training? (6) How many of them live on campus while attending class? and (7) Are guidance and counseling services available to them? Data was obtained from 1,081 respondents to a questionnaire which was mailed to 3,078 physically disabled adults in the state. The findings were these: (1) Thirty-three  percent attended college, trade, or business school full or part time; (2) of the forty-four percent who never attended, about half would like to attend; (3) thirty-seven percent were unemployed; (4) architectural conditions and the availability of supportive services were rated low by the respondents; (5) about half lived on campus while attending class; and (6) career information, job placement services, and educational aid and aptitude testing were available to the majority. (This report concludes with several recommendations pertaining to architectural conditions, supportive services, vocational training, chronic unemployment, and special services.

Data were obtained from personal interviews and mail questionnaires from sixty-eight private sector employers, both users and nonusers of permanent part-time employment. The occupations of workers studied were mainly clerical, operative, and laborer. The findings are that (1) the economic benefits and costs of part-time employment are not large and not central to the employers' decisions to use it, (2) employers do not have pejorative views about part-time workers but do see them as different from  full-time workers, (3) the nature of the employer's business (work technology) strongly affects the usage of part-time employment, and (4) some dimensions of organizational climate distinguish users from nonusers. The findings indicate that the decision to use part-time employment is prompted by a scheduling problem and implementation depends on several factors, e.g., work technology, labor market conditions, and labor union influence.

Related research was reviewed and pretest, shorthand attitude, and shorthand achievement data were collected from 1,317 beginning shorthand students in 20 area high schools teaching Gregg, Forkner, or Century 21 shorthand. Seventy-three percent of the students  completed the work and tests showed that the majority of the time Forkner shorthand students achieved the highest accuracy and transcription rate scores. Most students agreed that shorthand was easy to learn, but Forkner and Century 21 students agreed more strongly with this statement. However, one year of shorthand was not considered sufficient for high school students to develop minimal shorthand skills regardless of the system since no student could produce a mailable letter at 80 words per minute dictation. Recommendations included offering Forkner shorthand to students for at least one year, additional counseling for low aptitude students, and spending classroom time to discuss career opportunities, as well as personal use applications, for persons with shorthand skill.

State employment security data and Career Maturity Inventory (CMI) scores for a sample of the state's ninth graders were secondary information sources. The primary conclusion was that the idea of utilizing career education as a motivational device to increase the relevance of academic content for students and to prepare youth for a smoother transition from school to work has broad appeal throughout the state. Survey respondents indicated that the chief obstacle to the implementation of career education programs was the lack of funds, which resulted in limited staff training in career education and lack of curriculum  materials. The recommendations made by the respondents focused on provision of state funding for (1) dissemination of information about existing career education materials, and purchase by school systems of some of these materials; and (2) personnel to spend time in the field organizing staff training in the use of career education materials and techniques.

Placing emphasis on what individuals can do to avoid or mitigate the personal effects of the baby boom's undesirable and overwhelming influence on the labor market, the author encourages realistic and  strategic career planning and mandates for new guidance techniques, while he discourages a liberal arts education and unrealistic expectations by both parents and students.

The keynote address provides an overview focusing on learning, services and educational program sources for adults, and standardization versus flexibility in programs. The next address considers some major problems in granting credit for prior learning encountered at Empire State College. Several presentations then follow on the state of the art in credit for experiential/prior learning at the University of California, California State University and Colleges (CSUC), CSUC Consortium,  CSUC Consortium Liberal Arts Program, California Community Colleges, private sector, and private institutions. Two talks pertaining to the need for a validating institution and the needs of the training community are followed by the remarks of a reaction panel. Additional presentations discuss alternatives in developing a validating institution and cover the further expansion of CSUC Consortium, the creation of a new independent institution, and the use of the public/private sector through a voucher system. The presentations conclude with two addresses on problems in developing a validating institution, focusing on attitudinal problems and accreditation concerns. (EM)",

        "description":"In this synthesis of research and literature on the nature of occupationally-transferable skills, the author identifies skills that seem to be highly transferable in the sense of being general to a number of occupations. He then speculates about characteristics of skills that are generalizable or transferable and discusses some implications for educational programs, hiring, and employment search practices, and for research. Specific transfer questions also addressed are these: Are there optimal sequences for developing the component skills of complex behaviors? At what level of abstraction should a skill be taught? and Are some behaviors more amenable to training than others? Close attention is given to three studies: (1) the \"Dictionary of Occupational Titles\" classification of  occupations according to common elements, (2) the generic skills project of W.J. Kawula and A. Smith, and (3) research on egometrics (application of psychometric principles and procedures to the study of human work) directed by J. William Cunningham. The author concludes that there is no nontransferable skill and that a good education through high school will provide an individual with a good repertoire of skills for the world of work. A further conclusion is that training programs should be designed to teach specific skills very well and to allow for skill practice in a variety of situations after ensuring utility for one situation.

A brief history introduces the concept followed by specific definitions of \"training,\"\"education,\" and \"mainstreaming,\" as applied to vocational schooling. Three general operational models are described and graphically presented. Model guidelines developed for the instructional system, the instructional team, and supportive services are listed and include the following: development of prescription teaching, the student-instructional study team, competency based evaluation, and open entry and exit (instructional system); the role of vocational teachers, special education teachers, remedial teachers, vocational students, and vocational resource persons  (instructional team); and the role of the administration, community agencies, and parents (supportive services). Conclusions present a rationale for providing a vocational resource person for mainstreaming programs, and lists the required qualifications. Twelve recommendations for active steps to be taken at the local, state, and national levels are presented and include university development to orient special education teachers to the concept of vocational education, and education of the public about their responsibility for special needs students and the responsibilities of vocational education.

General implications for dental auxiliary personnel are also discussed. Factors determining the demand and supply of dental services, which include past demand, population growth, economic growth, dental insurance coverage, and technological progress, are analyzed along with developing trends in dentistry and their anticipated effects on supply and demand. Areas identified for needed additional research include dental prepayment and fluoridation. A fifty-six-page appendix describes in detail the supply-demand forecast model used and  examines past and developing trends which affect dental supply and demand relationships: engineering advances, organizational change in dentistry, prevention of dental disease, and third-party payment.

Agencies which would find it useful included employment service offices, schools, rehabilitation agencies, sheltered workshops, private employment agencies, government personnel offices, business, and industry. The handbook broadly summarizes knowledge about jobs (volume 2) and counseling-placement activities (volume 1) relative to the use of basic skills. General and specific reference is made throughout to more detailed techniques and information. Suggestions in this first volume are presented within  chapters which correspond to the sequence of activities performed. Chapter 1 suggests ways to assure a full and fair definition of the capabilities of each client. Steps that counselors and placement officers might take to expand the client's job competencies are suggested in chapter 2. Chapter 3 describes how to use existing job availability information to find appropriate jobs for the client group, and chapter 4 deals with creating or developing additional job opportunities. Chapter 5 suggests ways in which information about specific clients and specific job opportunities can be brought together to optimize the client placement. General guidance for the collection and use of data by which managers and administrators can enhance the counseling-placement process are presented in the  appendix.

A major project component was to conduct five conferences during which teams from each of the fifty states and territories would develop a plan of action for implementing the inclusion of the gifted and tal!nted in a local and area vocational program within their respective states. Conclusions of a third-party evaluation based on examination of objectives and their achievement included the following: Awareness of the theme and its implications to the total field of education was presented and well received across the nation, and it is safe to presume that an impact has been made as a result of the dissemination of curricular materials.

Multivariate personal space can be defined by three dimensions: relational, locational and interactional, and operationalized by the measures previously used singly. The present experiment tested the relation of multivariate personal space defined by shoulder orientation, seating position at or away from an occupied table, and interpersonal distance to psychological stress in the form of status differences among strangers. Results indicate adjustments in the magnitude of multivariate personal space are a function of stranger status level and that these adjustments occur in all three dimensions of multivariate personal space. The complex  nature of human social behavior suggests multiple behavioral measures should be used in future research to minimize experimenter bias, maximize generalizability of results, and maximize power in hypothesis testing.

It was the purpose of this study to assess both job functioning and attitudes of paraprofessionals in relation to professionals and the interaction of systems' variables that would impact the effectiveness of its individual members. A multi-method, multi-criteria study revealed significant systems, group, and individual differences between teams and team members in community mental health centers committed to medical-illness/clinical (MIC) paradigms of mental health and those committed to psycho-social learning/community (PSLC) paradigms. There were differences in teams' utilization of  professionals and paraprofessionals, and psycho-social differences in the members themselves. Compared to their MIC peers, paraprofessionals in the PSLC systems experienced the system as more positive and reported themselves being utilized more fully. Also, PSLC professionals reported greater sense of cohesiveness, influence, and satisfaction with co-workers than their MIC peers. Implications of these results were discussed in terms of training for both paraprofessionals and professionals (especially with regard to transfer of learning and utilization of resources) and in terms of understanding human behavior/performance within an individual-system interaction framework.

The study controlled for the number and kinds of sex-typed toys present during mother-child and peer-child interaction. The subjects were 48 3-and 5-year-old boys and girls, their mothers, and their same-sex, same-age peers. Each child was observed by concealed video camera with mother, with peer, and alone. In each situation a new toy set was introduced; one \"masculine\", one \"feminine\". Broad results indicate that both mothers and peers  contingently ridicule and verbally interfere when children play with inappropriate sex-typed toys. Girls are likely to receive more differential reward for playing with feminine toys than boys for playing with masculine, and boys more punishment than girls for reverse situations. Results suggest that peer influence is greater than mother's with the older child. (PFS)",

Despite this, government agencies suffer from poor image, being described as cold, inefficient, slow and impersonal. Since this seems contradictory, data from a national sample survey of 1, 431 adult Americans by the Survey Research Center in 1973 are presented. The subjects were questioned on the specifics of their contacts with one of seven government service bureaucracies, as well as on the question of support for the political system. The analysis techniques involved the examination of bivariate relationships. In general, clients indicated fairly low levels of support for government  agencies, particularly when compared to private companies. Clients who received assistance from government agencies were not more supportive of the government than were non-clients. Generally speaking, if the client's experience with the agency was negative it tended to give him an unfavorable view of all government agencies. (PFS)",

The treatment, emphasizing stimulus control and nutrition education, consisted of 16 classes spaced over 20 weeks. One hundred eleven subjects completed treatment, posting a mean loss of 17.3 pounds. Significant therapist differences were noted, with therapists having higher attrition also having smaller weight losses in their groups. At the end of treatment subjects were divided into two maintenance conditions: Gradual withdrawal of treatment (GW) and continued treatment (CT). These differed in amount and  fading of follow-up contact. The CT condition had more contact and a more abrupt termination of contact. By 18 months posttreatment the 63 subjects remaining had maintained over 80% of their treatment weight losses.

Discussion of general behavior modification principles did not reduce problem behavior, but problem behaviors decreased considerably after daily letters from the teacher were sent to the child's mother (the mother made a family trip contingent upon receiving \"good\" conduct letters). Following the family trip, letters continued to be sent home, and the child's school misbehavior rates declined even further. This suggests that teacher and mother praise, and the good behavior note, successfully maintained the child's appropriate classroom behaviors. The author cautions that, given the case-study nature of this experiment, the  findings need to be interpreted with caution. Replication with a larger sample would provide requisite data for determining the generalizability of findings. (Author/PFS)",

        "description":"This essay interprets the dynamics of suicide based on a view of life as an autonomous process of the unfolding of genetically determined potential. The life process does not require external incentives; it depends, however, on needs-satisfying exchanges between individuals and their physical and social environment. Social orders of human groups can facilitate or obstruct these needed exchanges. Obstructions of these exchanges, and hence of the satisfaction of developmental needs, is defined as violence. Such obstructions may result from acts of individuals or from socially structured conditions. The latter form of violence is defined as &quot;structural violence.&quot; Suicide tends to occur when individuals feel completely blocked in the unfolding of their potential as a result of  structural violence. Conditions in the United States and in other capitalist societies are analyzed and are found to involve much structural violence, reflected in a high incidence of suicide. It is suggested that primary prevention of suicide requires political action toward eliminating structural violence from the social order, rather than merely professional and technical measures.

These include: do less massive, broad-band testing, but improve the reliability and informativeness of what testing is done; look to instruction as the model for what to test, and then consider the influence of the testing situation, the tester, and the materials; be sure the information will be organized in a useful way, around theoretical models of the reading process. Too often, decision makers have the option of too little information (a single test score) or too much information (a myriad of behavioral objective  scores). In developing these arguments, the Minnesota Educational Assessment Program and the Interactive Reading Assessment System are analyzed to illustrate both problems and alternative approaches. (AA)",

The author concludes that, despite the plausibility of the hypothesis that boys might benefit from having male teachers, this assumption is not supported by the data.

The task was to infer a membership structure that is compatible with all the logical constraints. Membership problems may be cast in various settings (for example, a murder mystery, where a culprit is to be identified). One program (FIRST) was based on Findler's Universal Puzzle Solver; the other (GABE) used Wang's theorem-prover logic. Of the two programs, FIRST appeared to be the most feasible for use with college-level subjects. It accepts logical inputs in a near-English format and shows the current logical status of a problem through a  tabular array. The program's structure suggests a \"depth of inference\" measurement technique. When all possible logical paths of a logical problem are known, the \"depth\" of any given node in the path can be obtained from probability-of-success numbers at that node. A subject's logical progress along a path can also be computed and displayed. (Author/AA)",

        "description":"Two groups of preschoolers and one of young grade-schoolers were tested for their comprehension of presuppositions and negation in complex syntax. Four types of sentences were presented: affirmative and negative versions of sentences with factive main predicates (which presuppose the truth of the proposition of the complement clause) and with nonfactive main predicates (which do not). Results indicated that competence increased into the early school years: the oldest children showed a fair mastery of the syntax-semantics of the predicates tested. The younger children showed errors of two different kinds, described as the overextended negation tendency and the overextended affirmation tendency. Both of these errors decreased markedly in the oldest group. The nonunitary nature of  the acquired competency is discussed. In particular, it is pointed out that factivity is not a grammatically marked operation and, as such, it leads to what appears to be a gradual acquisition pattern; the test of factivity comprehension employed demanded a competence beyond that of normal use.

Many students formulate erroneous theories of punctuation based on spoken-language experience or on misleading definitions; in effect, they have good intentions but use bad procedures. The paper presents six patterns to which most comma splices and fused sentences conform, indicating that teachers should avoid instruction by definitions or rules and focus instead on providing a vocabulary with which related ideas can be logically connected.

This paper attempts to trace the changing nature of these concerns during the 1970s and to suggest trends for education financing in the 1980s. The first section discusses equity issues related to state school finance reforms and suggests that reforms are both hard to evaluate and lacking in effectiveness. Included is a discussion of school finance litigation and its substantial evolution in the 1970s from a \"student needs\" standard to a \"suspect classification\" standard back to a \"student needs\" standard. Section two covers current and future federal interest in equity and efficiency of education financing. The last section examines the current manifestation of efficiency  concerns--minimum competency tests and tax limitation efforts. It discusses the conflicts of these efficiency concerns with equity issues, public attitudes toward them, and implications for equity and efficiency trends in school finance for the 1980s.

The program itself is divided into six stages and subdivided into twenty-one steps, covering the following areas: needs assessment; needs prioritization; development of measurable objectives; generation of alternative plans for meeting objectives; selection of preferred plans; integration and reconciliation of plans selected by different organizational units in the system; implementation, evaluation, and recycling of plans;  and correlation of the implementation activities with budget development. The process is intended for use at every level of the system and by every organizational unit within the system. Included in the document are a conceptual overview, planning materials for developing school information summaries at the elementary, junior high, and high school levels, a discussion of and planning materials for needs assessment, a guide for planner supervisors, and a guidebook for the planning and implementation team, as well as supplementary information and sample forms.

Highlighted were such considerations as legal issues in the discipline process, effective implementation and organization of programs, and the status of discipline in public education. A presentation by Junious Williams detailed the pros and cons of alternative programs, as well as presenting recent figures on suspension and expulsion in the nation's schools. Hayes Mizell offered a discussion on components essential to  implementation of inschool alternative programs. Eight directors of inschool alternative programs presented detailed descriptions of their alternative plans.

Issues explored attempted to determine (1) what specific student behaviors are perceived by teachers and administrators to be discipline problems, (2) how frequently these problems occur, (3) how serious teachers and administrators perceive the problems to be, and (4) how much the identified discipline problems interfere with the learning environment. Questionnaires were mailed to a sample of secondary school teachers and administrators in Indiana. Of the 101 student misbehaviors listed, only 47 were perceived to be discipline problems by a majority of the teachers responding. The paper concludes that teachers who deal with the individual classroom work of the student hold  different perceptions of student discipline than administrators who must be concerned with the problems of the school at large. Related literature on the subject of student discipline is reviewed in detail in this document. (Author/LD)",

        "description":"Talk is proposed as the subject matter of foreign language courses. The key to acquiring liberated expression lies in the assimilation of the learner to the target culture. Once he/she is assimilated, the learner's involvement in a situation matches the involvement of natives of the target culture. For example, faced with some life circumstance the learner notices and interprets the clues of the event as natives do. This standardization process is controlled by the language teacher. As the learner acquires &quot;standardized imaginings&quot; to daily situations, the resultant involvements precipitate spontaneous talk. The pedagogic strategy consists of arranging the learners' social environment so as to provide them with real life exchanges in addition to practice exchanges. Transactional  exchanges that are made real have the power to spontaneously evoke topicalization behavior (dialogue). A model is proposed which outlines six stages of language learning. The first three relate to practice talk (differentiating situational units, practicing interactional routines, accumulating ethnicity information) and the second three relate to situated talk (enacting situated exchanges, managing episodal exchanges, executing liberated expression). Illustrative activities are given for each of the six phases. (Author/JB)",

Two of these phonemes, /s#/ and /n#/ were examined for their capacity as plural markers. Data were collected during a one-year ethnographically-oriented study of a single block in the Puerto Rican community in north Philadelphia. Tape-recorded interviews were conducted with first generation Puerto Ricans over age 21. All were dominant, if not monolingual, speakers of Puerto Rican Spanish, about 33 percent of whom claimed to speak no English at all, although many had lived in Philadelphia for over 20 years. The linguistic interviews were conducted in Puerto Rican Spanish, using an interview schedule adapted to suit the needs of the community. In studying  the verbal inflection /n#/, the same sorts of constraints were studied that were found to be operative for the plural inflection /s#/. These study questions were: (1) Did a subject NP accompany the verb in question, and if so, did it precede or follow the verb? (2) Did any additional disambiguating information accompany the verb? (3) Was the type of disambiguating information morphological or nonmorphological? and (4) Did the verb itself contain some morphophonemic change indicative of plurality? (SW)",

This tradition is contrasted with the contemporary models of positivism with its assumptions about constancy and quantification. The proposed model brings in social history, intent, consciousness, and other extensions of the data and combines them into a methodology of hermeneutics. These new perspectives not only ask different questions about how language is used in social terms, but it also makes radically different claims about how language is legitimized by the power elite who wield community power, and how people are socialized into external patterns of recognizable behavior that have salient values. The model accounts for many of the  basic concepts regarding pluralism within the discipline of political science, and it provides a coherent treatment of such sociological endeavors as labelling theory, neo-symbolic interactionism, the sociology of knowledge, and phenomenological sociology.

It is claimed that the only model that can account for the pluralistic nature of language is the symbolic interactionism model. Reading is basically an interpretive process in which the reader is obligated to try to infer just what the author's message might be. In the case of a native speaker of a language reading materials in his native language, it can be assumed that comprehension is complete when the perspectives of the author and the reader are the same. Variations in reading comprehension may rest in part in  incongruencies in socialization, the cognitive saliency of certain events from one's bibliographical history, or different strategies in approaching and processing new information. A reader approaches the printed page with preconceived notions, and this process is a kind of social interaction. A bilingual child may read the second language and incorrectly place connotations on the words based on the first language. The base of bilingual literacy and its implications for the inferencing process across cultures needs to be considered. (SW)",

        "description":"The purpose of this report on the Concordia College Language Village is to: (1) describe one aspect of the assessment effort, a survey of foreign language teachers whose students had attended the Village; (2) provide demographics for the 899 teachers who responded to the survey; and (3) display and comment on the findings drawn from data collected. The procedure by which the study was conceptualized is traced, beginning with cooperative efforts at curriculum development involving language village deans and consultants; continuing with the development of a survey questionnaire; and concluding with a narrative and graphic report on the preliminary use of data for curriculum development. The teacher population is described graphically. Findings, which are detailed verbally and  graphically, cover areas including classroom performance, satisfaction with the program, major benefits of the program, language-by-language analysis, and a demographic breakdown of teacher perception toward student achievement. Appendices include the questionnaire, item analysis of elements of the simulation and areas affecting performance, and additional comments made by teachers. (JB)",

        "author":["Darnell, Regna"],
        "description":"Differences between Cree and North American middle class patterns of interactional etiquette are discussed. Interactional etiquette is defined as the verbal and non-verbal conventions that are involved in communication among individuals, including greeting, leave taking, asking questions, disagreement, and interruption. The Cree communicate more with silence, interrupt less, and ask questions less directly than non-Indian North Americans. Old people, especially old men, play the central role in traditional education. The result is a potential for misunderstanding and conflict in classrooms which are based on the Anglo middle class North American model, often with a woman teacher. Teachers should be sensitive to the patterns of interactional etiquette of their students. The  successes and failures of a pilot television project, attempting to incorporate principles of Cree learning and teaching are described. The Cree speak two varieties of their own language as well as a distinctive variety of English. It is maintained that attempts to teach children to use standard English are ineffective and tend to make all teaching seem to the Cree like the imposition of an alien culture. (Author/JB)",

The analysis relies on some of the recent research and literature on adult development, life stages, and learning interests. The organizing principles were not predetermined, but have resulted from years of experience in designing and implementing baccalaureate degree programs for adults in the University Without Walls program of Loretto Heights College in Colorado. The report is anecdotal, with little statistical data or research analysis presented. (MSE)",

The plan presented here is the result of consultation between the state postsecondary education commission, the three public higher education segments in the state (the University of California, the California State University and Colleges, and the California Community Colleges), and the consumer group of students with disabilities. The plan consists of these elements: statewide objective; integration; definitions; segmental/campus plans; budgets; enrollment data/comparison base; accountability/administration;  evaluation; and action summary. The appendixes, which comprise the bulk of the document, consist of the text of the legislation, responses to the resolution by the three segments, section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and California Assembly Bill No. 77, a related bill.

The part-timer has long been a marginal employee in academe, but recent developments in the law clarify the degree to which he holds some measure of job security, rights to equal pay, and the protections of collective bargaining and due process. The report's considerations are presented in four categories: the legal status of part-time faculty (property rights, state statutes, litigation in the states, and public school decisions); compensation (equal protection, the Peralta Federation case, the &quot;substantial rationality&quot; test, and statutory provisions); determining part-time faculty unit status in collective bargaining (early and recent  National Labor Relations Board decisions, state labor board decisions, the University of Massachusetts and Los Rios decisions, separate bargaining units, and fair representation); and the law and institutional policy (the impact of court and labor board decisions on institutional policy, general implications for policymaking, and equity and policy considerations).
