Five resources are described for the elementary school years when children's natural curiosity and openness can be channelled into understanding themselves and others as well as learning about the meaning of work and the types of work carried out in their homes, schools, and communities. These include Developing Understanding of Self and Others (DUSO-Revised); the Culture-Free Self-Esteem Inventory; the Perception of Ability Scale for Students (PASS); The Test of Cognitive Skills; and the Murphy-Meissgeier Type Indicator for Children (MMTIC). For junior high school students a major objective is to identify general values in relation to work. Useful resources discussed for  junior high students include: the Life Roles Inventory; Values Scale; the Safran Student's Interest Inventory; Career Development Inventory (CDI); Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI); and Self-Directed Search. For career and the world of work instruction for senior high school students these career education resources are reviewed: Career Directions Inventory; Jackson Vocational Interest Survey (JVIS); Strong Interest Inventory (SII); My Vocational Situation; Career Maturity Inventory; Life Roles Inventory: Values Scales and Salience Inventory; General Aptitude Test Battery; and the Differential Aptitude Test.

        "description":"The U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect was established under provisions of the 1988 Amendments to the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (P.L. 100-294). The mission of the Board is to evaluate the nation's efforts to accomplish the purposes of the Act and to make recommendations on ways in which those efforts can be improved. This document is a summary of the Board's first report. In Part I of the report, the Board declares a national emergency, describes the process it went through in determining how to respond to the emergency, and characterizes the response. Part II also contains the Board's description of the nation's public- and private-sector attempts to protect children from maltreatment. These topics are discussed: scope and complexity of the problem of  child abuse and neglect and the relationship of the problem to changes in family and community life; nature of the child protection system, including the role of the private sector in the protection system; the crisis in the child protection system and the relationship of government to the crisis; and a proposed program of reform. In the final part of the report, thirty-one recommendations for change are made in these areas: (1) recognizing the national emergency; (2) providing leadership; (3) coordinating efforts; (4) generating knowledge; (5) diffusing knowledge; (6) increasing human resources; (7) providing and improving programs; and (8) planning for the future.

        "description":"Friendships between individuals can be found throughout lifespans. This study examined an interaction between adolescents who consider themselves close friends. Inspection of friends' interaction when working on a joint task may allow the classification of close friendships in adolescence. In addition friends were asked about their joint daily activities to allow the detection of possible characteristics of interaction across friendship types. The study also examined adolescents' conceptions of friendship across various possible types of friendship. Subjects (N=90) included 23 pairs of female and 22 pairs of male Israeli 10th graders who identified themselves as friends. Analysis revealed three main patterns of adolescents' close friendships: interdependent, enmeshed, and  disengaged. The three types reflect different qualities of relationships at the dyadic level which transcend the behavior of individuals. In the interdependent type friends were close to each another and they also respected each other's personal views and preferences. In the enmeshed type friends were very close to each another, it was very important to them to act in consensus, and they suppressed individual preferences for a greater sense of closeness and unity. In the disengaged type each partner emphasized individuality and separateness while working on a joint task. (ABL)",

The act also requires that a system be developed to evaluate the effectiveness of the remediation program. In West Virginia the summer implementation program for JPTA eligible students that were academically deficient used computer assisted instruction because of the non-threatening, highly motivational, self-paced environment that computers create. The program concentrated on mathematics computation skills and reading comprehension skills. A career exploration component was used to introduce students to a variety of occupations. The guidance component was specifically concerned with the development of the students'  personal, social, educational, and career aptitudes and goals through direct interaction. Gains made by students were considered to be positive and encouraging. Results of a spring 1989 survey suggest that the program reduced the dropout rate, had a positive effect on grade point average, reduced absences from school, improved motivation and attitude toward learning and school, and increased the enrollments in vocational education.

          "Lewis, Robert A."],
        "description":"Causal models of adolescent substance abuse from a family systems perspective are developed using data from a large-scale family therapy efficacy grant. It is argued that the literature on families of adolescent substance abusers is scattered in its theoretical and empirical efforts, tends to not account for individual and family developmental influences on adolescents' behavior, is laden with poor instrumentation, and tends to treat all drugs indiscriminately. In an attempt to address these concerns, a structural equation modeling approach incorporating systemic and developmental (individuation) perspectives on drug abuse is used in examining the impact of the family system on overall drug use severity, and tobacco, alcohol and marijuana use. The sample included 111 families of  adolescent substance abusers representing families of youthful drug users typically seen in treatment. Overall, the family systems causal models explained significant proportions of variance in adolescent illicit drug use, but were not predictive of licit drug use; none of the family systems variables were predictive of the frequency of adolescent tobacco or alcohol use. Conversely, greater family cohesiveness and open family communication were negatively related to overall drug use severity and marijuana use. Democratic parenting styles were associated with greater marijuana use. Finally, there was a trend suggesting that clearer intergenerational roles predict less adolescent marijuana use. Propositions based on the findings are developed and directions for intervention-prompted changes  in family functioning on adolescent drug use are offered.

        "description":"The purpose of this experiment was to test the hypothesis that individuals who engage in high disclosure of a cancer experience invite a significant degree of social rejection. Undergraduate students watched a videotaped interview with a male or female actor who engaged in either high or low disclosure of feelings surrounding an experience with cancer or a serious car accident. Participants rated the actors' communications skills and likability, as well as their level of discomfort with the actor and the content of the communication. Contrary to prediction, the female actor who engaged in high disclosure of her cancer experience was rated as the most likable and skilled communicator. However, the disclosure of a cancer experience aroused high levels of discomfort across the  board, even in those cases where the cancer victim was well-liked. Thus, it appears that hearing someone discuss a cancer experience may induce a state of ambivalence or an approach-avoidance conflict. The unexpected findings provide the impetus for the development of a new model to account for the social interactions of individuals with serious illnesses. (Author)",

The present study investigated this age status hypothesis among students before and after the transition to middle school in sixth grade with respect to school strain, self-esteem, and grade point average (GPA). Students (N=84) completed questionnaires at four points in time: the end of fifth grade in elementary school, the beginning and end of sixth grade (middle school), and the end of seventh grade. The subjects were placed in one of five age status groups (arranged from youngest to oldest) for the analyses. Results provided support for the hypothesis. Partial correlation analyses, with father's education controlled, showed that  age was positively associated with self-esteem and GPA during the fifth and sixth grades but not seventh grade. Strain was negatively associated with age status during fifth and early sixth grades only. Results suggest a developmental trend in which being younger than average has a temporary detrimental effect on adjustment that occurs before and immediately after the transition to middle school.

        "title":"The Prediction of Intrinsic Motivation among Early Adolescents: A Mediational Model Involving Self-Esteem and Strain.",
        "author":["Fenzel, L. Mickey"],
        "description":"Maintaining an intrinsic motivation for school work is considered to be an important element in keeping adolescents in school and out of trouble. Recent research has begun to study factors that contribute to the development of an intrinsic interest in school learning. Two such important factors are self-esteem and the stressfulness of the school environment. The study reported in this paper tested a model that hypothesizes that intrinsic motivation is affected directly by perceived strain related to school and self-esteem. In addition, it is hypothesized that self-esteem mediates the effect of strain on intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is operationalized as a preference for academic challenge, high curiosity in school work, and an independent approach to mastery of the  academic environment. Results from 84 seventh-grade middle school students provided strong support for the hypothesized model. The clear associations among strain, self-esteem, and intrinsic motivation suggest that a middle school environment that minimizes strain and enhances early adolescent self-esteem can increase a student's motivation to learn and may reap additional benefits of reducing dropout rates and promoting lifelong learning.

College undergraduates (N=94) completed a series of sexual behavior questions and the Self-Monitoring Scale.

Similarly, high and low self-monitors were equally likely to report engaging in sexual intercourse over the preceding year. A greater proportion of low self-monitors, compared to high self-monitors, reported  having sexual relations with only one partner. Other findings suggest that a greater proportion of males, as compared to females, used a condom while a greater proportion of females reported always or almost always using some form of effective birth control. A greater proportion of males than females reported drinking at least some of the time while on a date.

The paper begins with a description of Schutz's Interpersonal model in which Schutz, like Adler, views personality as existing within a social context but sees it as being manifested through the three fundamental interpersonal dimensions of inclusion, control, and affection. The FIRO-B, an assessment instrument designed to measure Schutz's three-dimensional model of interpersonal relationship is also described and psychometric properties of the FIRO-B are discussed. The document shows how Schutz's model supplements Adler's  conceptualization of life tasks and typology and how the FIRO-B can be used as a tool for measuring Adlerian life tasks. It also shows how Adler's and Schutz's conceptualizations are similar although not exactly the same. It is concluded that the correspondence between the conceptualizations of Schutz and Adler is sufficient for the FIRO-B to become a useful measuring tool in Adlerian psychology. (NB)",

The present study examined substance use among a sample of premaritally pregnant adolescents (n=241) who were interviewed as part of an ongoing longitudinal study of patterns of drug use among pregnant and parenting school-aged adolescents. Urine samples were obtained from a randomly selected 50% subsample and laboratory analyzed to verify self-reported substance use (2.5% had discrepant data). Respondents were on average 16 years old; 51% were white and 32% were African American. Findings indicated that, although the majority of respondents had a history of substance use, substance use  declined substantially during pregnancy. Multiple regression analysis indicated that boyfriend's substance use and best friend's substance use during the previous month, the respondent's perceived harm of substance use during pregnancy, and being a school dropout were related to the respondent's substance use during the previous month, while pregnant. The findings have implications for substance use prevention and intervention programs for pregnant and parenting adolescents. (Author)",

One personality variable that might increase susceptibility to symptoms of strain and physical illness is hopelessness, while one variable that was initially proposed as a mediator of the relationship between stress and illness is hardiness, a personality style that enables some people to remain healthy even after experiencing high levels of stress. This study was conducted to examine the possible relationships among hardiness, hopelessness, and strain. Undergraduate students (N=305) completed a questionnaire packet consisting of the Hopelessness Scale, a version of the Hardiness Scale, and a checklist of strain symptoms. Significant correlations were found among hopelessness, hardiness,  and strain. Hopelessness was negatively correlated with the hardiness composite and with each of the three hardiness subcomponents. Strain was negatively correlated with hardiness and positively correlated with hopelessness. While hopelessness and hardiness were moderately correlated, they each accounted for unique portions of the variance in strain scores. (NB)",

Consequently, learning becomes relevant, meaningful, and purposeful in relation to the individual and the society. In the modern African society (MAS), education has been at best an experiment that is marked with inconsistencies in education systems. As a result, the youth are left confused as they are swept from one system to another without the benefit of counseling. In the TAS, the youth are specifically prepared for the occupations they will take when they become adult members of the society. It facilitates their identification process. The youth are given an academic education only as they grow up in the MAS. Therefore, they flock into urban areas seeking  employment as soon as they terminate their academic education. They are disappointed at not finding employment because they lack necessary skills. In the TAS, all adult members of society have a &quot;natural&quot; mandate to correct and counsel youth at any time they find them making mistakes or having problems. On the contrary, parents are expected to correct their youth in the MAS. They pass that responsibility to teachers who understand their responsibility as that of giving youth academic education. Youth problems are ignored by both parties. (Author)",

        "description":"Students leave school for many reasons. Pregnancy, family circumstances, economic necessities, substance abuse, lack of academic success, or disciplinary actions can influence a young person's decision to quit school. There is no single solution to the dropout crisis. Just as there are a variety of causes behind a student's decision to drop out of school, a great many different strategies exist to prevent this event from occurring. In an effort to determine the most successful approaches within a comprehensive strategy, the National Dropout Prevention Center conducted an analysis in 1990 of current research and practices in more than 350 dropout prevention programs. The result is a synthesis of 12 strategies that have had the most positive impact on the dropout rate in  communities across the nation. These 12 strategies are summarized in this document, focusing on expected benefits, program ideas to consider, organizations with additional resources, and additional readings and references. The strategies are: (1) parental assistance and involvement; (2) quality early childhood education; (3) concentrated reading and writing programs; (4) individualized instruction; (5) utilization of instructional technologies; (6) mentoring and tutoring; (7) workforce readiness and career counseling; (8) summer enhancement programs; (9) flexible schedules and alternative programs; (10) staff development programs; (11) school-based management; and (12) community and business collaboration.

Given the complex nature of political socialization, this study investigated identifiable determinants of social action that might be used to advantage in educating young people for citizenship in a democracy. This study attempted to differentiate among junior high, high school and college students (N=517) who were inclined and not inclined to act on their concerns about nuclear threat with selected demographic, psychological, political, and educational variables. The results of a discriminant functional analysis indicated that in comparison with the non-action  group, students in the action group were characterized by reporting less trust in government, more exposure to sources of nuclear war information, more political knowledge, a more liberal political orientation, a stronger sense of political efficacy, a more internal locus of control, and perceptions of their parents as having a more liberal political orientation.

Substantive decision-making elicits three types of teacher knowledge: declarative, involving the description or explanation of a strategy; procedural, referring to how to implement a strategy; and conditional, pertaining to why a strategy is useful and when it should be employed. To effectively employ these three knowledge bases, teachers must be thoroughly familiar with a wide variety of instructional strategies. The term &quot;strategy review&quot; describes the needed process of pulling together available strategies and presenting them in an organized manner designed to aid teachers in the selection process. While findings vary,  research appears to suggest that study guides tend to facilitate students' comprehension performance. Types of study guides can be grouped into: (1) guides that promote skill and strategy development (including processes-of-reading guides, and pattern guides); (2) guides that facilitate content understanding (such as concept guides, learning-from-text guides, and content guides); and (3) guides with dual purposes (including textbook activity guides and interactive reading guides).

        "description":"Whole language has to do with beliefs about language and learners that lead to beliefs about curriculum and instructional procedures. The term emerged as a label for the way language is thought to be learned: as a cohesive organization of systems working together as one--as a whole. The term whole language also refers to the learner as being whole--as sound and healthy, rather than flawed and in need of fixing. Whole language means that learners and teachers are at the center of curricular gravity; all materials and resources are used only if they are appropriate, authentic, and lead to student reflection and reflexivity. Invitations originate from the authentic life of the classroom and are issued by teachers, students, by appropriate and compelling resources and materials, and  even from the acts of reading and writing themselves. Invitations to action that can lead to reflection and reflexivity come from students' abilities, interests and needs, and such invitations have to do with: listening and telling stories; reading real literature; writing with real intent; discussing and sharing with others; and solving difficult problems. Reflection involves the personal and systematic exploration of possibilities. Reflexivity involves independence, initiative, and creativity, and is characterized by restructure or extension of the present performance and the forging of new ideas or questions. When teachers serve as facilitators, give invitational demonstrations, and ask their students to do only those things that they are willing to do themselves, quality thinking and  learning take place.

There are two common threads in all the interpretations of literature-based instruction: (1) the use of literature as the primary material for reading instruction; and (2) the elimination of the structural support and practices of basal reading systems. Information which provides a theoretical base for literature-based reading instruction focuses largely on the whole language philosophy, psycholinguistics, and cognitive psychology. Children become literate, according to the advocates, by being immersed in a literate environment and by being encouraged and supported in encounters with literacy. Studies can be identified to support the trend  toward instruction with whole texts and purposeful reading. Proponents of the literature-based instruction movement value whole stories and an emphasis on meaning. Reports indicate that the use of children's literature in the teaching of reading has a positive effect on student's achievement and attitudes toward reading. There is a need for more research on literature-based reading programs and implementation strategies. There appears to be a label, &quot;literature-based instruction,&quot; which provides an umbrella for a myriad of practices. As models are developed, implemented and evaluated, studies should be undertaken so that teachers can receive guidance in using literature to develop proficient readers.

        "description":"To help students achieve a better understanding of narrative prose, yet still keep the benefits of semantic mapping, the traditional form of the semantic map is modified by incorporating the elements of story structure as part of the map. This format is called episodic mapping. Episodic mapping is based on the idea that most well-developed stories contain the same basic elements of structure. The five elements of episodic mapping include: setting, problem/goal, major episodes, theme, and resolution. This method helps children put story abstractions into the concrete, giving the children something more tangible with which to work. The visual nature of the episodic map also helps the children better understand the interrelatedness of the various parts of the story. This method has  a lot of potential for the reading teacher who is trying to teach and encourage interest in narrative prose. It can also be used to reinforce or teach many of the specific skills necessary for reading comprehension. When practicing or assessing comprehension skills, classroom activities related to the following skills are especially useful: interpreting story events, drawing conclusions, finding the main idea or theme, sequencing events, comparing or contrasting, finding cause and effect, developing a sense of inference, and locating information.

Metacognition, which is knowledge of a task and of the thinker's own cognitive processes, and monitoring, the ability to assess and adapt thinking when problems become apparent, are elements of reflective thinking. Research shows that experienced writers undertake constructive planning when creating and integrating complex networks of goals and strategies. To discover the role of critical reflection in collaborative writing, 22 first-year college students enrolled in 2 core composition courses were encouraged to engage in collaborative planning. Students were to identify discourse problems from their own lives, apply readings on the subject of how language and conceptual labels  affect what is seen and known, and prepare &quot;planning blackboards&quot; before writing. While planning, students did not behave like novice writers, but devoted attention in their discussions to the purpose/key point of their writing, as well as their intended audience. Collaborative planning styles fell into a &quot;checklist approach&quot; (using the planning blackboard as a checklist) and an &quot;interactive approach&quot; (introducing and reacting to key points). Overall, a positive correlation was found between the amount of reflection that went into a student's writing and the quality of that writing. (Two tables of data and two figures are included.)

        "description":"A writing across the curriculum program at Queensborough Community College in New York began its work on campus as Writing and Reading in the Technologies (WRIT) and chose to work with the Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology (ECET) department. The program's implementation was two-tiered. In Tier 1, over a period of three years, the WRIT staff presented writing strategies to the ECET faculty: using a course journal; improving writing in the lab report; evaluating writing holistically; and, in the third year, the introduction of the microtheme, which resembles both vocational and English discourse in its several manifestations of summary-writing, thesis-support, data provision, and quandary posing aspect. All strategies were well-received and were implemented, with the  exception of the narrative lab report, which met with resistance from the ECET faculty. Together, WRIT staff and ECET faculty developed curriculum materials on WRIT writing strategies for the first two courses required in both the electrical and computer technology programs. In Tier 2, informed about how to think about writing, the ECET faculty themselves, spurred on by their accrediting association, inserted writing into their lab report. In conclusion, this experience indicates that: (1) English teachers can play a role in other disciplines through teaching the value of writing and approaches to assigning it through generic writing-to-learn assignments, like the journal and microtheme; and (2) vocational faculty will themselves proceed to develop writing assignments for their upper  level courses that can be considered &quot;discourse centered.&quot; (Sample lab assignments with writing questions are included, and 12 references are attached.)

First, a breakthrough in national politics has provided a tolerance and an appreciation of multilingualism in the United States. In the presidential campaign of 1988, the Democratic candidate addressed his convention in Spanish, and the Republic candidate had a member of his family, Hispanic herself, address that convention. Also, disclosures about and resignations of key individuals and political figures suggests that U.S. English--a lobby for English Only--has lost a major amount of prestige in the American press and that its leadership is in disarray. Secondly, a historical  outline of English Only states reveals that the shift to the constitutional route for enacting this law has resulted in considerable difficulties or total defeat. Furthermore, even when passed, most of these English Only laws are either ignored by most persons or are viewed as &quot;decorative and innocuous.&quot; Thirdly, new support for multilingualism exists at the federal level. Recent guidelines adopted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regarding rules about language use in the workplace and alterations to the wording of the English Only proposed amendments to the United States Constitution evidence increased tolerance for multilingualism.

        "description":"Basic theoretical assumptions support the contention that writing has an important role to play in the teaching of reading and learning processes. E. M. Forster focused on the product of writing as an embodiment of either finished or evolving thought, and Ann E. Berthoff emphasizes the capacity of language to generate itself and, in so doing, spawn additional thought. The term &quot;epistemic&quot; was coined by Kenneth Dowst to describe an approach to teaching writing that makes language the lens through which humans know the world and construct a reality from that knowledge. Lev Vygotsky similarly emphasized the symbiotic relation between the process and product of verbal composing, and Jacques Derrida and other deconstructionists go even further in privileging language in the creation  of thought and knowledge. Recent investigations by R. J. Teirney and P. D. Pearson argue that reading and writing are &quot;acts of composing&quot; that share five cognitive and metacognitive subprocesses that are recursive and overlapping: planning, drafting, aligning, revising, and monitoring. Finally, a growing number of studies strongly support the contention that analytic writing can provide an effective means of deepening students' engagement with written study material and of improving students' long-term memories of such material. These studies (especially those dealing with the PORPE--Predict, Organize, Rehearse, Practice, and Evaluate--strategy and its predecessors) illustrate how directed practice in writing develops and reinforces subprocesses in a more intensive and conscious manner  than reading alone can.

To privilege one model over the many others is to ignore the student's need for self- and world-discovery. The composition classroom has become the current center of critical reading and thinking skills, and writing teachers need to make the students the center of the writing experience. Composition students should be able to ask and answer, &quot;What in my/the world is going on?&quot; Before student voices become institutionalized, they should experiment with writing groups, discovering what has become known as &quot;modern rhetoric.&quot; Students can explore possibilities in the important areas of audience and the nature of literacy, and decide what  writing models work for them. However, after their initial experimentation with broader views of process, audience, and literacy, students need to understand the political realities of academic writing: the ability to argue a point--that is, to support a position with research--and the ability to present facts clearly. One important way to help students to adjust to a more prescriptive model is to discuss the narrower views of audience and literacy in academic writing. Another way is to point out that most academic writing always has been collaborative, in which people &quot;talk&quot; through the articles they find in the research process. This point of view introduces students to structures required by other liberal arts courses. (KEH)",

The assumption was that students would produce better essays on the word-processor and printer, and that the instructor could more efficiently help students with revision, despite her low awareness of technical pedagogy. The experimental section included 23 students at the beginning and 14 at the end, a withdrawal/failure rate not uncommon in other sections and thus no reflection on computer-assisted composition. Results based on personal experience and student surveys revealed that the instructor had a difficult time covering the usual syllabus and that  covering the material kept the students from being in the computer lab as often as had been intended. The students, however, did learn more; they completed the work outlined in the usual 101 class, and they learned to use the computer and the WordPerfect program. The students were neither more nor less successful than other 101 students. Finally, the computer was an ideal tool for revision, but not for creating. Students were overwhelmingly inclined to write important in-class essays by hand. (The appendix contains a nine-page course survey and analysis.) (KEH)",

The essential principles of writing in all genres, poetry, fiction, drama, TV, and film can be taught, with the positive effect of saving a serious writing student years of stumbling in the dark. A responsible creative writing course of the present and future must be sensitive to serious writing students' needs by preparing them for writing for radio, film, and TV, without ignoring the important, traditional genres. A course could be developed that might not contribute only to upgrading writing in the media but also afford the professionally bent student writer the best preparation by linking the genres, demonstrating, for example, how poetry and film must both move audiences a long  distance in a relatively short space of time by shared techniques, such as controlling images, and a powerful, emotional closure. The course offers the more casual student a greater appreciation of writing, while it develops a greater awareness of self and life. Good writing offers the greatest opportunity to communicate trust and the courage to confront, even to initiate, conflict that inspires the change necessary for growth and development.

Next, these confrontive writings are used as an invitation to  dialogue as students focus upon changing oppressive social structures that influence their own lives. Students are moved to this point by the use of response journals and learning logs in which they have a place to think through their reading, empowering their voices.

Subjects, 743 students attending the 1989 Florida Scholastic Press Association Convention, were given a questionnaire to determine how they evaluated journalism as a career choice. The questionnaire asked students how many were planning journalism careers, what their other top career choices were, and who and what primarily influences their perspectives on journalism. Students were asked to rank journalism with nine other career choices; results were compared with similar research carried out in the last 30 years.  Current survey results indicated that students ranked &quot;journalist&quot; as number one in terms of interest of work. This indicates that students who choose journalism as a career continue to do so with an awareness of economic realities; they base their decision on journalism as an interesting and useful career. With high school journalism students, journalism continues to be the first choice in terms of career choices. Over 30 years, there is some indication of a modest increase in the number of high school journalism students planning a career in journalism. Involvement in high school publications continues to be the major influence of their decision to go into journalism. Students reported early career decisions to pursue journalism.

Part one discusses the essentials of poetry and the roles of poets from ancient oral cultures to the present. The four chapters in this section picture the reading and writing of poetry as a means of introspection through language and also as a way to discover a connection with a larger human community. Demonstrations illustrate how poetry expresses universals in terms of particulars, how it &quot;shows&quot; instead of &quot;tells,&quot; and how a &quot;live&quot; metaphor differs from a &quot;dead&quot; one. The entire second section focuses on helping student poets find subject matter for their  own writing. The eight chapters are in the form of a do-it-yourself handbook for amateur creative writers. The book's approach (read, respond, play with language) helps students use their imagination for more authentic expression and find subjects and ideas for poems in their everyday lives. Every chapter contains classroom activities, discussion questions, bibliographies of works cited, and student writing models. (KEH)",

The book provides a brief theoretical and historical basis for its fundamental approach and presents 29 instructional strategies that classroom teachers who do not have special equipment, materials, or preparation in the arts can incorporate into their teaching. The book is intended as a compact supplement--a \"starter kit\"--to be creatively adapted to specific classrooms to help students make stimulating connections between English and some of the arts they know best--popular music, film, photography, design, drawing and painting, and drama. Following a brief discussion of the theoretical and research-based  support for their ideas, the book presents 15 activities that focus on language (dialects, usage and structure, semantics, and etymology), nine that focus on literature, and five that focus on writing. A 50-item bibliography concludes the book. (SR)",

        "description":"A study investigated whether there were significant differences between male and female basic writers, examining the writing processes and products of 19 male and female college freshmen basic writers in a university and 33 male and female freshmen basic writers in a junior college. Results indicated that both groups of students, male and female alike, had difficulty meeting the demands of college prose. It is the intersection of such variables as race, gender, and class that determines which students are labeled as &quot;basic&quot; writers. The researchers are now compiling data to investigate quantitatively the influence of race, gender, and class on the writing processes and products of basic writers. Early analysis of this data has revealed some interesting trends. One such trend  finds male basic writers having difficulty with what is generally considered the &quot;male&quot; language of the academy. This suggests that &quot;male&quot; is only a metaphor for a kind of writing that is linear, hierarchical, evaluative, distanced, and controlled. Males who prefer other forms of expression do exist, and are seen with great frequency in basic writing classes. They are shunted into remediation classes until they learn to be distanced, controlled, analytical thinkers--&quot;male&quot; in the way the dominant culture defines &quot;male.&quot; There is a danger in the basic writing teacher's intermediary position: that of asking students to give away too much of themselves, their voices and their stories, in order to achieve what the college or university community wants.

        "description":"Book-length works of nonfiction prose are seldom the object of study when college English teachers, rhetoricians, or theorists are engaged in practicing their profession. Phyllis Frus McCord (in &quot;Reading Nonfiction in Composition Courses: From Theory to Practice&quot; 1985) proposes that the goal should be &quot;to break down the hard line between literature...and nonliterary texts.&quot; One way of doing this is by analyzing nonfiction prose by explicating such elements as character and image. In Tracy Kidder's book &quot;House,&quot; the interaction between character and image moves the reader from the world of the actual to the mythic, imaginative world of archetypal symbols, the shaping principle of this literary work. The house functions as a symbol in the meaning it assumes for each individual:  traditions, control, status, new beginnings, making a mark, rebellion, good-will, artistic, aesthetic, and accomplishment. The house functions as a symbol in what it means as the representation, on a more universal level, of the notion of continuity: homeownership, orientation, art, rituals, celebration and ceremony, and the spiritual flow of creativity.

        "description":"John Reiff's conceptual framework regarding conflicting views of peace provides insight into interpersonal communication which can be successfully applied to conflicts in writing conferences and has already been used at the Colorado College Writing Center. First, a tutor or writer using the &quot;Peace through Strength&quot; frame of reference might see interaction as a competition over authority, in which the goal is to finish the paper his or her way by forcing the other side to relent. In &quot;Peace through Negotiation&quot; the writer or tutor states the problem in terms of misunderstanding in which one side fails to see that both sides have the common interest of finishing the paper. The goal is to finish the paper by means of negotiation. &quot;Peace through Social Change&quot; assumes that the  educational system is unfair and that it sets up people to lose. The solution is to make the parts of the system responsible to each other and more helpful. The final frame of reference for understanding conflicts in a writing conference is &quot;Peace through Personal/Spiritual Change.&quot; Here the root of the problem is that the self-absorbed person is not taking responsibility for explaining himself or herself. The goal is to train the self-absorbed person in how to respect the other person and how to create mutual respect.

Activities in the second section are designed to stimulate an appreciation and understanding of literature and include focusing on imagist poetry, writing ghost  chapters, group role playing, creating the \"last words\" of famous literary characters, staging a contemporary storytelling contest, and more. Teaching ideas in the third section provide the means for students to learn writing from a variety of different angles and for different purposes.

Subjects were given pre- and post-semester tests consisting of a placement test, a writing exercise, and a questionnaire which included the Geer Fear Survey measuring students' self-assessment of their ability, attitude, motivation, and practicability. Writing instructors used a holistic grading scale to grade the essay portion of the tests. Results  revealed no significant difference between the treatment and control groups for six of the seven factors examined--anxiety; self-assessment; motivation; attitude; grammar and mechanics; and writing skills. Results, however, did reveal a significant difference in the students' perception of the practicality of the writing instruction they received for work after college. More research, especially longitudinal evaluation, is called for to measure these seven factors more conclusively. (Twenty-nine references are attached.) (KEH)",

Subjects, 110 students in an introductory linguistics course, kept a journal during the course. The study was mainly interested in the relationships among categorical ratings of linguistic features in students' journals, and the relationships between these features and students' course performance. Three trained judges rated entries taken from students' journals at three periods during the course. Entries were rated according to six 4-point rating scales: (1) formal/informal; (2) objective/affective; (3) elaborated/ unelaborated; (4) predetermined/unfolding; (5) externally defined versus internally constructed knowledge; and (6) negative/positive evaluation. Results  indicated that the degree of formality/informality was related to the degree of objective/affective expression and the degree of predetermined/unfolding. The degree of objective/affective expression was related to the degree of internally constructed versus externally constructed knowledge. Results also indicated that students who were applying the course material were more likely to elaborate and to develop their own working knowledge than students who were summarizing the material. The only journal rating related to final grade was the degree of elaboration which showed a relatively low relationship. The kinds of thinking encouraged by journal writing had little to do with the students' learning as measured on the objective tests. Low correlation suggested that students' beliefs about  the journal form were not strongly related to their actual journal writing. (MG)",

        "description":"Despite literally tens of thousands of rounds of debate competition over a number of years, little insight into argumentation theory has resulted. Debate as practiced by college debating teams has become a laboratory for perfecting itself. Permitting the divergence of debate from argumentation forfeits an ideal opportunity to study argumentation. The use of conditional argument can be assessed as it relates to argumentation theory and practice. Conditional argument, defined as a contention that is developed hypothetically, can be dismissed at any point in debate, irrespective of how such a claim has been argued. As such, conditional argumentation is inappropriate and undesirable in debate competition because it: (1) fails to satisfy the minimum preconditions necessary for  meaningful argumentation; (2) results in shoddy advocacy in absolving the debater of intellectual accountability; and (3) cannot be evaluated meaningfully. Allowing conditional claims would not make for more rigorous comparison of policies, while barring such arguments would neither render debate unreal or artificial nor unfairly restrict negative options. Conditional argumentation should be discouraged in academic debate. (Nineteen footnotes are included.) (SG)",

        "description":"Contemporary dispute among teachers of rhetoric between those who prefer the classical tradition of rhetoric and those who champion an epistemic view of rhetoric has antecedents among the disputes of the ancient Greek scholars. Some of the vital themes of epistemology can be traced back to Protagoras of Abdera, one of the two great leaders of the Sophistic movement and a pioneer of epistemic rhetoric. Comparatively little contemporary attention has been paid to his work, and there are only four or five sentences that can with any confidence be attributed to his authorship. Other evidence of Protagoras' views must be sought in the works of Diogenes Laertius, Sextus Empiricus, and Plato. While Parmenides rejected all assertions of not-being, and Socrates and Plato objectified being  in a world of &quot;ideal forms,&quot; Protagoras and his fellow Sophist Gorgius of Leontini took an opposing view. Gorgius identified flaws in Parmenidean logic and went on to demonstrate that nothing absolutely &quot;is.&quot; In Plato's dialogue &quot;Theaetetus,&quot; Protagoras calls upon Socrates to look beyond the surface of Protagoras' assertion that man is the measure of all things to the logos of the statement. This call to anti-logic was a particularly Protagorean approach to dialectic. A coherent dialectical method emerges from Protagorean epistemology: (1) that there are at least two opposed &quot;logoi&quot; in everything; (2) that it is the function and excellence of discourse to bring both out; and (3) that it can be demonstrated that there is no contradiction between the two.

        "description":"The computer user has played an active part in uncovering changes brought on with microcomputer technology. Electronic mail (or &quot;E-mail&quot;), which enables users to send and receive messages through bulletin board services (&quot;BBSs&quot;), is often considered one innovation of the computer revolution. A BBS provides opportunities for both &quot;live,&quot; real-time exchanges with the BBS host or a fellow user and &quot;asynchronous&quot; message exchanges. BBS telecommunication differs from other forms of computer-controlled communication in that it occurs in a non-task-oriented, active environment. Play theory, which examines the relationship of a medium user to the medium, may explain why computer users choose to employ the BBS. According to play theory, &quot;communication play&quot; is a form of self-expression  that takes advantage of a medium in promoting a feeling of individuality. Computer-mediated telecommunication is an example of what has been called &quot;participatory play,&quot; which occurs when communicators are free to alter interaction to achieve goals. Analysis of computer-mediated telecommunication must consider both the decision to use the medium and the unique features of the medium that provide content cues of communication play. A network analysis (examining who talks to whom about what) might also shed light on the influence of play communication. (Fourteen references are attached.) (SG)",

        "author":["Smith, John Kares"],
        "description":"To study any social movement is ultimately to examine an intricate social drama. With the publication of &quot;The Jungle&quot; in 1906, Upton Sinclair emerged from the stormy background of the muckraking movement to become one of that movement's principal actors. But in the 1920s, long after the Progressive reformers dusted and put away their muckrakers for other pursuits, Sinclair raked with indomitable zeal and enthusiasm. From 1918 to 1927, Sinclair created a remarkable series of muckraking tracts. Collectively called &quot;The Dead Hand&quot; series, it has been called one of the first thematic analyses of culture from the socialist perspective. Writing during a time of widespread disillusionment with American progressive reform, Sinclair championed the muckrakers' movement. But so cataclysmic  were the effects of World War I and its aftermath that the fires of reform movements had been virtually extinguished. In the 1920s Sinclair was almost alone in the role of radical American social critic. It was not until the 1970s that historians and critics noted the historical and intellectual significance of &quot;The Dead Hand&quot; series. Critics suggest it is indeed unfortunate that eminent historians ignored Sinclair's preservation of the muckraking tradition. &quot;The Dead Hand&quot; series can be seen as a &quot;rhetorica in vacuuo&quot; which ultimately failed in its purposes for historical, rhetorical, and personal reasons.

        "description":"The necessity for maintaining and extending the public space within which argumentation may appear, whether or not represented in the classroom, stems largely from pressures which have increasingly restricted that space. To function as public spaces, classrooms must enable students as citizens to confer in an unrestricted fashion about matters of public interest. Pressures such as specialization make the functioning of the classroom as a public space more problematic. For example, science courses tend to treat opinion as irrelevant. Furthermore, some reluctance to entertain popular opinions has been noted in the teaching of many academic disciplines. If students can be viewed as possessing public power, the classroom can be employed as a public space. A broader view of the&quot;classroom&quot; as including the entire educational environment and its inhabitants would have some potential for contributing to the public sphere. School forensics programs should be able to find a place for real talk which contributes to public opinion. The classroom may well be free enough for the exchange of public opinion so that the implementation of its public function may be a worthy goal for all educators. (Fifteen references are attached.)

Forty-three institutions were found to offer forensics-education courses. Forty course descriptions referred to either forensics, speech activities, and/or debate, and 17 of the courses were actually entitled &quot;Directing Forensics.&quot; In addition, 43 schools offered  graduate degrees in speech communication education; 11 offered doctorates. Descriptions of forensics direction courses tended to focus on such topics as directing programs, coaching skills, and administration, while there was little emphasis on tournament operation and judging. A prior study revealed a significant correlation between perceived training inadequacy and coaching satisfaction.

Results gave no support whatsoever to the proposal that visually graphic bad news is appealing to viewers because it eventually makes them feel better about their own lives.

First, directors should develop behavioral objectives for individual events programs which are consistent with the mission and goals of the sponsoring educational institutions. This includes codes of conduct for participants in individual events. Next, the director should seek to maximize student achievement by developing behavioral objectives that address the cognitive and affective realms of the learner and by promoting programs of independent study to help students prepare to participate in individual events. With regard to scholarship, program  directors and individual events coaches should both cultivate and utilize as fully as possible faculty in other disciplines to assess the content of student products. Faculty in individual events programs should make every effort to assure high standards of scholarship are met by each student in preparation of each presentation. The final area of concern by directors is service. Individual events programs should involve themselves in presentations before academic, scholastic, and community audiences consistent with the mission of the institution to serve such groups. Institutional provision of necessary equipment and funding is critical to the development of this service dimension.

        "description":"Current practice in competitive public-address events limits the value of the student's educational experience in several ways. The most frequently observed and easily addressed problem with contemporary practice is that event rules/descriptions do not indicate what judges expect to observe in those events. Unclear rules/descriptions are of little help in telling students, coaches, and judges what to expect in the event. This ambiguity may help explain why lay judges disagree with contest coaches in determining which speech should be rewarded. Additional problems limiting the value of the forensic experience may be found in the types of speeches represented in competitive individual public address. The current events demand three types of delivery: impromptu, extemporaneous, and  memorized. The fourth generally recognized type of delivery, manuscript, should also be required, as well as other forms of persuasive speaking. Further limitation of educational value may result from the evaluation of student performance in the competitive arena. Judges need to have more time to draft ballots with fewer contestants packed into panels. It would be helpful to increase the amount of judge-contestant interaction by allowing a specific time period after each presentation for questions and answers. The forensics community needs to adopt changes which will assure the educational value of competitive public address events. (Twenty references are attached.) (MG)",

Each approach: two-time point, panel/repeated measures, and time-series experimental designs, offers its own advantages and disadvantages. By examining the benefits and disadvantages of each approach and looking at several research questions, it appears that many research questions would benefit from using multiple approaches. A history of agenda-setting research suggests that non-theoretical over-time research may be a wonderful entry into questions of process, a place where theories may be developed. Theories allow these processes to be examined with other approaches. Therefore, examining temporal processes without developing  theories, regardless of method, would be to the detriment of a researcher's ability to understand the processes and effects of communication.

The focus was on 29 studies that compared between-class ability grouping to heterogeneous placements. Effect sizes were used to characterize study results. Findings indicate that comprehensive between-class ability grouping plans, different forms of ability grouping, and ability grouping by subject (except in social studies) had no effect on student achievement. The finding of zero effects of grouping for all ability levels contradicts earlier conclusions that demonstrated benefits of ability grouping for high-level students and detriments for low-level  students. Explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. An implication is that policy decisions about ability grouping must be based on criteria other than effect on academic achievement.

Few studies of school administrator burnout have been conducted using instruments appropriate to that field. This paper summarizes a study examining the relationships between colleague perceptions and administrator burnout as measured by the Administrator Role Perception Inventory. This study also investigated the relationships between colleague perceptions and factors associated with burnout. The sample was drawn from the membership of a west coast, state-level organization of school administrators. All 2,113 members received a biographical questionnaire and the inventory; 62 percent completed and  returned the packet. For a random sample of 159 members, colleague questionnaires were distributed, for a 48 percent return rate. Means and standard deviations for the subsample of administrators on the ARPI were calculated. Coefficients of correlation between the ARPI scales and colleague perceptions were also calculated. Results indicated that burnout exists and that the characteristics of burnout among school administrators (depression, lowered motivation, isolation from others, and reduced accomplishment) can be identified by colleagues. As this study suggests, it is possible to develop skills in identifying emerging burnout, perhaps aided by an inventory developed for this purpose. (18 references) (MLH)",

        "description":"The purpose of this booklet is to relate significant research pertaining to student achievement. Each section defines one of eight research-based variables associated with greater academic achievement and includes some practical applications within school settings. According to the first two sections, high principal and teacher expectations are associated with increased student achievement. As section 3 shows, time on task is also important; the more time spent on instruction, the greater the achievement gain. According to section 4, higher achievement gains are more likely to occur in classrooms characterized by supportive teachers and a high degree of structure. The most important determinant of classroom atmosphere is the teachers's method of managing the classroom and keeping  the class actively attentive and involved in productive learning activities. As section 5 shows, teachers' use of positive feedback/reinforcement also significantly aids student achievement. Section 6 explains the benefits of tutoring and offers tips for establishing a tutoring program. As section 7 shows, recitation promotes greater achievement gains, and using factual questioning in class is associated with greater basic skills acquisition. Finally, the last section discusses the importance of parental involvement as an influence on student achievement. Each section is accompanied by several bibliographical references. (MLH)",

Powell's written legal opinions on the need for maintaining discipline and order in the classroom, upholding the authority of school boards to determine curriculum, the importance of the teacher as role model, and the overall value of individual education to society are discussed in relationship to his educational theories. A conclusion is that Powell holds conflicting educational viewpoints that do not serve as a consistent progressive or traditional model for educators. A recommendation is made for educators to understand the combination of educational theories espoused in his legal opinions. Extensive footnotes are  included. (LMI)",

        "description":"Because the ultimate power to control school reform is in the hands of the superintendent or some other similarly positioned administrator, the reforms tend to benefit some student or constituency groups more than others. Judging from the personal characteristics of most superintendents and the political context of the superintendency itself, it can be concluded that superintendents are limited in their understanding of the needs and interests of significant segments of the community, specifically their least powerful constituents. Even if superintendents do attempt to serve the whole community, it is highly improbable that they will succeed, due to the political position of public schools. Results of the reorganization of Johnsonville School District, located within a small  western city that was experiencing considerable growth in the middle- and upper middle-class suburban areas, are consistent with observations of the powerful influence of community elites over local public policy. Had the Johnsonville School reform effort proceeded (as initially announced) in accordance with the principles of critical pluralism, a shared decisionmaking process where power--not just the opportunity to participate--is equally distributed, the benefits of the reorganization would have been more evenly distributed among the community's constituents.

This analysis, composed of seven chapters, examines the controversy of school choice and the agendas supporting it. While one agenda detailed within this document can be characterized as &quot;reaction to the present,&quot; the second, a well-known agenda for choice is actually &quot;choice as a means for desegregating schools.&quot; A third, less known agenda for choice is presented as &quot;choice as a catalyst for  change.&quot; Because educators must implement policies that not only benefit individual students but also ensure that schools represent the broad, democratic interests of society as a whole, this analysis attempts to assist educators to make informed decisions about choice based on the context in which they and their students teach and learn.

The surveys addressed three purposes: (1) overall assessment of the California Resource Specialist programs (designed to serve learning disabled students with a combination of regular classroom support and special &quot;pullout&quot; services); (2) identification of underlying themes and common perspectives within the evaluation data; and (3) determination of the extent to which response factors are able to predict student achievement and resource specialist program characteristics. Data from 5 of the 11 survey forms were analyzed in this report, including: educator opinions on overall school functioning and approval; parental  opinions toward the school and the Resource Specialist program; educator views of the type, quantity, and quality of staff development activities; and perceptions of the effectiveness of the Resource Specialist Program in achieving program exit for participating students. Both parents and educators gave the program a strongly positive evaluation. Educators throughout California seem convinced that resource rooms support classroom success for special education students. According to parents, good schools are organizationally effective and stress shared instructional involvement and academic concerns for all children. Professional educators interpret the general school programs along three dimensions: principal leadership, effective classroom practices, and effective teaching strategies.  Sources of program success, prediction of resource specialist outcomes, alternative goals, and policy implications are also discussed. There are 41 tables, 9 figures and two appendices containing surveys and results. (MLH)",

Eight Sacramento area schools serving four different student populations--agricultural, military, urban, and stable--were studied. Findings indicate that a significant number of students move frequently enough to impact students, teachers, and schools. Unlike research on migrant students, little acknowledgment of student mobility and its effect on the educational system exists in current literature.  Problems related to student mobility are inconsistent curricula, difficulty of student needs assessment, and the primary assignment of responsibility to teachers.

This report summarizes a survey of site leaders participating in two C-LERN summer institutes held in 1989. Additionally, school staff attending the evaluation sessions were interviewed regarding their experiences and assessments of the process. Analysis of the 319 surveys returned showed that many respondents lacked sufficient experience with C-LERN to answer all the questions. The  148 respondents with less than a year's experience with C-LERN were excluded from the second round of survey analysis, leaving a subset of 171 more experienced respondents on which to base the findings. This subset included 92 teachers, 15 principals, 7 vice principals, 4 counselors, 2 students, 5 parents, and 13 others. Generally, C-LERN summer institute participants were greatly satisfied with the process. Most respondents (75 percent) said they were clear about C-LERN goals and 67 percent believed that problems were accurately identified and that the process had clarified their school mission. Participants expressed concerns about failure terminology and implementation and development issues. Recommendations for improving, expanding, and evaluating the program are provided.

        "description":"Consolidation has become both a solution for small, rural school districts and a contentious policy fraught with numerous difficulties. Despite concerns about limited curricula and higher operating expenses, there is no generalizable evidence that students educated in rural settings underachieve or have deficient social skills. Recent research has found that socioeconomic status, English proficiency, and cultural factors are major indicators of student achievement, not school size and geographic location. This report explores alternative solutions to making needed improvements, including interdistrict sharing, partial reorganizations, extradistrict cooperation, and the use of intermediary units and instructional technologies, and describes the promises and limitations of such  alternatives. Districts pooling limited resources are, in effect, increasing their overall enrollment base. Arrangements requiring only minimal involvement are the easiest to sustain. Sharing ease or difficulty depends on factors such as stability, consensus, distribution of benefits, competition, and expense. Three successful examples of partial reorganization include central high school districts, cluster districts, and districts operating student exchange programs. Extradistrict cooperation results when a district receives program support, services, or equipment from area businesses, governmental agencies, nonprofit groups, and postsecondary institutions. Intermediary units are frequently mandated, directed, and funded by the state to coordinate the sharing of resources, teachers, and  specialized staff and services. Consolidation and cooperation are contrary policies attempting to accomplish the same goals, but neither fully resolves the problems of small, rural schools. (12 references) (MLH)",

A comparison of public and private schools examined the relationships between school characteristics and the percentage of schools offering advanced placement programs, the average number of subject areas covered, and the percentage of schools offering such programs in each of the subject areas. Appendices include extensive supporting statistical tables and the survey questionnaires. (LMI)",

Patterns of administrative behavior were analyzed on the basis of control relationships, communication styles, and utilization of structural or human resources in problem resolution. Successful cases were characterized by shared responsibility, participative decision making, and utilization of structural and human resources. Unsuccessful cases featured less communication and decision making based on structural considerations. The  cases illustrate the importance of collaboration, communication, and attention to personal issues in problem solving. Finally, the findings demonstrate that case records are useful in developing performance criteria, establishing a link between theory and practice, illustrating theoretical concepts, and defining a new role for practitioners as research contributors generating new \"knowledge-in-action.\" (14 references) (LMI)",

Focus groups are useful in generating new data that have not been constrained by a preconceived evaluation format. The goal of focus groups is not consensus building, but identification of a variety of needs. A needs assessment study was conducted by a regional educational laboratory, in five locations across the northeastern United States. Thirty-five representatives from education, administration, business, and professional associations, generated from a list of nominations, participated in focus group discussions. The groups identified regional elementary and secondary educational needs and feasible types of assistance. Group feedback  produced a significantly different list of needs than those generated previously by a mail survey. Earlier lists of needs focused on elementary and secondary problems, and the focus groups emphasized needs supportive of the instructional program. Focus groups' requests for assistance were congruent with available services. Findings indicate that, although limited to defining the educational status quo, focus groups are useful in providing input to improve survey design, enhance knowledge of clients' needs, and expand management concepts for future planning.

Findings indicate that small class size is a significant factor in kindergarten readiness achievement and is most effective in cases of low socioeconomic status and high attendance. A second phase of Project STAR, based on observations and interviews with 49 effective first-grade teachers, identified shared characteristics and instructional teaching strategies.  Findings indicate that effective teachers have high expectations for student learning, stress family involvement and individual attention, and have clear discipline and organizational policies.

Magnet schools were developed to achieve an integrated school system, with a focus on development of a curriculum that would attract various racial and ethnic groups. Increased student motivation was expected to contribute to achievement of the following program objectives: improved attendance; increased academic achievement; improved intergroup student relations; and increased positive school attitudes. Data collection involved analysis of aggregated attendance and grade advancement data and a survey of students in the program. Findings indicate that all four high schools attained or came close to attaining two of  the three objectives. The attendance objective was met by each of the four schools, and the achievement objective was met and exceeded by three of the four schools. Survey responses demonstrate that although over one-half of the students displayed generally favorable attitudes toward their peers and school, the evaluation criterion of 70 percent was not achieved in any of the four schools. The recommendation is made for continuous emphasis on improving the attitudinal objective. Programs of the participating schools are described. (LMI)",

The cluster program consisted of 13 separate school clusters that offered career-related curricula, each headed by a different principal and facilitator. Program goals were: (1) to ensure equitable student access to special and optional programs by providing a uniform curriculum among schools that share related career interests; and (2) to allow development of students' special interests. Methodology consisted of interviews with principals and facilitators of all 13 clusters and a mail survey of 40 cluster members. The majority of interview subjects felt that the clusters had successfully achieved program goals, and expressed satisfaction with a  collaborative cluster member forum. Recommendations were made for: clarification of program guidelines; concentration of responsibility for cluster organization and communication; prior dissemination of program information to prospective high school students; and consideration of student attitudes and interests in the admission screening process.

This booklet explores how people responsible for schools can develop better relationships, new forms of colleagueship, and new ways of working together more productively. Three aphorisms describe the phenomenon of faculty-led school improvement: (1) taking a trip without a roadmap; (2) rebuilding the airplane while in flight; and (3) rediscovering the &quot;if it's not local, it's not real&quot; adage. To restructure education effectively, educators must foster the dynamics of group functioning and build an environment in which research-proven teaching methodologies promoting positive student interaction can flourish. Cooperation and collaboration are often hampered when groups of teachers and  students are asked to work together without using group building activities, which incorporate heterogeneous grouping, positive interdependence, group reward, and individual accountability. Four chapters discuss specific group builders to enhance positive interactions between administrators and teachers, among teachers, and among both younger and older students. The last chapter discusses approaches to assessing the outcomes of the interactive process. Numerous sources for group-building activities are included, along with a selected bibliography of 35 references. (MLH)",

Tracking's most controversial feature is the potentially harmful effects of bad placement decisions based on such nonacademic criteria as low parental income, race, ethnicity, gender, and special needs. The problem is exacerbated by the rapid displacement of unskilled industrial jobs and a growing demand only for workers having high academic skills. This report outlines the results of an extensive inquiry into the tracking system and presents conclusions and recommendations. Research activities and procedures developed by the National Education Association (NEA)  generated a comprehensive analysis of academic tracking. Tracking was found to be very common, becoming more typical during each subsequent school grade. At some point, virtually all students are ability grouped or tracked. Students from diverse ethnic groups are tracked into different classes and curricula. Hispanic and Black students are overrepresented in vocational education and underrepresented in academic tracks. Findings concerning benefits and the role of educational \"gatekeepers\" are also discussed, along with alternatives to tracking such as the U.S. Department of Education's Regular Education Initiative (REI). Rigid academic tracking creates problems for many students from all socioeconomic and ethnic groups and also creates student isolation by socioeconomic status and  ethnicity. Further conclusions and recommendations are discussed. A chronological review of NEA tracking research and a glossary are included. (35 references) (MLH)",

Iowa achievement test scores of a random sample of 250 children in grades 1-5 were then matched with their parents' survey responses that had been classified according to level of involvement and attitudes about school effectiveness. Findings indicate that involving parents in substantive ways in their children's schooling has a significant impact on parents' attitudes toward the school. A second finding  demonstrates a direct relationship between parents' attitudes toward the school and student achievement. Although not a causal relationship, findings demonstrate that increased parent involvement not only contributes to positive school perceptions, but is also related to improved academic performance.

        "description":"For the 1982-83 school year, the Austin (Texas) Public Schools adopted a high school attendance policy allowing a maximum of 10 absences per semester for course credit to be earned. Under this policy, Austin's high school attendance rose to an all-time high of 93.5 percent in 1983-84. In 1984-85, education reform mandated by the Texas Legislature set a state standard. A student could now miss no more than five classes per semester and receive course credit, but principals could &quot;excuse&quot; absences at their discretion. During the first year of the &quot;five-absence&quot; policy, Austin's high school attendance nearly matched the previous year's record high. Then began a remarkable decline, as excessive absences over five were excused in record numbers. District rumors held that students,  parents, and school administrators had figured out the game and knew how to play it. In 1989, the Texas Legislature abandoned the five-absence rule in favor of an 80-day per semester attendance requirement, with days lost to be made up before course credit may be received. This report describes how the five-absence rule failed, so that institutional wisdom may help ensure the new policy's success. The study concluded that since the beginning of the five-absence rule, Austin high school attendance rates had deteriorated, the number of excused absences had increased, absences were not inflated by dropout counts, and the rule did not cause more students to drop out. The number of excused absences circumvented the rule and made it ineffective. (MLH)",

At issue was a male school principal instructing a female teacher to change the record of what she had said in evaluating a language curriculum project. The objectives of the paper are the following: (1) to demonstrate the way in which local reactions to an evaluation directly threatened its validity; (2) to demonstrate that not all participants in a qualitative evaluation study  understand or defer to the commitments of democratic evaluation; (3) to indicate that the metapolitical analyses of evaluation approaches do little to inform the nature of local site effects; and (4) to identify some new theses about the practice of &quot;democratic&quot; evaluation.

        "description":"State education reform efforts, like national proposals for educational excellence, have blamed poor schooling for widening the gulf between poor and rich and influencing economic and industrial decline. Improved schools will supposedly restore economic health to society and its individual citizens. This conflation of educational reform and economic revitalization has encouraged business leaders to shape policy strategies for educational reform as they do for their corporations, focusing on purpose and restructured work relationships. Better schools are frequently defined as those meeting the needs of business, as Lee A. Iacocca's syndicated column illustrates. Although educational policy analysts have criticized various components of the excellence movement, few have examined  the underlying commitment to a corporate ethos and a factory organizational model. The rhetoric of empowering teachers and rewarding competency with higher pay and status masks structural changes which will undermine the conditions nurturing effective teaching. The old factory model has merely been replaced with a new manufacturing model that is equally incompatible with education's democratic purposes and is being challenged (even within factories) as a less humane workplace organization system. By allowing corporate leaders and ideology to dominate the national and state policy debates on educational reform, educators have won increased funding for schools and teacher salaries at the cost of further isolating education from its democratic goals and constituencies.

        "description":"Recent studies have reported that private schools surpass public schools on numerous educational outcome measures. Analysts have suggested that differences between teachers in public and private schools partly account for the measured success of private schools. This report investigates these differences in terms of teacher time allocation patterns. Specifically, the report asks if public school teachers spend more or less time than private school teachers in classroom teaching, planning and evaluation, extracurricular supervision, or other student-related activities. The report also examines whether differences in teachers' time allocation depend upon demographic, educational, or teaching experience factors, or on school characteristics such as school size or regional location.  The study analyzed data from \"The Public School Survey of 1984-85\" and \"The 1985-86 National Survey of Private Schools,\" using descriptive analysis and multiple regression techniques. The typical full-time teacher spends approximately 50 hours weekly on classroom and nonclassroom school-related activities, with roughly one-half of this time spent in the classroom. The remaining 25 hours are distributed across the other activity categories, with the largest proportion (60 percent) allocated to planning and evaluation activities. For all teachers, there are no significant differences in time usage between public and private school teachers among the activity categories shown. Within each instructional level, some public-private differences do emerge. These and other results are summarized  and displayed in numerous tables and appendices. (MLH)",

According to the U.S. Education Department's National Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), which surveyed 25,000 American eighth graders, such learning communities are seldom found in our schools. Regarding school relationships, data show that by spring of the school year, 35 percent of eighth-grade students said they had not talked with their teacher about coursework  during the school year and 65 percent had not discussed their course selections with a school counselor. Concerning learning readiness, teachers said that 20 percent of sampled eighth graders were inattentive; 47 percent of the students said they were bored at least half the time spent in school. Over 10 percent of eighth graders were frequently absent, and a third had been sent to the office for misbehaving. School climate is far from engaging, with a significant percentage of students citing tardiness, absenteeism, cutting class, and class disruption as serious problems. Fundamental restructuring is needed to redress these problems. Specific recommendations are outlined. (Three references) (MLH)",

Interviews were also conducted with 27 former ONS and other employers and personnel managers in business and industry. Findings indicated that benefits of such employment programs to employers, MSN employees, and the community are many. However, performance expectations often exceed MSN employee ability, which tends to contribute to difficulties in  psychosocial and emotional adjustment of the NSM employee. Training supervisors who can provide specific information and supervisory techniques for working with MSN employees and the availability of such supervisors for ongoing consultation were seen as major sources of support for ONS staff.

        "description":"These guidelines developed out of a study identifying support systems for supervisors of people with moderate special needs (MSN) in training internships and employment situations. Generally MSNs are dependable, loyal employees who are eager to please and to do a good job. Problems occur because the MSNs are insecure about their role at work, have low self-esteem and doubt their capacity to live up to others' expectations. For some MSNs, distractibility and having a short attention span are major problems. Strategies for supervision of MSN staff are discussed in two sections: general techniques, such as welcoming techniques, for working with MSNs across time, and specific strategies for handling problem behaviors ranging from shyness to poor judgement regarding safety issues.

Children with ADD, medicated (N=20) and unmedicated (N=21), were compared on the Raven test of Progressive Matrices and other tests with children who had been referred for assessment of learning disabilities (LD) and who were either identified (N=16) or not identified (N=11). Discriminant function analyses were conducted to determine the cognitive/educational profile which differentiated among the four groups studied. Grouping nonmedicated ADD subjects with LD subjects proved effective, indicating a need for special education programming appropriate to both groups. The nonmedicated ADD group  demonstrated weaknesses in word attack (decoding) calculations and verbal working memory. Similarities and differences among nonmedicated ADD and LD subjects are discussed. Includes 46 references. (PB)",

        "description":"The number of Hispanic school-age children with hearing impairments in the United States is rising. Hispanic parents who discover that their baby has a hearing impairment lack basic information about deafness and experience guilt feelings about the cause of their child's hearing loss. They often do not know how to obtain information or medical care. Initiation of services in the school district often takes far too long, and parents are not familiar with the educational rights of their children. Parents do not understand how to care for, test, and encourage their child's use of hearing aids. The John Tracy Clinic in Los Angeles, California, is a private nonprofit agency that provides free educational, audiological, and psychological services to families that choose the oral  communication option for their deaf children (ages birth through 6 years). The program is based on the principle that parents are their children's primary teachers of language. Hispanic parents undergo English-as-a-Second-Language training, parent classes, and support group sessions. The hearing-impaired children may attend the Clinic's nursery school. Clients who have successfully utilized the Clinic's services tend to be motivated, open to learning, energetic, flexible, and hard-working; clients come from varying socioeconomic and educational backgrounds.

It contains edited summaries of the discussions of five working groups from a major forum on national supported employment issues which was convened in Williamsburg, Virginia, in May 1988. The five working groups covered: systems change/conversion, integration and empowerment, in-state economic development and marketing, long-term funding, and technical assistance and staff development. Each working group identified issues relevant to its topic; identified components of each issue; and specified progress, resources, and challenges related to the issues. An introductory paper describes how the issues  forum was designed and how topical areas and formats were determined. A concluding paper notes that the issues forum marked a change in expectations from beginning a social change initiative to extending the reality of integrated jobs with long-term support to all persons with severe disabilities.

These funds were targeted to modify existing adult day programs for persons with severe disabilities and provide supported employment programs as alternative vocational options. A survey instrument was developed, covering: strategies used to establish local supported employment programs, implementation of Title VI-C regulations of the current Rehabilitation Act, availability of ongoing support services, conversion of existing facilities/programs, and extent of participation by persons with severe disabilities. The study's findings are presented in the following four chapters: \"Policy and Program  Development in Supported Employment: Current Strategies to Promote Statewide Systems Change\" (John Kregel and others); \"Supported Employment Implementation I: Characteristics and Outcomes of Persons Being Served\" (Paul Wehman and others); \"Supported Employment Implementation II: Service Delivery Characteristics Associated with Program Development and Costs\" (Paul Wehman and others); and \"Public Policy and Supported Employment: An Assessment of Fiscal Activity, 1986-1988\" (Michael Shafer and others). The results show that the 27 states have effectively implemented supported employment service delivery systems in a short period of time, and efforts are just now beginning to lead to widespread supported employment opportunities. A final chapter by John Kregel outlines recommendations for the  future of the national supported employment initiative. References accompany individual chapters. (JDD)",

Respondents were requested to rate present and desired levels of competence for both administrative personnel and learning specialists. Fifty-nine competencies were grouped into the following categories: assessment skills, affective interventions, cognitive interventions, instructional skills, counseling/consultation skills, management/leadership skills, and research skills. Competency areas perceived as\"most desired\" by learning specialists were assessment skills, cognitive interventions, and instructional skills, while administrative personnel rated management/leadership skills as most desired. Personnel currently functioning in the role of the learning disability specialist indicated the need for further training on 17 individual items. Both learning disability specialists and administrative personnel requested more knowledge of assessment and of high school special education programs and personnel. The results are intended to provide educational institutions that prepare postsecondary special services personnel with direction for program development and instruction. Includes 26 references.

Administrative support cannot be effectively achieved until college administrators determine where the support services should be located and who is ultimately in charge of these services. The second critical issue involves the functional interpretation of diagnostic reports by consumers and the development of an Individual Student Plan. Students cannot take full responsibility for their learning disability until they have a complete understanding of their individual strengths and weaknesses. The final issue to be highlighted concerns  program accountability and procedures for measuring and determining program effectiveness.

        "description":"An overview of the needs of postsecondary students with learning disabilities in technical colleges is provided, based on data gathered during 12 months of on-site technical assistance provided to five Connecticut technical colleges. Data suggest that institutional planning was a high-priority need, followed by information on Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, inservice education for faculty/staff, and admissions and intake procedures. Across sites, there was variation in the key campus facilitator (e.g., the Dean of Students, the Dean of Instruction, Counseling Center personnel). A comparison of two-year community colleges and technical colleges on selected variables offers insight into some important differences that service providers should consider in the areas of  admissions criteria, student coursework in high school, curriculum, methods of instruction, and faculty credentials and characteristics. Characteristics of learning-disabled students who meet the technical standards for admission to a technical college are listed. Includes four references. (JDD)",

Several goals of current reform initiatives are felt to be exclusionary, such as specifying national or state goals for student achievement, establishing rigid graduation requirements, and relieving schools from \"burdensome regulations.\" Advocates for persons with disabilities, both parents and professionals, must shape school reform in a way that will meet the needs of all students. An inclusionary model of school reform is proposed which is intended to provide a positive educational experience leading to productive lives for all students. The inclusionary approach stresses acceptance of the value of each student regardless of academic ability, social behavior,  race, class, or any other label. The model calls for effective instruction, effective schools, exit criteria that reinforce productive school learning, curriculum alternatives, and building-based leadership. The focus of special educators on the narrow issue of least restrictive environment as opposed to the broader issue of school reform is discussed. Approaches to teacher preparation are presented that are based on the inclusionary model of school reform. Includes 35 references. (JDD)",

The evaluation design is suitable for programs in 2-year and 4-year settings, and incorporates both process and product evaluation methods. The approach was used to evaluate learning disability support services at Housatonic Community College (Connecticut) and the University of Connecticut. The evaluation focused on program activities, such as identifying referral sources, processing referrals, implementing direct instructional services, providing testing accommodations, and consulting with on-campus personnel; and program outcomes, such as satisfactory completion of courses, retention, and graduation. Examples are offered of forms generated to manage  ongoing data collection and to display longitudinal information regarding program activities and outcomes.

The program also trained teachers to address students' academic and affective needs more effectively. To evaluate the program, interview and observation data were collected from 7 of the 17 participating schools, and data retrieval forms were collected from all participating students. Results showed that: (1) staff development covered many relevant topics; (2) 71% of teachers reported moderate or full collaboration between Chapter 1 teachers and special education teachers in planning and instruction; (3)  student pre-test results were used by all teachers to develop instructional plans; (4) teachers used a wide variety of teaching strategies and equipment to provide instruction; and (5) the program surpassed its student achievement objectives in every category. More than 76% of students for whom complete data was available demonstrated a gain in reading comprehension, 92.4% of students mastered math objectives at a rate of 2 or more per 20 sessions attended, and 35% of students mastered mathematics objectives at a rate of 5 or more per 20 sessions attended.

Subjects were paired in three dyads and observed over a 6-month period in both their dyads and whole group for the frequency of several categories of nonverbal interactional behavior including initiating, imitative, and reciprocal behaviors. Of the 480 minutes of observation data, subjects engaged in non-interactional behavior for a total of 307 minutes. A  total of 1,160 events of interactional behavior were observed. Of that, 322 events occurred in the whole group context and 838 in the peer-dyad context. The frequency of interactional behavior over the eight observation periods followed a complementary pattern, increasing and decreasing in frequency in a reciprocal fashion. Results support the value of the peer-dyad for the development of interactional behavior for the language impaired child. Contains 23 references. (DB)",

Additional data on educational backgrounds were collected for 80 members of the LDSS population, to define variables important in predicting college outcomes. Subsamples of academically high- and low-achieving learning-disabled students were contrasted. Forty percent of the students were female and 60% were male. Ninety percent of the students were of traditional college age, and over 80% were white. Transfer students made up 23% of the population. A disproportionate number of students had majors in fine arts, social science, and education. The high school class rank and the Scholastic Aptitude Test  scores were lower than the University average. The majority of LDSS students had a long-standing history of learning problems and had received special education in high school. However, less than half of those students chose to identify their special needs at the time of college admission. Students with language-based learning disabilities experienced greater academic difficulty than students with nonverbal processing problems. Reasons for these findings are analyzed, and it is concluded that factors such as social/emotional maturity differentiate high- and low-achieving learning-disabled students. Includes five references.

        "description":"Findings are presented from a study of social interactions between hearing-impaired and hearing college students living on one floor of a mainstreamed residence hall at the Rochester (New York) Institute of Technology, home of the National Technical Institute for the Deaf. Twelve ethnographic observations were completed, and interviews were conducted with 20 residents. An ecological model is offered for describing and explaining social interactions. Four individual characteristics emerged as significant in explaining the interactions: reasons for selecting a mainstream floor and perceived advantages of living on a mainstream floor; communication skill; knowledge of one another; and feelings and attitudes toward hearing-impaired/hearing people. Environmental characteristics are  also considered, including the physical setting, policies and rules related to student housing, stability of the environment, and campus culture and organization. The paper concludes with a discussion of how such a model can be used to study and explain interaction between hearing-impaired and hearing people within other contexts, including family, elementary and secondary school, and work.

        "description":"Observations and recommendations are presented from a seminar in which 25 practicing special educators (teachers, administrators, and specialists) from New York State meeting for 5 full days over a period of months participated. A section of general observations notes that the special education system has taken too much upon itself and has fostered too much parental dependence upon the system. This is followed by a section of general recommendations, which address the issues of mainstreaming, regular and special education cooperation, individualization, transition, and creation of a Student Services Team. Specific observations and recommendations are then made on the issues of students, curriculum, the Regent's Action Plan, related services, mainstreaming, personnel, parents, and  the community. Examples of recommendations include: (1) regular and special education teachers and administrators must be held accountable for outcomes in special education; (2) staff development and planning time needs to be considered as an integral part of the professional role; (3) parents should have more control over the process of their child's education; (4) more community utilization of school facilities should be allowed; (5) peer tutoring should pair regular students with students with special needs; (6) college preparation of teachers should include student teaching experiences with students with special needs; (7) stronger team approaches are needed; and (8) self-concept curriculum should be integrated into special education programs.

Two subgroups of learning-disabled college students, the language strong/visually weak (N=22) and the visually strong/language weak (N=10), were identified based on evaluation of 32 essays. Subjects were then given the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) and the Test of Adolescent Language (TOAL). Analysis indicated that the visually strong/language weak subjects earned significantly higher scores in such areas as object assembly, visual motor spatial, visualizing the whole, and sequencing; the language strong/visually weak subjects earned significantly higher scores in the areas of information, vocabulary, comprehension,  speaking, writing, expressive language, and concept score. For the language strong/visually weak subgroup there was almost a two-point difference between the vocabulary and grammar subtest scores on the TOAL, indicating the language strength of this group is in semantics. The visually strong/language weak subgroup earned scores at the mean or above on all non-language subtests of the WAIS-R; on language subtests these subjects scored below the mean. Suggestions for further study are offered. Data and statistical analyses are provided in an appendix. Contains 60 references. (RM)",

The guidelines delineate the roles and responsibilities of personnel involved in the provision of specialized health care. They focus on commonly acceptable practice within the various involved professions and on appropriate actions to protect the safety of the students and minimize risks to schools and their employees. Following an overview of issues, a matrix of professional responsibilities for the delivery of special health care procedures is presented. The matrix lists 66 procedures, and delineates: the persons who are qualified to perform each of the  procedures, the persons who should preferably perform the procedures, and the circumstances under which these persons would be deemed qualified. Personnel include registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, certified teaching personnel, related services personnel, and paraprofessionals. Procedures cover activities of daily living, catheterization, medical support systems, medications, respiratory assistance, ostomies, screenings, specimen collecting/testing, and development of protocols.

The teaching method is designed for four distinct environments, including: (1) an independent mini-course for tourists or emergency needs; (2) a multi-language exploratory course to expose students to various languages and improve their language ability; (3) a pre-course for use before regular academic study; and (4) as an initial unit in full sequences of up to several semesters in which the methodology is followed up consistently. Discussions of the teaching concept address how mini-courses can help in speaking spontaneity and creativity, what the goals and implementations  of the various courses are and why they are important, and some limitations inherent in current foreign language instruction. Additionally, the question of how to integrate the mini-course into the classroom is addressed, and its stages of instruction are described. Finally, an assessment of the results of mini-course instruction, including the follow-up process, is provided based on the outcomes of several hundred students who have taken the course in one or more of the environments mentioned.

Results of the study revealed a specific preference by students for one of the three general phases of composing: pre-writing, writing, or rewriting. Although the process preference did not correlate with native language, it did correlate with measures of product quality: i.e., the texts of pre-writers had greater lexical cohesion, and those of rewriters had fewer grammatical and spelling errors. Native language did correlate strikingly with a major rhetorical difference in the products, a difference apparently related to differing rhetorical expectations that seem to be culturally defined. Three suggestions are provided  for teachers of adult English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) students, including: (1) encourage formal pre-writing, even to the extent of offering a question-and-answer template to the fledgling writer; (2) force an awareness of audience and purpose in the business or technical writing process of ESL students; (3) urge ESL writers to focus on rhetorical structure during their rewriting.

Test results indicated no substantial differences in proficiency between the groups of students compared. There was, however, a slight but statistically insignificant tendency of the secondary school students to do better than the adults. Analysis of results by sex showed that female students achieved higher total scores than male students on one test, but lower on the  other. Females scored higher on essay portions of the test, whereas males tended to score higher on non-essay portions of the test. School leaving grades were higher for female students.

The program's primary goal was to help LEP students gain the listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills necessary to improve their performance in school. Thirty-four schools received services at mobile instruction units, 13 at nearby public schools, and 7 at leased sites. Fifteen schools received computer-assisted instruction (CAI) only; in some cases, CAI was combined with face-to-face instruction. Data from document reviews, test scores, site visits, interviews with staff, and analysis of responses to a teacher survey indicate that the program met its objectives for  both face-to-face and computer-assisted instruction (except for one writing subtest), with few differences found for the two modes of instruction. A variety of face-to-face and CAI teaching strategies were used. Recommendations include continued expansion of parent involvement programs, provision of face-to-face instruction for all ESL students, continued adaptation of software for situations where teachers are not present, adjustment in software companies' teacher training schedules, and investigation of the impact of lack of audio component at higher grade levels in ESL CAI.

First, models of normal and abnormal reading in English are described. The significance of these models for understanding the reading processes for other writing scripts, such as Malay and Chinese, are then considered. Data from a case study of a biscriptal Chinese/English-speaking boy with reading problems in English are then presented and explained with reference to the dual route reading model. The paper concludes by reviewing possible implications for educational assessment and reading remediation in the context of Singapore's  predominantly bilingual, biscriptal primary school population.

        "author":["Laurier, Michel"],
        "description":"Computerized adaptive testing for language teaching and learning takes advantage of two properties of the computer: its number-crunching and multiple-branching capabilities. Adaptive testing has also been called tailored testing because it aims at presenting items that suit the student's competence and that are informative, using an item bank and an algorithm for selecting items. The most widely used theoretical framework for these components is item response theory, which allows for the measurement of the trait that corresponds to the subject's ability. Creation of the item bank includes planning, field testing, item analysis, calibration, and item inclusion. Test bank management requires additional features for updating, importing items, listing items, and obtaining item  information. The item selection procedure estimates the examinee's ability after an answer and finds the next item that is most appropriate. Test administration involves gathering information about the examinee, a self-rating of general proficiency, and sub-tests using the item selection procedure. Results are available immediately, an advantage appreciated by examinees and administrators. The adaptive procedure allows for shorter tests, and the items are never too difficult or too easy. Limitations include the artificiality of the computer environment, restriction of answer type and test content, non-applicability for small-scale testing, the theoretical assumption of unidimensionality, and cost.

        "description":"Program results emerging from policy changes concerning identification and placement of limited-English-proficient (LEP) students in one school district are evaluated. The policy changes permitted students classified as bilingual, English-dominant, or English monolingual to be placed by committee in an appropriate instructional program (bilingual, English as a Second Language, or Language Arts Mastery Process), and provided for screening of these groups to determine whether they were LEP or educationally disadvantaged. The latter group would be provided compensatory or remedial services as needed. It was found that the achievement of LEP students in the Language Arts Mastery Program (LAMP) exceeded that of other groups, but other measures did not indicate any clear superiority of  one program over another. Of 122 students who would previously have been classified as LEP, 77 were determined not to be. Some formal process to assure that non-LEP, educationally disadvantaged students are given remedial help is seen as necessary. The committees were comfortable placing the students in the three programs. Where LAMP was combined with another program, schools felt the complementary approach was beneficial; however, some schools did not have LAMP programs. (Author/MSE)",

One solution is to encourage involvement in learning by having students write their own tests. For classroom tests used in formative evaluation, this approach can be applied to both group and individual work. A unit from an Israeli textbook and a unit on a short story illustrate the method. After reading the text and completing the accompanying exercises, the teacher reviews the unit with the class. The students' task is to discover what new material the unit contains and how it is presented and practiced, working in small groups. The groups are asked to choose what they think should be tested, and to write the test and answer key using the guidelines  provided. The teacher corrects the tests. If the exercise is used primarily for teaching, the tests can then be administered and corrected by the working groups. If the tests are used for grading, the teacher extracts the items to be included in the actual assessment. Where group work is not feasible, the same process may be followed with individuals. A similar procedure applies to writing tests for literary texts. (MSE)",

Subjects were 6 native American English speakers and 12 native Chinese-speakers, 6 using Chinese and 6 using English. Each language group was asked to discuss and come to agreement on aspects of a desert survival task. Collaborative interactions were transcribed and analyzed. Native English-speakers used much greater variety and complexity of conversational strategizing, revealed by analyzing contextualized language across the whole discourse event. This finding illustrates why more comprehensive models of language use in the classroom and  in textbooks are needed. Students need to see more examples of situationally appropriate uses of politeness and to be shown how they can argue a point persuasively through use of supporting explanation and justification, repetitious persistence, and other speaking strategies. Future research could explore whether the comparative simplicity of the Chinese groups' behavior is a general pattern and whether related problems arise when Chinese- and English-speakers interact.

        "description":"Current language policy planning in Ireland was examined as part of a larger study of the language behavior of groups with access or exposure to more than one language. Language can be seen as a resource to ethnic groups primarily in their competition for access to the goods and services of a nation. The norm for groups in prolonged contact is language shift, not maintenance or maintained group bilingualism. The tendency of ethnic groups in contact with a contemporary nation-state is to form four distinct types of social mobilization (ethnicity, ethnic movements, ethnic nationalism, and geographic nationalism) which under certain social conditions result in differential language maintenance and shift. In Ireland, language policy planning and language planning are both in place.  Language revitalization is a more recent concern. The Bord na Gaeilge, established in 1978 to promote Irish, has recommended seven strategies for reversing the shift to English: central planning; state and public leadership for real impact; expansion of networks and structures of usage; increasing Irish visibility; ensuring service through Irish in the Gaeltacht; new instructional syllabi and methods; and innovative communications. This paper argues, however, that these efforts are unrealistic and unlikely to be successful, and that Irish as a living language may eventually disappear. A 62-item bibliography is included. (MSE)",

The third section outlines and explains the project's activities, namely, creating a bibliography, networking, organizing colloquia, and promoting and undertaking research. Section 4  presents the nine specific questions that the project is attempting to study. These include the following: the teacher's concerns, the extent of the large class phenomenon, the reasons for the occurrence of large classes, attitudes towards large classes, data collection in large classes, the performance of large classes, strategies in large classes, language acquisition in large classes, and experiments in large classes. Section 5 summarizes and presents conclusions. (GLR)",

        "description":"Language testing is an area of applied linguistics that combines the exercise of professional judgment about language, learning, and the nature of the achievement of language learning with empirical data about student performance and, by inference, their abilities. The relationship between judgments and empirical data in language testing is examined through three studies. The first investigates language professionals' judgments about test content and the skills and abilities supposedly being tested by certain test items and compares them with test results and the attitudes of test-takers. The second study compares the judgments that experienced test writers and scorers make about item and test difficulty and compares them with item results. The third study gathers judgments from  language testers and teachers about standards of performance of a given population in a standard-setting exercise aimed at determining grade boundaries for a public examination. The implications of the findings are discussed. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"Language teachers have responded to the special pedagogical needs created by large language classes as they arise rather than addressing them comprehensively. This may result from both guilt about the relatively small size of even the large language classes, and fear that expression of concern might be mistaken for trying to find an excuse for teaching problems. Limited research evidence suggests that large classes are not interfering with learning achievement. Further empirical research is needed on language pedagogy and on greater extremes of class size. Four alternative interpretations of the issue of class size are available. These include the following: (1) class size is not a problem, just an excuse; (2) class size really is a problem, but not interesting enough; (3) class  size is a problem, but insoluble; or (4) class size is a problem, but a politically dangerous area to address pedagogically. It is wide open to imaginative research on both pedagogical and political aspects. The Lancaster-Leeds Language Learning in Large Classes Research Project evolved not to undertake research but to promote it. Its activities have involved discussion, development of a bibliography, design and administration of preliminary questionnaires, development of a mailing list, dissemination of research papers, and organization of awareness-raising events.

        "description":"Four surveys conducted in Japan investigated teacher and student attitudes about second language instruction in large classes. The first three surveys, conducted at a university and at secondary and university teacher seminars in three cities, elicited information concerning actual and preferred class size, institutional policies concerning class size, and perceived problems of teaching responsibilities relating to class size. The fourth survey asked university students about their experience with and attitudes toward class size. The &quot;average large class size&quot; experienced by most teachers was 45, over the size (39) at which problems are seen to arise and under the size (51) at which problems related to class size begin to occur. The average class size taught was 38, and the  average smallest class was 24, with the ideal at 19. Teachers appear to frequently teach classes they consider too large, but never too small. Related research is limited. Most students had experienced classes of 40-59 students, some much larger. Students preferred classes of 11-20. Policy for maximum size is seen as related to institutional financial considerations, but the law recommends restriction to under 50 students, with 40 students as the goal. Problems teachers encounter with large classes are pedagogical, managerial, and affective. Further research is recommended. The questionnaires are appended. (MSE)",

The first section is introductory. The second presents findings of a small-scale (n=46) investigation of the perceptions of native-speaking and non-native-speaking teachers of English as a Second Language (ESL) of the characteristics of large classes. The third section describes a larger study of ESL teachers' experiences with and perceptions of class size in Great Britain, Turkey, Indonesia, Madagascar, Mali, Japan, Greece, Jordan, and Spain. Section 4 discusses what the study tells about actual class sizes, and  section 5 is a detailed analysis of the relationship between teachers' experiences and their perceptions of class size. It is concluded that class size varies across countries and probably across institution type. No evidence that teachers share a universal conception of ideal class size was found, but there appeared to be a positive correlation between the largest class regularly taught and both perceptions of an ideal class and perceptions of what a large class is.

Classroom data are derived from experience in teaching German to Dutch-speaking university students. The analysis looks at the relationship of morphology and word recognition and retention, lack of attention given by second-language readers to word endings, and interference arising from lack of word contrast. Research on lexical access is examined for insights on such issues as the distinctions and relationships between mental lexicon, semantic memory, and common semantic or conceptual stores across languages. A distinction between semantic memory and mental lexicon is seen as necessary in explaining  interference from lack of word contrast, and this approach is further developed in the context of other research.

Signs used by nine different sources representing various locations, ages, and social groups are compared. The first section reviews a number of previous informal assessments of dialectal variation in MSL. The second section describes the study, in which individuals in five locations (two in Hermosillo, one in Cuernavaca, and two in Mexico City) were asked to provide signs for words from a list of 100. In addition, four published signing dictionaries were consulted. Identical, similar, and variant signs were then analyzed and compared with a similar analysis of the same 100 words with native English-speakers from the United States with  different accents. Results are interpreted in the third section. It is concluded that the majority of the evidence suggests MSL is a single language, at least for the signers and dictionaries sampled. The moderate amount of dialectal variation is seen as not hindering effective communication. Further research on mutual intelligibility is recommended. The greatest variation appeared in the Monterrey dialect sample; explanations are offered. Implications of the findings for language planning are discussed. (MSE)",

        "description":"Switch reference, in which certain clauses contain a signal indicating whether that clause has the same or a different subject, is examined in Mbya Guarani. It is found that most cases can be covered by a grammatical rule stated in terms of the grammatical subjects of the two clauses involved, yielding &quot;same subject&quot; and &quot;different subject&quot; markers. In sentences where this subject-related dichotomy is complex, switch-reference marking can instead be used to indicate facts of a semantic or pragmatic nature, such as whether the clauses have the same agent/topic or the same semantic type. These are considered marked uses of Mbya switch reference. Certain aspects of these uses can be described by rules similar to grammatical ones, but the description is essentially external,  depending on factors outside the formal system. Mbya switch reference is therefore one example of linguistic phenomena conditioned by grammatical features and amenable to description by grammatical rule, but only in the unmarked case. In marked modes of use, they are conditioned by extragrammatical factors. More specifically, Mbya switch reference is a &quot;fair-weather phenomenon&quot; whose marked uses are triggered by complexities arising with its unmarked use. Further questions arising from this analysis are discussed briefly. (MSE)",

A section is then devoted to generalizations and observations about double-object constructions. Two subsequent sections discuss non-personal objects producing an intransitive or a transitive  stem, respectively. In the case of transitive stems, situations producing both secondary objects and transitivity shifts are considered.

Survey questions addressed the following: (1) the quantity of time spent in school studying English and the other foreign languages concerned; (2) preferences for a first/second language; (3) adequacy of the English learned at school; (4) expected second language use in professional career; (5) languages used for communication with another Swiss with a different  native language; and (6) feelings about adoption of English as a lingua franca. Results show English is accepted as an additional language and a language for specific purposes. However, it is not yet accepted as a language for international communication despite the fact that its use in job-related and leisure-time domains makes it increasingly difficult to avoid in a multilingual setting.

The &quot;best&quot; tokens of three categories of potential assimilation (full, partial, and zero alveolar) were drawn from electropalatograms and recordings of sentences and recordings made by a linguistically naive speaker. These tokens were then transferred to a test tape and transcribed by 13 phoneticians, who provided a narrow transcription, lexical identification, and rating by category. Results suggest that identification of these tokens as alveolar or otherwise involves an extremely complex set of factors, including knowledge of the auditory  effects of different tongue gestures, differential vowel quality and length in different consonantial contexts, and dialect-specific allophonic differences. The task of transcription is seen as an inherently ambiguous task at several levels, and transcription without any kind of theory is not recommended. (MSE)",

It is argued that in some circumstances, when a speaker uses certain kinds of definite descriptions to refer to himself, he may be attempting to deter the hearer from attaching any beliefs or associations, connected to whoever or whatever is delimited by the definite description, to the speaker himself. How this is achieved is difficult to specify. Where the hearer is not motivated to seek a referentially specific entity, he may simply treat the description as generic or attributive and perceive any beliefs about the referring description in these terms, with the result that any conclusions  or inferences are not bound to any designated individual. Although the analysis is based on one example from political commentary, the behavior is commonplace. Research on the occurrence of such situations, and on speaker interpretations, are seen as supporting this approach. (MSE)",

        "description":"A study examined lexical density in interviews and conversation with the same subjects. Sixteen undergraduate and graduate students, members of religious, political, and/or cultural societies at Aston University (England), were interviewed in pairs by the university chaplain, who knew them. Immediately following each interview, the chaplain left the two students to converse freely. The pairs were already friends. Analysis of the students' language use found that while the lexical density was different in the two situations for graduate students, with the density higher for the interview, undergraduate students performed comparably on this variable in both settings. Accommodation theory appears to be applicable to the lexical level of linguistic control. Further investigation of  the differences in skill and/or sensitivity at the lexical level is recommended. Eight possible sources of variation are identified, including: bases for calculating lexical density; expected interruption and length of speaking turn; function of component units of text; self-consciousness/self-monitoring; personal attributes; group attributes; planning time; and topic. It is suggested that these variables be controlled in future research. (MSE)",

Assuming the familiar concept that linguists should construct the simplest analysis compatible with a phenomenon, it is suggested that some children construct a simplest analysis of such utterances as inevitably containing &quot;of,&quot; using a grammar allowing such a structure. Evidence supporting such a structure comes from such constructions as the infinitive, where the word &quot;to,&quot; a word with certain unambiguously prepositional functions, occurs (&quot;to do&quot;). If the learner eventually acquires standard English and demonstrates this by writing &quot;must have been,&quot; he has replaced this earlier grammatical guesswork with a structure more  normally and traditionally considered appropriate for the mature standard dialect.

        "description":"A discussion of autosegmental phonology (AP), a theory of phonological representation that uses graphs rather than strings as the central data structure, considers its principal constraint, the &quot;No Crossing Constraint&quot; (NCC). The NCC is the statement that in a well-formed autosegmental diagram, lines of association may not cross. After an introductory section, the syntax and semantics of autosegmental representations are considered, and a few important basic definitions and principles of graph theory are introduced. In section 3, two claims are examined, including: the claim that the NCC restricts the class of representations in planar and non-planar AP; and the belief of some proponents of three-dimensional AP that the necessity of non-planar representations has been  demonstrated. Finally, some data exemplifying a number of interacting harmonies in Guyanese English that are amenable only to non-planar representation are presented. It is concluded that the NCC is invalid because it either incorrectly restricts the class of phonological graphs to planar graphs or else carries no force. (MSE)",

The hypotheses were that: (1) people rely on the configurational properties of sentences in relative clause (RC) processing; and (2) people rely on the grammatical roles of the noun phrases involved in relativization in RC processing. The first experiment used a comprehension task to test native speakers of Spanish, a VO language, learning Basque, an OV language. The results provide strong support for the idea that the configurational properties of sentences play a crucial role in language processing, as opposed to the idea that it is the grammatical relations holding between elements of a sentence that affect the relative difficulty of processing . The second experiment tested native speakers of  English, a VO language, learning Spanish, another VO language. This experiment, while failing to provide support for either hypothesis, raised an interesting theoretical issue: that when parameters have to be reset in the second language learning, acquisition is hindered considerably.

        "description":"Full verbs and auxiliaries are subject to gapping. In the simplest cases, this construction type involves apparent ellipsis within one or more clausal conjuncts under identity with the finite verb or auxiliary of a preceding conjunct. It has often been suggested that the apparent ellipsis must involve at least a verb. Some researchers see in the ellipsis of both full verbs and auxiliaries in this construction support for the claim that they belong to a wider category &quot;verb.&quot; However, there is evidence for the argument that this analysis is wrong, and that there are straightforward cases of gapping that do not include a verb or auxiliary. It can be concluded that: (1) gapping may occur in conjoined &quot;small clause&quot; constructions and exclamative clauses, where the ellipsis crucially  includes a noun, adjective, adverb, or preposition, suggesting that auxiliaries are not necessarily verbs; and (2) instead, gapping seems to involve an ellipsis that crucially includes a semantic factor or an item that corresponds to a head of an antecedent conjunction or of its major predicate, supporting the view that auxiliaries are heads.

Through the interview process, personal account data were gathered during two-hour sessions. It became clear that women in academe were more sensitive to enhancing the personal development of junior colleagues than women in business. Women in the business world focused primarily on the development of proteges' careers and to a lesser extent on the psychosocial functions of mentoring. Women in business became more like the dominant male group and  abandoned feminine caretaking or nurturing qualities. There was also little evidence that women mentors in business or academe protected their proteges, took responsibility for mistakes outside the proteges' control, or acted as buffers.

C. Ringenberg in 1984. Analysis of available information from the history of Willamette has led to the conclusion that the institution is secular as seen through Ringenberg's characteristics of secularization, yet Willamette is not deemed a good case study of Ringenberg's secularization model because (1) there was an early emphasis on non-sectarianism; (2) there has never been a recognized effort to secure a faculty that entirely  professed the Christian faith; and (3) there has been an ebb and flow involving its mission declarations, the importance placed on the Bible and Christianity in the curriculum, and budget decisions related to Christian programming. Despite this mismatch, Ringenberg is felt to have provided a valuable checklist for those church-related colleges which are concerned about becoming increasingly secular in curriculum, lifestyle, and reputation.

        "description":"Statewide coordinating agencies are examined concerning their role in determining whether or not to establish new institutions, branch campuses, or professional schools, as well as in deciding which institutions to reallocate or eliminate and which research and public service activities to institute. The historical background and purpose of statewide coordinating agencies is also described. The question is raised as to whose viewpoint the agency really represents, the institution's or the state government's, and it is suggested that if it is not to be merely a capricious and arbitrary decision making body, it could represent the best interest of both parties. The coordinating agency, it is argued, cannot afford to be just a rubber stamp organization that merely approves every new  proposal for an institution that is proposed by the state government and higher education. Rather, by considering each proposal on its own merit, the statewide coordinating agency will assure each body involved that the decision it reaches will be both fair and unbiased.

Principle findings of the investigation concern the higher interst costs to the borrower that are brought about by longer payment plans and the fact that the government's subsidy costs will increase because of loan consolidation. Several options are presented for the Congress to consider for changing the program in order to reduce the government's costs. The Department of Education and four of the five lenders providing data for review also provided written comments on a draft of the report; the lenders also provided technical comments. Appendices include a description of the methodology used to eliminate consolidated  loan costs as well as default statistics, a list of lenders, and information related to reducing the subsidy costs.

The investigation's objectives were to: (1) identify any differences between the states' endorsement requirements for graduates of foreign medical schools and for graduates of U.S. medical schools; and (2) determine the reasons for and merits of any differences. The investigation revealed that the states had no uniform standards or requirements to determine competence and that most states had different endorsement requirements for graduates of foreign and U.S. medical schools. The American Medical Association, the Federation of  State Medical Boards, and directors of state medical licensing boards were found to disagree with organizations representing foreign school graduates on the merits of different requirements related to documentation of educational background. Despite the differences of opinion, it was agreed by all concerned that different examination requirements for foreign medical school graduates have no merit and that it would be desirable to have a clearinghouse to maintain and verify records to help eliminate states' duplicative verification efforts and streamline the licensing process.

        "description":"A proposal written by a group of economists suggests investing a portion of the Social Security surplus in a revolving loan fund designed to enable American students and workers to finance their own post-secondary education, vocational training, or re-training. The plan would make available to every American a line of credit to finance the costs of college or university education, or vocational training, or apprenticeship programs. Under the program, loans would be available to all students, middle-class and poor students alike, and would be paid back by means of a levy on future earnings to be collected by the Internal Revenue Service through payroll deductions. Up to a lifetime total limit of $40,000 would be available for tuition, fees, and living expenses for students at  accredited colleges, universities, or licensed training schools. Borrowers could take up to 25 years to repay their loans. An income adjustment plan would grade repayments depending on income level. The claim is made that, across all participants in the system, the combination of increasing income, IRS collection of loan repayments, and long repayment schedules will result in full repayment to the Social Security system.

It relates them to the decisions faced by states as they implement the Jobs Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS) Training Programs mandated by the Federal Family Support Act of 1988, which must be structured to meet the needs of recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). The following findings are reported: (1) changes in the workforce affect job prospects of AFDC recipients; (2) employment programs are not equally effective for all participants; (3) more intensive services are required for those with greater barriers to employment; (4) interagency cooperation can provide more intensive services; (5) employment programs for two-parent families are not effective;  and (6) voluntary programs can be effective. While changes in the workforce in the next decade will likely improve the job prospects of many workers, those with less education and poor skills may be left out, so states may find it advantageous to exceed the minimum requirements of the Family Support Act in the following service areas: (1) basic literacy; (2) postsecondary education; (3) intensive education and training programs; (4) job placements that provide long-term economic security; and (5) early program implementation.

Specifically, the study sought to identify existing legal entanglements, from both state and local policy sources, that resulted in the denial of a free, appropriate public education to these students. In addition, remedies to these problems are analyzed and recommendations made to alleviate their recurrence. Section 1 includes the following parts: (1) &quot;Incidence of Homelessness&quot;; (2) &quot;Definitions of Homelessness&quot;; and (3) &quot;Federal Legislation for the Homeless.&quot; Section 2 presents the methodology of the study, which included a survey of homeless service providers and public school officials and a case law  review. Section 3 discusses the results of the survey and the case law review, which included an exploration of cases specifically involving residence and guardianship requirements as barriers to education. The study found that the educational provisions of the McKinney Homeless Assistance Act are essentially non-regulatory, relying on meager funding to motivate states to confront the problems of educating homeless children and youth. In addition, since future funding is uncertain, advocates for the homeless may have the greatest impact by focusing their efforts on state legislatures and state education agencies to remove or minimize the residency and guardianship barriers to education.

Chapter 1 is an introduction and summary of the paper. Chapter 2, \"Dimensions of the Problem,\" covers the following topics: (1) household incomes and housing location; (2) housing expenditures and affordability; and (3) suburban housing opportunities. Chapter 3 \"Addressing the Problem,\" covers housing policy matrix and designing a metropolitan strategy. Section 4, \"Keys to Understanding the Problem Better,\" covers the following topics: (1) availability of affordable housing; (2) location of affordable housing; (3) minority access to affordable housing; and (4) summary. This analysis  demonstrates that serious problems of excessive cost and lingering discrimination discourage poor and working class minorities from gaining access to affordable housing opportunities in the suburbs. Moreover, these problems appear to prevail in most U.S. metropolitan areas. However, the composition and causes of these problems vary substantially from one metropolitan area to another. Thus, solutions must be tailored to the metropolitan context, and must be supported by thorough analyses of local patterns of housing affordability and availability. Seven tables, six figures, and one matrix are presented. A list of 10 references is included. Operational definitions of income classes and affordability standards are appended. (JS)",

The NESNP-II data represent the only extensive examination of the NSLP and SBP since passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1981, which enacted a number of significant program reforms including the following changes: (1) a reduction in the reimbursement rates for paid and reduced-price meals; (2) tightened income eligibility requirements; (3) simplified program rules; and (4) increased verification requirements. Thus, an  examination of the participants would highlight the changes resulting from OBRA. A description of the NSLP and SBP as they operated in the school year 1983-84 is presented.

The following major program objectives are discussed in this report: (1) to conduct a field survey in each school to gather information on specific problems and needs regarding Asian American students; (2) to conduct a 15- to 30-minute presentation and discussion based on needs identified by the field survey for 40 to 200 personnel at 30 schools; and (3) to provide follow-up activities based on the information gathered at the workshop  and to provide crisis intervention, mediation, parent networking, and translation services upon request. Evaluation methodology is briefly discussed. The evaluation indicates that all of the program's primary objectives were met, except for attendance. There was no available data to assess the attendance objective of the 40 to 200 participants per school. Most workshop participants rated the sessions well-organized, but indicated that the opportunity for question-and-answer interaction was sometimes limited. Participants gave high ratings to the workshops in terms of their usefulness and information. Recommendations for improving this program are discussed. (JS)",

The following strategies are discussed: (1) curriculum and instruction intervention; (2) social and support services; (3) staff development; (4) world-of-work experiences; (5) collaboration with other agencies; and (6) district leadership. This paper also questions whether the current \"state of the art\" thinking about youth at risk is enough to meet the challenge these students provide. The following areas of particular concern are discussed: (1) lack of information on outcomes, use of data, program  evaluation, and student monitoring; and (2) lack of coordination of at-risk programs and strategies with links to school curricular and social support programs. Finally, this paper examines secondary school characteristics and their impact on at-risk youth, and suggests a framework for thinking about restructuring schools for academic success and achievement for all students. The following topics are discussed concerning this issue: (1) time; (2) curriculum; (3) pedagogy; (4) staffing; (5) location; (6) social organization of instruction; (7) social control; and (8) school-family interaction.

        "description":"Growing income disparities between wealthy Americans and those in low or moderate income brackets are contributing to a widening income gap between rural and urban areas. Proposed federal tax policy changes would primarily benefit upper income brackets and would likely widen the gap further. An analysis of census data indicates that since the early 1970s, the income gaps between rich and poor families and between rich and middle income families have widened considerably. Since a disproportionately large number of wealthy Americans live in cities, the income gap between rural and urban areas is also widening. The rural-urban impact of the following proposed tax policies that redistribute income upward are examined: (1) reduction of the capital gains tax, which would almost  exclusively benefit urban residents; (2) expanded eligibility for tax-deductible contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), which would also go to urban taxpayers, causing significant revenue losses that would eventually have to be financed by tax increases or spending cuts; and (3) establishment of the Family Savings Account plan, which would also cause a transfer in income from rural to urban areas. These three proposals would provide little to the middle three-fifths of taxpayers and almost nothing to the poorest fifth but would benefit the wealthiest fifth; thus residents of urban areas would stand to benefit substantially more than their rural counterparts. Statistical data are included on one graph and three tables. A separate press release summarizing the report is  also included. A form for ordering related publications is appended. (FMW)",

The 146.4-curriculum hour program also included job readiness skills. The Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills (CBTS) and an employment skills test were used as a pretests and posttests. Analysis of test scores and student demographic data yielded the following major findings: (1) on average, a client  who attended the entire program increased the number of instructional objectives mastered by 25 percent; (2) overall, 58 percent of the clients demonstrated a gain of at least one grade level in at least one of the three curricular areas; (3) of the 117 participants, 75 percent were Black, 15 percent were White, 7 percent were Asian, and three clients had Spanish surnames; (4) 72 percent of the participants attended at least 34 of the 39 days of the remediation program; and (5) about 30.5 percent of the participants achieved the target employment test skills.

Regression analyses were fitted to annual data to isolate factors responsible for changes in relative earnings. National and regional data on population growth and employment growth by industry were analyzed to determine the degree of spatial mismatch between jobs and workers. The following main conclusions are reported: (1) little evidence was found of a largescale upward trend in relative earnings operating over the entire period from the early 1950s through 1987; (2) relative earnings gains since the early 1950s occurred largely in one period, between the mid-1960s and the mid-1970s; (3) unlike many earlier studies that found positive effects from the unemployment rate  or deviations from the level of resource utilization on relative earnings, this analysis did not find significant effects from the unemployment rate or deviations of actual output from full employment output; and (4) there was significant evidence that accelerated declines since 1969 in the share of jobs located in seven large northern states and in heavy industries have acted to reduce black men's relative earnings by as much as 18 percent in 1986 and 1987, with average overall losses of nine percent or less.

        "description":"This study examined the effects of specific motivational dimensions and self-perceptions of a group of 47 urban black fourth and fifth grade students on attendance and academic achievement. Each student's responses to a measure of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and a self-perception inventory were compared to each other and to his or her attendance record and scores on the vocabulary, reading, and mathematics subtests of the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS). The following conclusions are discussed: (1) many students displayed a lack of intrinsic motivation, relying on teacher leadership in the classroom; (2) general feelings of self-worth were related to perceptions of their physical appearance and athletic ability and not to perceptions of their behavior or their scholastic  competence; (3) those students who preferred challenge had more positive perceptions their scholastic ability but more negative perceptions concerning of their social acceptance; and (4) attendance and academic achievement were not correlated, but those students who had better perceptions of their scholastic competence had better attendance, whereas students who were more independent in their judgments were more likely to have poorer attendance. The findings suggest that schools could enhance the self-image of black elementary school students by using challenging obtainable goals and objectives, encouraging self-directed learning, encouraging self-evaluation, and by becoming more knowledgeable about black culture. Statistical data are included on 16 tables, four diagrams, and one graph. A  list of 26 references is appended. (FMW)",

The program combined two main components: (1) a high-interest curriculum based on a mini-school setting which focuses on a hands-on approach to architecture and the urban environment; and (2) the provision of extensive social services to students and their parents. The following topics are discussed concerning the program and its implementation: (1) student selection; (2) program components;  (3) the Salvadori Program, which offers an architecture and engineering curriculum; (4) guidance services; (5) community service and student stipend activities; (6) parent involvement and education; (7) staff development; and (8) summer program. This report provides an evaluation of both program implementation and outcomes based on the first six months of its existence. The following findings are discussed: (1) the mean attendance rate for the students in the program remained stable; and (2) students improved their reading scores more than would be expected over a year's time.

        "description":"Evaluations of compensatory education programs provided under Chapter 1 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act (ECIA) indicate that the traditional provision of a less challenging curriculum, limited achievement goals, and emphasis on pull-out programs for compensatory instruction actually hamper the ability of low-achieving students to develop critical thinking skills, lower their learning expectations, and stigmatize them as inferior. Because of a lack of coordination between regular and compensatory education classes, Chapter 1 students end up with less instructional time than other students, and the reading skills teaching they receive is not related to other learning and study areas. Chapter 1's emphasis on mastery learning techniques that may improve  standardized test scores fails to help students learn how to work independently and develop cognitive strategies. Disadvantaged students continue to be taught relatively low-level reading skills that do not transfer to the higher-level knowledge and skills that comprise literacy. Remedial mathematics programs have been criticized for fragmenting the curriculum into enrichment programs, differential programs, and developmentally based programs rather than emphasizing the interdependence of ideas and the use of reasonable procedures to arrive at an answer. Disadvantaged students need access to a sound core curriculum that is as rich and balanced as that provided to high achieving students. (FMW)",

        "description":"A number of factors put pressure on schools to work more closely with health, social service, and other youth-serving institutions but poor communications, program redundancies, fear for job security, and concerns about parent and community support for controversial services inhibit close collaboration. Recent successful collaborative school, health, and social service programs at the federal and local level have renewed interest in school-human services linkages. Schools are the natural focus for combined services because every child must attend school, but school organization proves problematic for service professionals. Most efforts at improving collaboration have focused on improving bureaucratic cooperation. The following characteristics are associated with successful  locally developed programs. They: (1) offer a wide array of direct services or serve as entry to those comprehensive services; (2) move beyond crisis management and early intervention and focus on prevention and development; (3) cross professional and bureaucratic boundaries; (4) provide staff time, training, and skills needed to build relationships of trust and respect; (5) hire a staff member from the local community to serve as a facilitator; (6) involve both parents and teachers in communications; (7) deal with the child as part of a family, and the family as part of the community; and (8) provide accountability, with creative and meaningful measures. Because collaborations still focus on bureaucracies, integrated youth policies must be developed that focus on the individual needs of  the student. (FMW)",

        "description":"An ongoing empirical study is being conducted of the professional socialization of Kentucky's state public administrators. The study proposes two measurable attitudinal latent traits: orientation to public service professionalism and political acuity. Relationships among independent, intervening, and dependent variables include education/training, agency culture, demographic attributes, and public service values. A sample of 3,000 Kentucky public managers (1,500 with and 1,500 without management training) received a six-page questionnaire; 1,497 usable responses were returned (a 49 percent response). Empirical findings suggest some positive associations between the professional socialization indicators and public service values. Training and age were found to affect reported  levels of political acuity but not professionalism. Reported levels of political acuity affected attitudes toward the merit system and services to clients, whereas professionalism level influenced all four service value attitudes. The data suggest that, as political acuity increases, it tends to cause increases in professionalism, even though these traits were found to be statistically independent. (The report includes 49 tables, the questionnaire, an agenda of a management awareness workshop, a sample management newsletter, and a 331-item bibliography.) (KC)",

        "description":"Because the changing demographics of the U.S. work force are making cultural diversity the rule rather than the exception, the skills necessary for people to work in a multicultural environment are becoming a natural employment requirement. Those skills are integral to the tool that is called cross-cultural/intercultural/multicultural communication. The central principle of cross-cultural communication theory is that everything one does and everything one perceives is filtered through one's cultural knowledge. Misunderstandings, hurt feelings, and general ill will usually result when one culture's knowledge is used as the base for interacting with staff, employees, clients, or customers from other, different cultures. Cross-cultural communication provides a way to know what to  expect and how to interact when one lives or works with people from other cultures. Cross-cultural communication is essential in the workplace because the new job seekers will come from many cultures and the future will be a job seekers' market. Potential employees will want to work where they feel the most comfortable and the most valued. Cross-cultural training requires a strong long-term commitment on the part of employers, whether they employ in-house trainers or consultants. (CML)",

Specifically, the report looks at four areas: (1) the need for education for work (the need for post-high school but less than college education), one of the few education components that is not well funded or supported; (2) suggestions for improvement, such as more competition between local schools, tighter eligibility, more intensive services, and more linkages between local agencies; (3) making education for work happen--coordination that includes understanding the resources  available and the final goal, education for work that focuses on basic skills needed for employment, and understanding the barriers; and (4) the large number of federal programs serving JTPA-eligible populations (vocational education, adult education, and secondary/elementary education) with limited funding. Appendixes to the report include a summary of HR7--the Applied Technology Education Amendments of 1989; a list of educational programs, regional contacts, and the administration's fiscal year 1990 budget proposal; the Louisville, Kentucky, partnership student contracts and curriculum; and a list of national clearinghouses.

          "And Others"],
        "description":"A developmental study explored appropriate teaching and learning strategies for providing education about leisure activities and economic activities to the unemployed in Southampton, England. Developing a curriculum with unwaged adults was found to involve contact-outreach, negotiation, establishing an educational infrastructure, the learning experience itself, learner support and follow-up, evaluation, and integration. The study recommended that developers be clear about sociopolitical aims; foster individual autonomy by helping unwaged adults investigate and understand the social and economic context of unemployment; be clear about what the institution can offer; suggest educational starting points for the adult; and take into account the adult's skills and experience.  Providing education for leisure activities was found to have little meaning for many unwaged women and unemployed people in general. Coping activities may be more meaningful. Some learning activities, such as the development of hobbies, were found to require individual help. When trying to help adults create economic opportunities, the developer should plan on a first, exploratory and student-centered stage of student self-assessment, confidence-building and investigating what a business is and how it works. The second, more technical stage will help the student study the details of bookkeeping and other aspects of business. (The document concludes with recommendations for institutions, collaboration contracts involved in the study, a list of elements of good practice, and 27 references.)  (CML)",

A department must be willing to invest time necessary to establish links with multiethnic faculty, staff, and student leaders if it is to create an environment attractive to multiethnic students. Cooperative education staff charged with outreach to multiethnic groups must get involved with students, get to know them, and encourage them to be different and to pursue opportunities that are new. A multiethnic outreach effort with a step-by-step market research and action program is needed. The key factor in effective efforts to reach multiethnic students is the ability to recognize and value the uniqueness of  these individuals and to demonstrate positive response to this uniqueness. There are no instant solutions to attracting multiethnic students to participation in cooperative education. Successful marketing efforts require time, creativity, and a trial and error approach.

The study concluded that: (1) job descriptions and training manuals were not reliable indicators of literacy requirements, but observation and interviews were; (2) entry-level manufacturing job literacy requirements vary according to the extent to which traditional assembly line work is being modified to a production team approach; (3) traditional assembly line work entails few job literacy tasks and minimal calculations; (4) quality control, the use of  team approaches, the introduction of job rotation, and statistical process control procedures increase literacy requirements; (5) the jobs of entry-level dietary department workers and laboratory assistants in hospitals tend to be defined by the availability of skilled entry-level workers and by the need to cut the cost of professional salaries or to address a shortage of professional workers; (6) the complexity of menu-driven software and the use of technology also influenced the level of difficulty of those jobs; (7) employers do not always have the information they need to set hiring criteria; and (8) workplace literacy skills are different from those in academic settings because they are usually repetitive, performed cooperatively, and driven by procedural knowledge or oral  instructions rather than written directions.

The content of the guide flows directly from program administrators, practitioners, case managers, and others in the field, gathered at workshops in case management conducted around the country. The first section of the guide is an overview of case management, including definitions and suggestions for effective case management. Its theme is that case management must occur on both the client level and the institutional level. The balance of the guide is organized in two parts. The first half focuses on client-centered interventions. It discusses what a case manager does  with each young person and reviews how a case manager helps youth identify, gain timely access to, and successfully complete an individualized, coordinated set of services provided by a variety of institutions. The second half of the guide focuses on institutional agreements. It shows that client-centered activities will not succeed unless institutions develop formal interagency agreements that define new ways in which they will work together. It investigates how case managers operate across institutional boundaries and how communities can authorize case managers to requisition services. (KC)",

        "description":"A study evaluated the cacao farmer training program in the Dominican Republic by testing hypothesized relationships among reactions, knowledge and skills, attitudes, aspirations, and some selected demographic characteristics of farmers who attended programs. Bennett's hierarchical model of program evaluation was used as the framework of the study. Target population consisted of 510 male regional cacao farmers. A sample of 200 farmers was selected, and 160 completed interviews by researchers. The study found that most farmers had participated in the program one or two times, almost all had favorable reactions to it and high perceptions of knowledge and skills gained, as well as high intentions to apply knowledge and skills. The study also found that older farmers had a more  negative attitude toward information given, whereas a small positive correlation was found between favorable reaction to the program and perception of skills gained. The study concluded that Bennett's model was a coherent framework for this type of research and that the study course should continue with modifications designed to facilitate high involvement of course participants.

Chapter 1 describes the scope of the study that resulted in the document and defines both literacy and educational technology. Chapter 2 contains a generalized set of questions that can be asked about any educational technology and that provide a framework for evaluating educational technology. Chapter 3 describes the use of educational technology in adult literacy programs in Australia. Descriptions of the technologies in use are included for print media, audio material supporting print material, radio, video and television, subtitling, computers, drill and practice, simulation programs, word  processing, word and text manipulation, story programs, databases, computer peripherals, teleconferencing, optical laser discs, CD-ROM, videodisc, and hypermedia. Chapters 4-9 present case studies of the use of technology in particular literacy programs. Chapter 10 describes computer software programs that are appropriate for use in adult literacy classes. Chapter 11 is devoted to an exploration of the uses of HyperCard and HyperStory in adult literacy learning. Chapter 12 considers emerging issues and the potential of using educational technologies in adult literacy education. The document concludes with 121 references. (CML)",

The following actions should be taken: (1) the government should fund a research project that will evaluate workplace efficiency outcomes for employers who have participated in the Workplace Basic Education Project (WBEP) of the Council of Adult Education (CAE); (2) the government's development of a national languages policy should clarify the different as well as overlapping training needs for industry; (3) employers and unions should be encouraged to identify the literacy, English language, and basic education skills for each broad-banded classification or production-related skill; (4) Technical and Further Education (TAFE)  should be required to develop award classifications for courses in the areas of literacy and numeracy, English skills, and basic education; (5) the use of literacy and numeracy assessment of workers should remain on a confidential and voluntary basis until the issues related to job selection, job security, and work satisfaction in the use of literacy assessment are resolved between employers and unions; and (6) the government should fund CAE to develop train the trainers curriculum and training programs for tutors in workplace literacy and basic education programs.

        "description":"Market research, important for professional renewal, is a critical part of continuing education program planning. It includes attention to learning needs and learner motivation to participate in continuing education. Informal market research makes use of internal sources, such as enrollment data, program evaluations, policy statements, and staff members and volunteers; and external sources, such as other program providers, professional development activities, and market research literature. Formal market research with individuals includes surveys, the Delphi technique, face-to-face interviews, and telephone interviews. Group research techniques include the nominal group and the focus group. Philosophy of education, personal preferences, and the work environment influence market  research. The steps in executing market research are as follows: (1) decide what to research; (2) consider the resources available; (3) determine the best time to do research; (4) choose a market research approach; (5) recruit people to help; (6) develop a preliminary plan for the research; (7) develop a budget; (8) plan how to use the data; (9) collect and analyze the data; and (10) use the data to make decisions.

        "description":"The at-risk students served by vocational education include academically disadvantaged students, dropouts, students with limited English proficiency (LEP), pregnant teens, single parents, migrants, economically disadvantaged students, handicapped students, and potential dropouts. The claim that the U.S. economy is healthy because unemployment is relatively low hides the radical job market changes of recent years, the dilemma of one-parent families, and the growing number of working poor. Between 1973 and 1986, young families lost over one-quarter of their real income and fared far worse than any other age group. Although all young families earned less, minority and female-headed families fared far worse. Between 1967 and 1986, the poverty rate of young families almost doubled.  Among students enrolled in North Carolina vocational programs, 49 percent of disadvantaged students, 56 percent of handicapped students, and 53 percent of LEP students say these programs are a main reason they remained in high school. After graduation, the 1989 unemployment rate of disadvantaged students who completed vocational programs in North Carolina was 8 percent, as compared with a rate of 12.3 percent for youth aged 16-19 statewide. Vocational education in North Carolina offers support services, specialized assessment, special cooperative education and work study programs, job placement services, and programs for pregnant and parenting teenagers. Ideas that work to keep at-risk students in school include incentives (fast food coupons, school supplies, and field trips), tutoring,  self-esteem building efforts, role models and mentors, and parental involvement.

        "description":"An investigation was made of the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986, which requires employers to verify employment eligibility of workers and imposes civil and criminal penalties against employers who knowingly hire unauthorized workers. The study reviewed federal agency implementation of IRCA, reviewed discrimination complaints filed with federal agencies and data from groups representing aliens, and used additional methods to obtain data on IRCA's effects. The other methods included a statistically valid survey of more than 9,400 employers and a hiring audit in which pairs of persons (one a &quot;foreign-sounding, foreign-appearing&quot; Hispanic and one an Anglo with no foreign accent) who matched closely on job qualifications applied for jobs with 360 employers in 2  cities. The study found that the IRCA: (1) has apparently reduced illegal immigration and is not an unnecessary burden on employers; (2) has generally been carried out satisfactorily by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Department of Labor; and (3) has not been used as a vehicle to launch frivolous complaints against employers. The study also found that widespread discrimination was a result of the IRCA: many employers discriminated because the law's verification system does not provide a simple or reliable method to verify job applicants' eligibility to work. The discrimination would be reduced if employers were provided with more education on the law's requirements and a simpler, more reliable verification system.

JTPA Title III provides funds to states for programs tailored to the specific needs of workers who have been laid off or who have received notice of layoff as a result of a mass reduction in force or the permanent closure of a plant or facility. EDWAA was enacted, to replace Title III, in 1988. Changes brought about by EDWAA include new allocation procedures, the establishment of state rapid response teams, and increased emphasis on skill training. Among the  findings of this report were the following: (1) despite differences in the amounts of funds allotted for Title III, state expenditures were relatively consistent for 1985-87, averaging about $185.6 million per year; (2) in 1988 the amount spent jumped by 43 percent--from $172.4 million in 1987 to $246.5 million in 1988--after EDWAA was enacted and limited the amount of formula-allotted funds that can be carried over from one year to the next; (3) as states increased their spending for dislocated worker assistance, the cost per participant increased by 28 percent--from an average of $940 in 1987 to $1,200 in 1988; (4) 11 states spent more than 10 percent of their 1988 allocation for activities to facilitate implementation of changes in dislocated worker assistance brought about by EDWAA;  (5) some states received a much higher proportion of discretionary funds, allotted by the Secretary of Labor, than the proportion of funds allocated to them by formula.

        "description":"The purpose of a review of course materials and teaching methods in the area of adult development and learning was to identify commonalities that existed in course titles, objectives, content areas, texts, required reading, resources used, course requirements, and instructional processes. Thirty-two course syllabi and 1 curriculum guide from 24 institutions of higher learning in 17 states and 2 Canadian provinces were reviewed. Some form of &quot;The Adult Learner&quot; or &quot;Adult Learning&quot; was used as the course title for 22 syllabi. Only two courses used the title &quot;Adult Development and Learning.&quot; All 32 syllabi had some form of course description, but only 16 reported a clearly stated course purpose. Twenty-eight syllabi offered objectives and competencies to be mastered. Three major  divisions of course content emerged from the course descriptions: emphasis on adult development concepts, theories and concepts of adult learning, and instructional methodologies. Twelve syllabi indicated a balanced combination of both theory and practice, with eight placing heavy emphasis on theory and seven emphasizing practice. Twelve courses had traditional academic assignments, 10 had assignments that blended theory and practice, and 6 had applied assignments. Twenty-eight different books were cited as texts, with the most frequently cited one being listed seven times. (A 28-page bibliography on adult learning and development is included with the report.)

The level of educational investment was 7.5 percent of the gross national product (GNP), with 10.5 percent of the investment in adult education. Adult education in Sweden consists of study circles, folk high schools or residential colleges for adults, adult basic education, municipal adult education, Swedish for immigrants, labor market education, trade union education, inservice training, distance education, and special provisions for disabled adults. Some 50 percent of Swedes participate in adult education, with half of the participation in inservice training and staff development programs. The volume of  employer-sponsored programs increased 5.7 percent between 1986 and 1987 when measured by days of education and 3 percent when measured by number of participants. Swedes with more formal education participate more in adult education. (The report includes a discussion of policy alternatives, 58 references, a reprint of a government report on the education and training of the labor force in 1986 and 1987, and a reprint of a working draft of a paper from the Swedish National Board of Education, &quot;Assessing Invisible Colleges: Comments on the Evaluation of Human Resource Development Investments.&quot;) (CML)",

Data were collected from October 1988 through April 1989 through interviews with 49 program officials; 2 site visits; a mail survey; a telephone survey; a log of inquiry activity; and available information on budget, workload, and other program statistics. Findings showed that the VA's approach to administering the Chapter 30 program was generally appropriate. The VA was most successful in meeting basic program objectives, such as verification of eligibility of veterans, payment of benefits, and monitoring of veterans to ensure they remain eligible. Areas of less effectiveness included the accuracy, timeliness, and cost-effectiveness of  benefit processing and the dissemination of Chapter 30 information to veterans. Among the recommendations were the following: development of a management information system; development of an online, interactive facility database; development of an automated database for Chapter 30 circulars and other procedural information; development of easy-to-understand materials for Chapter 30 application and monthly certification; and development of general materials for veterans on Chapter 30 eligibility, application, and information sources.

The first section of the book is a mixture of exercises and tips on types of learning (memorizing, understanding, and doing) and learning methods for each. The next section offers help on how trainers can help learners to overcome complacency, fear, and disinterest about learning and to become independent learners. Trainers are encouraged to undertake five stages (write learning objectives after task analysis, analyze tasks for difficulty, select training methods to match the kind of  learning required, plan a training session, and present the session), and the document includes exercises so that most stages can be practiced. Other exercises help trainers think about how to widen the range of experience they are able to give their learners and how they can make the most effective use of their time. The document concludes with tips on how trainers can encourage continuous assessment of their sessions, a list of the 10 commandments of good listening, a summary, and a 9-item bibliography. (The 10 commandments are: do not talk, help the speaker to relax, express a will to listen, keep away distractions, relate to the speaker, have patience, use self-control, ask questions, tolerate silences, and--again--do not talk!)

The document concludes with a summary of good instructional practice and appendices that describe a study of instructor effectiveness, an explanation of methods to help prevent errors in what is to be learned, a quiz that asks readers when they would correct particular kinds of errors frequently made by trainees, and answers to the quiz.

Those areas are: (1) deciding whether training is needed; (2) analyzing the job; (3) identifying learning outcomes; (4) identifying what trainees need to learn; and (5) considering constraints and the needs of trainees. Section 3 leads the reader through the selection of  training approaches by describing nine approaches (presentation, presentation-discussion, group discussion-task, project group work, team training, discovery learning, open learning, pair or one-to-one discussion, and computer-based training) that are categorized as either exposition or instructor-led, collaborative or group-centered, and individual. Each description includes characteristics of the approach, associated training methods, type of learning for which the approach is appropriate, trainee needs that are usually met and unmet by this approach, and suggested references. Section 4 leads the reader through the selection of training methods by describing 29 training methods and 3 ways of learning procedures.

Change is the norm, and the United States' competitive advantage increasingly will depend on the creation of value-added products and services. A value-added economy, in turn, demands higher-order skills of its workers. However, the work force is shrinking and aging, and most new workers will soon be minorities or females. In addition, there is little coordination between business and postsecondary institutions and many overlapping or gapping training programs are provided. Some of the solutions are to: (1) view learning as an  uninterrupted process; (2) focus on individuals, not institutions; (3) build demand-driven systems and raise standards; and (4) increase public and private investments in postsecondary education. The future depends on how these solutions are implemented. It will take years, but the success of the country will be measured by the outcomes of these initiatives. (The conference agenda and a list of participants is included in this report.) (KC)",

        "description":"This document, one of the results of a 3-year study, provides an overview of training in the United States in terms of who gets trained and how the training itself is organized, structured, and delivered. The findings were developed through a literature review, the work of advisory panels, feedback from 400 experts and practitioners, interviews with employers and employees, and site visits. Part One considers who provides training, how the employer-based training system works, and who receives training. Part Two addresses how employers form linkages with training providers, how those partnerships function, and how employers select and use providers for various types of training. Part Three describes organizational strategies and training roles, lists questions training advocates  within organizations should ask, and gives practical approaches for connecting training to strategic decision making. Part Four offers policy recommendations for improving training. Among the recommendations are that: (1) employers should integrate human resource development into institutional climate and structure, use the applied approach to learning, decentralize the learning systems, and foster learning linkages; (2) educators should invest in the occupational preparation of secondary students who do not go on to postsecondary education; and (3) government should provide human capital development to the disadvantaged, craft programs for the dislocated, investment incentive for training to employers, and improved access to training for employed people. The document concludes with 94  references. (CML)",

The document's intended audience includes executives and managers, personnel and human resource development workers, trainers, vocational educators, higher education administrators, and business and management consultants. Chapter 1 explores what constitutes technical training, the size and scope of the technical work force, how technical workers are prepared for their jobs, and how they keep their technical skills up to date. Chapter 2 examines  how technical training is structured inside employer institutions and analyzes the systems that employers use to deliver technical training and how those systems are connected to strategic goals. Chapter 3 looks at the many providers of technical training--from educational institutions to original equipment manufacturers to vendors--and explores how employers and providers share information about technological trends and future training needs to forge partnerships for developing and delivering training. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 contain examples of how some of the nation's largest employers organize and deliver technical training to their work force; centralized, decentralized, and integrated systems are explored. The document concludes with a list of representative groups of occupations among  technical professionals, technicians/technologists, and skilled trade workers and a 33-item bibliography. (CML)",

The resulting programs use the applied approach that motivates learners by linking learning to improved job performance. The document is intended for practitioners and administrators responsible for providing private or public training programs; administrators and instructors involved in basic skills programs; business and management consultants; and secondary, postsecondary, vocational, and adult educators. The introduction explains what skills employers want. The next section explains the document's format, including the meaning of various symbols used. The bulk of the document explains these steps of  program development: (1) identifying job changes or problems related to basic workplace skills; (2) charting a course for building management and union support for workplace basics training programs; (3) developing and presenting an action plan to management and unions, including guidelines for selecting outside training providers; (4) performing a task analysis; (5) designing a curriculum; (6) implementing the program; and (7) evaluating and monitoring the program. A glossary, index, and five appendices conclude the document. The appendices profile two workplace basics training program experiences, give information on locating providers of basic skills and getting help in setting up the program, provide a sample form that can be used to request proposals from potential providers, and  provide generic curriculum guidelines.

        "description":"A study sought to explain why unions fail to obtain contracts 25-30 percent of the time, even after winning the right to negotiate contracts in secret ballot elections. Data were collected from union representatives and National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) records pertaining to a sample of 135 Indiana cases and a sample of 140 cases nationwide where unions had won the right to negotiate during 1979-80. Because the national sample exclusively involved unions affiliated with the AFL-CIO, the data were biased in that they reflected the experience of larger unions rather than that of smaller, independent unions and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Unions were found to be more likely to obtain contracts under the following conditions: (1) when they were negotiating  contracts with firms that had high wages relative to the firm's industry; (2) when they were negotiating contracts with firms in which separate bargaining units were already under contract with the union; (3) when the percentage of workers voting for union representation was higher and the size of the work unit was larger; and (4) when national union representatives were involved in the negotiations. The unions were less likely to obtain contracts in southern states with right-to-work laws, when the national union required national approval of local first-contract agreements, when the National Labor Relations Board had to resolve employer objections and/or challenges to union election victories, when employers refused to bargain, and when there were discriminatory charges and other forms  of illegal discrimination against union activists.

        "description":"Program design in nonformal education must take into account the cultural context in which it exists. In developing countries, it can neither reject all values of Western civilization (an impossible task), nor can it embrace Western values without regard to native cultures. The challenge, especially in literacy education, is to become culturally conscious, to preserve what is of value in indigenous cultures and traditions, to renew what must be renewed, and to develop a mutually regenerative relationship between traditional values and science and technology. The educational agenda for all non-Western cultures must support the old culture as it subverts it and reinforce the tradition while renewing it. Practical suggestions for program design in culturally sensitive nonformal  education stress the following: (1) building a learning environment; (2) defining needs; (3) defining objectives; (4) selecting clients; (5) choosing content and language; (6) selecting methods and materials; (7) establishing institutional and social arrangements; (8) selecting settings for learning; (9) recruiting instructors; (10) training workers and providing orientation to leaders; (11) motivating teachers and learners and mobilizing resources; and (12) conducting evaluations and developing feedback. The key to the process is participation in the program design by the learners, teachers, local leaders, and extension workers in a genuinely collaborative network of relationships.

        "description":"State and local governments have been in the front lines of dealing with the adverse effects of recent economic change. States have embarked on a dual approach to economic adjustment. First, they have established programs that respond to economic change and cushion its deleterious effects on communities and individuals. Second, they have attempted to anticipate and prepare for the massive dislocations that are taking place in the economy. State training programs have been key elements of both strategies. Most of the training programs have been job specific and company specific. Historically, state job-specific training programs have been heavily directed at influencing the locational decisions of firms. Today, as a result of changing demographics and economic conditions, some  states have also begun directing their state job training programs inward as a job retention strategy. Following an introductory section and a section on training for expansion, modernization, and retention, this paper briefly describes the job-specific training programs in 17 states. Information is drawn from interviews with state officials, a meeting on \"State Strategies for Training a Competitive Workforce,\" and a 50-state survey on state industry-specific training programs conducted in 1986.

        "description":"Research on the implementation of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) included a sample of more than 20,000 people in 16 service delivery areas (SDAs). The random assignment model for the study produced estimates of the impact of the overall JTPA program in this sample of SDAs, plus separate impact estimates for individuals recommended for classroom occupational training and on-the-job training. Because some SDAs declined to participate due to fears that the study would disrupt or have a later negative impact on their operations, the U.S. Department of Labor and the research team altered the exclusion rules for the control group, provided technical assistance to help SDAs and service providers meet enrollment goals, simplified the research design, increased the compensation  for sites' efforts, and urged states to administer the performance standards system flexibly. The following lessons for future research were developed: (1) when research goals conflict, priorities must be set quickly so that a realistic plan can be developed; (2) if generalizable findings are necessary, major adjustments may have to be made in the study design to recruit a representative sample; (3) if participation by sites is voluntary, sites must be offered incentives to participate; (4) implementing a random assignment research design changes the operation of an ongoing program; and (5) technical assistance and staff training are important. (Appendices provide an overview of JTPA, profiles of the sites, tables comparing participating SDAs with others not participating; and 45  references.) (KC)",

        "description":"Critical thinking is often defined as that which a particular instrument measures. The most prominent tests are the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal, the Ennis-Weir Critical Thinking Essay Test, and the Cornell Critical Thinking Tests. Watson and Glaser's (1980) view of critical thinking is &quot;a composite of attitudes, knowledge, and skills.&quot; Ennis (1984) uses the terms &quot;critical thinking,&quot;&quot;informal logic,&quot; and &quot;reasoning&quot; roughly interchangeably, defining critical thinking as &quot;reflective and reasonable thinking that is focused on deciding what to believe or do.&quot; Based on this definition, Ennis's model posits 13 dispositions and 12 abilities that together make up critical thinking. From the field of adult education, a simplified concept of critical thinking emerges.  Brookfield's (1987) definition of critical thinking is a productive and positive emotive and rational process that is triggered by both positive and negative life events. The following definition of critical thinking was used for the learning strategies instrument developed by the Kellogg Center for Adult Learning Research, Montana State University: &quot;a parallel process by which individuals analyze given information in a contextually specific situation and create new ideas, concepts, or constructs based on their analysis.&quot; According to this model, there are four general strategies necessary for critical thinking, two of which are analytical (recognizing and testing assumptions, and assessing contextual parameters) and two of which are creative (generating and testing alternatives, and  conditional acceptance).

It also reviews existing policies in Canada and in British Columbia, in education ministries, and in other ministries with interests and activities touching upon literacy. Recognizing the intentions of the Provincial Literacy Advisory Committee, the paper outlines a framework for thinking about literacy policy that would realize a community-based strategy for literacy work, in which teaching is tailored to meet the needs of students in particular communities and programs often involve nongovernmental organizations, sometimes in cooperation with education institutions. The six sections  of the paper examine the following: (1) adult literacy policy in the late 1980s; (2) federal government policy and institutional arrangements; (3) British Columbia policy and institutional arrangements; (4) mandates and responsibilities; (5) literacy policy strategies; and (6) understanding literacy programming.

It also assessed 10 selected administrative procedures unique to the program. The subjects were 180 randomly selected students in vocational education classes in two Chicago public high schools. Ninety students were in a control group, and 90 received tutoring in reading and mathematics as related to vocational education classes. Students in both groups and the tutors were classified as special needs. Tutors were 60 students, with 30 students in a control group.  The study found that the peer tutoring program had limited impact on the improvement of students in mathematics. However, the program had a positive impact on reading, particularly for academically disadvantaged and handicapped students. Tutors increased their mathematics scores, whereas their reading scores decreased. The most useful administrative procedures for the program were orientation workshops for tutors, the selection criteria used for tutors, and the technical assistance and support provided for tutors. Recommendations were made for program improvement. (Includes 59 references and study questionnaires and forms.) (KC)",

However, by 1980 the number of articles about burnout had increased dramatically in an explosion of awareness of the problem. Various writers and researchers have identified the stressors that can lead to burnout for a nursing faculty member. Among the identified stressors are preparation and teaching of new courses; initiation of team teaching; assumption of leadership roles and administrative responsibilities; increased workload in relation to the amount of classroom teaching and increased committee responsibilities; the multiple relationships in which the faculty member is placed, including those with students, patients,  families, other academicians, and other health care professionals; frequent involvement in conflict situations; and having to adopt a second profession (education) and its values and standards of competence, while maintaining the first profession (nursing) and its values and standards. Among the actions recommended for preventing and managing burnout are fostering a concept of collegiality among nursing educators, offering training programs that teach coping strategies, and fostering an organizational awareness of burnout problems.

The study addressed multiple education and training functions, including preparing youth for productive careers, supporting the development of work skills through employees' lifetimes, and helping displaced and disadvantaged people to develop skills and find meaningful jobs. Data were collected through interviews with leaders in the education and training field and with employers; analyzing employment and demographic trends that affect the demand for work-related skills; and development of a &quot;map&quot; that describes the work-related education and training system in  the region. Among the results of the study are that: (1) the system was estimated to have spent $550 million of private and public funds in 1985; (2) employers were the largest source of training, followed by the public schools, proprietary schools, and the community colleges; (3) employment has shifted from manufacturing to services and more people are employed in small establishments; (4) the region has relatively fewer young people than the nation as a whole and faces continuing declines in working age population; (5) 80 percent of elementary and secondary students are in small districts outside the city of Pittsburgh, and the system in general is fragmented; and (6) the community must decide whether continued economic vitality requires a more coordinated education reform effort.

Providers were classified as either: (1) formal, secondary providers; (2) formal, postsecondary providers; or (3) informal, postsecondary providers, such as training provided by employers and community-based organizations. Providers were considered formal if they granted credentials to program completers and informal if they did not. In addition to institutional providers, several governmental programs, such as those of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), displaced workers programs, and state-sponsored customized job training programs, were identified. In 1985-86, public schools provided the only work-related education available at the  secondary level, and area vocational technical schools served about 27 percent of all vocational students. Community colleges and proprietary schools provided most of the formal postsecondary occupational education. Proprietary schools enrolled more vocational students and had larger vocational expenditures than the community colleges. On-site training by employers accounted for about half of the expenditures on work-related education in the region. Those being trained by employers tend to be those with higher levels of education and experience, rather than unskilled workers or those new to the work force. JTPA programs provided training for more than 18,000 persons in 1988.

        "description":"After a brief overview of the size and nature of illicit drug use observed among American adolescents and young adults over the past 20 years, this paper argues that the nation's reliance on supply reduction as its primary strategy for controlling drug abuse has been unsuccessful. Of the two approaches to demand reduction--coercive techniques versus changing beliefs, attitudes, and norms--the latter, and primary prevention in particular, are judged most promising. The paper discusses three essential components to the process of early intervention: idea generation, program development, and systematic evaluation. The report examines the two most far-reaching current approaches to prevention--school-based programs and media-based efforts; the report then offers recommendations. The  study also presents a number of specific ideas for expanded approaches to prevention. These include emphasis on health and other risks associated with various substances; early creation of parent groups; recreational alternatives for adolescents to &quot;partying&quot; organized around substance use; systematic attempts to change norms among adolescents regarding drug use; and a serious societal response to the adverse effects of widespread alcohol and cigarette advertising. The drug-related beliefs and attitudes of young people are examined, and procedures for changing those beliefs are suggested. (TE)",

The next section cites statistics on the number and characteristics of dropouts over the past 10 years. Findings on the causes of dropping out are subdivided into student factors, school factors, and societal factors. Findings are cited that show how staying in school helps life chances and helping strategies for at-risk  youth are discussed in detail.

It explains that only first-time freshmen may enter the university without a major, that transfer students must declare a major upon application, and that undeclared majors are allowed only one academic year in that status before they must declare an academic major or leave the university. It goes on to describe the dilemma of undeclared majors who complete their first year with a grade point average below 2.0, noting that most departments require a minimum of a 2.0 grade point average before a student will be accepted as a change of major. A retention effort for these \"negative standing\" undeclared majors  piloted by the University Advising Centers is described in which selected \"negative standing\" undeclared majors were allowed to continue at the university beyond their normally-allotted three quarters under the auspices of a controlled group counseling program. Included are a description of the functions of the University Advising Centers, the development of the \"Continuation Group\" for undeclared majors, impressionistic interpretations of the group, comments from student evaluation of the group project, and a discussion of the coordinators' reactions to the student evaluation.

It focuses on the theory, research and implications for practice regarding academic self-concept. Four models of the structure of self-concept and their resulting implications for practice are reviewed: (1) nomothetic; (2) taxonomic; (3) compensatory; and (4) hierarchical. Marsh's (1987) Big-Fish-Little-Pond effect on academic self-concept is discussed, with implications for the possible impact on academic self-concept of placement into remedial or accelerated programs, movement between varying types of school systems, or the possibility that parents who place their children into highly competitive educational programs may actually achieve exactly the reverse of their intended  goals. The document concludes with a brief overview of recent research on academic self-concept underway at the University of Maryland, stressing the implications for practice resulting therefrom.

        "description":"This study examined the experience and planned activities regarding nursing home admissions of persons with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Surveys were sent to 235 nursing home administrators in Illinois to obtain information on the facility, staff needs and experiences in service provision to persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, admissions and finances, and respondent information. Responses from 54 nursing homes revealed that fewer than 10% of the facilities received referrals and none reported admissions of persons with AIDS. A variety of issues were reported that blocked prospective care of persons with AIDS. Reimbursement concerns predominated, with 25-47% of respondents potentially willing to admit persons with AIDS if given adequate  reimbursement. Anticipated staffing concerns included fear of attrition and recruitment problems, staff resistance, family concerns and training and supervision. Concerns about residents included resident fears and lack of information, capability to care for persons with AIDS-related illnesses and issues about age mix of residents. Within the homes, activities included discussion of the AIDS issues and sending staff to AIDS education programs. These findings suggest that, while education provided to nursing home administrators and staff may quell some fears about infection control and the clinical picture of care for persons with AIDS-related illnesses, more adequate protocols for assessment, reimbursement, and referral linkages are needed to facilitate appropriate care.

        "description":"This study was conducted to identify efforts by hospital discharge planners to refer clients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) to nursing homes; to determine the responses of the facilities contacted; and to identify gaps in services, discharge planner practices, and relationships between characteristics of clients, care systems, and outcomes. Discharge planners in hospitals with the highest incidence of patients with HIV infection in Chicago were contacted bi-monthly to provide information on persons with AIDS who needed to be discharged from the hospital with post-hospital continuing care provision. Questionnaires requested information on demographics, diagnoses, care needed, placement, and number of days hospitalized beyond a  medical need. The results revealed that, in a 3-month period, none of the 42 identified clients were admitted to any nursing home. One-fifth of the cases included referral to multiple facilities. Total placement contacts and admissions that did occur were in specialized AIDS residences. Patients were assessed as staying in the hospital for 8 days beyond acute care needs. These findings suggest that difficulties in placing persons with AIDS in care facilities have financial and quality of life costs. Long-term care of persons with AIDS must be a coordinated effort throughout the care continuum including governmental agencies, health care and social workers, and the long-term care industry.

A questionnaire consisting of the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI), a modified form of the Attitudes Toward Women Scale, and 34 questions concerning sex-role attitudes and beliefs was administered to students in psychology of sex roles classes and to controls in non-sex role psychology classes. The questionnaire was given to different classes both before and after each semester over a 7-year period between 1982 and 1989. Findings from approximately 430 subjects showed no significant differences between controls and experimental subjects before the course began. Pretest scores revealed gender differences in that men showed more maleness on the BSRI than  did women and men were more conservative or traditional and women were more liberal on the Attitudes Toward Women Scale. For experimental subjects, female students' attitudes on the Attitudes Toward Women Scale changed toward more liberal sex-role attitudes after taking the sex roles class. Male students' attitudes did not change significantly after taking the course. All analyses for control subjects showed no significant differences between pre- and post-test scores. (NB)",

Women in the incest group self-reported sexual abuse before age 18 by a father or stepfather. Sexual abuse was broadly defined to encompass a range of sexual activities from exhibitionism to sexual intercourse. All subjects completed the California Personality Inventory (CPI) which provides information regarding vocational, educational, social, and familial issues, as well as delinquent and asocial behaviors. Results indicated that incest subjects scored lower on the overall scales of the CPI. Regarding the individual scores, women who had experienced sexual abuse tended to score lower in the areas of sociability,  socialization, social presence, self-acceptance, communality, and psychological mindedness. Women who had experienced more intrusive types of sexual abuse (i.e., sexual intercourse) were more likely to indicate problems with self-acceptance and self-confidence in social settings. Women who were incestuously abused at younger ages were more likely to experience internal conflicts and an inability to empathize with others. (Author/NB)",

The model was elaborated to include measures of religious participation and several aspects of self-concept, including self-derogation. This elaborated model of sexual assault was tested through administration of a survey to 229 male college students. The hypothesized model, consisting of four categories of variables, was tested using a hierarchical blockwise discriminant  function analysis. The results revealed that 83.8% of the cases were successfully classified: 91.4% of the nonaggressive men and 72.0% of the aggressive men were correctly classified. The results partially confirm the model. Early sexual experience, personality characteristics, peer group influence, alcohol and drug use, recent sexual experiences, and style of conflict management were all significant predictors. Neither family violence nor the measure of sex role attitude was predictive. The findings support the viability of a multidimensional model of sexual aggression and provide a profile of the sexually aggressive male. (NB)",

Subjects were divided into high and low self-esteem groups using a median split. Results of 2 x 3 (self-esteem x task) analyses of variance showed that the efficacy, ability attributions, and task satisfaction of subjects in the low self-esteem group, but not of those in the high self-esteem group, were affected by task perception. These findings support Brockner's (1988) notion that individuals with low self-esteem are more easily  influenced by external cues than are individuals with high self-esteem. Subjects in the low self-esteem group had lower goals, efficacy, and task performance than those in the high self-esteem groups. Subjects set high goals and had higher performance in the difficult condition than in the easy condition. (Author/NB)",

Accordingly, this paper presents a package of therapeutic techniques designed to help members of two paycheck families learn how to adjust to this family lifestyle. After a brief introduction, an audience-generated list of 12 common family stressors is presented and external and internal sources of stress are defined. The main part of the paper presents a therapeutic model for dealing with the stresses in two-paycheck families. Techniques are classified under four headings: control, courage, commitment, and cooperation. Control techniques  emphasize locus of control, mutual brain storming, rethinking, and shared gloating. Courage techniques address perfectionism, learning to say no, rewarding effort despite outcomes, and experimentation. Commitment techniques address life priorities, self-defeating fantasies, guilt, and marital enhancement. Finally, cooperation techniques include delegation, household preferences, scheduling, and friendships. (TE)",

        "description":"Increasing demands for home health aides to the frail elderly and disabled, coupled with a high rate of turnover among these aides, has led to growing concerns over worker recruitment and retention in the home care industry. This paper therefore describes a model developed to explain job satisfaction and turnover among home health aides. The model was tested using survey data collected for a Ford Foundation-sponsored home care demonstration in five cities. The methods used to estimate the model included an adaptation of the Michigan Organizational Assessment Questionnaire to the circumstances of the home aide's job. This instrument was administered to workers employed by 17 agencies in five cities (Boston, Massachusetts; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; New York City, New York; San Diego,  California; and Syracuse, New York). Based on critical path analysis, a causal model was developed to explain two outcomes of the questionnaire: intrinsic job satisfaction and intent to leave the job. Youth, loneliness, and dissatisfaction with pay and benefits were the major determinants of aides' intent to leave, while factors affecting workers' job satisfaction included positive attitudes about pay and benefits, supervisor supportiveness, and task variety. The importance of age as a predictor of turnover suggests that employers should focus their recruiting efforts on older workers, who because of temperament or lower employment aspirations seem more inclined to stay with the job.

The project supported three separate work life demonstration at home care agencies in New York City and Syracuse, New York and in San Diego, California. The demonstration sites included both independent and chain-affiliated agencies as well as both non-profit and for-profit agencies. The demonstrations modified training and support, pay and benefits, status, opportunities for advancement, and hours of work--all dimensions of the job found to be sources of dissatisfaction in the home aide work force. In each case, the aim of the intervention was to increase worker satisfaction, decrease turnover, and  improve reliability and continuity of care. At each site, the evaluation design provided for random selection of program participants (experimentals) and controls. One-year and 18-month turnover data were collected for experimentals and controls. Depending on the particular demonstration, program participants were 21 to 44 percent more likely to be on the job one year after the start of the demonstration than were their relevant control group. These differences persisted at the 18-month measurement point. References are included. (Author/TE)",

It was hypothesized that an age effect favoring younger subjects would be present such that younger participants would perform better overall on the maze task, that older subjects would perform better on a Styrofoam mock-up of the maze-like floor plan compared with a paper version, and that the addition of kinesthetic information would prove especially helpful to older participants. Eighty-three older (mean age of 68.29) and 83 younger (mean age of 20.89) urban respondents were asked  to remember a route through a building after being presented with one of four conditions giving either realistic or paper and pencil spatial information. The second two hypotheses were not supported; however, analysis supported the first hypothesis. Younger participants performed significantly better than older respondents on the right turn index, the turns index, the sequence of turns index, and the drawn to scale index. This research is consistent with other findings on the domain of spatial memory. (Author/ABL)",

This study explored the influences of blood pressure on memory for designs and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale vocabulary performance in terms of seven theoretical models which test not only for linear effects but for effects having a more complex, nonlinear time-lagged form as well. Each of a large number of hypotheses was tested twice, first with systolic, then with diastolic pressure variables. The 25-year data base of the  Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging was used. Significant complex relationships between blood pressure and cognition were found. The theory that best fits results of this study is that optimal pressure delivers optimal oxygen to the brain, and optimal pressure depends on the state of the whole system, maintained and adjusted by age related feedback loops connected to both blood pressure and cognitive adaptive systems. The use of nonlinear, lagged multivariate models is recommended, since these hypotheses received support. (Author/ABL)",

        "description":"Social facilitation can be defined as the effect of an audience or coactors on performance. Research on social facilitation effects has produced some contradictory and confusing findings. Some studies have found that the presence of others enhances performance; other studies have found that the presence of an audience or coactors impairs performance. Zajonc's theory of social facilitation is currently one of the most widely accepted interpretations of social facilitation effects. Zajonc's mechanistic drive model and Weiner's cognitive model offer competing explanations for the interaction between anxiety level and task performance. A 2 x 2 factorial design involving male college students (N=39) was used to test the two theories. The results tended to support Zajonc's model. As in  Zajonc's theory, on the easy task subjects high in anxiety did better than subjects low in anxiety. On the difficult task subjects low in anxiety did better than subjects high in anxiety. This pattern of interaction is the exact opposite of that predicted by Weiner and clearly does not support his cognitive interpretation of social facilitation effects. (ABL)",

This disability can cause problems in reading, listening, speaking, writing, spelling, or performing mathematics. Furthermore, learning disabilities may affect motor functioning, memory, and attention. Because a growing number of youths have been identified as having learning disabilities, it is expected that the vocational impact of learning disabilities will receive greater attention as these youth leave school and enter the work force. Most of these youths will have been provided an array of services and accommodations in their secondary programs and many will need continued accommodation in the workplace. Human resource managers can play a vital role  in assisting persons with learning disabilities to be successful in employment by: (1) being sensitive to the needs of persons with this hidden handicap; (2) providing an environment in which fear of discrimination will not prevent the employee from disclosing his or her disability; (3) identifying the essential functions of jobs in the workplace so that accommodations may be considered which would allow the employee to be productive on the job; and (4) including the employer in the selection of appropriate accommodations.

Federal legislation mandates that education programs receiving federal funds cannot discriminate against persons with disabilities. This places the burden of accommodation on the institution. Many colleges and universities are meeting the needs of learning disabled students through special programs. However, learning disabled students must choose carefully the colleges they attend and the classes they take to reap full benefits from these programs. They must also be willing to disclose their handicap to be eligible for these programs. High school counselors can play a major role in helping learning disabled  students to make wise decisions when choosing colleges by serving as advocates and facilitators in the school-to-college transition of these students. In developing appropriate programs of educational services for learning disabled students, thorough assessment of their strengths, limitations, and needs should be conducted. Choosing courses that will meet these students' needs is a priority after college entrance. Social deficits and lack of social support are major areas of concern for learning disabled students. This group of students has special concerns related to their career development. Counseling services specifically for learning disabled students can meet these needs. (ABL)",

The quality of the data and the arguments of literacy scholars concerning crude literacy, reading performance, and functional literacy were examined. Results indicated that although the problems of concept validity, representativeness of research samples, and noncomparability across time confuse the attempt to discern trends, three historical trends were identified. These trends are that (1) in the twentieth century, self-reported outright illiteracy almost disappeared as a percentage of the  whole population; (2) the big story in twentieth century literacy is the rise in school attainment, not the relative effectiveness of schools to teach children at a particular grade level; and (3) the greatest difficulty was found in making a confident statement about the reading abilities of people at different points in time with the same amount of schooling. Findings suggest that present-day literacy policy should be argued on the basis of an assessment of the current condition and on the basis of shared educational goals and not on the basis of alleged declines or rises in literacy skills.

During the 1988-89 school year, the program served a total of 7,943 students at 162 instructional sites. The total included 4,656 students receiving face-to-face instruction and 3,287 students receiving computer assisted instruction (CAI). In addition, 65 teachers, 780 parents, and 831 students participated in a new Parent Read-Aloud Program in grades one through three. Sources of data included program documents, data retrieval forms, observations of classes and staff development training workshops, interviews with program staff, and the results of standardized reading  tests. Results indicated that students in all grades on all subtests in all modes of instruction achieved mean gains that were statistically significant and met the program criteria for success. Recommendations include: (1) vigorous promotion and expansion of the Parent Read-Aloud Program; (2) continuation of staff development as currently organized; (3) more training for CAI teachers on the content and features of software packages; (4) continuation of efforts to adapt software for use in settings where teachers are not physically present; and (5) evaluation of the CAI curriculum for first grade and, if necessary, change of the curriculum.

Several aspects of this flexible, open-ended program contribute to meeting individual needs for progress: (1) children learn to become readers and writers at the same time; (2) children enjoy the mutual support of the peer group; (3) progress is commensurate with development and motivation because of the opportunities for repetition, time on task, and direct instruction; and (4) the management aspect of the program is composed of  meaningful reading and writing activities.

In fact, the leading political figures of late eighteenth-century America were generally, and often intimately, acquainted with the output of the greatest European minds of the day--and of the minds of the ancient western world. Two factors above all placed an ineffaceable stamp on the reading habits of the American revolutionaries: (1) the prevailing mode of their education was rigorous, classical, and thoroughly book-oriented; and (2) the political and social upheaval of which they were the architects and beneficiaries caused them to consult the experience of the past to make sense of their current tribulations and to guide them in their epic task of nation-building. John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, two of the most  intellectual of the Founding Fathers, took extraordinary pains to create not just serviceable personal libraries but collections of superlative quality. Most noteworthy about the Founding Fathers' reading habits was their tendency to regard books not as ornaments but as tools. The Founding Fathers were readers, collectors, users, and creators of books. A few of them went further and became founders of institutional libraries. Through books, they sought both knowledge and self-knowledge, the means by which better to live. (RS)",

Whole language educators are apparently so dissatisfied with the traditional, rigid three-group plan that they may be avoiding most small group patterns. The challenge to whole language teachers is to organize a variety of groups, including Shared Reading, Shared Meetings, Literature Circles, skill groups, and strategy groups. These patterns provide children with flexibility while they prevent the self-fulfilling prophecy of \"once a problem reader, always a problem reader.\" They also complement other ways of organizing instruction, including whole  class and individual activities. Unless varied grouping is incorporated into classrooms, the whole language movement may never demonstrate its full potential for helping children grow as readers and writers.

Subjects, 66,296 recruits who entered the navy between June 1988 and May 1989, took the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Comprehension Tests and the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery. Results indicated that: (1) the typical navy recruit has completed slightly less than 12 years of education; (2) the mean reading comprehension score placed the composite  group near the tenth grade level and the median near the twelfth grade level; and (3) higher percentages of the recruits who scored below the 6.0 reading grade level were high school graduates in the earlier months of the period. Findings suggest that the recruit population remained relatively stable, showing little variability during recent years with regard to means on years of education, reading comprehension skills, and aptitude scores. Findings also suggest that factors for which distributions by month differ include reading grade level scores, high school graduation status, and high school graduation status of recruits who score below the 6.0 reading grade level.

A portfolio is both a collection of the artifacts of students' reading and writing and a disposition toward assessment. This disposition is characterized by the belief that assessment must be continuous, multidimensional, collaborative, knowledge-based, and authentic. Recommendations for portfolios are based upon the conviction that records gathered while students are engaged in functional and contextualized literacy tasks will ultimately prove more useful to both teachers and students than will any set of numbers derived from tests that have little relevance to the purposes and needs of either students or teachers. The principles  and continua put forward should be regarded as a conceptual framework to use in developing and evaluating assessment strategies. The array of assessment opportunities available to teachers is limited only by their creativity, knowledge of the reading process, and grasp of sound assessment criteria. The report describes the portfolio assessment practices in detail and illustrates how they must be applied in the classroom by means of five &quot;scenarios.&quot; Appendixes include: A Schema for Scoring Retellings (The Retelling Profile), A Wholistic Scoring Scale, An Analytic Scoring Scale, A Writing Analysis Checklist, and A Self-Evaluation Questionnaire.

Thirty-one ninth-grade students and 44 third/fourth-grade students were interviewed to ascertain their knowledge about 4 topics; 2 weeks later they responded to 3 tests of topical knowledge. Results were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Correlations between the interview scores and the paper-and-pencil measures did not reveal a strong and clear relationship between the students' performance on the interviews and their performance on the tests of topical knowledge. Conditional probability analysis revealed that the interview and the paper-and-pencil tests provided different information regarding an individual's knowledge of a topic. These differences seem to be  related to the difference between a recall and a recognition task. Results indicated that the interview approach captured individual differences more clearly and more dramatically than the paper-and-pencil tests of topical knowledge.

        "description":"An analysis was conducted of 12 fourth-grade science and social studies lessons in which a textbook was used as a focus of instruction. The purpose was to determine how the textbook was used by teachers and students, and in particular, to determine what kinds of questions the teachers asked during the textbook-based lessons. The results replicate and extend several findings from previous research. Results indicated that (1) even when textbooks were used during instruction, students did not do very much reading, and the reading they did was round-robin oral reading; (2) the teachers asked a large number of questions; (3) very few of these questions came from textbooks; rather, the teachers made up about 90% of their own questions; and (4) only about one-fourth of the questions  asked were about the text segment currently being read, and of those questions, text explicit questions outnumbered text implicit questions two to one. Also of interest were the large number of question repetitions and rhetorical questions (questions that did not appear to elicit a response).

Seventy-five of the subjects read a 1,760-word adaptation of the passage on organizational processes in memory--the low-knowledge passage. The other 78 subjects read a 1,760-word passage on human sexuality--the high-knowledge passage. Each passage was divided into eight sections by the inclusion of embedded headings, each consisting of a word or short phrase. For each section of each passage, one short-answer question quizzing high-level, main-idea information and one short-answer question quizzing low-level, detail information were generated. Approximately half of the subjects in each  passage condition read the passage in booklet format with the headings present, and the remainder of the subjects read the passage with headings absent. Subjects answered questions on one test by consulting the text, and then in a second test based only on memory. Results indicated that headings can positively affect the performance of low-knowledge subjects as they search text for answers to questions. The score in the headings-present condition was significantly higher than the score in the headings-absent condition for the low-knowledge passage, but the score in the headings-absent condition was significantly higher than the score in the headings-present condition for the high-knowledge passage.

The study comprised three experiments. Experiments 1 and 2, tested the hypothesis that the semantic structures conveyed by verbs and other predicate terms are more likely to be altered to fit the context than are the semantic structures conveyed by object-reference terms. In these experiments, subjects (137 university students) paraphrased simple sentences in which verbs and nouns were combined with varying degrees of semantic strain. Results confirmed that verbs alter meaning more than nouns do. The second question,  investigated in experiments 3a and 3b, involving 64 university students, was how this meaning adjustment takes place. Results indicated that although meaning adjustment is initiated in response to a mismatch with context, it is nevertheless characterized by orderly semantic processes.

The study was based on a review of the literature on the merits and demerits of phonics instruction; theory and empirical research related to the nature of reading and its acquisition and mastery; the history of the debate; the relative effectiveness of different instructional approaches; the theory and research on the knowledge and processes involved in skillful reading; and the various literatures relevant to reading  acquisition. The studies indicated with impressive frequency that instructional approaches that include systematic phonics lead to higher achievement in both word recognition and spelling, at least in the early grades, and especially for slower or economically disadvantaged students. The study also found that precise identification of the factors underlying the phonics advantage is not possible. Specialized literatures concerning the research and theory on skillful readers, on poor readers, and on children who have not yet entered school are summarized in the report. The overall findings of the study suggest that a child's success in learning to read in the first grade appears to be the best predictor of his or her ultimate success in schooling, yet children's first grade reading  achievement is seen to depend most of all on how much they know about reading before they get there.

This paper discusses five implemention issues and possible ways of addressing them. The issues are: (1) selection of students; (2) evaluation of effectiveness of Chapter 1 and Reading Recovery Programs; (3) number of students served; (4) coordination of reading instruction; and (5) accounting for Chapter 1 funds used in support of Reading Recovery Services. Each issue is examined in turn and possibilities and/or suggestions for the  resolution of each are discussed. The implication of this analysis is that both Chapter 1 and Reading Recovery policies and practices may need to be adjusted so that each may accommodate the instructional and accountability needs of the other. To accommodate both approaches, educators need to address the dilemmas surrounding these issues. (Twenty-seven references are attached.) (RS)",

The book emphasizes: (1) the research-based rationale for what educators teach in reading and how it is taught; (2) an integration of reading with writing; (3) an acknowledgement that middle school reading instruction occurs within a context that imposes constraints which, in turn, shape the nature of middle school reading curriculum and instruction; (4) the importance of gradual, contextually bound charge relative to the conditions imposed by both policy and environment; and (5) a strategy of creating effective instructional improvement through collaboration among practitioners, teacher educators, and theorists.  Part 1 includes four chapters that provide a frame of reference for middle school reading. The five chapters in Part 2 focus on middle school reading curriculum and instruction. Part 3 consists of five chapters in which reading educators and/or practitioners describe a particular perspective on how effective reading programs are implemented in specific school settings. Part 4 consists of a single chapter that foreshadows what to expect in middle school reading during the 1990s. (MG)",

Subjects in the first experiment, 40 undergraduate university students, read a 2,100-word story and then immediately reported any scenes or events that evoked an emotional response and any mental images they recalled from reading the story. Sixty-nine affect terms were then identified for the latent partition analysis. Subjects in the second experiment, 53 undergraduates who had not read the story, were presented with a deck of 69 randomly ordered cards, each containing one of the emotional response terms reported by the students from experiment one. The sorters were then told to divide the cards into different piles representing categories of terms that were  similar in meaning. The word sorts were subjected to a factor analysis. Results indicated that the factors identified through latent partition analysis by an independent group of sorters proved useful in interpreting readers' emotional responses to a story. Findings suggest that readers call on their background knowledge of emotional responses during reading and that free reports can provide a rich source of information about readers' emotional experiences that can be reliably coded and meaningfully interpreted.

Brainstorming will help students recognize their own prior knowledge on the subject and learn from hearing each other's responses. An anticipation guide is a teacher-generated list of questions that are asked of students before reading the text to elicit thinking, arouse curiosity, and focus attention. Science teachers can use graphic organizers to introduce new technical vocabulary from the unit under investigation and to illustrate the interrelationships that exist among the various concepts and terms. Capitalizing on students' curiosity increases students' motivation to read, which leads to an increase in comprehension.  Providing students with a list of terms and having them classify them and identify their reasons for doing so will not only stimulate student interest but will also help the teacher find out what students do and do not know about the topic. Active comprehension on the part of the students can be promoted by asking them to make predictions as to the content of the selection. (MG)",

        "description":"As more emphasis is placed on helping children gain a global perspective and understanding of the world, children's literature seems to be a natural vehicle for fostering that understanding. By studying the storyteller, educators can learn about literary traditions of communities, particularly traditions which reflect the use of stories. An explanation of West African minstrels' traditional use of the story can be shared with children and adapted for use in a classroom setting by hanging fishnets from a corner of the classroom where all sorts of items are hung. Children can choose an item which brings to mind a favorite story to share with the class. Children can become storytellers and take their stories from classroom to classroom in a way similar to the East Indian tradition,  using story cloths to present stories through pictures. By identifying the original tradition and history of the storytelling technique, children learn about the value and use of stories from other cultures, and teachers can avoid the use of these traditions as merely another gimmick to capture children's attention.

Educators fear being viewed as hungry for headlines, shallow, and opportunistic, while reporters dislike being bombarded with press releases. In fact, both researchers and journalists are capable of writing dynamically and intelligently about social problems for large numbers of readers. The problems with reporting social science research in the mass media are that: (1) findings are contingent; (2) similar studies may produce conflicting findings; (3) many reported studies are not legitimate research; and (4) what journalists choose to report may be neither valid nor important science. Communication between researchers and reporters could be improved if journal editors routinely sent copies of their  publications to newspapers and if journalists devoted more attention to the educational community. Those who cover education can teach the public that educational research is a promising method for seeking solutions to social problems and more generally that education is a field of intellectual consequence which is worthy of study.

A university-required junior level composition course was designed in which students wrote two five-page papers, several shorter response papers, and read fiction and non-fiction. The final examination for the course was a three-part essay question which asked students to (1) describe aspects of the workshop which made them feel like &quot;displaced persons&quot;; (2) discuss aspects of the workshop which made them feel connected to a community; and (3) explain how they felt about being placed in or displaced from the workshop.  All students seemed to share the same problem--the presence of a multiplicity of voices competing in their writing. Because students had collaborative alternatives to the workshop, they were very positive about three aspects of it: they felt empowered as readers and responders to the texts of their peers; they felt connected to the workshop when their responses centered on the last stages of revision; and, they felt good about sharing their work in the workshops. The writing workshop seems to make the most sense in the reentry phase, a place for students to publish, share, and polish their work, but not to create or shape writing and not to negotiate authority.

Students in the non-traditional class received additional information in the form of lectures and handouts that students in the traditional class did not receive, and during the semester they applied these new insights to the literature they studied. Two case studies were conducted with students from the non-traditional class. A series of interviews with the two students indicated that despite their very different orientations and attitudes, both students found something of value in the non-traditional  approach used in the class. Four conclusions were drawn from the case studies: (1) the approach has some value and at least warrants further investigation, perhaps in the form of more narrowly defined, more tightly focused studies; (2) students respond well to challenging materials; (3) each student will take from the approach what he or she finds of importance in it at a given moment; and (4) what a student gets out of a course depends on a number of complex factors (student's orientation and attitude, the kind of literature used, the kind of linguistic insights used, and the commitment and enthusiasm of the teacher).

The teacher then began to realize the real implications of this method for writing instruction. Student reactions to their classmates' compositions can lead to measurably improved writing. But as important as these specific gains are, the real value of bringing the writer's group into the classroom is what this conveys about writing as a social act. Writing is both the loneliest and most communal of all endeavors. Teachers should allow students to discover the pleasures of reading aloud to and hearing responses from a group of committed writers. Students should have the opportunity to see  that the solitude of individual effort can be balanced by the voices of others in a conversation that engages students and teachers alike. (SG)",

Teachers can find many authors who are willing to speak to classes; many come through towns on book tours and many are employed by universities.  Some writers will donate manuscripts to schools; some will respond with personal letters when students write to them. While teachers often tell students about the value of revision and provide many models of successful products, bringing writers into the classroom also provides models of the actual process.

Educators must also take responsibility for modeling the powerful notion that books or literature aid in everyone's personal search for meaning. The process of analyzing literature is helpful in determining personal worth, and it is necessary for teacher education majors in determining professional worth for use with their future students. It is imperative that education majors understand the complex nature of literature as it aids each individual in a personal struggle for meaning. Students in a children's literature course need to spend time analyzing picture books and examining the possibilities of the psychoanalytical influence  of fairy tales. In one course, a poetry unit precedes the introduction of children's and adolescent's novels. Students read five novels and also &quot;A Critical Handbook of Children's Literature&quot; (R. Luken, 1986) so that they may be aware of elements particular to children's literature. A second project at the end of the semester requires preservice teachers to compare and contrast two adolescent novels according to setting, point of view, style, characterization, and theme. By reading fewer books, students can analyze the many layers and shades of both personal and universal meaning inherent in children's books. (Twelve references are attached.) (MG)",

Such an inquiry leads toward the claim that the learning process itself is a suitable arena for evaluation, and thus that the evaluation of written and oral communication practices provide acceptable evidence of disciplinary learning. To test this assertion, a college composition class was instructed to discuss the &quot;Japanese idea of beauty,&quot; and written transcripts were made of the oral discussions. Students were also given reading assignments on the subject and were required to write short papers. Two oral discussions and 14 written papers were examined. From an analysis of the  transcripts and papers, six categories, each representing a certain kind of learning process, emerged: (1) synthesizing outside material; (2) linking ideas together; (3) discovering contradictions; (4) suggesting qualifications; (5) internalizing; and (6) tentativeness. Analysis of these categories indicates that important intellectual processes defined as &quot;readiness&quot; may be observed in oral classroom discussion, and may be seen as representations of active learning. If encouraging synthesis of ideas is an educational objective, evidence of it is present in oral interaction. If the aim is to promote contradiction and challenge, tentativeness and exploration, internalization and commitment, educators can look to class discussions for signs of success. (SG)",

Subjects, 23,442 students from 100 high schools and programs, received remedial instruction in reading and/or writing for either a single term or the full 1988-1989 school year. Four instructional approaches were used to teach the subjects: model A used a supplementary laboratory setting and related workbook materials; model B used reduced class sizes; model C was interdisciplinary and integrated remedial reading and writing with the basic curriculum; and model D had two variations--reduced class size and team teaching. The evaluation criteria that 70% of the students in the  reading and writing programs show improvement was met by the writing students but not by the reading students. Students in models A and C met the program objectives while students in the other models did not. (Five tables of data are included; 14 appendixes of data are attached.) (RS)",

The paper narrates the students' research processes, from topic selection (&quot;humor and gender differences in forming a sense of camaraderie in groups&quot;), to a first attempt at using the files, from a pilot study to a search for methodology, from data collection to findings. The paper's first section is organized around a time line used as a basis for a narration of the group efforts in reviewing research literature, gathering pertinent information in the files, and presenting separate hypotheses  in class. The second section discusses the development of a variable coding system, used to code all 60 HRAF probability sample files for both 201 and 522 categories. The third section discusses the results of the research review, methodological modifications, coding difficulties, types of jokes found, and the fact that the findings seemed to be congruent with the superiority theory of humor. The next section presents results of the gestures and signs research. The last section evaluates the HRAF study and offers six recommendation as to how the report could be strengthened. Fifteen references are attached, and 11 appendixes containing data, codes, definitions of terms, attitudes expressed and behavior patterns, lists of tribes, etc. conclude the paper. (SR)",

        "description":"One of the most valuable skills in group decision making is the ability to make trustworthy judgments about group performance. It follows from the &quot;inferential model&quot; of social cognition (Pavitt, 1989; Pavitt &amp; Hight, 1986), that there are three types of judgments relevant to the group context: (1) behavioral (what the group did); (2) dispositional (what kind of group it is); and (3) evaluative (how good the group is). People rely most heavily on evaluative judgments, because they serve as intuitively satisfying explanations for evaluative judgments while each provides a shorthand for a large quantity of behavioral judgments. However, behavioral judgments are the basis for dispositional and evaluative judgments, and it is at the level of behavioral judgments that recommendations  for improving the group's performance can best be provided. Thus, curriculum in small group discussion (along with other performance areas in communication) should encourage students to become more aware of the behaviors their group performs along with the dispositional and evaluative judgments they more naturally make.

        "description":"As it is difficult to know how much damage negative publicity can cause or how an organization should react to it, the best measures are seen as preventive. Advocacy or issue advertising, which attempts to tackle controversial subjects and present facts and arguments that will project the sponsor in a positive light, is one such measure which colleges and universities are beginning to employ. Five hundred new undergraduates and 1,000 students who had been accepted but not enrolled at Chico were surveyed about their attitudes toward California State University-Chico (CSUC). The institution had experienced bad publicity because of violence and a magazine story labeling CSUC the nation's number one &quot;party&quot; school. Eighty-two percent of respondents who attended CSUC had heard or seen  a negative story about the university during the year preceding their arrival, while 75% who chose not to attend the university knew of negative stories. In addition, negative publicity had received attention from both prospective students and their friends. Nonetheless, the negative publicity appeared to have had little impact on students' college choice. Traditional college selection criteria (academic programs, social setting, etc.) remained important to students. Further research is warranted.

        "description":"The Bill of Rights contains a set of simple statements about the rights which citizens may claim in disputes with the government. Those who suggest that the First Amendment has always represented a strong commitment to free speech ignore the historical lesson offered by the Sedition Act of 1798. The early American republic maintained careful neutrality between warring France and Britain. Federalists, suspicious of the Republicans' friendship with the French, won congressional passage of the Sedition Act. The statute criminalized criticism of the American government. At that time, the government was in the hands of the pro-British Federalists, while much of the criticism leveled at that party came from certain Republican newspapers and legislators. Federalists defended the Act as  necessary to the defense of the United States. The law was expressly designed to suppress any and all political opposition to Federalist leadership and policies. Republican-dominated Southern legislatures bitterly attacked the constitutionality and desirability of the Sedition Act, not for the limits it placed on speech, but for the fact that it increased federal power over the states. The story of the Sedition Act casts serious doubt on the notion that the founding fathers intended the First Amendment to be a libertarian statement designed to protect every speaker and every utterance. The Constitution represents principles which must be applied to the present, irrespective of how they have been interpreted in the past. (Seventy-two footnotes are included.) (SG)",

        "description":"News reports regarding the relationship between Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank and a male prostitute reflect a growing willingness to hold public officials responsible for private acts. The incident triggered a classic example of apologia--a speech of self-defense. As critics have long suggested, the intangible nature of the &quot;public&quot; complicates appeals to it. However, it is possible to infer the public by studying how it is constituted by the speaker. In an August 25, 1989 speech, the congressman admitted to his relationship with the prostitute, denied misuse of his office, and pleaded that the psychic burdens of being gay led to catastrophic errors in judgment. By portraying his constituency as a benevolent, compassionate, forgiving people, Frank offered the listener  the choice of joining his public and voting to acquit him, or renouncing this public and the positive values it represents and voting to convict. Public responses in letters to newspapers, poll results, and political contributions suggest that Frank's approach netted forgiveness and understanding. Several would-be challengers have canceled plans to oppose him in his 1990 reelection bid. While Barney Frank's public may exist only in his words, its real power is reflected in the fact that Frank has a political future. (Twenty-six footnotes are included.) (SG)",

        "description":"There are thousands of alternative media outlets in the United States. By definition, they differ from the mainstream dominant media. The idea that the media represent and promulgate societal values is widely held. While not monolithic, the dominant media which grew alongside mass industrialization share an overriding bias. The dominant media promote such values as the sanctity of the &quot;ordinary&quot; family, the celebration of celebrity, and the triumph of personal initiative over bureaucratic control and state inefficiency. Alternative media, which promote an active, critical, and empowered audience, tend to be independently operated, small-scale, openly supportive of political change, and critical of dominant institutions and values. Alternative media sources include periodicals,  non-commercial radio stations, broadcast and low-power television stations, cable access operations, and independent video and film producers. The &quot;Utne Reader,&quot; for example, represents a type of alternative press. Messages transmitted to the public during the next 10 years will influence the public's twenty-first century values. To the extent that alternative media are effective in reaching the public, the promulgation of a different set of values should be expected. If the values of the alternative media affect the new century, then more participants should feel more involved, share more information, and represent more interests than would be the case without the alternative media.

Differing from advisory councils in that they have more involvement in decision making, and differing from management teams in that they include role groups other than administrators, school improvement teams may be composed of teachers and the principal or of a variety of role groups, including students and community members. Typically, such leadership teams have been assembled for school improvement projects during the planning phase. Once the plan is developed, however, responsibility for its implementation tends to fall back upon the administrators. The purpose of these four modules is to prepare school improvement teams for the roles they should be playing throughout implementation.  A specific aspect of effective leadership is covered in each module, including: (1) Coaching Secrets for School Leaders; (2) Lessons from the Business Literature; (3) The Role of Teams in Implementing School Improvement Plans; and (4) Making Sure It Sticks: The School Improvement Leader's Role in Institutionalizing Change. The modules are designed to complement and built on one another, yet each can stand alone if a trainer wishes to focus on a single leadership aspect. This document is the third module and covers the following activities: (1) team formation; (2) team roles during implementation; (3) implementation dilemmas; and (4) constructing a school improvement agenda.

The second takes issue with those using the schools \"as a catchall for problem social issues and as whipping boys\" for the United States' diminished economic standing. The next two publications emphasize the need for cooperation among schools and social service agencies for the benefit of children and their families. The fifth article portrays a Texas superintendent's efforts to establish a \"lighted schoolhouse\" to assist homeless children. H.B.

The next article recounts a Queens, New York, principal's efforts to establish an afterschool care center for kids living in welfare hotels. The two succeeding papers on the problems facing schools argue for less criticism and more cooperation. The next article, a reassessment of the progressive educational legacy, points out that turn-of-the-century reformers went way beyond \"Great Society\" goals to demand free lunch programs, social workers, health clinics, summer programs to serve the poor, and night school programs for adults.

        "author":["Bridges, Edwin M."],
        "description":"Featuring the same practical guidelines for ridding schools of incompetent teachers as the 1984 edition, this new edition incorporates substantially revised material on three topics: criteria and information sources for evaluating teaching effectiveness, remediation procedures, and grounds for dismissal. The book presents an eight-step systematic, organizational approach to resolving several interrelated problems: (1) the legal barriers to dismissing tenured teachers for classroom incompetence; (2) the technical problems of evaluating teacher effectiveness; and (3) the human obstacles, chiefly supervisors' unwillingness to discharge teacher evaluation, remediation, and dismissal responsibilities. The eight steps are: (1) establishing teaching excellence as a high district  priority; (2) adopting and publishing reasonable teacher evaluation criteria; (3) adopting sound procedures for determining whether teachers satisfy these criteria; (4) providing unsatisfactory teachers with remediation and a reasonable time to improve; (5) ensuring that appraisers have the requisite competencies; (6) providing appraisers with necessary resources; (7) holding appraisers accountable for evaluating and dealing with incompetent teachers; and (8) providing incompetent teachers with a fair hearing prior to making the dismissal decision. The final chapter recommends strategies for creating environmental conditions conducive to success. A commitment to ongoing leadership is essential. An appendix contains the District Evaluation Practices Inventory, designed to be used in  conjunction with this handbook. (143 references) (MLH)",

Possible solutions offered in this report are: public declarations of repugnance for racism; multicultural educational programs; use of teachers as role-models; and effective use of tolerance-generating resources. Several other motivational and confrontational strategies used by educators to change racist behavior are discussed. Schools can preserve ethnic identity without sacrificing social integration by offering programs that recognize the distinction between the meanings of culture and ethnicity. Multicultural education must distinguish between culture and ethnicity if it is to preserve ethnic identity while facilitating social integration. Multicultural  education offers excellent ways to uncover prejudice and to stimulate appreciation for racial and ethnic differences. (12 references) (LMI)",

Just as schools alone cannot compensate for the disadvantage created by troubled homes and communities, welfare and social agencies cannot hold out a hopeful future to clients lacking employment abilities. Comprehensive problems call for comprehensive services to the whole person and community. Family crises and poverty conditions must be alleviated if children are to concentrate in the classroom; children must succeed in the classroom if they are to support themselves and avoid long-term dependency as adults. Demographics and financial reasons also support collaboration. &quot;Joining Forces,&quot; a National Association of State Boards of Education report, has  launched a national effort to help education and social services work together to aid children and families at risk. Areas for collaboration include health care, income support, family social services, tutorial and remedial help, before- and after-school care, improved parental literacy and involvement, linkage between employment and education, and attendance policies seeking to retain rather than exclude. Advice is provided for understanding the problem and building interagency collaboration. Examples of collaborative efforts in New Hampshire, Washington, D.C., Texas, and Michigan are summarized. Tips are provided for ensuring collaborative success that transcends special project status and attempts fundamental organizational change. (Nine references) (MLH)",

        "description":"Recent educational reform initiatives have caused the state to examine its role in regulation of schools, and the current regulatory processes have been found to be in need of revision. The current system, in which the state grants &quot;recognition&quot; to schools that meet its standards based on whether they meet a rigidly defined set of criteria, is capable of addressing only the most general of differences between schools and their districts: Full Recognition, Probationary Recognition, and Nonrecognition. Since dissolving a school district through Nonrecognition is virtually never a viable option, the state has no level of sanction that allows for intervention in situations that call for it. Other problems with this system include its inflexibility in terms of differences that may  exist between school districts, its failure to address the quality of student learning, and its lack of a mandated public disclosure of the results of the evaluation process. Recommended changes in current regulatory practices include: (1) the inclusion of student performance in criteria for evaluation; (2) the definition of a sufficient number of performance levels to more accurately access schools; (3) an increase in the number of possible intervenient options available to the state; and (4) a commitment to open disclosure of the results of the evaluation to the public.

The general aim of this paper is to determine the direction of the bank's future policy in assisting education. Among the main reasons for reviewing the bank's role are the following: (1) the continued low enrollment ratios in basic education as well as low adult literacy rates in a number of DMCs; (2) the need for structural reforms in the education sector; (3) the changing economic conditions in the region; and (4) the surfacing of innovative areas of educational interest such as environmental education, distance education, and women's education. Chapter 1 provides a background analysis  relevant to the education sector and development assistance in the region by describing the regional setting and analyzing the relationship between development and education. Chapter 2 reviews the present status of and ongoing development trends in education in the region and analyzes key issues and tasks ahead. Chapter 3 has three objectives: a review of the bank's past policy and performance in assisting education development in the region; a brief overview of other agencies' regional assistance operations in the sector; and an outline of the bank's future assistance policies and priorities. Relevant data is presented in ten appendixes. (68 references) (MLF)",

However, the literature contains few descriptions regarding benefits realized by individuals serving as mentors in programs designed to prepare educational leaders. A recent study involved the use of in-depth interviews with a group of seven practicing administrators who worked directly with aspiring administrators serving as candidates in the Danforth Foundation Program for the Preparation of School Administrators. Interviews focused on the extent that mentors' expectations were realized during the first year of program participation. Each mentor selected for intensive interviewing had been recognized by at least 5 out of 17  candidates as an administrator consulted on at least 3 occasions during the school year. Five distinct themes emerged: (1) administrative mentors derived considerable satisfaction as program participants; (2) mentors expressed positive feelings about being teachers again; (3) mentors were exposed to ideas from other school systems; (4) mentors were exposed to recent research on effective school practices; and (5) mentors viewed their role as an affirmation of their value to their local school systems. In sum, mentorship was found to be a mutually enhancing process. More research is needed on the formation of mentoring relationships and their maintenance over time. (Nine references) (MLH)",

Today there are 150 school-based clinics operating in most major cities and many rural areas. In 1984, the Center for Population Options launched a major project to evaluate a diverse group of clinics located in different parts of the country. The project sought to asses student use of clinic services and the clinics' effects on use of medical services generally and on student absenteeism, illegal drug use, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and unprotected sexual intercourse. The study also sought to examine clinics' potential to meet desired  objectives and identify helpful strategies. The clinics selected for evaluation were in the following cities: Gary, Indiana; Muskegon, Michigan; Jackson, Mississippi; Dallas, Texas; Quincy, Florida; and San Francisco, California. All six clinics served low-income populations, provided primary health care, and were open daily during school hours. Evaluation data were drawn from four sources: (1) staff and student interviews; (2) clinic records; (3) a student health survey; and (4) longitudinal birthrate data. Very large percentages of students used clinics in five of the schools studied. Study results suggest that school-based clinics can reduce students' consumption of alcohol and tobacco. The clinics did not encourage students to be sexually active, even when dispensing or prescribing  contraceptives. According to survey data, the clinics had no effect on pregnancy rates. Recommendations to improve clinics' effectiveness are provided. Included are two appendices containing a reproductive health and pregnancy prevention inventory and the student health survey.

Two important methodological principles are involved: (1) collecting multiple kinds of data with multiple methods; and (2) collecting comparison data. Student needs can be identified by using student and parent surveys or community data. Various management information systems are useful for collecting process data on clinic utilization. Student satisfaction can also be easily measured, and site visits by other professionals can help identify clinic strengths and weaknesses. Outcomes are harder to measure because clinics typically serve relatively small student populations for any particular health outcome and the  students who patronize the clinic differ from those who do not. Diffusion and self-selection are major problems. The traditional solution is to use an experimental design (based on a large sample) that measures the clinic's impact upon participants. The best method of measuring the clinic's impact on the entire student body is to collect survey data from all the students or merge lists of student names with birth records or other public records. Rates can then be compared over time or between clinic and similar comparison schools. Appendices contain the student health survey, an explanation of the Center for Population Options School-Based Clinic Management Information System, and a description of methods for assessing a clinic's pregnancy prevention program.

The law required ED to conduct a series of regional meetings and to implement &quot;a modified negotiated rulemaking process as a demonstration.&quot; This study evaluated ED's implementation of the requirements for regional meetings and negotiated rulemaking. During late May and early June 1988, ED held five public meetings at locations around the country that drew over 700 participants. Identified by ED as particularly important in the development of proposed regulations were the following issues: targeting, parental involvement, schoolwide projects, program improvement, state  administration, and national evaluation standards. ED held a 2-day session in July 1988 to negotiate the provisions of the proposed regulations corresponding to the six issues discussed in the regional meetings. The 19 negotiators, who were selected by ED and approved by their respective national associations, representated the same groups as those invited to the regional meetings. The study team reviewed relevant documents and interviewed 47 people. The study assessed the effectiveness of the new rulemaking requirements and concluded, in summary, that the regional meetings resulted in improved public understanding of the new Chapter 1 provisions; however, the lack of consensus on key regulatory issues meant that the new procedures exerted only limited substantive influence on the  development of Chapter 1 regulations.

        "description":"This study assesses the usefulness of case records in significantly expanding the base of knowledge in education administration. Forty-six school personnel case records were examined in regard to: how respondents perceive and describe problem situations; whether or not alternative strategies are reported and, if so, what types; and what kind of differences, if any, exist between successful and unsuccessful strategies. Although not a comprehensive or conclusive analysis, the study suggests that case records' most valuable contribution is the link they provide between theory and practice. Findings indicate that educators function primarily within a single theoretical model, at a conscious, cognitive level in which structural considerations are predominant. However, many cases show  a contradiction between espoused theory and theory-in-use. If the central goal of effective administrative education is to work successfully with people in a \"growth-enhancing\" organization, the rational, controlling strategies of the prevalent institutional theory-in-use are an important issue, particularly because these cases document the negative impact that results when such strategies are employed. Secondly, the case records do provide information not readily accessible or apparent; they also illustrate theoretical concepts in behavioral and experiential terms. Finally, case records can define a new role for practitioners as creators, rather than consumers, of knowledge. Viewing practitioners as intentional actors in the development of knowledge, or \"knowledge-in-action,\" helps to  bridge the gap between theory and practice. (11 references) (LMI)",

The teachers, all from three rural northern Vermont schools, then participated in five workshops. The teachers were reobserved and a second profile was generated. In a  sixth workshop, participants compared both profiles and noted improvements. Finally, interviews designed to elicit examples and illustrations of influences were conducted. The results indicate that: (1) knowledge of specific behaviors had a strong influence on the teachers' perceived improvements; and (2) topics of the workshops, the relationship with the trainer, and small group size were strongly related to perceived gains. These results show that data-based staff development programs can succeed, especially with marginal teachers untrained in the basics of their profession. (11 references) (KM)",

        "description":"The Excellence and Accountability pilot program sponsored by the New York State Education Department was an opportunity for the Governeur Central School District to redefine decision-making in regard to teaching and learning. The program, which is moving school management closer to the source of learning (the teacher), is a process of change resulting from policies, behaviors, and attitudes shaping the learning environment. This report discusses the characteristics and considerations for change, beginning with six assumptions concerning change as a highly personalized experience. The traditional justification for bureaucratic organization of schools has been that a smooth-running school facilitates learning. However, when efficiency begins to control the school's educational  practice, teachers react in ways that reduce educational quality rather than enhance it. In fact, teachers tend to control their students in much the same way as they are controlled by administrators. The Excellence and Accountability program has six components: annual public reporting, school building registration/registration review, district standards of excellence, a 5-year school education plan, an independent review of education plan, and a strategy for coordinating people. The characteristics of change that must be implemented and evaluated within the context of improving school systems include administrative vision and leadership, leadership through empowerment and organizational teaming, goal definition, and the management of incremental change. A change quotient rating scale is  appended. (10 references) (MLH)",

        "description":"Education in America is facing a postindustrial crisis of legitimacy brought on by the cultural contradictions of advanced American capitalism. The theorist and social critic, D. Bell, describes the most significant feature of postindustrial society as &quot;the disjunction of realms.&quot; This concept describes the progressive division of labor or technical specialization in all realms and the tendancy of highly organized systems to become disorganized. In U.S. schools, cultural considerations--instilling an appreciation of the nation's cultural legacy and an awareness of the fundamental concerns of the human heart and mind--are being avoided in favor of political and economic concerns. Ideally, schools would be the primary agent through which culture is transmitted and made accessible  to students. Yet schools seem ill-equipped for this purpose, as they are driven by the principles of the techno-economic, rather than cultural, realm--novelty (in the form of a preoccupation with reform: &quot;new and improved&quot; education), efficiency (more education for the taxpayers' dollar), and utility (the ability of schools to meet a predetermined, politically charged set of goals established by the polity). In this model, schools serve as little more than institutions that specialize the human intellect for work in the capitalist system. Attempts to counter this anti-intellectual, anti-cultural method of education must center around attempts to articulate the cultural legacy on behalf of the institution of education. Administrators should be critical of attempts to improve schools based  on the ends of the techno-economic realm (vocationalism, perpetuation of U.S. global economic supremacy, etc.). (RJS)",

Underlying the report is the belief that present principal preparation programs are inadequate and require overhauling. Chapters 1 and 2 focus on demographic changes, effective schools, and the nature of effective school leadership. Guiding assumptions about the roles and responsibilities of tomorrow's principals and recommendations for principal preparation are offered in chapters 3, 4, and 5. Chapter 6 recommends that policymakers at the state and national levels fully support educational reform funding and school-based management initiatives, including but not limited to quality control for principal preparation and continuing  professional development of principals. In conclusion, it is recommended that effective recruitment efforts be immediately launched to attract potential principals from the best and brightest teachers, that these aspiring administrators be enabled to develop proficiencies that will help them to deal with the pedagogical problems of the 1990s, and that programs be provided that allow practicing principals--those now in the schools--to refine existing proficiencies and develop new ones. Fundamental to these recommendations are the notions that principals should understand the nature of instruction within a particular environment and have substantive classroom experience. (JAM)",

All of California's school districts completed reports for the fourth reporting period. Despite an article added to the California Constitution affirming students' right to attend school in a safe, secure, and peaceful environment, crime rates on many campuses remain high, and school crimes continue to disrupt the educational process. Results are reported in terms of the average size school (568 pupils) in order to correct for enrollment changes. School crime has decreased 2 percent over the 4-year history of the School Crime Reporting Program. There has been a dramatic decrease (43 percent) in  the incidence of substance abuse. Elementary schools had the lowest overall crime rate, with 10.4 crimes per average school. Middle grade schools had the highest crime rate at 39 incidents per average school, but showed decreases in substance abuse, homicide, robbery, extortion, and sex offenses; however, weapons possession and assault were up. The high school crime rate dropped during the first 3 years of the reporting program, but increased in 1988/89 by 9 percent, Again, the assault/attack/menace and weapons possession categories showed the largest increases. Economic losses to schools from property crimes such as arson, vandalism, burglary, and theft totalled over $24 million in 1988/89, a decrease of 5 percent over the past 4 years. Recommendations are provided concerning weapons  possession problems, validation of crime reporting systems, prevention program resources, and crime prevention and reporting standards. Data are displayed in six tables, and appendixes contain four supplementary tables and the 1988/89 School Crime Reporting Form. (MLH)",

In some regions unexpected shifts in population have adversely affected school organization, and schools have had to be opened or closed in haste. This study has a twofold aim: to develop a methodology that will enable Ontario school boards to make demographic projections in support of educational planning, especially in regard to language of instruction, denominational character, and the educational needs of various socioeconomic groups; and to apply the methodology specifically to the Stormont, Dundas, and Glengarry County Roman Catholic Separate School Board. Conventional quantitative demographic methodology is complemented by structured interviews to investigate the general  socioeconomic circumstances of the region and the decisions that families make in regard to school enrollment. The methodology is then applied to the projection of enrollment in a school board where the three factors (language, religion, and social class) affect attendance rates. This board, which seems to be experiencing enrollment fluctuations, covers both rural and urban areas. It offers what are known as &quot;regular&quot; and &quot;adapted regular&quot; programs to Francophone students, and &quot;core&quot; and 50/50 immersion programs to Anglophone students. The report's four chapters respectively provide an introduction, present the study methodology, illustrate the methodology by applying it to a particular school board, and finally present a summary of demographic observations and a critical review of the  approach adopted.

How schools respond to this challenge may well determine the future of U.S. education. Some communities may react with ignorance and fear, just as the community in Arcadia, Florida did when confronted with the three hemophiliac sons of Clifford and Louise Ray. What can school districts do to ensure that their communities will not react in such an unenlightened fashion? Clearly, educational efforts directed mainly at prevention will no longer be sufficient. Public relations and staff education efforts must be comprehensive and must be initiated as soon as possible. Instructors, as  well as students, need to be educated about any possible risks presented by the presence of an HIV-infected student or coworker. This education must be accessible, sensitive to the sensibilities of the participants, engaging, cost efficient, and conducive to active dialogue. Cleveland State University has developed a series of instructional video cassettes and supplemental manuals whose use is encouraged in such an educational effort. (RJS)",

Specifically, the sections provide: (1) issues in school-based review and development including accountability, participation, and the external view; (2) a comparison of the Guidelines for Review and Internal Development in Schools scheme, the ILEA scheme,  and the Salford schemes for school-based review and development; (3) the six stages of school self-evaluation and development; and (4) suggestions for external support for review and development. In addition to benefiting from improvements to the pupils' education, a school-based review should enable the head of a school to gain from a greater understanding of the perceptions of the staff and others involved regarding the school's strengths and weaknesses.

Today, approximately 68 percent of the Catholic schools in the United States have some form of educational governance structure. Although the primary focus of this handbook, which contains 10 chapters, is on Catholic school boards and boards of trustees, the principles and much of the materials are easily adaptable to councils, commissions, and committees for other diocesan, parish, and religious education programs. Specifically, the chapters define a Catholic school board; discuss policy formation and enactment; review selection and appointment of the principal; study the roles and relationships of boards and  schools; and cover board meetings. Additional chapters explore planning, the role of the board in finances; development and public relations/marketing; evaluaation of and by the board; and membership. The 12 appendices contain sample constitutions for a variety of educational governance structures, definitions and guidelines related to Catholic school principal selection, the functions of the board and a board member's profile, and sample diocesan policies. Practicing subsidiarity and collaboration, school boards and other diocesan, parish, and educational councils and commissions can effectively and efficaciously serve the church's educational mission.

        "description":"Each year, school districts in every state are required to file various financial reporting forms with their state education agency. Although these documents are often viewed more as a nuisance than a useful planning tool, they represent a wealth of information rarely exploited to full advantage by state or local policy makers. The research summarized here attempted to determine what interest, if any, local school districts have in generated fiscal data comparisons and how they would use that information for planning purposes. Policy Analysis for California Education (PACE) interviewed 151 officials in 46 local school districts and county education offices in California. The district sample was designed to reflect the size and geographic and socioeconomic diversity of  California's school districts and the views of both experienced and inexperienced school managers. The survey found considerable support for a statewide fiscal database. Desired database criteria included: (1) established reporting deadlines for local school districts; (2) timely information processing and reporting by the state agency; (3) accuracy of database information; and (4) a system that is flexible, state-funded, well documented, and easy to use. Respondents also showed interest in certain data comparisons involving pupil transportation, maintenance and operations, food services, special education, and other data categories. Observations and conclusions concerning system design, data displays, and local concerns are summarized. (Seven references) (MLH)",

        "description":"In 1983 the California Legislature passed Senate Bill 813, which appropriated an additional one billion dollars yearly for each of 4 years to the schools. Most of the additional money was distributed through the state's general aid formula. However, a portion of the money was offered through eight other new programs designed to encourage specific behavior on the part of school districts, such as lengthening the school year to at least 180 days and increasing instructional time at all levels. A substantial amount of the additional money was distributed in the form of incentives. This report shows that SB 813's incentive funds had a stimulative effect on district instructional funding; districts spent $2.00 on instruction for every incentive dollar received from the state. The  report attempts to help policy makers identify the range of fiscal instruments or funding formulas most likely to stimulate desired changes in school district spending patterns. By analyzing the revenue and expenditures of California unified school districts between 1980-81 and 1985-86, this paper shows that the distribution mechanism influences how local school districts spend additional funds. The study found that: (1) incentive grants appear to be more effective than other types of intergovernmental grant mechanisms in increasing school district spending for instruction; and (2) incentives are useful only under limited conditions and for limited time periods.

        "description":"Typical ethical dilemmas confronted by educational administrators and their normative levels of ethical reasoning are identified in this two-phase study. The first phase, which involves in-depth interviews with 23 principals, applies the Van Hoose and Paradise (1979) developmental model of ethical reasoning to self-reports of decision making processes in ethically problematic situations. The second phase, based on interviews with 20 practicing administrators, compares the principals' reported levels of ethical reasoning with their perceptions of their peers' levels of ethical reasoning. Findings indicate that each group functions at the societal level of ethical reasoning, and that administrators perceive themselves as operating at a higher ethical level than their peers. A  second finding suggests that ethical behavior is influenced by the ethical behavior of superordinates. A third conclusion is that reported behavior is not indicative of high levels of ethical reasoning. Finally, the level of moral growth may be inversely related to the length of time spent in the institution. Although the results have limited generalizability, a recommendation is made for participation in district-sponsored in-service workshops which address ethical issues in educational administration.

In July and August 1989, 13 focus groups were convened in Colorado for the Education Commission of the States' Re:Learning effort. The focus groups, comprised of 3 to 12 people from various interest groups living in the Denver area, met to discuss: (1) how people react to terms used in Re:Learning and other school reform efforts; (2) barriers to effective learning and improved education for children; (3) how and by whom these barriers can be overcome; and (4) how responsible parties might be motivated to improve education. Aside from the findings described in  this report for each topic, three important perspectives permeated the discussions: each group felt somewhat isolated or even excluded from the education loop; each group felt a sense of powerlessness; and the groups did not clearly see how their possible actions fit together with those of others. The focus group led to three major conclusions: educational change cannot occur without widespread cooperation; extensive and effective communications are essential; and the group process is a valuable way to inform people about Re:Learning. Three appendices explain Re:Learning, detail focus group activities, and list participants. (MLH)",

As this report shows, these changes are challenging California's school system, which accounts for nearly 55 percent of the state's budget expenditures. The school-age population between 3 and 24 enrolled in school should increase almost 50 percent between 1980 and 2030. By 1990, Anglos will no longer comprise a majority of this population; by 2015 there will be more Hispanic than Anglo students and more Asian than black students. California schools must cope with growth  and ethnic diversity by creating better dropout prevention programs, improving Hispanic and black students' academic achievement, training a sufficient corps of effective teachers, and determining the schools' proper roles in enculturating immigrants and their descendants. It is unclear whether California will continue to increase educational funding or concentrate on divisive debates over bilingual education and other issues as the state's population changes. Schools will play an even more important role in California's future economy, because a service economy requires &quot;knowledge&quot; workers. If schools continue to lose 20 to 30 percent of their students as dropouts, they impose remedial training costs on business and society. Chapters are accompanied by numerous tables and references.

        "description":"The current demands for values education, like recent basic educational reforms generally, reflect a superficial consensus. The push for values education by educators and politicians is a response to two developments: (1) the public's perception that schools are too disorderly; and (2) a desire to inculcate a common belief system. However, the ideal of common (moral) education has always collided with the reality of a segmented society. Regarding the current demands for values education, there is difficulty in distinguishing between moral education and civic education and in finding a common values core. Appeals to rhetorical consensus gloss over policy dilemmas. Deviating from Mario Cuomo's and William Bennett's &quot;moral literacy&quot; rhetoric, the New York State Education Department  recently proposed a civic approach to values education. Each student will respect and practice basic civic values and acquire the skills, knowledge, understanding, and attitudes necessary to participate in democratic self-governance. This means: (1) understanding and acceptance of the values of justice, honesty, self-discipline, due process, equality, and majority rule with respect for minority rights; (2) respect for self, others, and property as integral to a self-governing, democratic society; and (3) ability to apply reasoning skills and the democratic government process to resolve societal problems and disputes. The New York approach is presented as being most practically effective, politically acceptable, theoretically justifiable, and consistent with long-range educational reform.  (21 references) (MLH)",

Using survey data and a literature review, this paper discusses the development of administrator competency testing, explores pertinent issues, makes recommendations for policy makers opting to use these tests, and suggests workable alternatives. Currently, 15 states use administrator competency tests. So far, there is scant evidence that such testing has achieved its primary objective--ensuring that certification candidates have attained the knowledge required to fulfill the duties of a school administrator. Various issues associated with student and teacher competency testing programs are relevant to administrator competency  testing. These include test validity, impact on preparation programs, minority recruitment, legal challenges, and costs. Alternative practices being used in several states include assessment centers, on-the-job training and assessment, on-the-job assessment without training, alternative forms of testing, multiple competency indicators, better recruitment strategies, and improved administrator preparation. Policy makers need to clarify objectives to be accomplished through testing, determine costs of test development, study other states' experiences, be aware of legal challenges and possible racial and cultural biases, and consider alternative practices.

Working closely with the beginning principals, Louisiana's four technical assistance centers help implement a school model to effectively define and solve key instructional problems. The model, called Consequence Analysis, is presented in a field manual guide that outlines performance objectives and contains supporting material. The program results in a strong  networking organization for the principals and positive support by the superintendents of the principals in the program. Louisiana's successful LEAD project clearly indicates that when the professors of educational administration in a state have a vision of what needs to be done to help principals become more effective in their schools, change can be effected. That change in Louisiana now has the potential for greater positive growth for the state's principals and professors. (KM)",

The new focus on policy reflects a change in the labs' knowledge base and audience.

The nature of the knowledge base used by labs as they interact with policymakers is examined in this paper. Suggestions for improving lab effectiveness in the policy arena are also offered. A content analysis of the lab publications in the ERIC database indicates that the most prevalent types of documents included in the knowledge base are issue tracking systems, &quot;conditions of education&quot;-type documents, policy-relevant original research, studies of  existing policies, literature reviews with policy options, and &quot;think pieces.&quot; Topics covered, in order of importance, include teachers and teaching policy, at-risk youth, rural education, early childhood education, and school restructuring. Lab publications are generally useful, with the exception of misleading references to audiences as &quot;policymakers.&quot; If labs are to be effective disseminators of policy information, they must be willing to take controversial stands, not in the partisan sense, but with the understanding that decisions in a democratic society are political.

Problem areas centered on role-related issues, ambiguous means of implementation, and lack of fit between context and innovation. Santanya argued that knowledge gained from the past must be used to avoid repetition of the same mistakes. A review of reform efforts must therefore consider the different social, economic, and intellectual roots of the past and present situations to avoid misapplying the lessons. An understanding of the context in which restructuring occurred is necessary. Factors crucial for restructuring success are:  (1) an understanding of the roles and knowledge needed; (2) a clear organizational structure; and (3) a balance between content and context.

Lompoc, Poway, and Santa Cruz designated the area of peer assistance and review. Newport-Mesa chose staff development, and Petaluma selected the general area of staff evaluation. San Francisco chose to develop two trust agreements: a career development program for teachers' aides, and an elementary school level interdisciplinary literature-based reading program involving a single  elementary school. Trust agreements developed have begun to alter the ways in which organizational decisions are made. Adversarial relationships have begun to give way to collaboration. Teachers are being included as partners in decisions about the structure and method of operation of school districts. The work of each trust agreement district is described.

        "description":"The features of a mass production-based economy are traced and contrasted within a competitive global marketplace in this political-economic analysis. The early reform movement's equation of \"more\" with \"better\" is no longer appropriate to meet the human resource needs of a nation undergoing profound economic changes. Older industrial economies such as the United States have two options: stabilize mass production by cutting costs, or increase the value of labor. Each path requires a different organization of work and type of work force. The second path relies on a work force capable of rapid learning in order to compete successfully in the world market. To prepare the nation's labor force, American education faces four challenges: (1) improve basic literacy and numeracy skills;  (2) promote collaboration between specialized disciplines; (3) encourage teacher and student responsibility; and (4) avoid fragmentation of elite/less privileged groups.

        "description":"An exploration of the process by which newly hired high school principals learn instructional leadership roles is presented in this paper, which focuses on the effect of faculty and superintendent expectations on principals' leadership behavior. A triangularized methodology includes indepth interviews with new principals, (n=28) from a midwestern state, observation, and document analysis. The findings indicate that both supervisors and teachers influence principals' instructional leadership behavior. A second conclusion is that principals receive strong, consistent messages to become involved with student personnel issues. Third, teachers limit principals' power in areas of curriculum development and staff personnel issues. Finally, selection interviews convey powerful messages  to principals about job expectations. Suggestions for improving the new principals' socialization process include: (1) identification of school needs and evaluation of the principal's role prior to the selection process; (2) involvement of teachers in the development of the selection process; and (3) the creation of a principal socialization committee after selection. District norms and expectations often do not promote instructional leadership in the areas of staff personnel functions. The organizational socialization of principals must be balanced, unambiguous, and explicit. (23 references) (LMI)",

The secular humanist position is not foreign to the notion of religious ideas and values. Images 1 and 2 stress the contemporary secular humanists' optimistic belief in human  nature and scientific reason for the attainment of human fulfillment.

The literature review focuses on supervision textbooks and on research that examines the relationship between leadership in schools and instructional effectiveness. Knowledge, attitudes, and skills are classified into 12 categories representative of the dimensions of supervisory practice: (1) community relations; (2) staff development; (3) planning and change; (4) communication; (5) curriculum development and implementation; (6) improving the  instructional program; (7) service to teachers; (8) observing and conferencing; (9) problem solving and decision-making; (10) research and program evaluation; (11) motivating and organizing; and (12) personal development. Identification of these dimensions legitimates the professional status of supervision in education.

The subjects were 853 students and 54 teachers in a suburban setting. The results of the achievement data were inconclusive; however, the number of student dropouts was significantly reduced. The SAS analysis revealed contradictory perceptions of the program. Students appreciated the increased learning opportunities, while teachers identified the program with  increased workloads and less planning time. The results of this first-year study provide a basis for further planning for the implementation of the seven-period program.

Three major topics are addressed: situational factors leading to intervention; the legitimacy of state power; and appropriate beneficial conditions of state takeover. The most frequent reasons for state intervention involve concerns about equity, accountability, and different effectiveness levels of schools with similar resources and populations. A discussion of the issue of state legitimacy concludes that the state has the legitimate power to intervene. However, the extent to which responsibility is part of such power is less clearly defined. Recommendations specify that future state takeovers must provide usable expertise and resources to the local schools involved, utilize  multidimensional evaluations of school effectiveness, and clearly define state and local functions. Finally, because the primary reason for intervention is the protection of children's rights, cooperation is crucial. (20 references) (LMI)",

Agreements cover topics such as teacher evaluation, staff development, site-based management, and curriculum development. The pilot trust agreement study tests the proposition that labor relations and school reform can be linked effectively. The initial results are encouraging.

Interviews and historical research explore the impact of the \"welfare capitalism\" of the Endicott Shoe Corporation and International Business Machines on Harrison City, New York, from 1890 through the present. An analysis of the history of recurring community deference to paternalistic leadership in Harrison City indicates the power and ability of this leadership model to satisfy community needs in the educational and economic systems. Just as characteristics of paternalistic leadership varied with each leader, community deference or resistance to paternalism fluctuated with changes in social, political, economic, and emotional community structures. Findings  of the study document patterns of active community resistance. Community deference accorded to paternalistic leadership depended upon the degree to which the leader was able to successfully transform a work or educational ideology into a positive community ethos. The complexities of this reciprocal relationship contribute to either public deference and loyalty or public resistance and possible usurpation of the paternalistic leader. (10 references) (LMI)",

The  findings indicate that male advisors acting as brokers were instrumental in obtaining positions, and that mentoring was perceived as a less important factor.

        "description":"The examination of school organization from a cultural perspective focuses on value orientation and commitment in elementary and secondary schools, and relates the predicted cultural differences to specific organizational and demographic attributes. A cluster-sampling procedure first selected schools as the unit of analysis, and then selected teachers from each school. A survey of teachers from 53 elementary schools and 51 high schools yielded a 83.6 percent response rate. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and multiple regression were the primary methods of data analysis. The findings suggest that differences in organizational culture exist between elementary and high schools, and that such differences are not a function of demographic or organizational variables. A  second finding indicates that the higher the level of normative value orientation, the higher the level of teacher organizational commitment. Normative controls therefore generate higher levels of teacher commitment. Finally, the results failed to confirm any relationship between personal characteristics of teachers and differences in organizational culture. This suggests that school culture exists independently of individual traits. The implications for administrative practice are that different school cultures require different administrative practices. (43 references) (LMI)",

        "description":"The call for limits on the enrollment of students in classes has continued to grow during the past decade despite questions regarding whether class size really makes a difference in instructional effectiveness. The purpose of the research reported here is to establish what the states have actually done to reduce class size in kindergarten through grade 6. Responses to a profile analysis assessment instrument sent to the state education agencies for each of the 50 states plus the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands,, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are analyzed. Two tables show the caps on class size, the classrooms needed, the process used to determine the classrooms needed, and how the new classroom construction was financed. Of the 24 states  with mandates to reduce class size, only three (Alabama, California, and South Carolina) conducted a needs assessment to determine the number of classrooms needed to meet the mandates. This study verifies the failure of the states to adequately address the issues of reducing class size as a means to improving student achievement. It illuminates the fact that states have passed mandates but have not conducted a needs assessment of the new classrooms required to meet the mandates. It verifies also that the local school systems are being held responsible for meeting the mandates in both policy and finance without state support in the vast majority of cases.

(2) how many of these students could also be considered to be at risk for failure in school and/or life? (3) how often is special education used as an intervention strategy for at-risk students? and (4) how effective is special education as an intervention strategy? All students were enrolled in regular fourth, seventh, or tenth grade classes. The study found 2,179 students identified as special education students, of whom approximately 64% were categorized as learning disabled. Application of a scale of 45 factors contributing to  risk showed that about 63% of special education students met the criterion of being at risk as contrasted to 22% of the regular education population. The data also indicated that principals (N=276) and teachers (N=9,652) view special education as one of the more appropriate and effective intervention strategies for use with at-risk students.

The report centers on parents of exceptional students who are from low socioeconomic levels or differing ethnic groups, or are geographically isolated. The task force identified issues revolving around questions of policy, resources, commitment, and implementation, citing needs for more adequate policy and coordinated services, more adequate funding, more effective use of training materials, greater sensitivity and understanding of culturally diverse families, and greater interagency understanding of  existing policies and procedures affecting minority and isolated parent involvement. Recommendations call for development of policies, procedures, and programs focused on overcoming barriers; use of collaborative interagency efforts; identification of multiple funding sources; and provision of comprehensive training for parents and professionals addressing cultural and economic diversity.

Subjects were 10 EMH children, aged 11-13, with mental-aged matched controls. Repair behaviors were elicited using a picture description and matching game with a barrier between the subject and the experimenter. Action picture cards were used to elicit specific descriptions, and on some of the trials the experimenter indicated a need for clarification of the descriptions. Fourteen categories were created to code the children's repair responses, such as whole repetition, partial repetition, expansion with detail, expansion by specifying referent, irrelevant or inappropriate information, no response, concluding comment, delayed  response, and self-correction. Findings indicated that subjects in both groups used all 14 categories of repair strategy with the exception of one category, &quot;concluding comment,&quot; which the normal children did not use. EMH children produced significantly more &quot;no responses&quot; than did the normal children. Both groups used &quot;expansion with detail&quot; most often to repair their utterances, but the normal subjects produced significantly more repairs of this type. It is concluded that EMH children have the ability to perceive the needs of their listeners and revise their utterances accordingly. Includes 16 references. (JDD)",

Written in outline style, the paper briefly describes project activities and general conclusions. Phase I of the project documented the nature and extent of the problem. It was concluded that people with disabilities experience at least 150% greater risk for sexual abuse/assault than their nondisabled peers of the same age and sex. Paid caregivers account for about one-third of the abuse, and vulnerability is increased by learned helplessness, limitations on communication, lack of sex education, and other factors. Phase II, the current phase of the project, stresses the identification and development of appropriate strategies  for prevention of assault and abuse, and treatment of victims and offenders. It focuses on the areas of family involvement, education, health care, counseling services, transportation, institutional care, vocational services, social services, law enforcement, judicial and legislative reforms, offender programs, and the consultation process.

In the model, which is derived from work at the Boston Children's Hospital Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) program, neuropsychological outcomes are determined by an interaction between various potential contributing risk factors and the timing of the central nervous system (CNS) disease process and treatments. The model incorporates these factors in a framework with particular emphasis on the differential impact of the disease process relative to the child's stage of brain development. CNS manifestations early in brain development result in more global neuropsychological effects due to a less  differentiated state of neurological and neuropsychological development, while later manifestations result in relatively more specific and subtle effects. A better understanding of the neuropsychological profiles of children with AIDS has implications for development of specific and appropriate cognitive and academic interventions.

The report reviews relevant medical facts, discusses federal and state laws which define the rights and responsibilities of disabled individuals and service providers, explains how these laws apply to persons with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, and provides information for rational policymaking. The report offers a detailed review of five major areas of the law: antidiscrimination, HIV testing and medical treatment, confidentiality and provider liability, isolation and involuntary civil commitment, and federal benefit and entitlement programs. These areas are discussed  in relation to topics such as housing and residential facilities, health care, child welfare services, day care and education, vocational training, and employment. Within the chapters, sections summarize the legal rules or principles, analyze major statutes and legal principles, and pose a series of questions and provide answers applying the laws to practical situations. A glossary and approximately 250 references are included. (JDD)",

The program was designed to be participant-driven and district-based; it sought to increase the knowledge base and instructional competencies in self-selected and locally determined areas. The program evaluation for the 1988-89 school year, the program's second year of operation, assessed the planning and implementation processes and examined the impact on participants and their students, through interviews with several sources and review of program documents. Findings are presented in the  areas of program process, participant levels, participant feedback, and program achievements. Overall, participants' opinions of QUIPP were very positive. However, time and expediency constraints restricted the level of involvement of school-based members in the process of planning and organizing the programs. Several recommendations conclude the report. (JDD)",

The Writing to Read System is a multisensory, multimedia literacy program and involves five types of materials: a computer-based instructional program; correlated student work journals; word processing; language-development activities; and use of read-along tapes of children's literature. Students use the program for 1 hour each day. Pretests and posttests given 2 months apart were used to evaluate the program. Major findings indicated that, on standardized reading tests, kindergarten and primary special education students receiving the Writing to Read instruction progressed almost five  times faster than did students in the comparison group. In addition, the Writing to Read System proved to be an effective intervention strategy for students who had been referred for special education testing but who had not yet been tested or placed.

After selected questions, the interviewer either nodded his head &quot;yes&quot; or shook his head &quot;no&quot; or did neither, providing a cue to the subjects as to what response the interviewer desired. As a second experimental manipulation, subjects were interviewed by either a familiar person or someone they did not know. Results indicated that subjects were significantly influenced by the interviewers' head-nodding, thereby supporting the hypothesis that acquiescent responding among the mentally retarded is a form of maximizing reinforcement by  submitting to others.

Subjects were asked to list such behaviors in four categories: environmental behaviors, interpersonal behaviors, self-related behaviors, and task-related behaviors. The resulting list of 214 behaviors was collapsed into a 34-item social skill ranking list. In Phase II, the list was administered to 53 regular education teachers and 68 special education teachers. In Phase III, the list was administered to 129 students in regular and special education junior high and high school programs in southern Illinois. Results indicated that there is a generic set  of social skills agreed upon by teachers as being important for successful classroom functioning across special and regular education settings. There was a general level of agreement on the social skills which the teachers ranked as most/least important to functioning successfully in the classroom. Student groups were generally aware of the social skills which were most/least important to teachers in the classrooms.

Subjects were 60 general educators, their 60 most difficult-to-teach nonhandicapped pupils, and 22 consultants, representing 17 elementary schools in a large metropolitan school system. The teachers were assigned randomly to a short (N=24) or long (N=24) version of the prereferral intervention or to a control group (N=12). Analyses indicated that the two variants of the prereferral intervention improved teacher perceptions of their difficult-to-teach students, and decreased referrals for testing and possible special education placement. Moreover, results suggested that the short  and long versions were equally effective. Implications for consultation-related activity are discussed. Contains 21 references. (Author)",

        "description":"The High School State Incentive Grant was established to improve the quality of instruction given to New York students with handicaps by providing high school special education teachers with an intensive staff development program designed and implemented at the school, district, and citywide levels. The program consisted of three major components: on-site training, boroughwide initiatives (BWI), and central staff development. Among findings of the evaluation report are that all three components were implemented as planned. BWI provided training, curriculum development, and Academy of Basic Skills (ABS) teacher training. Central staff development provided instruction in Computerease, Instrumental Enrichment, the Academy of Basic Skills, and paraprofessional training. More than 50%  of participants considered on-site training and ABS instruction, curriculum, and training to be of superior quality. The on-site training component approximated but did not meet its objective of providing 25 hours of training during the 1988-89 school year. The on-site training component effected a positive change in the total level of knowledge of 75% of the teacher-respondents and increased 57% of the respondents' levels of communication with general education personnel. Recommendations include involving teacher-trainees in development of on-site training plans and expanding the ABS program to more schools. (DB)",

The program's mission was to develop and implement a three-semester program of intense occupational, vocational, and career education to enhance job skills and secure retail sales jobs for high school juniors with mild learning, speech, emotional, or intellectual disabilities. In 1988-89 Project STARS served 106 students at seven high schools. Project evaluation indicated that Project STARS satisfactorily implemented four activity areas: teacher training, curriculum development, classroom instruction, and workshops. Evaluation also indicated that 74% of students rated all STARS activities very favorably, particularly the practical preparation for job interviews, for finding and  retaining jobs, and the psychological preparation such as increasing self confidence. Project STARS teachers identified the same program aspects as most successful. More than 94% of the students reported that their level of knowledge and self-esteem had been positively affected and 38% of the students reported that they had acquired jobs. Among recommendations are setting aside a class period for Project STARS workshops at the beginning of the semester and making time available for Project STARS teachers to follow up on students at job sites.

The SETRC training program targeted four objective areas: educational personnel, local needs, parents, and information dissemination. SETRC provided a total of 8,161 hours of training in 1988-89 falling short of the proposed number but providing an increase in the average number of hours offered per trainer. SETRC trainers met or exceeded the training objectives for occupational education personnel, support personnel, and special  education personnel but did not meet the objectives for serving Limited English Proficiency personnel, preschool personnel, and parents but did increase efforts over the previous year. Trainers expressed satisfaction with the training. Administrators were overwhelmingly satisfied with the SETRC training and would have liked to utilize trainers more. Parents and educational personnel who used services of the Resource Centers responded favorably to this component. Recommendations included provision of a specific number of hours for technical assistance and enhancement of publicity to attract users to the Resource Centers. (DB)",

Information was obtained from interviews with project directors who were asked about their project experiences, the features and design principles essential to the success of their projects, the problems they encountered, and how these problems could be resolved. After a brief discussion of technology transfer, information is presented according to three major stages in assistive technology development: designing to fit user needs; prototype development, testing, and evaluation; and distribution. Key features of 10 projects contributing to the report are summarized in tabular form and include information on  project director and organization, grant or contract period, prototype educational aid, function, functional limitations, and features. An appendix charts accessibility features in relation to user characteristics (such as physical impairments, visual impairments, hearing impairments, or seizure disorders) as well as features to facilitate third party manufacturers for all five disability areas. Name, address, and telephone number of five current OSEP projects promoting the use of assistive technology are also appended. Twenty-eight additional resources are suggested. (DB)",

The project's three phases included preliminary activities relevant to the development of the evaluation system; activities in developing, field testing, and revising the evaluation strategy; and selecting and evaluating the transition programs. Twenty-one of the 123 school districts in Maine participated. The system was designed to allow the state education agency to conduct further longitudinal study and to track the progress of individuals receiving transition services. The study contributed the following major findings, among others: (1) a significant number of local education agencies are not addressing transition needs in a formalized way; (2)  successful transition programming shares some components with special education, such as referral and assessment, interagency collaboration, use of functional curricula, and active participation of parents and students; and (3) components unique to transition programs are not as successfully implemented, including community involvement, quantity and quality of job placements, student follow-up, postsecondary educational placements, and adjustment to community living.

        "description":"Educators need to understand the grieving process that parents often experience when they learn their child has a handicapping condition. The diagnosis of a handicapping condition may result in a symbolic death--the death of the preconceived \"perfect\" child, and the death of the parents' plans, hopes, and dreams for that child. The stages of grief as identified by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross can provide structure for addressing the emotional experiences of many parents as they come to terms with having a child who is handicapped. The stages are: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. These stages, as well as initial feelings of shock and the continual need for adjustment, need to be understood by professionals who work with parents of children identified as having  handicapping conditions.

The data gathered focused on: (1) job engagement time; (2) extent of interaction with work supervisor, human service supervisor, nonhandicapped co-worker, handicapped co-worker, or other; (3) type of interaction (receiving, providing, or requesting assistance; receiving or providing instruction; receiving or providing social amenities; receiving or providing compliments; receiving or providing criticism; receiving or providing teasing; or work conservation); and (4) the job task, setting variables, and inappropriate behaviors. Results indicated  that workers in individual and enclave employment sites had significantly more contact with nondisabled persons than workers in work crews, but there was no difference in the social contact rate between workers in individual jobs and those in enclaves. There was a wide variation in the amount of interaction with nondisabled persons in the different individual and enclave sites, but little difference in the type of interactions across the three different work options.

Initial observations were of mainstream classes containing no learning-disabled students. Observations were again conducted after LD students had been mainstreamed for 8 months. Eleven LD students were observed in five classrooms containing 89 nonhandicapped students in grades 1-5. Behaviors were coded in five areas: type of materials, grouping arrangement, person monitoring the activity, student response, and teacher response. Analyses of the observation data revealed no significant changes in teachers' behaviors after the implementation of the full-time mainstreaming program. Overall, nonhandicapped students  spent the same amount of time reading in reading class and doing math in math class. Nonhandicapped students continued to be actively engaged in academic instruction about 35-40% of class time. Off-task behavior did not change significantly in reading and decreased significantly in math. Student time devoted to waiting and management decreased significantly in reading; and in both reading and math classes, teachers assigned less class time to workbooks and worksheets.

The paper discusses cultural, socioeconomic, and political factors that impinge upon implementation of Section 8 and the need for continuous policy evaluation in Nigeria. An overview of Nigeria's economic and political situation is provided. Section 8 is described as an equivalent of Public Law 94-142 in the United States, instituted in Nigeria in 1977. Section 8 attempts to provide education for all handicapped children while recognizing their roles in the development of the nation, and to develop skills of the exceptionally gifted so that they can foster economic and technological advancements. The  policy appears to have been bothered by a lack of accountability at all levels, and is plagued by endemic problems of culture, socioeconomics, and politics. Continuous evaluation of the policy is recommended, in order to detect how far the policy has helped in restructuring and formulating a new society, influencing curriculum changes, and promoting democratic ideals.

No significant differences in the effects of behavioral instruction were found associated with race, sex, educational level, or educational setting). Other results included statements by most service providers that instructional time was at least equalled by time saved.

State foreign language supervisors and others responsible for international education at the state level were surveyed concerning the changes that have occurred in their states based on the report's recommendations. The survey focused on changes in enrollments, languages offered, course requirements, teacher certification requirements, and state level leadership. Results from the 36 respondents and other information from earlier reports are presented. One of the strongest indicators of change is sharply increased foreign language  enrollment in individual states and throughout the country. This change is traced to the return of foreign language requirements at all educational levels. The number of languages taught has also increased substantially. Ten states have added foreign language specialists at the state level. International studies have drawn attention only recently. Obstacles to continued expansion in both areas include funding, public attitudes, teacher recruitment, retention, development, articulation, and scheduling.

It is also suggested that these three features can be markers of foregrounding in discourse, highlighting, or giving discourse prominence to that part of the utterance with which they enter into construction. It is concluded that while a sentence-based grammar can not account for the way in which these items are used in everyday discourse, when seen in the  broader context, as part of a pattern of addressee-oriented features, their function may be more properly appreciated.

The analysis draws on transcriptions of conversations among a group of women friends over a period of months. It is proposed that the conventional treatment of these forms as &quot;weak&quot; is inappropriate in all-female discourse. In friendly, all-female conversation, these linguistic forms function as cooperative devices. Women use minimal responses to signal active listening and support for the current speaker, and to mark recognition of the different stages of conversational development. Hedges are used to respect the face needs of all participants, negotiate sensitive topics, and encourage participation. Tag questions also encourage participation, but among women  friends are more often used to check the taken-for-granted nature of what is being asserted, monitoring group support. Misunderstanding of these and other aspects of women's linguistic style arises from the misunderstanding of female subculture. Typical features can be shown to be functional in terms of the goals of all-female interaction, a characteristics of mutual support and solidarity, and can not be dismissed as weak or tentative.

Data are drawn from conversations between women, who were asked to \"get to know each other,\" and interviews with 34 women and 6 men in an elderly day care center. The second source group was used only to support the distribution evidence from the first group. Disclosure of chronological age (DCA) occurred in 75% of the intergenerational conversations and in 80% of the elderly interviews. In the intergenerational conversations, the older participant generally disclosed her age first, and in the interviews, the older adult generally disclosed age early in the interaction, and often in response to questions about health. From the analysis of DCA discourse contexts, it is  concluded that elderly DCA can be treated as functional and strategic. What particularly seems to distinguish early age-related discourse is the multiple-layering of identity and \"face\" considerations. Face can also be lost during DCA sequences. It appears that DCA offers an opportunity for elderly individuals to evaluate, within conversation, where they stand developmentally. (MSE)",

The first of these is to critically assess the validity of orthodox variationist approaches as applied to similar language situations and the second is to produce the outline of an alternative approach that would work in this and other language situations as well. The operation of restrictions against the co-occurrence of any given linguistic variables, which occur within the clause in the Guyanese Creole-to-English continuum, are examined for the past tense marker variable (&quot;bin, did, and woz&quot;) and the continuative aspect variable (&quot;a-&quot; and &quot;-in&quot; operating with the verb). The evolution of the continuum is linked to the distinct function and social prestige associated with certain stereotyped  linguistic features, and the linguistic stereotyping likely to have occurred in a language situation involving initial contact between English and conservative Guyanese Creole is examined. It is suggested that the co-occurrence restriction rules emerged as a result of social, not linguistic, factors. It is proposed that in Guyana, the appearance of two variants of the same variable in the speech of most speakers represents switching between two or more immediately adjacent varieties on the continuum.

Two were born between 1910 and 1920, and two between 1944 and 1950. One individual in each pair was upper middle class and one was not, and no change of social status occurred during the period of the study. The linguistic features examined in the speech of the individuals include chain shifting and lexical diffusion. The three following conclusions are drawn: (1) lengthened vowels do not follow the pattern of chain shifting proposed in previous research; (2) the hypothesis that lexical diffusion is necessarily ultimately resolved is not supported; and (3) fine acoustic phonetic analysis demonstrates that  phonological changes can continue after adolescence for native speakers of a dialect. The change is not conscious, and is more significant for speakers whose phonology was originally more conservative. (MSE)",

Aristotle taught that a definition points to the essence of something, perhaps by naming it, and then describes it. Popper criticized this approach to definition as overly verbose in that it invites an infinite regression of definitions, and is not helpful in understanding the universe. It is proposed here that, as in other disciplines, many sociolinguists follow the Aristotelian method of definition. Ways to avoid even the appearance of essentialism in definitions include the following: (1) giving definitions that connote right-to-left orientation (e.g., &quot;the study of language in relation to society is called sociolinguistics&quot; rather than&quot;sociolinguistics is the study of language in relation to society&quot;); (2) avoiding use of the term &quot;proving&quot; in philosophically and methodologically sensitive contexts; and (3) not giving the impression that only the concepts that the speaker is addressing are difficult to define and others are not, when in reality no concept can be precisely or ultimately defined. It is concluded that essentialist sociolinguistics is untenable and should be abandoned. (MSE)",

Results indicate that dialect lexis loss was neither as thorough nor as abrupt as older informants represented. The contradiction appeared to stem from a decrease in the use of certain terms, rather than curtailed use, of which the older generation was more aware. Adults altered their speech in deference to children's education, and older speakers who have not adjusted to changes in everyday speech felt eccentric and out of touch. The young were perceived to be foul-mouthed. Most parents were unwilling to enforce their  language standards, with the dividing line between roughness and respectability disappearing. Younger speakers seemed to categorize Scots as slang. These changes resemble a generation gap in language. The findings suggest that the nonstandard forms of language persist without expressing a distinctive conceptual order. Unevenness in linguistic change is what would be expected of the spontaneous convergence of one language variety on another. (MSE)",

In District Six, non-standard Afrikaans seems to be a mixed code, and it is unclear whether non-standard English is a mixed code. Consequently, it is unclear when codes are being switched or mixed. The analysis looks at features of the non-standard dialects that are either directly traceable to the other language or are parallel to equivalent structures in the other language. This analysis includes lexical and morpho-syntactic features. It is argued that while the use of the mixed code, non-standard Afrikaans is much more common than code-switching, many instances of intra-clausal switches occur. Closer examination suggests that the point at which codes are  switched is not necessarily the exact point at which one language ends and the other begins, but may be located some distance away at a bridge element (a word or phrase). It is unknown whether these shifts are just individual speakers' errors or eccentricities, a product of transitional instability as the speech community shifts toward English, or early signs of the development of a common structural and lexical stock to be freely mixed by speakers.

Specifically, the study examined the frequency of glottalized variants of three voiceless stops, and treated variation by sex as separate from, not a byproduct of, variation by class. Subjects were four male and four female adults from professional families and four female and four male adults who were in unskilled occupations or unemployed. An analysis of the patterns shows an effect of class and a much larger effect of sex. Results suggest that the glottalization considered characteristic of Tyneside vernacular is better described as a male rather than a working class norm. Supporting data from the vowel patterns of the same speakers  suggest that consonant variables are more likely than vowel variables to function as sex markers. It is concluded that it is inappropriate to develop a sociolinguistic theory that attempts to explain sex differences in terms of class, and to account for the interacting effect of sex and class by invoking a stereotyped notion of women's status-consciousness.

After each sentence containing one of the forms, the children were asked whether a boy or girl had spoken, and occasionally asked to explain that choice. Analysis of the transcribed story-telling and responses show that affect was the strongest explanation for gender-marked items. Six-year-old boys appear to make judgments more in line with adult gender stereotypes. Assumptions about the kind of explanation associated with gender-marked items were largely borne out. However, it was not clear whether children fit their explanations to their  choices in some cases, or chose in terms of their explanations, which represented their understanding of the event.

        "description":"The validity of the consensus paradigm dominant in sociolinguistics is questioned. Social scientists working in this paradigm take the perspective of society as an aggregate operating through agreement between its constituent elements, working to the benefit of the aggregate. The best-known of the consensus-oriented theories is structural-functionalism (S-F), which sees society as a system of mutually supportive institutions where each institution contributes to the system as a whole, maintaining it in equilibrium. By contrast, variant theories in the conflict paradigm see the S-F concept of society as a fundamental misrepresentation. It is proposed here that theories in the conflict paradigm are more powerful than those in a consensus paradigm because they account more  comprehensively for observed phenomena in language use and learning. Further, language policies in education based on consensus theories are likely to be counterproductive for being based on invalid theories. The implication is that schools can do no more than the dominant group will allow: perpetuate structural conflict or promote assimilation. Schools can not transform dominated social groups into dominant groups. At best, schools can enhance an individual's capacity for mobility from one group to another. A society of groups with differential power coexisting in an integrated way without conflict is not possible. (MSE)",

This sociolinguistic feature has been described as marking southeastern varieties of British English and as a connected speech process (CSP) in its sensitivity to variation in speaking rate. Language style variables were sentence reading and narrative reading. Sentence reading was slow, normal, or fast. Vocalization was measured as total, partial, or not at all. Vocalization scores were found to be similar for fast sentence reading and narrative. These results are discussed in terms of the speaker's possible approaches to different speech tasks. The occurrence of &quot;/l/- clarification,&quot; in which the /l/ is moved from word-final position to the initial  position in the following word, is also examined.

The project provided bilingual instructional and support services to 240 Spanish-speaking students of limited English proficiency (LEP) and utilized computers to develop students' English skills and native language proficiency, and to offer bilingual instruction in content areas. The project also trained students to use computers for career-related purposes and offered professional development to its staff. The project met its objectives in the subjects of science and social studies and for attendance. The project failed to meets its English-as-a-Second-Language objective, although this objective had been met the previous year. The project did  not provide data on the objectives proposed for Native Language Arts, computer and career education, cultural heritage awareness, or staff development. Recommendations for program improvement include the following: (1) the purchase, if funds are available, of additional computer software; and (2) the provision of the data necessary to evaluate all the program's objectives to the Office of Research, Evaluation, and Assessment.

        "description":"A sample of 15 eighth-grade Hispanic students in a bilingual classroom were used for a descriptive analysis of students' writing samples to compare their growth between pre- and post- writing samples in Spanish and English. This was accomplished by juxtaposing English and Spanish pre- and post-tests using the same holistic rubric developed by the school district for reevaluating the writing samples. Findings suggest that development of literacy skills for bilinguals follows a normal progression. The results also suggest that a holistic technique intended not only to complement a process approach to writing, but to focus on a global impression of students' ability to communicate ideas effectively, is not sufficient to ensure fairness in evaluation. It is noted that poorly  developed holistic rubrics, which do not detect important gains or differences in writing levels, frequently mask academic potential in bilingual students and are generally biased in favor of English. To guard against these inherent biases, school districts should use more caution in assessing the academic skills of bilingual students, ensuring that they are given credit for knowledge and acquisition of skills even if these skills are not in English.

Results show native speakers are better at comprehending all varieties of English, native or non-native, than Chinese and Japanese speakers. However, native English is not always more comprehensible than non-native English to non-native listeners. The subjective reactions reveal that the subjects who listen to male speakers give the worst score in listening to the speaker they judge most difficult to comprehend, but the same is not true of those who listen to female speakers. It was also  found that the subjects identify their own native language speakers more readily than the speakers of other native languages, and that native English is as identifiable as their own English.

Sharwood Smith (1987, 1988). First, a lexical framework that offers a series of questions to help teachers discover the relevant semantic and pragmatic information associated with grammatical structures is discussed. This framework assures a more systematic approach to what otherwise seems to be an infinite range of information. It is then argued that a consideration of the semantic and pragmatic generalizations and principles associated with grammatical structure is consistent with the major goals and assumptions of GCR. Activities for building lexical knowledge about grammatical structures that correspond with GCR activities  are described, including judgment and discrimination exercises, such as drawing inferences, paraphrasing, creating context, and judging appropriateness. It is suggested that the vastness of information networks in a lexical framework necessitates teaching students various strategies that encourage schema building, associational thinking, and inferencing. These strategies sensitize learners to discovering this type of information for themselves and support language development. (MSE)",

The following five aspects of the language situation in the United States are relevant to an understanding of foreign language teaching and learning: (1) the dominance of English in American life; (2) the scarcity of foreign language instruction in the public schools; (3) the four distinct language professions (foreign language teachers, bilingual specialists, English-as-a-Second-Language teachers, and English as a native language teachers);  (4) language instruction outside the public schools, and (5) myths about language held by Americans.

The survey contained four general areas of inquiry, including: (1) items relating to parents' perceptions of, and attitudes toward, school programs and practices; (2) items relating to parents' general aspirations for their children and those related specifically to education and language learning; (3) items related to language use and to parent involvement in their children's schooling; and (4) parent  demographic characteristics. Survey findings established that parents support bilingual education in its most generic sense--giving extra help to students in order to facilitate their learning English--but generally do not go much beyond that in differentiating among types of bilingual programs. Although there were large and pervasive differences among the ethnic groups in terms of the level of their support for certain instructional strategies, parents did support special language programs for language minority children.

        "description":"Data was collected from 45-minute conversational interviews of 20 Cubans, who arrived in the United States in 1980, to analyze vocalic processes in Cuban Spanish. Four vocalic processes found in Cuban Spanish (raising and devoicing of unstressed vowels, lengthening of stressed vowels, and diphthongization of stressed mid vowels) were examined. Vowels are considered to be composed of three elementary particles: &quot;a&quot; (aperture), &quot;i&quot; (palatality), and &quot;u&quot; (labiality). Raising is characterized as an instance of decay, in which an aperture particle is lost. Devoicing is described as the addition of the &quot;devoicing&quot; punctuator &quot;o&quot; beneath particles. Lengthening is characterized by the repetition of a particle following the &quot;space&quot; punctuator. Finally, diphthongization, an instance of  fission, is represented by the addition of a tonality particle, with the &quot;half-moon&quot; punctuator to indicate non-syllabicity, after the &quot;space&quot; punctuator. In addition, these vocalic processes are related to recent studies in experimental phonetics, which suggest that a length difference is emerging between stressed and unstressed syllables, thus calling into question the traditional classification of Spanish as a syllable-timed language.

It found that the test format, as shown in the Matching Cloze Test, may be significant in predicting future academic achievement, and the content of language tests may play a role in academic achievement for each type of language program. The second study showed the direct and indirect relationships between subskills of General English and EAP tests. It found that all language subskills, regardless of content, are significantly related. The third study examined the  underlying relationships between General English and EAP tests. It found that EAP tests may predict achievement in EAP programs better than General English tests; the formats associated with each discipline tend to predict academic success in science better than those that are not related to a specific discipline; and there is a common factor shared by the EAP tests, General English tests, and knowledge of the subject matter represented by student grade point average.

Certain aspects of the adjustment are causing difficulties for persons who have applied for permanent residence.

The Pell Grant program, administered by the Department of Education's Office of Student Financial Assistance, receives more federal funds than any of the other five student financial aid programs authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 and its amendments. It offered grants ranging from $200 to $2,100 in the 1987-88 academic year to eligible students furthering their postsecondary education. During 1987-88, more than 2.8 million students received $3.75 billion in grants. The reported data provide a basis for program planning and development to help higher education officials and financial aid administrators. The report is organized into six chapters that provide the following:  highlights of the Pell Grant program; selected demographic characteristics of Pell Grant recipients; miscellaneous information about the eligibility status of applicants by income level; distribution of verified Pell Grant recipients by income and grant level; summary statistics for the multiple data entry application processing system; and summary information on institutions participating in the Pell Grant program.

        "description":"Modifying the classroom behavior of passive college students is central to the task of improving education. At Ursinus College in Pennsylvania, an Academic Orientation Workshop for freshmen was designed to communicate the college's expectations of high student involvement in classes from the outset of the student's college experience, in order to promote active learning. In the workshop, students viewed a videotape emphasizing active involvement in terms of both class participation and effective listening skills. Small group discussions about the videotape then took place. In order to measure the impact of the workshop, a follow-up study was conducted 2 months after the fall orientation program. The study assessed student attitudes about the importance and appropriateness of  active student participation in college courses. Compared to nonparticipants, students who had experienced the workshop reported that they participated more in college than high school classes, reported higher rates of oral class participation, and reported more certainty that faculty members want students to share opinions in class. An appendix contains the script used to train workshop leaders. Includes four references. (JDD)",

        "description":"The purpose of the 3-year project was to strengthen the role of experiential education as an accepted and effectively used way of teaching in a majority of postsecondary institutions and to make it available to a majority of future learners as part of the regular curriculum. Among specific objectives were assisting 160 colleges and universities to integrate experiential education into their missions and curricula; testing five models of institutional assistance, and helping campus-based advocates of experiential education to become more sophisticated in using principles of effective institutional change. The five different models of service delivery tested were: (1) on-site campus consultation; (2) regional or thematic workshops; (3) national workshop with individual  consultation; (4) national workshop only; and (5) observer institutions. Project results included assistance to 454 schools. Three models of service delivery were found to be effective and feasible in helping schools institutionalize experiential education: on-site campus consultation, regional or thematic workshops, and national workshops. It was concluded that faculty involvement in experiential education is crucial for its integration into the higher education mainstream. Appended to the document are a final project evaluation and a list of the institutions that participated. (DB)",

        "description":"The study reported in this paper is the first phase of a projected multi-phase, multi-year inquiry designed to explain how professors think about, and go about, teaching. This preliminary phase examined the attitudes of 15 faculty members in 5 disciplines (anthropology, English, history, mathematics, and psychology) toward the teaching aspects of his/her position. Interviews were conducting using a protocol of seven open-ended questions: (1) how did you become a college professor? (2) what kind of preparation did you have for teaching in higher education? (3) how did you come to teach as you do and what person do you use as a model or try to emulate? (4) how do you prepare for class? (5) what do you most want to achieve in your teaching of students? (6) how do you know whether or  not you have been successful in achieving those ends? and (7) how do you feel about teaching? A major finding was that each of the professors interviewed held one of four different paradigms of teaching--transmission of information; communication with students; \"doing\" the discipline; and personal development. Paradigm choice had no necessary relationship to disciplines studied. Across paradigms, professors differed in the methods they used, their attitudes toward students, and in whether or not, or how much, they enjoyed teaching. Contains 23 references. (DB)",

It focuses on how individual team members, who report directly to the president, make sense of their own and each other's activities on the team (for example, by constructing certain types or roles) rather than on the nature of effects of the activities themselves. Seventy administrators at 15 campuses were interviewed concerning the administrative team's organization, functions, and internal dynamics. Analysis revealed the following typical roles: (1) definer (creating the team's reality), (2) analyst (exploring and mapping the team's reality), (3) interpreter (predicting what others are likely to see), (4)  critic (redefining, reanalyzing, and reinterpreting the team's reality), (5) synthesizer (orchestrating what the team knows), (6) disparity monitor (gauging what outsiders think), (7) task monitor (keeping the team on course), and (8) emotional monitor (remembering emotions). Teams were also analyzed on the basis of how clearly cognitive roles were articulated in the areas of: role content and quality of role performance, stage of team development and team integration, role prevalence, role configuration, cognitive differentiation and cognitive complexity, and management of cognitive differentiation.

The focus is on how campus members learn about the institution's financial condition and their attitudes toward the institution's resource strategies. Special attention is given to the views of persons outside the top administrative circle. The college, which has been given the pseudonym of Continental College in this report, was one of eight institutions participating in a study of organizational and leadership dynamics and experiencing various degrees of resource stress. Interviews with up to 15 administrators, faculty, and trustees were conducted on each campus to elicit personal views of leadership and campus life. In regard to Continental College conflicting views emerged, with some  interviewees reporting that the college is very organized, efficient, and task-centered while others felt that the task orientation is distancing and depersonalizing. Faculty appeared more attuned to contradictions than did administrators. Views are presented in terms of the following: stability as appearance and reality, \"organization\" as resource strategy, learning in bureaucracy (e.g., nature of information flows, different learning roles), experience as the \"flip side\" of structure, and evaluation. The case of Continental College raises three concerns: (1) that financial stability is not necessarily associated with faculty vitality; (2) that the organizational images of control and stability may shield stressful and disordered internal realities; and (3) that concerns about learning  are separated all too frequently from concerns about leadership.

        "description":"A case study approach was used to examine reasons for success and failure among high-risk students at a community college. The impact of academic and social integration was assessed in terms of success, as defined both by the students and by institutional standards. Two surveys of 563 first-time enrolled students in 1984 and a later follow-up of 173 of these students in 1987 indicated that an intervention program for high-risk students appeared to be effective, but more than half of the 1987 respondents still indicated they had not achieved their personal and academic goals. Twenty students, selected to represent a stratified sample of success, were interviewed. Students who were defined as successful by both college standards and self-report tended to report good relationships  with other students, faculty, and counselors. In contrast, students lacking either college-defined or self-reported success reported few friendships positive for growth and lack of a strong relationship with at least one faculty member. It was concluded that success or failure was, in large part, based on: (1) the interactions between faculty and students; (2) the perceptions, attitudes, and values of the students regarding their experiences at the college; and (3) student goals and \"intentions\" for attending college.

An examination of South African faculty perspectives was compared and contrasted witht U.S. faculty perspectives and was interpreted in relation to the cross-cultural relations that exist in the two countries. Faculty attitudes were compared through the use of a written survey. Based on the responses received, South African faculty (N=112) were found to be more consistent than U.S. faculty (N=97) and clearly indicated a preference for faculty dominance in the classroom (compared to U.S. preference for diversity and permissiveness). It was maintained that the reason for this was that South African faculty members, having less interaction with  culturally different people, do not recognize that there are cultural perspectives other than those held by their own cultural group. It is noted that as long as this condition exists in the South African classroom, the communicative climate in the classroom will result in negative cross-cultural relations and the hampering of social change.

Results of the survey showed that students often did not know how or for what purpose the evaluations were to be used. They were also uncertain as to whether such evaluations were used in determining pay raises and/or promotions. Students indicated that they do  take teaching evaluations seriously despite their uncertainty about whether professors take the evaluations seriously. It appeared that student ratings are not significantly undermined by their incomplete knowledge of the process or their uncertainty regarding how professors felt about the evaluations, but providing students with information about the uses of teaching evaluations would help reduce cynicism and improve lines of communication between students and their professors.

        "description":"The Institute of International Education outlines the forces behind the new wave of international cooperative ventures in higher education and the challenges they pose through a systematic focus on the Japan-United States transactions. Focus is placed on two prototypes: (1) U.S. accredited institutions setting up a cooperative venture in Japan to offer U.S. accredited courses, and (2) Japanese institutions setting up either a cooperative venture or an autonomous institution in the United States to offer courses that will receive credit in Japan. Chapter 1 describes differences in beliefs which can lead to reactions of dismay and resistance for these new cooperative ventures. Chapter 2, in tracing the evolution of the new ventures, points to their positive elements as well.  Chapter 3 discusses some of the typical problems that emerge during negotiations. Chapter 4 examines the performance to date of these institutions in realizing their educational objectives. Chapter 5 takes up issues concerning the use of public resources and the protection of public purposes in higher education. Chapter 6 reviews of the accreditation process as it applies to international cooperative ventures. Chapter 7 offers some reflections on the challenges posed by the new arrangements.

        "description":"A national study of social conditions on college campuses found that college officials were concerned about alcohol and drug abuse, crime, breakdown of civility, racial tensions, sex discrimination, and a diminishing commitment to teaching and learning. In response to those findings, this book proposes that both academic and civic standards be clarified and that the enduring values that undergird a community of learning be precisely defined. Six principles are presented that provide a formula for day-to-day decision making on the campus and define the kind of community every college and university should strive to be: (1) a purposeful community, (2) an open community, (3) a just community, (4) a disciplined community, (5) a caring community, and (6) a celebrative community.  Appendices present detailed results of the 1989 national survey by the Carnegie Foundation that formed the basis for this report. The survey identified campus life issues of concern, as perceived by 382 responding institutions in the National Survey of College and University Presidents and 355 responding institutions in the 1989 National Survey of Chief Student Affairs Officers by the American Council on Education and the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators. The survey also analyzed views on improving campus life, actions likely to improve campus life, and changes over 5 years in specific problem areas. Reference notes accompany each chapter. (JDD)",

A total of 1,043 students in the 1984 entering freshman class in the College of Engineering at Pennsylvania State University served as the population. Three models were developed to predict sophomore persistence and success at different points in time: pre-enrollment, freshman year, and sophomore year. For the pre-enrollment model, the variables best predicting success were high-school grade point average, algebra score, gender, non-science points, chemistry score, and reason for engineering choice. For the freshman year model, best predictors included grades in Physics I, Calculus I,  and Chemistry I. In the sophomore year model, the variables of grades in Calculus II, Physics II, and Physics I were the best predictors. Thus, it was found that the variables which are predictive depend on the student's point of progress through the first 2 years of an engineering program. Includes four references. (JDD)",

The typical introductory class is dedicated to the notion of coverage, and textbooks and tests are material artifacts supporting the ideal of coverage. Also in most introductory courses, students assume an acquiescent and non-authoritative status vis-a-vis the authority of the text and the teacher. The proposed approach involves studying in depth one \"eminent contributor\" to the field of psychology. For 8 weeks of the course, students write short reports on several contributors, recommend papers for other students to read, and write position papers explaining the pros and cons of studying the various  contributors. Following \"campaigning\" and a series of votes, the class chooses one contributor to concentrate on. Students then conduct an inquiry into that individual, reading works by and about him/her, and writing papers. Course grades are based on the students' degree of participation in the project and their peers' perceived value of each student's participation. Limitations of the technique are noted, and six references are cited. (JDD)",

The critics are Russell Kirk (conservative), Robert Maynard Hutchins (middle ground), and Harold Taylor (liberal); and their views are presented within the framework of six concepts: (1) outlook toward man, (2) curriculum, (3) stance toward control of one's education, (4) who should have an education, (5) use or non-use of science, and (6) process. Outlook toward man ranges from &quot;perfectibility&quot; (students can make their own academic decisions) to &quot;depraved&quot; (students must be kept in line through discipline). Curriculum is viewed in a range from liberalizing to utilitarian types of courses. The control of one's education is  argued from the notions of prescriptive versus free elective. The use or non-use of science in education is argued within the context of the behavioristic versus humanistic controversy, while the question of who should have an education is part of the elitist-democratic continuum considered by all critics of higher education. The final concept to be analyzed is process, that is, rationalism (in which decisions are made to conform to postulated truths) versus instrumentalism (which views the individual as the criterion for decision and process as more important than substance).

The compendium is comprised of four sections: Section 1 was developed from a series of site-visit interviews with senior-level decision makers, faculty, staff and handicapped students at six colleges and universities. It contains an overview of accessibility issues and problems that require attention, a discussion of how accessibility  considerations can be incorporated into a planning and budgeting process, and a set of guidelines for assessing specific accommodation requests; Section 2 reviews 16 national data bases that describe the handicapped population in the United States and contains summary charts of the characteristics revealed. Section 3 describes the results of a survey that NACUBO mailed to a stratified sample of 944 of its member institutions concerning trends in accessibility expenditures and number and types of handicapped students served; and Section 4 lists adaptive education equipment by impairment (such as hearing or mobility) and then by function (such as writing or speaking).

        "description":"Different ways student-generated learning issues are used to deal with disciplinary content were assessed at seven North American medical schools with problem-based curricula. Structured interviews with key faculty representing the schools being studied suggested that the seven programs are encouraging the development of self-directed learning skills to differing degrees. Reports from administrators and librarians also suggested that at those schools where student-generated learning issues have been de-emphasized in favor of faculty learning objectives and reading lists, students may not be helped to become independent self-directed learners by that aspect of the curriculum. It is postulated that when students are given specific reading assignments and are not evaluated on their  self-directed learning skills, the motivation for self-directed learning is likely to be diminished. It is also assumed that students at the problem-based learning programs that are using their own learning issues are developing self-directed learning skills through the process involved in case discussions; an assumption that requires validation.

Topics ranged from hand-held calculators to the use of main-frame computers and the assessment of the SPSSX, SPSS, LINDO, and MINITAB computer software packages. Hand-held calculators are being increasingly used in college and university classes. As this trend continues, it is forecasted that more institutions of higher education will either have to supply calculators for student use or require all students to buy the same type of calculator. Many computer software packages were used in college and university classrooms: LINDO was found to be good for use in courses involving contemporary mathematics, managerial accounting, and management  of operation systems; MINITAB was good for quantitative analysis courses in business administration programs, in basic statistics courses, and in other statistics related courses; and SPSS and SPSSX, two very similar statistical software packages, were good for courses in basic statistics, advanced statistics, business administration analysis, education research, social science research, and psychological research. The implementation of these software programs was considered helpful in equipping students to face the challenges of the twenty-first century. Contains eight references. (GLR)",

Findings showed that students seemed to adjust relatively well to American higher education, but were still struggling to adjust in financial, communication/language, and social/cultural areas. Female students seemed to perceive the verbally related adjustment problems as more difficult than male students. Length of stay in the United States and geographic location were significant factors in adjustment level. The variables of age, academic classification, religion, and family status did not seem to be significant adjustment factors. Recommendations are made for further study. Includes 14 references.

This monograph defines responsible citizenship in a democratic society and its requisite skills; reviews higher education's role in civic education; identifies ways colleges and universities can help develop the skills and requirements of citizenship and public life; and presents ways that campuses can create a new environment for learning about the civic life, through teaching, governance, extracurricular activities, campus life, and community relations. Six approaches to civic education are presented, including: (1) cultural traditions and classical education, (2)  community and public service and experiential education, (3) studies of leadership, (4) general and liberal arts education, (5) civic or public leadership education, and (6) other education such as international studies and philanthropy.

The report summarizes the information gathered from surveys of 26 library associations and agencies that were known providers of CE in Washington and in-depth interviews with representatives of the providers. Chapter 1 is the executive summary and chapter 2 introduces the project. Definitions of CE are discussed in chapter 3, followed by a consideration of cooperation and coordination of CE activities in chapter 4. Chapter 5 describes providers of CE in Washington, analyzes the potential target audiences, and makes recommendations about a needs assessment for CE. Motivation for participants in  CE--i.e., the individual learner, the employing library administrators, and CE providers--is discussed in chapter 6. Chapter 7 discusses the promotion of CE activities. Chapter 8 defines quality CE in terms of the criteria established by the National Council on Quality Continuing Education of the Continuing Library Education Network and Exchange Round Table of the American Library Association and examines current CE activities in Washington with particular attention to needs assessment, learning objectives, design, presentation, and evaluation. Chapter 9 discusses current funding of CE in Washington with particular attention to the contract between the Washington State Library and the University of Washington Graduate School of Library and Information Science. Chapter 10 discusses  leadership and responsibility for CE in Washington. Finally, chapter 11 summarizes the major themes of the study. Eleven appendixes include a 19-item bibliography and a copy of the survey form. (19 references) (GL)",

Examples are provided of the use of compact disks for the storage and retrieval of counselling and research information. To demonstrate the role of information technology in information dissemination, applications of computer conferencing for enhancing the tutoring and learning process at the British Open University are reviewed, and the potential of the French Teletel system for educational uses is discussed. Also considered are applications of computer technology in the creation of information through word processing, desktop publishing, and electronic publishing. Electronic spreadsheets, computer simulations,  and micro-worlds are then discussed as tools for information analysis and information transformation. It is noted that two of the major obstacles limiting the use of information technology are shortage of qualified and experienced staff and hardware and software obsolescence, and remedies are suggested. Four rationales for information technology in education--social, vocational, pedagogic, and catalytic--are outlined. The paper concludes with a review of the use of information technology at the Dundee Institute of Technology. (5 references) (GL)",

A discussion of the integration of the CoSy system into the existing curriculum is followed by descriptions of the conferencing environment and the interface to CoSy. Profiles of students and teachers involved with the course are also provided. The nature and amount of use of the CoSy system are then examined in light of eight original expectations regarding convenience, increased access to help, equal access, CoSy as a new learning medium, social needs, the conceptual model of conferencing, technical difficulties, and variations in moderating styles. Both quantitative and qualitative data are presented for each of these  areas. The paper concludes with a final evaluation of the data from four perspectives: (1) the value of computer-mediated communication for students; (2) the implications of its use for tutors; (3) the integration of this medium into the Open University's distance learning package; and (4) the impact of computer-mediated communication on the organization of the university. Appendixes include an electronic campus map; demographic data; and data on students' past experience with computer-mediated communication and their level of use of the technology during the course.

The project was designed to involve the parents as active participants in the computer learning experiences of the children, who ranged in age from 4 to 14. It was found that participation with teachers, child care workers, clinicians, and parents in teaching/learning teams facilitated the development of self-worth among the emotionally-disturbed children. The report concludes with a description of requirements for replicating the project, highlighting the  need for a full-time teacher coordinator. Included in the appendixes are demographic data on the hospital; a sample project teacher resume; a project time line; inservice staff workshop schedules; and examples of items purchased with grant funds, assessment tools, and written communications from the project.

An evaluation based on both quantitative statistics of usage and qualitative data from interviews and conference comments is made and compared with results from the first year. The similarities of students' reactions to the medium over the first 2 years are highlighted. The differences brought about by the changes in the second year are also analyzed: the content of the messages, the readership of the conferences, the management of the system, the improvement in communications, and the interactive nature of discussions. The paper then describes the major difficulties impeding further  exploitation of the medium: the passivity of students, the limitations of the medium itself, and the difficulties of teaching practical work at a distance. The conclusion summarizes the overall success of the medium and a number of surprising benefits of its introduction at the Open University. (7 references) (GL)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to better understand teachers' perceptions of collaborative learning and to explicate how they use computer activities to promote cooperative learning experiences. Based on questionnaire responses and group meetings, the Office of Research, Evaluation, and Assessment (OREA) identified seven New York City teachers of various grade levels who appeared to be using computers to encourage student collaboration. Classes ranged from a high school business course using spreadsheets, to special education students using simulations, to elementary school children using word processors for creative writing. OREA staff observed two to three class sessions of each teacher, and later met with them to clarify aspects of the observation and obtain information about  related class activities. Of particular interest were the types of activities used, group composition, and the roles of teachers and students in these computer settings. Major findings include: (1) teachers believed that collaborative learning promoted the goals of problem solving and report production; (2) teachers used several types of software in collaborative learning activities; (3) most computer activities were structured so that students worked in pairs; (4) preparation did not involve instruction of students in social skills necessary for collaboration; (5) little or no role or task differentiation was observed; and (6) teachers acted as facilitators of the group work. Among the recommendations is that teachers be provided with further training and support for implementing  collaborative learning. Appended are brief profiles of each of the seven class sites.

The first is a review of research on the effectiveness of computers as resources for learning and teaching. It reports the general findings from a large number of studies concerned with the achievement and attitudes of students and then considers some of the evidence available on applications within particular areas of the curriculum, such as mathematics, sciences, social studies, modern languages, and information skills. Attention is also given to software evaluation and the cost effectiveness of computer assisted learning. The 70 references cited in the text are arranged under curriculum areas, followed by two further listings of references to studies of general curriculum interest  and software design. The second study complements the review of research by reporting the experiences of 27 Scottish secondary teachers, mainly of science and social studies, as they have observed the responses of their students to the computer, adapted their teaching methods to make the best use of the resources, and sought appropriate software for their students.

The major findings are as follows: (1) in general, based on course grades or pre- and posttest measurements of learning, student opinion, and faculty opinion, telecourses have been found to be as effective as conventional, face-to-face courses; (2) telecourses are superior to correspondence courses; (3) although telecourses do not allow the frequent and spontaneous interaction with faculty and other students that is possible in conventional classrooms, their utilization has facilitated major improvements in the convenience of access; and (4) when well produced, telecourses impose a discipline and organizational rigor on instructors that is not required  in the looser structure of the conventional classroom. It is concluded that the major issue with telecourses is not whether or not they are as effective as face-to-face courses per se, but whether telecourses are skillfully planned and delivered, with the same attention to pedagogical and organizational issues that is essential in planning and delivering a conventional course.

        "description":"This study reports on an examination of the experiences and expectations of the older university student who is returning to school to either complete a degree or begin a new career--one who in all likelihood did not have any computer experience before attending university classes. Specifically, the study was designed to: (1) compare attitudes towards computer use between returning and new students; (2) determine potential computer use by returning students; and (3) determine perceived present and potential use of computers in schools by those who plan to teach in the future. Participants were 28 graduate and undergraduate students ranging in age from 19 to 47 (with an average age of 33) from two university computer literacy classes. Students were surveyed at the beginning and at  the end of the class to determine their attitudes towards the utilization of computers. Data were analyzed using a Pearson correlation based upon the survey responses, student status (returning or new), and age of the respondent. Preliminary results indicate that the returning student demonstrates a more positive attitude towards the use of computers. While results of the pre-class survey indicated a larger potential for use of computers among returning students than among new students, the survey at the end of the class showed a similarity between the two groups, with the attitudes of the new students more in line with those of the returning students, whose positive attitudes towards the use of computers had increased slightly. These results indicate a greater need for more inservice  education opportunities for teachers. (GL)",

        "description":"This study examined how first-year law students developed a civil rights case using an open-ended interactive videodisk (&quot;Litigation Strategies&quot;), which uses a visual and textual database to complement the traditional curriculum by simulating the experience of a junior partner in a law firm. An implementation and formative evaluation examined the use of two types of orienting instruction: (1) unguided (i.e., general instructions and a statement of the task); and (2) guided (i.e., instructions, task statement, and a list of case development strategies). Twenty pairs of second-semester Harvard Law students volunteered to participate. Student pairs were randomly assigned to guided or unguided orienting instruction to develop the case. After 90 minutes, they specified three criteria  for a legal complaint: plaintiff(s), defendant(s) and cause(s) of action. Data collection involved direct observation, online tracking of usage patterns, post-use completion of the legal complaint, an individual post-use questionnaire, and a post-use structured interview. Data analyses addressed students' pathways through the case, the relationship between mode of use and performance on the complaint, and the relationship between mode of use and student perceptions of their experience. Results indicate that while both guided and unguided student pairs used a variety of effective case development strategies, guided pairs were more likely to produce superior legal complaints than unguided pairs. Additional orienting instruction was desired by 70% of the unguided pairs as well as by 40% of  the guided pairs. (25 references) (GL)",

        "description":"It is argued that computer assisted instruction might be an answer to the scheduling problems resulting from the implementation of mastery learning programs in the public schools. The mastery learning model proposed by Carroll and the transformation of this model into a working model by Bloom are described. The difficulty of implementing mastery learning given the fixed schedules of public schools is noted, and the potential contribution of computer assisted instruction (CAI) is outlined, noting that CAI facilitates instruction at the student's own pace while reducing constraints on teachers' time and allowing them to devote more time to students requiring remedial instruction. Criteria for instructional software which can support mastery learning are outlined. It is noted that  software must be clear and understandable; must motivate students actively in drilling subject matter, passively in reinforcing all learned subject matter, and interactively to give fast, positive feedback; must move consistently through subject matter and end at a given mastery level of objectives; and must be both user-friendly and entertaining. Emphasizing that the computer cannot replace the teacher or the textbook, the paper concludes with a model for CAI use in mastery learning situations which incorporates initial teacher instruction, student practice (individually and in groups), formative testing, teacher remediation and CAI lesson referral, CAI (paired or with small group practice), further teacher remediation, and summative testing.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of three levels of learner control (no control, moderate control, and high control) on the achievement and continuing motivation of Hispanic students. Two weeks prior to the experimental part of the study, 101 seventh and eighth grade Hispanics were pre-assessed along an internal-external dimension. Subjects were stratified by sex and grade, then randomly assigned within classes to one of three versions of a computer-assisted instructional program on insects. In the no learner control version, subjects were assigned to the complete computer-assisted instruction (CAI) program consisting of informational screens plus all practice questions, feedback, and content reviews for missed items. Subjects in the moderate learner  control version received the informational screens, practice items, and feedback, but had the option of bypassing each content review. The high learner control version gave students the option of bypassing each set of practice questions, as well as the content review, for each question they responded to but answered incorrectly. Continuing motivation data revealed a significant preference to study science when it was presented on the computer as compared to study of another subject in paper and pencil form. Analysis of en route data revealed that subjects under high learner control chose to receive practice 89 percent of the time, resulting in a small practice difference of 11 percent between program control and high learner control. Although females were found to have a much more  internal locus of control than males, there was no evidence that Hispanic learners with an internal locus of control perform better than those with an external locus when given a relatively high degree of control in a CAI program.

The first of nine chapters includes a description of the objectives and phases of the study, the format of the report, and background information. Chapter 2 focuses on the process used to establish working definitions of major services, i.e., reference services,  interlibrary loan, and photocopying. Chapter 3 presents a model of question handling which was developed to clarify and define which activities needed to be costed. Chapter 4 describes the data gathering effort. Chapters 5 through 7 focus on the development and implementation of the cost finding model. Chapter 8 reports the results of the cost finding model, and the final chapter presents recommendations, including strategies for compensating the State Contract Libraries. Appendixes include a glossary of terms and copies of two forms developed to profile staff time and the characteristics of reference resources. (61 references) (GL)",

To accomplish this goal, community college faculty members should take on the role of classroom researchers, conducting careful, systematic, and patient studies of their students in the learning process. The purpose of classroom research is to help teachers assess the effectiveness of their own teaching, so that they may make appropriate modifications while their classes are still in progress. One form of classroom assessment solicits feedback on how students are learning. At the end of each class period, students are asked to write down the most important thing they learned that day and identify any questions they still  have. Community colleges are in the best position to be leaders in developing expertise in college-level teaching for the following reasons: (1) community colleges are primarily teaching institutions; (2) no other type of institution has the same challenge or obligation for teaching excellence that the community college has; (3) the diverse community college curriculum offers a potentially productive laboratory for gaining knowledge about learning; (4) classroom teaching is especially important to commuter students, who constitute virtually all of community college students; (5) the practical orientation of community college teachers assures that the problems for classroom research are real problems that affect college teachers in their classrooms; and (6) the diversity of the community  college student population is an advantage in studying the learning process.

The study also involved surveys of community college chief executive officers (CEO's), high school principals, and Regional Occupational Programs and Centers (ROP/C) directors regarding the leadership qualities needed to provide an optimum career-vocational teaching and learning environment. The study sample included 25 California community colleges and 263 high schools and ROP/C's; 24 colleges, 230 high schools, and 27 ROP/C's participated. Survey responses were received from 762 college instructors, 1,073 high school instructors, 164 ROP/C teachers, 18 college CEO's, 136 high  school principals, and 23 ROP/C directors. Study results included the following: (1) high school and college faculty agreed that career-vocational students lacked basic skills, analytical skills, study skills, self-motivation, self-esteem, and family support; (2) barriers to effective instruction included cultural and economic differences among students, lack of interdisciplinary cooperation among faculty, and lack of cooperation between high school faculty and community college faculty; and (3) community college CEO's, high school principals, and ROP/C directors agreed that the institution's lead officer should emphasize the worth and value of career-vocational programs, take responsibility for creating formal articulation councils among and between educational institutions, and consider  reorganizing the current college/high school administrative structure to ensure strong industry relations and to promote high school liaison activities and projects.

The individual cost categories examined for the study included direct salary, direct department, direct equipment, building rental, operation and maintenance, academic administration and planning, learning resources, student services, administrative data processing, general administration, and general institutional costs. In addition, the net instructional, full instructional, and total institutional costs were analyzed. All cost analysis for the study was done on a statewide level rather than on a district level, and all costs were adjusted for inflation. Study findings included the following: (1) after adjusting for inflation, unit cost  expenditures showed very limited growth between 1980 and 1989, with direct salary, department, and equipment costs actually lower in 1989 than in 1980; (2) operation and maintenance costs, learning resources costs, general administration, and general institutional costs reflected a rising trend; (3) salary costs on a per unit basis declined from $35.20 in 1980 to $31.43 in 1989, while departmental unit costs decreased in real terms from $7.34 to $6.30 in real terms; and (4) in 1980, the real cost per credit hour of instruction was $85.12, and, in 1989, the figure was $82.30. The data suggest that the community colleges in Illinois have operated in a very cost-effective manner during the past 10 years, with the most significant cost increases being attributable to cost factors over which  institutions have little control.

        "description":"As college student populations become more diverse and classes become more heterogeneous, instructors have an opportunity to implement leadership models based on the goals of empowerment, cooperation, inclusion, and collaboration. A heterarchical notion of leadership (in which information and authority flow across channels and input from all members of a collective is considered valid and important) can be useful for increasing classroom participation and helping students learn to work in groups. One of the ways to begin building connections across similarities and differences is to provide mechanisms for people to talk to one another. Such opportunities set the stage for students to work together in collaborative and mutually affirming ways. Instructors can serve as key players  in this learning process by setting norms that support an open discussion of individual differences. For example, students may be asked to write about the differences they observe in their classmates regarding a specific issue under discussion. By emphasizing the need for open and honest communication, modeling effective listening skills, and providing positive reinforcement as students attempt new behaviors, instructors can help class members shift from superficial interaction with each other to a greater willingness to communicate and examine differences. Interventions aimed at cooperative learning as well as speaking create an atmosphere of shared experience. An important challenge in the process of learning to manage and appreciate differences is to develop some guidelines for  generalizing what has been learned to future situations, which increases students' potential for meeting the challenge of diversity in the future.

Research suggests that both faculty-oriented advising and professional counselor-oriented systems may have fallen short of their intended purposes. Concern for the quality of academic advising and recognition of the important role it can play in promoting student retention and success underpin current efforts to improve advising. Steps to improve academic advising include the following: (1) preparing, reviewing, and revising a written plan detailing the goals and functions of academic advising; (2) screening potential advisors and  informing them that they must be willing to do more than help students schedule classes; (3) requiring that students meet on a regular basis with their advisors; (4) implementing advising programs in which counselors and teachers work together as a team; (5) rewarding the efforts of those involved in academic advising; (6) training advisors in basic counseling skills and techniques and providing simulation and role-playing activities; (7) using computers in academic advisement; and (8) assessing students and administrators to determine if the advising system is meeting its goals.

        "description":"Based on a 3-year case study of an open-access community college, this monograph examines the background to, causes of, and possible resolutions for the decline of literacy in open-access colleges. Chapter 1 presents a working definition of literacy; considers the nature of literacy in a community college setting; and raises issues concerning the impact of the decline of college standards on the student, institution, and society. Chapter 2 describes the curriculum, administration, faculty, and students of the college and illustrates the complex and dynamic character of the study setting. Chapter 3 provides a detailed description of teaching and learning in the classroom, and chapter 4 looks at reading and writing behaviors required in class activities. Chapter 5 discusses the  educational objectives of the college instructors, with a focus on the relationship of course objectives to instructor style, the emphasis on cognitive objectives in the classroom, faculty responses to low student literacy skills, and the reciprocal effects of student skills and teacher objectives. In chapter 6, student motives for pursuing an education are examined along with the way the institution reinforces and responds to these motives. Chapter 7 examines non-classroom influences contributing to the lack of literacy skills, including inadequate advisement, student placement problems, and the absence of special services for non-traditional students. Chapter 8 considers the indirect impact of administrative priorities on classroom literacy. Chapter 9 discusses the implications of study  findings for administration and instruction in open-access colleges and offers recommendations for promoting literacy. (LAL)",

        "description":"In an examination of the dynamics that mold a bill and keep it before the attention of the national legislature, this paper traces the behind-the-scenes history of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), H.R. 925, from its origin as a benefit solely for pregnant women workers to its current status as a broad remedy for the stresses of modern family life. In the space of only 4 years, the parental leave issue has captured serious public attention, building momentum to keep it squarely before the nation's policymakers. How has this happened? Why has a bill drafted by a half-dozen Washington feminists become the central item on the agendas of more than 70 organizations representing millions of Americans nationwide? This paper looks at these questions and ultimately credits: (1)  changes in the roles of women and in the characteristics of U.S. families; and (2) legislators' willingness to acknowledge the current realities of American family life. Concluding remarks assert that there are powerful arguments for the federal response embodied in the FMLA, particularly in its establishment of a minimum labor standard. The guarantee of job reinstatement, at the minimum, represents a floor beneath which benefits should not fall. It is the most basic of workplace entitlements and deserves to be a nationwide standard for all employers. (RH)",

Success for All, which concentrates resources in grades pre-K to 3, uses research-based instructional programs to bring participants to the third grade with adequate reading, mathematics, and language skills. Elements of the program include reading tutors, regrouping for reading instruction according to performance levels, reading assessments every 8 weeks, preschool and kindergarten programs, parenting education and parent participation efforts, a program facilitator, in-service teacher education, an advisory committee, and no assignment of pupils to special education resource services for reading problems. Evaluation data indicate that  program participants outperformed control school children on multiple individually administered measures and on California Achievement Test measures in grades 2 and 3. Participants scored at about the 50th percentile on individually administered measures, compared to a control school average of about the 28th percentile. It is concluded that continued success of the 5-year program in full-year evaluations will demonstrate that high rates of learning problems can be prevented by the schools. (RH)",

Analysis of data gathered from a mail survey of over 300 currently and formerly registered FDC providers in Delaware suggested that nonstable providers were more likely than stable providers to have their own young children at home. Data also suggested that stable providers were more likely to have clear boundaries between their nuclear families and their FDC systems, work longer hours, and have previously held child-related jobs. Stable providers reported higher levels of overall job satisfaction than did  nonstable providers. Data from a 6-month longitudinal study of 24 FDC providers during their first 6 months after FDC registration with the state of Delaware provided illustrations of the ways some providers established boundaries between their nuclear families and FDC systems and insights into factors influencing FDC providers' job stability.

Children who watch television 3 to 5 hours a day have little time for other activities such as play, reading, and talking with others. Excessive television viewing may have a detrimental effect on children's learning and school performance. The amount of violence depicted on television is increasing. The average child views more than 20,000 commercials a year, and by doing so, may acquire a distorted picture of appropriate eating habits. A recent study found a direct relationship between amount of television viewing and children's risk of obesity. In this digest, parents who wish  to address the problems associated with excessive television viewing are advised to: (1) know how much television their children watch and set limits on the amount of viewing; (2) encourage their children to plan their viewing; (3) watch television with their children and provide interpretations of excesses and distortions, such as violent actions; (4) encourage their children to watch programs that depict characters who cooperate and care for each other; (5) call their local stations and write or call networks or sponsors to express their feelings about programming; and (6) join with other concerned parents and public action groups.

Subjects were 58 toddlers between 16 and 19 months of age and their mothers. Two general methods were used: observation and maternal report. Standardized developmental assessments were used to ascertain toddlers' cognitive abilities. Suggesting that cognitive and social influences on the development of play are not parallel, findings indicated that the toddlers' shift in attention from dropped object to mother was related not to security but to cognitive development. Organization of attention during play was related to the play context that the infant created by dropping toys from the high chair tray. The shift in  attention to the mother showed that the toddler's goal in the game was getting the mother to respond. The infants who were more securely attached were more likely to attain their goal. Their mothers responded by returning the toys more quickly. Perhaps because the more secure toddlers were more certain of their mothers' responsiveness they were less likely to use their object play to test it. They played with the toys longer before dropping them and paid more attention to the toys than did the less secure toddlers. The organizatiion of attention in toy-mother-toy sequences, particularly the likelihood of attention to toys being embedded in such sequences, was associated primarily with cognitive ability. (RH)",

        "description":"In 1985, Virginia state law was amended to change the birth date for automatic eligibility for kindergarten from December 31 to September 30. The law allowed school districts to admit young children with birthdays from October 1 through December 31, provided the children were tested for kindergarten readiness. Testing for admission to school for children with December birthdays began in the fall of 1986. The law specified that children with November birthdays would be added in 1987 and children born in October added in 1988, so that afterwards, children with birthdays in the 3 months would be permitted entry into kindergarten at the discretion of the school superintendent. The law was interpreted by the state attorney general as holding that districts must test children whether  or not the information obtained would be used. School districts responded to the law in many ways. Most districts used one of the tests tentatively approved by the state. Few heeded cautions that a single measure was inadequate for determining kindergarten readiness. About half used a specific cut-score or procedure for determining entry; about one-fourth did not use a fixed cut-score or used a variable one; one-fourth districts used no cut-score. While recent legislation would have fixed entry age at September 30 and eliminated the screening requirement, an amendment may continue kindergarten readiness screening for children who turn 5 in October, November, or December.

This paper uses data from a longitudinal study of 4,500 students who entered or were petitioned to enter kindergarten in the fall of 1986 and 1987, to address the question: What effect do transitional programs implemented pursuant to Section 22.1-199 have on achievement, retention, and other indicators of school success? Cognitive Abilities Test scores of students who spent 1 or 2 years in kindergarten were collected. Of these, the verbal subtest scores, arguably the most susceptible to instruction, were used to show program differences.  Analyses revealed a significant negative cognitive effect associated with transitional programs and kindergarten retention. It is concluded that extra-year programs are not beneficial to students. The results discussed, and the results of a large and increasing body of research, suggest that neither transition programs nor retention are viable solutions to the well-documented deleterious changes in early grade curriculum. It is urged that schools be allowed the time and resources needed for redesigning the early grade curricula to effectively meet the needs of Virginia's students before kindergarten transition programs end.

Data were collected on the Prekindergarteen Saginaw Objective Reference Test, the Affective Rating Scale, a Parents as Partners sheet, and existing records. The 1989-90 Chapter 1 prekindergarten program served 442 children at 16 elementary schools. Evaluation data indicated that in its second year of operation, the program  was quite successful, with 21 of 26 objectives attained. Recommendations for program improvement are offered. Nine appendices provide related material. (RH)",

The purpose of the program is to provide educationally disadvantaged, inner-city 4-year-olds with an environment that will enable them to develop skills needed for success in school. In 1989-90, the program served 188 children enrolled at six buildings, one of which operated a half-day session. The major question addressed by the evaluation was: Did the program attain the 16 objectives it set out to accomplish? To answer this guestion, evaluators used: (1) the Prekindergarten Saginaw Objective Reference Test to assess cognitive and fine and gross motor objectives; and (2) the Parents as Partners Sheet to assess the program's success in  imparting to parents the skills they need to become directly involved in their children's education. Findings indicated that the program met eight of nine objectives in the cognitive skills area and one of four objectives in the psychomotor skills area. Of the three psychomotor objectives which were not met, two were within six percent or less of meeting the standard. All three objectives on parent participation were met. Recommendations for program improvement are offered. Related materials are provided in six appendices. (RH)",

        "description":"Illinois' state-funded preschool program, the Illinois Prekindergarten Program for Children at Risk of Academic Failure, is serving almost 19,000 children in the 1989-90 period on an allocation of 48 million dollars, which was distributed to 184 projects in 353 school districts. The preschool projects serve children of 3-5 years, who are taught 10-15 hours a week by teachers with early childhood or day care supervisor certificates. This report discusses preschool expansion, access to services, program effectiveness, and issues for further study and action. Section I, on preschool expansion, reports growth of funds and services, estimated numbers of children who need these services, expansion that would meet the estimated need, and the use of preschool funds by individual  projects. Section II, which studies access to services, describes children of working parents, differences in urban and rural access to services, and the problem of access to services for children in Chicago. Section III, on program effectiveness, explores aspects of effective preschools, effects of the Children at Risk Program, and long-term evidence of effectiveness. Section IV takes up the issues of screening systems, integration of children with disabilities, and increased collaboration among early childhood programs. Appendices provide related legislation, project-by-project comparisons, and data on variations in projects' use of preschool funds. (RH)",

        "description":"This study examines the relationship between the amount of time sixth graders reported spending on homework and their achievement gains on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS) between the spring of 1988 and the spring of 1989. Selected for participation were one or two classes in each of 30 public elementary schools in Chicago. Of the 30 schools, 10 were magnet schools, 10 integrated or desegregated schools, and 10 predominantly minority schools. The questionnaire administered in January, 1989 asked students how many days each week they were assigned homework in reading and language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies, and how much time they spent on assignments in each of these curriculum areas. The Chicago Board of Education's test score master file provided ITBS  mathematics total and reading comprehension scores for April 1988 and 1989. Homework and achievement measures were average classroom level measures for the 52 surveyed classes, not individual student level measures. Although the findings strongly suggest that homework may be related to achievement gain in some classes, because of several methodological and measurement characteristics, the study fails to add unequivocal evidence to the discussion on the effectiveness of homework in the sixth grade curriculum.

        "description":"An extensive survey was made of personal papers, textbooks, periodicals, and other printed material from the last decades of the nineteenth century to the early years of the twentieth, when the kindergarten movement rose and declined, to answer several questions concerning American Froebelians' cognizance of the influence of Comenius on Friedrich Froebel. Were founders and supporters of the American kindergarten aware of the writings of Comenius? Did they recognize similarities between his philosophy and that of Frobel? Did Americans leading the Kindergarten Crusade know that Froebel had been influenced by Comenius? If so, did they then acknowledge the indebtedness of the nineteenth century father of the kindergarten to the work of the seventeenth century Moravian scholar? How  did their recognition of the relationship between the two systems, or their avoidance of this recognition, affect the kindergarten movement? Findings indicated that the American Froebelians could have been aware of the &quot;central core of thought&quot; which was shared by Comenius and Froebel. It is concluded that an educational system based upon one individual and dependent upon didactic materials, becomes vulnerable, static, and cannot adapt to new challenges and unique problems. Use of the historical approach to integrate new theories into a central core of thought can provide an integraton of systems to stand the test of time. (RH)",

The paper begins with a discussion of an educator's concern that young children in modern China have decreased the amount of their play due to pressure from the family to acquire academic skills. The review of major theories of play addresses theories developed before World War I, which are termed classical, and those developed after the war, termed modern. Five descriptive characteristics of play viewed as critical to the definition of play are listed. The research reviewed indicates that training in group dramatic play can result in gains in social skills and perspective-taking. But research findings leave unanswered questions about which aspects of play are  primarily responsible for developmental gains. Implications of the research for early childhood education are pointed out. These concern the provision of an environment conducive to play and the use of play tutoring to promote social play. Directions for future research are suggested. (RH)",

A total of 85 child care providers from 11 child care centers completed a questionnaire that measured their attitudes about good parents, parents with children in their centers, most parents today, traditional sex roles, and how well parents know their children. Subjects were also asked to respond to a behavioral measure assessing willingness to comply with parents' wishes and truthfulness with parents. Findings showed that child care providers with children evaluated parents with children in their own centers and parents in general more positively than did child care providers without children. Child care  providers with children indicated that they were more truthful with parents than were child care providers without children.

Discussion concerns nontechnical assistance, and screening for development, vision, medical and health condition, and communicative abilities. The rationale for this section is that  many communities could not afford to offer preschool screening services without the assistance of trained volunteers. Part 3 addresses the need for staff in-service and offers suggestions concerning content and format of an early identification workshop for teachers.

Data used in the study were the most current data available from the United States Department of Labor, the Kentucky Cabinet for Human Resources, and a thorough examination of the literature on day care. Comparisons were based on data from the adjacent states of Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, and Indiana as well as several states having model child care programs, such as Massachusetts and Minnesota. Virginia and Massachusetts were included partly because those commonwealths have governmental structures similar to those  of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Two major areas of interest emerged in the course of the study. One involves the shortage of child care subsidies for poor women; the second involves the enhancement of child day care availability for middle and lower income working families. Chapter 1 includes background information and an overview of child care as it has emerged as a social, economic, and business issue.

Arthur Norton and Louisa Miller in &quot;The Family Life Cycle: 1985&quot; show trends in the frequency and timing of marriage, divorce, remarriage, and fertility across several generations of women. Martin O'Connell in &quot;Maternity Leave Arrangements: 1961-85&quot; presents research on factors associated with childbearing and labor force participation. Data from Norton and Miller's study show that younger cohorts of women had a tendency to marry later, begin childbearing later, and have fewer children. They also divorced more often and did so at a younger age than women in older cohorts. Despite within-cohort differences, members of the same birth  cohort showed an overriding commonality with respect to basic patterns of life cycle change. O'Connell's study found that women most likely to work during their first pregnancy were relatively older, white, and at least high school graduates. Among women who did work during pregnancy, teenagers, black women, and high school dropouts were most likely to return to work within 6 months of their child's birth. Between the 1961-65 and 1976-80 periods, women most often quit their jobs during pregnancy; by 1981-85, almost one-half of all women received maternity benefits while only 28 percent reported quitting their jobs.

        "description":"In a cooperative task, American Indian elementary students produced bilingual natural history dictionaries using a Macintosh computer. Students in grades 3 through 8 attended weekly, multi-graded bilingual classes in Hupa/English or Yurok/English, held at two public school field sites for training elementary teaching-credential candidates. Teams of three students worked together at the computer to complete a dictionary page, a task involving selection of a natural item, formulation of its definition, transcription in the Unifon alphabet, translation to English, and page layout. The project focused on written sentence construction and oral communication skills. The goal of producing a dictionary dealing with plants and animals known to local tribes allowed students to use  knowledge obtained from family and other tribal members. The computer provided concrete realization of abstract concepts and a self-directed interactive learning environment. Classroom observation showed that (1) students worked on the project willingly for the entire school year; (2) students' oral communication skills, used in the cooperative learning groups, developed over the year; (3) students tended to build on the work of other students; (4) older and younger students differed in their ways of viewing the natural world; and (5) older students advanced from producing literal English translations to making &quot;good&quot; free translations. The success of this project points to the importance of implementing a teaching methodology compatible with the learning style of the home culture. This  report contains 26 references. (SV)",

        "description":"This collection of conference presentations focuses on the twin themes of restructuring and technology in rural schools. Rural America's increasingly polarized demographics, political leadership voids, teacher training, renewal strategies, and ever-shrinking budgets are discussed, along with ongoing media criticism, which is a reality for all educators in the 1980s. Opening speaker Ron Knutson described many rural problems as being associated with an economic decline that contrasts with the economic upswing enjoyed by the rest of the nation. Four educational administrators from Western states placed the responsibility for improvement on state and local administrators and educators. The major topic in education today is restructuring. Stanford University's Michael Kirst observed  that ideas challenging traditional educational models suffer in the current atmosphere of low public confidence, but he depicted schools as having little choice but to restructure. Arizona State University's David Berliner raised a different restructuring question: Why is so little attention paid to the role of research in transforming schools? Because of its promise for the rural future, technology took center stage on the conference's second day. But technology specialist Robert Pearlman cautioned that the mere purchase of high-tech systems is no assurance that education will improve. The processes of learning and teaching must be reassessed and new technology appropriately exploited to turn students into active learners. Pearlman proposed making technology-smart teachers the buyers of  technology, in order to create and exploit a genuinely enthusiastic constituency for technology education. (TES)",

        "description":"An estimated 13 million acres of New York State have been taken out of production agriculture since the early 1900s. While most of this land has remained idle and returned to its natural growth, that part that is being rapidly converted to urban uses is of immediate concern. These changes inevitably affect the quality of life in rural areas, impacting family lives, community service, and education. Urban development often absorbs prime agricultural lands in disproportionate amounts. It has an additional, indirect impact on farming, as an uncertain farming environment causes farmers to forego major improvements or investments. The conference reported in this document explored the various options available to preserve some of that prime agricultural land in New York State. Speakers  described specific preservation programs operating in Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Preservation strategies include creation of agricultural districts, agricultural use-value assessment, zoning, purchase and transfer of development rights, and the setting up of land trusts. The appendices include a follow-up questionnaire sent to conference participants, survey results, and an outline of farmland preservation efforts in other states. (SV)",

        "description":"Rural residents have traditionally received fewer essential health care services than their urban counterparts because of lack of coherent health care policy, institutional and regulatory impediments, and the special costs of delivering health care in a rural setting. Lack of adequate health services affects all rural residents, including children. With this in mind, health care providers, insurance representatives, state legislators, health care associations, and State Health Department and Social Services Department staffs convened a symposium in order to identify the key issues and outline a framework for improving health care policy and services for rural New Yorkers. This report contains highlights of four separate workshop discussions with the specific recommendations made  by each group. All four workshop groups independently arrived at similar conclusions and recommendations about state policy, regulations and codes, communication and representation, joint ventures, research, finance, and personnel. Workshops recommended stimulating recruitment and retention of health care workers, providing more administrative backup, improving financial support, and providing dollar incentives in terms of taxes, insurance, and education. The report also describes the conerence setting history, and opening session, and contains a list of conference participants, resource contacts, and abstracts of the white papers prepared for the symposium.

        "description":"Local governments in rural areas of New York State, as in many other states, are struggling to keep up with the demands of a changing society and an increasing rural population. Relative poverty, increasing costs of essential community services, frequent turnover of elected and appointed officials, insufficient training, geographic isolation, and lack of timely information and legal advice are all problems for rural local governments. One answer is intermunicipal agreements that allow participating governments to provide services through joint funding and administration. This document reports on results of a survey conducted by the Legislative Commission on Rural Resources of over 1,000 municipalities in New York State on the subject of intermunicipal cooperation. Responses were  received from 100 towns, 57 villages, 12 cities, 5 counties and 2 unknown places (municipal names were missing). The report also discusses the legality of intermunicipal agreements in New York State. Such agreements may include not only municipal services, but also recreational and health services to youth and the elderly, including drug abuse education. This report contains a synopsis of the survey results including detailed comments from government officials about factors that hinder participation in such agreements and ways in which the state could encourage the sharing of services. A table of responses shows areas in which municipalities presently share services. Appendices contain a checklist for successful intermunicipal projects; a directory of offices with information about  intermunicipal agreements; sample agreements; notes of restrictive decisions (addenda to the New York State law on municipal cooperation); and a copy of the survey questionnaire.

This report describes the activities of the CRR during 1988. The Commission created a steering committee of state and local officials to conduct a think-tank seminar for officials working in rural governments, created a rural transportation program integrating schools buses with public transportation systems, worked on water supply and quality issues,  addressed health care and transportation difficulties, and pursued state budget allocations for all these programs. The report lists 14 bills drafted by the CRR and sponsored by members during the 1988 legislative session and describes 4 Commission-produced reports, dealing respectively with enhancing New York State's forestry industry, swing-bed care for rural hospitals, integrating school transportation resources into public transportation systems, and problems of disappearing farmland. Networking efforts by the Commission are summarized as are the Commission's activities in sponsoring research and discussion in areas of special interest to rural New York State.

The report presents a comprehensive picture of the condition of rural schools in the region and of unique  conditions of schools within each state. It contains three major sections: a regional overview, a description of Southwestern rural and small schools, and individual state profiles for the five states. The regional overview examines demographic and economic trends, legislative mandates, public education funding, rural education conditions and needs, and strategies for addressing regional needs, including economic development. The section on the description of rural small schools includes demographic information. Each state profile includes information on the economics affecting rural schools and discusses consolidation, the uses of technology, and education service centers.

        "author":["Morrow, Phyllis"],
        "description":"This paper traces the history and development of Yupik, the first language for almost 14,000 Native Alaskans, and reports findings of the Bilingual/Bicultural Needs Assessment survey conducted in 1983. Yupik remains one of the strongest Native American languages, despite historical factors that have increased English usage among Native Alaskans. Increasingly, Yupik is associated only with past traditions. Concern for the viability of the language has given rise to Yupik revitalization efforts, including a renewed focus on bilingual education. Although it means different things to different people, the issue of bilingual education is closely linked to local autonomy in questions of land use, social services, and health care. The issue is often seen not just as one of educational  policy, but as an all-encompassing social policy and, thus, has fallen victim to ambivalence and shifting priorities. The survey questioned Yupik and non-Yupik students, school staff, and &quot;other important adults&quot;--a total sample of 2,192 persons--about bilingual education needs and demands. Results revealed inter- and intracultural disagreement on the issue. Most students (54%) and other important adults (62%) wanted equal time for the two languages, but 64% of staff members wanted more English than Yupik. The report concludes that, while there was general support for bilingual education, educators and the surrounding community are split on the emphasis of course content. The report suggests that policies based on the belief that monolingualism is inevitable, could end as self-fulfilling  prophesies. This paper contains 15 references. (TES)",

Of primary concern to the study were the characteristics and roles of part-time staff, the level of satisfaction with existing training, and attitudes toward a modular training system. A total of 33 interviewees consisting of urban and rural social workers, community center staff, welfare rights workers, counselors, and tenants' group staff participated in the study. The study found that training and refresher courses were valued, but that there were some worries about training standards and delivery. Part-timer training was considered successful when it involved practical  activities relevant to the work places and when the work was performed alongside experienced staff. Brief on-the-job training sessions were favored. Main problems limiting training opportunities were seen to be a lack of full-time staff and inadequate budgets, especially for special project workers and workers with preschool groups. Most part-time staff favored modules, but employers and trainers were doubtful. The document recommends that organizations more clearly identify goals and needs, and make training as relevant to needs as possible. On-the-job training is perceived as highly effective and desirable by part-time workers. Questions of policy, information, support services, and clearly the use of modules are discussed. (TES)",

Of primary concern to the study were the characteristics and roles of part-time staff, their level of satisfaction with existing training, and their attitudes toward a modular training system. A total of 96 interviews were carried out. Respondents were staff in public and voluntary youth clubs, and in young farmers', scouts', and girls' groups. The study found that youth-work training and refresher courses were valued, while generic courses were criticized. Training was considered successful when it involved practical, relevant work alongside experienced staff. Residential weekends were favored; distance learning was not. Main training access  problems were seen to be caused by a lack of full-time staff and inadequate budgets. Experienced youth workers seemed to be offered fewer training opportunities than new staff. Most part-time staff favored modules but employers and trainers were more doubtful. Welfare rights organizations' training was better because representatives of these organizations seemed to have a clearer view of their aims and objectives. Local authority workers, however, seemed less clear about agency goals, making identification of training needs more difficult.

        "description":"Survey questionnaires concerning the response of rural schools to the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) epidemic were sent to administrators of 400 randomly selected rural school districts in the United States. Of the 100 respondents, 80% provided some form of HIV/AIDS education. These programs varied greatly in goals, placement, length, and curricular content. A majority (56%) of schools with programs had involved their communities in program development, and 90% permitted parents to excuse their children from AIDS education. The most frequently named program goal was transmission of accurate AIDS information to students. Most programs were relatively brief, with 59% lasting 1 day or less and 40% lasting only 1-2 hours. A majority (60%) of schools included curricula  concerning abstinence, condom use, safer sex, homosexuality, and sexually transmitted diseases. More AIDs education programs were provided in upper than lower grades, and most programs were part of health education classes. Only 34% of districts with programs had tools for evaluating them. Most schools had policies about attendance of HIV infected students, but most did not have policies about attendance of infected employees. For effective implementation, rural citizens, outreach agencies, social groups, and parents should be involved in designing and implementing sex education programs. This survey identified low levels of community and parent involvement in program planning. The survey questionnaire is included. (Author/SV)",

Rural communities have distinct environments and unique strengths and weaknesses, differing even among themselves. A diversity among rural lifestyles, values, resources, and other socio-cultural factors call for unique responses to the needs of rural special-needs children and their families. The involvement of families in rural programs is essential for success. Interagency cooperation is also important. Funding inadequacies, staff recruiting problems, transportation difficulties, professional isolation, staff development needs, support services, and local resistance to change are all hindrances to such family-community collaboration.  Factors to be considered when designing a service-delivery system for rural disabled children include: population sparsity, topography, cultural diversity, language differences, economic lifestyles, students' ages and level of disability, history of services, available resources, cost efficiency, and governance systems. This document describes many successful working service-delivery models and strategies. Service-delivery strategies discussed include the use of (1) non-school personnel; (2) power and communications sources; and (3) responses to family needs. The document concludes that, while community characteristics may differ, planners may identify variables to design appropriate, individualized models meeting the needs of children, parents, communities, and service agencies.

        "description":"This report evaluates the Writing to Read (WTR) program instituted in 1988 in 13 West Virginia elementary schools as the result of a partnership between the IBM Corporation and the federal Appalachian Regional Commission. The WTR labs, also installed in 42 Kentucky and Virginia schools, use a computer-based instructional system to develop the writing and reading skills of kindergarten and first-grade students. Under the program, students and teacher spend 1 hour each day in the lab, organized around five learning stations where students are taught how to write anything they can say and to read anything they can write. The West Virginia labs were placed in rural areas that were economically distressed and that had declining populations. More than 50 administrators, teachers, and  aides from 5 school districts attended a 3-day training session. They also were given access to training materials and inservice activities throughout the school year. WTR students' writing and spelling test results were compared with those of students who did not participate. In all sites, the WTR students did significantly better than their counterparts. T-tests were used to verify the results. Similarly, a survey of teachers rates the program as positive. The report concludes that successful implementation of the WTR system requires ongoing inservice training and that the WTR labs had a positive impact on students, teachers, administrators, and parents. The report recommends that the program be improved, monitored, and expanded to include other West Virginia schools. (TES)",

        "description":"This publication describes Oregon's current school funding system, and provides some criteria for evaluating alternatives that address issues of equity, balance, and stability. Oregon's school funding system depends primarily on local property taxes (57%) and a state aid program (22%) funded mainly by an income tax. This system permits a great deal of local citizen control in financial and program matters. However, because of wide differences among districts in wealth (assessed evaluation) and nonproperty tax revenues, higher property taxes do not ensure higher spending for pupils. This system is widely criticized for generating high property taxes and as being unfair to students, unfair to taxpayers, and unstable or inadequate for many districts. Commonly supported goals of  school finance reform include: (1) reducing uncertainty or inadequacy in districts with inadequate tax bases; (2) reducing disparities among districts in resources available; (3) reducing disparities among districts in property taxes necessary to support equal expenditures; (4) increasing state support; and (5) reducing property taxes. Achieving the goals of a fairer, more stable school funding system that depends less on property taxes involves three sets of interrelated policy choices: (1) whether to update all school tax bases; (2) whether to change state aid formulas or spending levels; and (3) whether to replace part of the property tax with a new tax or increased income tax. Discussion questions are included. (SV)",

        "description":"By almost any definition, rural America has been medically underserved. This bibliography includes materials available from the National Agricultural Library's (NAL) Rural Information Center. The listed materials include approximately 36 books and monographs, 106 articles, and the names and addresses of 17 related associations. Certain local characteristics make rural areas especially susceptible to deficiencies in the allocation of medical resources. A prevalence of hazardous jobs, low incomes, low educational levels, a dispersed population, a growing proportion of senior citizens, and unemployment all play a role in the rural health profile. Infant mortality has been higher, ratios of practitioners to patients has been lower, and per capita spending lower than in urban areas.  Public sector policies of dispersed responsibility and privatization have made it more important for local areas to identify and solve their health system problems with local efforts and resources. Medical service financing initiatives must be more original and tailored to meet community needs. The materials cited in this document have been compiled with that goal in mind. They focus on alternatives or original approaches for providing medical services in times of financial stress. Specific subjects of the materials include rural medical care, psychiatric services, dental care, hospice care, and care for the rural elderly. Each listing includes title, author, number of pages, the publication source, and publication date. (TES)",

        "author":["Amado, Melissa"],
        "description":"Hispanic business ownership has existed in Tucson, Arizona since before 1854, when legislation allowed the federal government to acquire the city and surrounding territory. Ranching and agriculture were primary sources of income for early Hispanic settlers but they also were able to diversify into other economic sectors. As Hispanics became integrated into American society, minority business ownership patterns changed. Starting in the 20th century, Mexican Americans tended to operate mostly service industry businesses, such as barber shops and grocery stores. There were a few Hispanic lawyers and doctors, but their numbers were small in comparison to the growing Mexican-American and Anglo populations. The Great Depression of the 1930s negatively affected the agriculturally  oriented Hispanic families. By the 1940s, more Mexican Americans and Anglos were arriving, looking for employment. By the 1980s, the trend toward service-sector jobs was evident in Tucson. Most of the 20 Hispanic entrepreneurs interviewed for this study were first- or second-generation Tucsonians. The pioneer Hispanic families were no longer at the forefront of business opportunities. Instead, some of the offspring from these families were attracted to other enterprises. Current Hispanic owners' indecision as to whether they want their children to enter the family business indicates the possibility that some of these establishments may someday change hands. A continuing cycle of Hispanic &quot;latecomers&quot; operating businesses may develop in the Tucson area, resulting in the possible lack of a  solid economic base for the Hispanic business community.

        "description":"Rural schools have often lacked sufficient resources to acquire training, consultant, and evaluative services. The expertise of faculty in university teacher and administrator training programs has been largely untapped. This is primarily because of a lack of programs linking rural schools with the university faculties that might provide needed services. The University of Central Arkansas' College of Education established the Center for Academic Excellence to provide these services. The center cooperates with public schools and shares university resources with them. The center receives written requests from district superintendents and then works with schools to address their diverse needs. Examples of local needs include curriculum revision, dropout and at-risk student programs,  school renewal and restructuring, teacher and administrator inservice training, grant writing, school assessment, student testing procedures, instructional improvement, the use of computers in instruction and administration, addressing isues of PL 99-475 (the Education of the Handicapped Act Amendments, 1986), and local research projects. College faculty consultations serve the center's teacher education program in by: (1) strengthening the link between higher education and public schools; (2) extending opportunities for faculty to be directly involved with public school concerns; (3) providing schools with realistic assessment of their condition or status; (4) helping assess needs in school curriculum, instruction, and administration; (5) insuring feedback for incorporation into the  curriculum; and (6) opening new avenues to enhance the college's reputation. The center has served more than 100 school districts during the five years of its existence, involving administration and staff at all educational levels. (TES)",

        "description":"This report discusses the growing shortage of affordable housing in the rural United States. The data, released in February 1989, come from the U.S. Bureau of the Census and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The data show that most of the 3.9 million poor households in nonmetropolitan areas pay high percentages of their limited incomes for housing. Large numbers of poor rural homeowners bear high housing costs, but bigger affordability problems are faced by poor rural renters. Moderate-income households also have significant housing-cost burdens in nonmetropolitan areas though such households spend proportionally less on housing costs than the poor. In fact, the data show that, as income rises, the proportion spent on housing declines. Since the 1970s, there has  been a dramatic shift from a surplus to a shortage of rural low-income housing, burdening poor black and white families alike. While housing costs are a bigger burden in urban areas, incomes are lower in rural regions. Poor rural families also occupy a disproportionate share of substandard housing and for most such poor rural households, government subsidized housing is inaccessible. Most national analyses forecast that affordable housing will be less accessible to low-income families in the future. Nonmetro poor households are more likely to be white, elderly, and to include a married couple with at least one worker. Rural Southern households are more likely to be poor than those elsewhere in the nation. The U.S. housing problem is a crisis that requires action from both government and  the private sector.

The background data include the district's size, population, unemployment, and percentage of adults with a high school diploma. The operating revenues and expenditures are financial characteristics about each district's general operations. The funding community summaries show the number of buildings in a district, grade levels  served, and enrollment. Student characteristics include numbers of students enrolled in the following programs: gifted/talented, special needs, migrant, bilingual, Chapter 1, and vocational education. Staff ratios and statistics show numbers of teachers, instructional aides, and administrators in a district. The section also includes average salaries, average age, student ratios, and average years of experience for each group. The demographics section gives characteristics of teachers, aides, administrators, students, and high school graduates, broken down into gender and ethnic groups.

First, third, and fifth grade children were asked a series of factual, explanatory, and generative questions in an attempt to understand as clearly as possible the way they conceptualized the shape of the earth. An examination of the responses of individual children to these questions revealed inconsistencies. The inconsistencies could be explained by assuming that the children had formed and used in a consistent fashion various assimilatory concepts of the earth's shape; for example, that the earth is formed of discs, that there are two earths, one round and one flat, and that the earth is a sphere but people live on  flat ground inside the sphere. This paper argues that children construct these assimilatory concepts in an effort to reconcile the information coming from adults that the earth is a sphere with their own naive concept of a flat earth. Changing these concepts will require a change of theory analogous in many respects to theory change in the history of science. (Author/YP)",

A text on osmosis consisted of six-pages and was used as reading material. The ninth-grade students were considered novices because they were unfamiliar with the biological content used in the experiment. The tenth-grade student who had studied the content were considered as a comparison group. The subjects (88 students from a Dutch secondary school: 46 ninth-grade and 42 tenth-grade students) were randomly assigned to either the experimental or the control group. The text was studied less than 20 minutes and discussed less than 10 minutes in the experimental group. A different picture was found from  the data by the grade 10 and grade 9 students on free recall. For the grade 9 students producing explanations for a blood cell problem facilitated the processing and retrieval of the problem-relevant text. This indicated the facilitative effect of activation of prior knowledge influenced the integration of new knowledge into existing structures. An analysis of the verbatim protocols showed that the grade 9 students dealt with the blood cell problem by segmentation. No statistically significant differences were found related to the grade 10 data. A table showing naive conceptions of the processes underlying the blood cell was presented. (YP)",

The aims of the study were to determine: (1) what effect the instructional strategy had on achieving conceptual change; (2) what devices or strategies students used in their attempts to understand physics, and which of these factors were important; and (3) how robust new conceptions were, and to what extent they were used in unfamiliar situations. Seven students in a mechanics section of a first-year physics course were observed during a 12-week period. The instructional strategy consisted of three stages: introduction of POE (Predict, Observe, Explain) experiment, use of qualitative problems related to the concept under consideration,  and provision of problems through worked examples by the teacher. The data were collected from audiotaping of classroom sessions, written responses for the POE experiment, problem solving responses, course assessment materials, and interviews. The results indicated that although some success was achieved, obtaining long-lasting conceptual change was a difficult process. The students assessed the course as interesting and relevant, but these features alone were not sufficient to promote change. A lack of awareness of conceptual change was evident among the group.

This study developed a measure of ALB by drawing on teachers' working knowledge and the literature on problem-solving, including self-regulatory and metacognitive strategies. The Math Assessment Project Questionnaire was used to assess students' awareness of their behaviors in a mathematics class and a non-routine word problem solving was used to measure the ALB. Students' confidence and achievement were also collected as data. No gender differences were found on the math achievement measures, the ALB questionnaire, or the confidence measure on two-tailed  t-tests. However, the inclusion of the interaction term between gender and confidence showed a significant rise in the multiple R. The results of correlation analyses revealed significant correlations between the ALB score and the standardized test score, and confidence in math learning and gender. (YP)",

By the 21st century, society will demand that all of its citizens possess basic competencies in the fundamentals of science and the use of technology. As science increasingly becomes the dominant subject of the work place, it is important to begin developing within children an understanding and appreciation of science early in their lives. This book provides suggestions for interactive science activities that can be done in a variety of settings, using inexpensive and readily available materials.

        "description":"This document is the record from a U.S. Congress oversight hearing on the Department of Education's refusal to fund a program to teach students about the Holocaust. The program, &quot;Facing History and Ourselves,&quot; applied for federal funding to the Department of Education's National Diffusion Network (NDN), an organization intended to disseminate information about successful school programs. &quot;Facing History&quot; was the only Holocaust curriculum in the country eligible for funding by the NDN. The curriculum was denied funding by the NDN in 1986 and 1987. In its 1988 denial of funding, the peer reviewer for the NDN cited an imbalance in the program's presentation of two viewpoints, the Nazi viewpoint and the Ku Klux Klan's, as a critical factor in the decision not to fund the program. The  testimony of Department of Education officials as to the circumstances surrounding the denial of funding to &quot;Facing History&quot; along with the testimony of several persons in support of the program form the body of the document. Appendices include materials referred to in the record as well as statements submitted for the record. (DB)",

In the 1970s, however, many began to raise the question of whether the expansion of educational opportunities really did reduce social inequalities. This report discusses research that analyzes available evidence about the link between educational attainment and social stratification. The research is conducted around two competing paradigms: the functional paradigm which looks upon education favorably as a way to achieve a meritocratic society; and the conflict paradigm which sees schooling not as a great equalizer, but as a reproducer of the social division of labor. The relationships of family background, schooling, and personal traits to social  achievement are analyzed. Analysis is made according to age groups. The report generally finds education to be highly correlated to social achievement. Numerous tables are included, as is a lengthy list of references. (DB)",

        "author":["Stone, Frank Andrews"],
        "description":"Literary sociology is a multifaceted process of analyzing texts. It moves beyond traditional literary criticism to incorporate such varied approaches as: appreciating literary schemata; textual analysis; seeking form, sound, and content regularities; examining the lasting values of the work; and contemplating the reader's own authentic life-world and experience. This paper seeks to provide a literary sociology about growing up Turkish in light of the contents of five works of recent fiction. The titles of the books (with English translation) are: &quot;Korku'nun Bedeli&quot; (The Price of Fear), Ibrahim Ulvi Yavuz, 1983; &quot;Aile Savaslari&quot; (Family Struggles), Bekir Yildiz, 1984; &quot;Yalcin Nereye Kosuyor?...&quot; (Where's Yalcin Running?), Emin Colasan, 1985; &quot;Koca Ren&quot; (Great Rhine), Fakir  Baykurt, 1986; and &quot;Geriye Donenler&quot; (Those Who Go Back), Gulten Dayioglu, 1986. A central theme running throughout these works is the cultural conflicts of growing up Turkish. These conflicts take on three dimensions: a fundamental clash between adhering to traditional Islam or adopting modern Turkish behavior; the tension in the socio-political arena between ideologies of the right and left; and the struggle of Turkish guest workers in West Germany and other European countries between the rural Anatolian root values of the older generation and the European values of their children. According to the five books, the 1980s were turbulent times for Turkish youth. Economic fluctuations at home and abroad as well as changing dynamics in the relationships between today's Turkish parents and  their children were among the sources of upheaval. Two charts and two figures supplement the text and an 11-item bibliography is included. (DB)",

Using a stratified random sampling technique, 64 schools from the southeastern section of Georgia were selected for participation. Surveys were returned by 56 (87.5%) of the schools and a total of 1,436 of the surveys were completed by teachers in the participating schools. Of this total, 97 were social science teachers. Factors related to the teaching profession that were viewed as most encouraging by the social science teachers were: (a) contributions to humanity, (b) job security, and (c) job availability. Factors viewed as most discouraging were: (a) salary, (b) student cooperation, (c) social status, and (d)  parental support. Reform criteria were rated by these teachers and reforms receiving strongest agreement included those related to increased salary and funding, use of mentor teachers, and partnerships between colleges/universities and community schools. A majority (74.2%) disagreed with the proposal to abolish the undergraduate major in education and 75.3% disagreed with requiring 5 years of collegiate teacher training.

Arrow focuses on the theories of individual and social choice and general economic equilibrium. Arguing that macroeconomics is the key to understanding the modern economic system, Robert M. Solow provides an historical review of the ideas of macrotheory. Lawrence R. Klein discusses the present state of macroeconomic theory and policy as it relates to econometrics. James Tobin looks at the fundamental issue of macroeconomics: the existence, reliability, strength, and speed of market economy adjustments. Tobin states that a large gap exists between academic macroeconomics and that oriented to contemporary events and policies. In developing a modern theory of public choice,  James M. Buchanan also develops contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of political decision making and public economics. Herbert A. Simon remarks on the state of methodology used in, and the future of, economics. Simon believes the methodology is in need of reform and claims that more emphasis should be placed on the prescriptive, rather than on the predictive as a test of science. Recommendations are made by each of the contributors in this discussion of macroeconomic theory, policy, and methodological developments. (NL)",

Increases necessary to expand access to highly subsidized and publicly provided education have not been forthcoming. Another concern is that education is being inadequately and inefficiently provided by the public sector. This study is an inquiry into the nature of the achievement differential between public and private schools in Colombia and Tanzania. It questions the extent to which the differential in academic achievement can be attributed to student characteristics rather than school inputs, attempts to estimate the quality differences between the public and private secondary schools in these two countries, as measured by student performance on the achievement tests (ACATESTs). Estimated  sample-selection effects suggest that Colombian students sort themselves by type of institution, public or private; but Tanzanian students are selected by a hierarchical mechanism, with the lowest-scoring students entering private institutions. These effects are consistent with the different institutional frameworks for educational choice in these two countries. For each country, however, private schools offer an achievement advantage. By standardizing for differences in student and school attributes, private school students have higher achievement test scores. (Author/NL)",

There is no unanimity of opinion, however, regarding the models or approaches to management education that are most appropriate in different environmental settings. Traditionally, management education has been dominated by the need to train executives for large-scale enterprises. But the 1980s has seen a global trend toward the deconcentration of business. The future development of the indigenous business sector in the developing world depends heavily on the emergence of small and medium scale entrepreneurs. The roles of public administrators with respect to regulatory and developmental activities enterprise are also changing. This  trend is evident not only in market-oriented countries, but also in socialist countries, and many developing countries. This volume encompasses management education for each of these groups--the managers and future managers of large-scale enterprises; entrepreneurs and small business people; and public administrators. Its purpose is to review worldwide trends and developments in management education for information about curriculum design, research and teaching methodology, and institutional policies and administration. Experience is drawn from recognized universities, educational organizations, civil service institutes, and corporations in several major countries and regions of the world. A number of tables and figure appear in this volume along with references. A seminar participants  list also is included. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"Recent research suggests that there may be systematic differences in instruction and learning associated with particular social studies subjects. The researchers question whether social studies instruction differs across the various subjects that constitute the social studies curriculum. If so, to what extent do these differences have educationally significant consequences? Social studies curriculum planning involves, whether consciously or not, a classification of subjects. The examination of social studies courses suggests that boundaries vary, between these subjects, from strong to weak, with the weaker boundaries in the middle and elementary-school grades. There is some evidence that teachers' conceptions of a particular subject affects how they interpret the goals of the  curriculum and which instructional strategies they employ. A review of the research literature found that the choices of curricular organization and instructional strategy influence what is learned, how it is learned, and what counts as evaluation. I. L. Beck and M. G. McKeown (1989) concluded that the social studies curriculum has been too global and vague to allow a meaningful understanding of instructional practices.

A critical review of recent research (1978-1988) on social studies methods classes, examined those with a focus on overall course design and those that focus on a specific practice. The studies cited did not contribute to a knowledge base in the empirical-analytic sense, and most of the work reviewed was based on the researchers' own teaching experiences. Research on particular components of social studies methods classes was particularistic and unsystematic with little building of one study upon another. There was no pattern to the data on the characteristics of the effective social studies  methods classes. Samples were randomly selected from too narrow a population, jeopardizing the validity of generalizing to a wider population. None of the studies examined whether changes in attitudes had an impact on teaching practices. Recommendations for further study include developing alternative approaches to research, with the focus on intrapersonal processes and self-reports that can be a valid component of a broader set of research practices. Researchers must conduct a critical inquiry that questions, analyzes, and considers alternatives. (NL)",

Key adopted the viewpoint that subliminal perception was a new phenomenon and that advertisers and advertising agencies were involved in manipulation of the public with the cooperation of the mass media. This study asks whether professors of advertising continue to explain the concept of subliminal advertising as defined by Key or others to their students, and how many class meetings are devoted to the topic. A questionnaire was mailed to 51 college professors who were asked if Key's theories were discussed in their classroom lectures. Of the 51 questionnaires mailed, 21 were returned, 14 indicated the issues were discussed, 6 explained Key's theories, and 1 indicated  the topic was not discussed. The findings showed that professors in departments of advertising continue to discuss the Key's ideas but the discussion is limited to one class period or less and usually in an introductory course.

Most of the existing research on the self-employed uses the individual as the unit of analysis; however, this study uses the enterprise as the unit of analysis and asks whether schooling makes a difference in family income. Generally these businesses are loosely organized, pay no taxes, and employ a large segment of the Peruvian working sector. Regression analyses show significant effects of schooling on earnings. Returns differed markedly among four sub-sectors and by gender and by location (Lima, other cities, rural). The results were  consistent with education being valueless in traditional activities but having a positive effect in jobs requiring literacy, numeracy, and adjustment to change. Post secondary education had a fairly high and significant pay off in urban areas for both women and men. A 20-item bibliography and 11 tables of statistical data are included. (NL)",

These records represent an important source for the cultural history of these groups and offer new perspectives on the tri-racial nature of frontier society. Africans as well as Indians played significant roles in Spain's settlement of the Americas. On arrival in Florida the Africans ran away from their captors to Indian villages. The Spanish, perceiving an alliance of non-white groups, sought to separate them, and passed special legislation forbidding living or trading between the two groups. There were continuous episodes of violence by the Indians who resisted Spanish labor and tribute  demands, efforts to convert them, and changes in their social practices. Villages were reduced to mission sites where they could more readily supply the Spaniards with food and labor. Indian and black surrogates were used to fight the English and helped build the massive stone fort at St. Augustine. The end of the Spanish Mission system came with the war of 1700, English forces from the Carolinas raided mission sites killing thousands of Indians and taking many into slavery. The Spaniards lacked regular troops and relied heavily on Indians and Africans during these raids. The Seven Years War ended with the Treaty of Paris that required Spain to deliver Florida to England. The entire Spanish population including the black villagers of Mose, Yamassees, and other nations evacuated to Cuba.  After centuries of warfare, dislocation, and disease, the native population was decimated. (NL)",

Chosen randomly from Georgia high schools, students were selected from the population attending Close Up Foundation activities during 1989. The hypotheses were that students who participate in an experiential citizenship education program would: (1) show increased political interest; (2) show increased feelings of efficacy; (3) show an increase in political confidence; (4) show an increase in political trust; and (5) become more politically active. The experience was provided by the Close Up Foundation, a private, non-profit organization specializing in experiential citizenship education. Experimental subjects (n=58)  ranging in age from 15-19 years spent 1 week in Washington, D.C. in a program designed to provide an understanding of government and their roles as citizens. Comparison subjects (n=113) were 15- to 19-year-olds attending Close Up in a Georgia school. A pretest, posttest, experiential-comparison group design was used. The data showed that the Close Up experience in D.C. increased positive feelings toward government and stimulated political participation.

        "description":"This paper illustrates an approach to analyzing the content and contexts of inservice teacher education programs. Two inservice programs in mathematics for elementary teachers are compared. One program is part of a large urban school district's initiative to revise its mathematics curriculum. The other program is conducted by a local college; participants come from a number of demographically varied school districts. Despite these differences, the two programs appear to share the goal of teaching mathematics for conceptual understanding. They also face some predictably similar obstacles in attaining that goal: traditional views of mathematics and mathematics teaching and learning, the organization of schools and the conditions of elementary school teaching, elementary teachers'  knowledge and skill. The analysis focuses on the interaction of each program's context and content. The analysis of context deals with factors of organization, surroundings, time, and timing, that contributed to shaping the conditions for teachers' learning. Both the settings of the inservice sessions themselves and the settings of the participating teachers' practice are analyzed. In examining program content, the analysis focuses on the programs' goal of teaching mathematics for understanding--what each program meant by this goal, and what they thought teachers needed to know in order to teach for understanding, as well as their assumptions about how teachers would learn this. The paper concludes with a discussion of the interaction of context and content in inservice teacher education  and raises questions critical for researchers interested in the effects of different approaches to working with practicing teachers as well as for policymakers and researchers intent on changing practice.

        "description":"Several scholars in the field of teacher education recently have proposed the use of cases as a pedagogical strategy in teacher education. In this paper, Wilson discusses her preliminary attempts at using a case to teach prospective teachers about the role that subject matter knowledge plays in pedagogical thinking. The author begins the paper by establishing the intellectual and practical contexts of the case by discussing both current research in the field of subject matter knowledge in teaching and the teacher education course which she teaches. Wilson then presents a case of a new teacher whose subject matter knowledge was not sufficient for his instructional purposes and plans. The paper ends with a set of questions that the author has developed to use in conjunction with  the case in teacher education courses. In sum, the paper is a case of using a case, a story told by a teacher educator about how she has used one particular case in teaching prospective teachers. (Author)",

        "description":"Teacher education reform policies and proposals--particularly those of the Holmes Group--call for fewer education courses and more liberal arts. This paper examines the assumptions that underlie such proposals. A review of recent research on teaching and learning in undergraduate physics and mathematics raises questions about the effectiveness of undergraduate instruction in challenging fundamental ideas and beliefs and helping students develop meaningful, connected understandings. Questions are raised about the role that recent ideas about cognition play in teaching liberal arts. Recent reports on undergraduate education that portray teaching as frequently unchallenging offer little hope of change: The reward structure of higher education is unlikely to change to encourage more  attention to teaching. The various liberal arts disciplines provide scholars little incentive to think about, much less inquire into, teaching their field. In the culture of higher education, scholars' prerogatives to teach what they individually consider important tends to take precedence over concerns for the perceived coherence of programs of study.

At the end of the school year, interviews were held with teachers from kindergarten through third-grade levels on their perceptions of teaching either in a small class, in a regular class with a full-time aide, or in a regular class. The following categories of teacher perceptions were identified: (1) grouping of pupils' (2) physical and social climate, (3) learning centers and activities, (4) classroom management, (5) pupil evaluation, (6) teacher morale, (7) pupil achievement, (8) instructional practices, (9) teacher planning, and (10) teacher/student relationship. Time was a dominant theme observed throughout small class and regular/aide class teacher interview responses. The  amount and pace of academic content covered was the most pervasive time related difference noted by all of the small class teachers. Increased opportunities for more individualized instruction emerged as a second dominant theme when small and regular/aide class teachers talked about differences between teaching in a small or a regular size class. A discussion is presented on findings in each of the identified categories of teacher perceptions. (JD)",

First, a thorough analysis of documents from the period of action research in the post-World War II era in the United States is presented. Images of the work and workplace of teaching from this period begin to establish patterns to be pursued in looking at later work. The second section begins with an examination of the writings of Lawrence Stenhouse whose thoughts on the teacher-as-researcher have been influential in the development of action research, especially in the United Kingdom and Australia. The section concludes with a discussion of projects conducted in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States in the late 1970s  and early 1980s. Finally, issues in action research related to the work and workplace of teachers are identified, and their implications for current action research practices are discussed. (JD)",

As democracy is more of a process than a specific content, the Orchards faculty have concentrated more on changes in methods of delivering curriculum than on changing specific items of curriculum. Questions of worth and value have all circulated around the concept of \"shared decision making,\" which is the central ideal of the multifaceted restructuring efforts that have occurred during Orchards' involvement in the Mastery in Learning Project. From initial focus on faculty autonomy/decison making and student discipline, the faculty is moving towards democracy and shared decision making within their classrooms, involving students in curriculum decisions, playground  arbitration, and other aspects of their school lives.

        "description":"Reforms advocated for elementary school mathematics call for knowledge few teachers possess--knowledge about content, inquiry, and the pedagogical use of mathematical knowledge. As part of a larger study, researchers at the National Center for Research on Teacher Education interviewed methods instructors at a sample of college based preservice programs. An initial examination indicates that methods instructors could take responsibility for this content, but might prefer to concentrate on attitudes toward mathematics and on specific teaching methods. The question arises, then, of who should take responsibility for future teachers' knowledge of mathematical content. One suggestion is to organize the methods course around mathematical experience, but to use the experience to help  teachers live through a different type of learning. In such a course, the methods students observe an elementary school class in which the students conjecture about mathematical ideas, challenge each other's hypotheses, and seek proof for ideas presented. It is acknowledged, however, that the reforms called for by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (1989) go beyond mathematics methods courses and therefore may not be easy to attain.

A study examined the effect of the partnership on the student teacher and the master teacher in the classroom. The subjects of the study were 6 teachers from the partnership school who have served as master teachers, the 6 master teachers from a nearby school where student teachers from Mills had and continue to have field experience, and  the 13 Mills teacher education graduates who had field experiences at the partnership school. Data were gathered via questionnaires. Findings indicate that the effect of the partnership had the strongest positive effect on partnership master teachers who acquired a broader sense of professionalism.

This paper reviews data on trends in the incidence of the degrees, describes some findings on comparisons between the two degrees over the years, and argues that there are at least three factors related to degree choice which may interfere with any effort by the profession to move toward a single degree, particularly if that degree should be the Ed.D. These three factors are the reopening of the marketplace for doctoral graduates in education, the popularity of the Ph.D. with students  and faculty, and the expanding knowledge base in the field.

This paper discusses the nature and influence of the teacher's professional beliefs on his attempts to create a classroom learning environment congruent with the principles of a constructivist epistemology. Cognitive perturbation is considered an important part of the process of reshaping the teacher's conception of his classroom role. The teacher designed and implemented constructivist teaching strategies. However, the narrow scope of these innovations highlighted the significant role of the teacher's established positivist epistemology in determining boundary conditions for conceptual change. In a constructivist epistemology  cognitive perturbation facilitates a learner's reconstruction of his/her ways of interpreting experiences. It is an important pedagogical focus for teachers who wish to influence their students' conceptual development. This study found that teacher beliefs moderate cognitive perturbation and, subsequently, restrict the nature and scope of the teacher's conceptual and practical classroom changes. (Author)",

Chapter 1, on the nature of collaboration, aims to promote inquiry into research, theory, and application concerning the nature of collaboration and the necessary conditions for successful partnerships. This chapter also contains a speech by former Education Secretary Terrel H. Bell and a summary of a symposium on cooperative learning. Chapter 2, on implementation strategies, contains discussions on general lessons to be drawn from successful programs and those programs' characteristics, and on the re-emerging importance given to teacher preparation.  Chapter 3, on role relationships/leadership, considers the coming educational challenges presented by demographic trends; the changing roles and responsibilities of university, school, and union personnel working in collaboration; and the nature of leadership. Chapter 4, on context variables, focuses on the factors influencing the outcome of a collaborative project. Finally, chapter 5, on collaborative models, presents reports on different in-place programs. A featured symposium assessing current issues in educational reform and the requirements of effective collaboration conclude the document. (JD)",

The combination of course work, teaching, and industry experience represents a new route by which college graduates can enter teaching. Teaching interns are employed by a school system to assume most of the  responsibilities of a full-time teacher; industry interns work in a full-time position at one of the cooperating companies. During the first three years of teaching, participating companies are committed to making an attempt to hire MESTEP graduates for summer employment. (JD)",

Purposes were to describe these teachers' views of teaching and learning and to learn how the inservice project informed their work, especially with regard to their identity salience as teacher educators. Data collection consisted of interviews, observations, samples of written responses to project tasks, tapes of project sessions, and tapes of talk between student teacher and cooperating teacher. This paper describes the first year of the project and reports on two of the cases. The teachers in both case studies benefitted from the  program and made plans for systematic induction of future student teachers into the school and classroom communities. A recommendation for other inservice programs for cooperating teachers is that some version of the \"remembering one's own student teaching\" task be included because such remembering helped teachers to be empathetic toward their student teachers.

(2) How do SEGA teachers perceive various proposals for educational reform? (3) Do SEGA teachers, categorized on the basis of background variables, differ in their perceptions of the teaching profession and educational reform? (4) Are there background variables which discriminate independently or in combination between SEGA teachers who would choose teaching again and those who would not? and (5) Are there items related to perceptions of teaching which  discriminate independently or in combination between SEGA teachers who would choose teaching again and those who would not? Most respondents viewed contributions to humanity, job availability, and job security as encouraging factors. Thirteen suggested reforms were viewed positively and nine negatively, and there were numerous differences in perceptions of teaching factors and reforms.

The findings suggest that educational reforms need to take teacher' beliefs into account. This study examines teachers' beliefs about two school subjects, mathematics and writing, and their beliefs about their own responsibilities toward diverse learners. Respondents included intending teachers (usually college juniors), first-year teachers, and experienced teachers. Although there are some differences in patterns of beliefs across these three groups, the most remarkable finding is the diversity of patterns found. The evidence suggests that teachers, as a group, hold no clear view on any of these issues. Six tables display the data on  patterns of beliefs. (Author/JD)",

Four layers of meaning given to the concept of diversity are proposed: individual, categorical, contextual, and pedagogical views of differences. In surveys and interviews with prospective teachers, it was found that individual and categorical views predominate, with psychological orientations and an emphasis on the individual underlying most of the responses. These beginners value ideals of equality and fairness but have difficulty envisioning concrete pedagogical means towards supporting these goals. Dilemmas that have shaped much of American educational  history pose problems for these prospective teachers. These findings raise methodological and conceptual puzzles and hint at implications for teacher education practice. (Author)",

        "description":"A longitudinal study was made of two groups, traditional college-age students when certified to teach and those who at certification were classified as nontraditional or returning students. Follow-up data 5 to 6 years after certification revealed that in the traditional group only 46 percent remained in the teaching force, and of the nontraditional group 85 percent were teaching. This paper focuses on the data from the traditional group to examine those factors which may be responsible for retention in or attrition from the teaching profession. Participants completed the Teacher Concerns Checklist--Form B (Fuller 1978) and a career development survey. Data analyses revealed that: (1) familial factors of marriage and parenthood do not explain why nonteachers are not using their  certificates; (2) no statistical differences exist on academic and environmental impact concerns, but some difference exists in discipline concerns; and (3) developmental patterns, such as focus on career goals and personal security, do explain in part why certificate holders are not teaching. Of those remaining in teaching, only 18 percent intend to stay. This finding, in conjunction with the data from the surveys, suggests the need during preservice training for earlier classroom experiences and for early efforts at career awareness and exploration.

        "description":"Current research on teacher decision making reveals that ability is viewed as an important attribute in determining students' achievement and that teachers behave differently toward students of different ability levels. This study focuses on a secondary English teacher's decision making in a class she perceived to be of low ability and in one she perceived to be of high ability. Data were gathered through interviewing the teacher, audiotaping her thinking aloud while planning, videotaping class sessions with subsequent stimulated recall sessions, observations, and pertinent written documents. The results of this study do not show major patterns of differences in this teacher's decisions for the two classes, perhaps because the curriculum is the same for all classes. The  noteworthy differences hinge on her style and the students themselves. For example, generally she made her plans for the general class, modifying them for the advanced class. The study provides insight into how a teacher translates curriculum into instruction, how instruction is modified to accommodate students' needs, and how fine-tuning takes place during the implementation of lesson plans. Thus, the study links the research on teacher decision making with attribution theory and the resulting expectancy literature. (JD)",

The criteria used to evaluate these examinations focused on their construct validity. The data were collected during the 1988-89 academic year. Scores on the 60-item COMP examination were obtained from 1,973 seniors and scores on the CAAP examination were obtained from 735 seniors. Approximately 100 of these students took both examinations. To evaluate the content representativeness of the examinations, a seven-member faculty committee rated both tests for their coverage of basic skills goals. Students who took the tests also rated the  tests. The evaluation by the faculty indicated that neither test covered even one-third of the general education goals established at the university. The CAAP examination was weaker than the COMP examination in providing useful information in specific content areas. Students were somewhat more favorable than the faculty in their evaluations of the CAAP and less favorable in their evaluations of the COMP. Neither test was judged to be adequately reliable. Both tests had a large standard error of measurement related to the scores and subscores, and both were found to be insensitive to the general education coursework at the university. Nine tables and one graph provide the study data. (SLD)",

        "description":"The concept of aptitude is reviewed, and the uses and misuses of aptitude tests are considered. Many aptitude tests measure general ability plus certain more specialized abilities that are important for success in particular educational programs. Aptitude tests can be subdivided into: (1) group-administered aptitude tests, such as the Scholastic Aptitude Test; (2) multifactor aptitude tests, exemplified by the Differential Aptitude Test; (3) specific aptitude tests; and (4) individually administered aptitude tests (intelligence tests). Aptitude tests have three major uses: instructional purposes; administration; and guidance. Several potential misuses of aptitude tests can occur, particularly if results are interpreted as fixed or immutable. In considering the effects of  schooling on results of ability measures, it is important to consider the many reasons for change in individual test scores. While it may not be possible to raise intelligence quotients permanently, habits can be taught that allow a child to make the most of natural ability. Raising achievement test scores and teaching test-taking skills are generally acceptable objectives. Improvement of academic aptitude may be possible through direct training in learning strategies and the development of executive learning skills, i.e., skills involved in planning, monitoring, and evaluating one's own thinking.

After reviewing the framework developed for the Manpower Development and Training Act and the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) evaluations and the data sets used to test the models, literacy and language programs are considered in an attempt to determine the information needed for evaluation. Problems addressed include: (1) the post hoc nature of evaluations, precluding the possibility of a true experimental design; (2) the need for large sample sizes to detect small anticipated program effects on earnings of program participants; (3) the necessity for longitudinal data on earnings;  and (4) the need to contain the costs of an evaluation. An interesting recent approach is the framework using recursive earnings equations developed by O. Ashenfelter (1975, 1978, 1979). A model, developed by N. Kiefer (1978) to extend Ashenfelter's framework, allows for the possibility that language training might alter the functional form relating human capital and earnings. The Continuous Longitudinal Manpower Survey, a study of demographic characteristics of CETA participants and program impacts on employment and earnings, is reviewed. The use of Current Population Survey data in combination with Social Security Administration data is also covered. Recommendations are provided for the selection of control groups. (TJH)",

        "author":["Bierschenk, Bernhard"],
        "description":"Topological and algebraic scales were compared in the representation of the concept of human worth in behavioral-semantic terms. In a first experiment, seven doctoral students of Business Administration in Sweden explored the notion of worth using definitions from at least 10 dictionaries as the intentional-semantic content. Each subject served as experiencer, observer, and recorder in grouping entries by content. On the basis of the differentiations presented and names proposed for each of the groupings, the prototypical character of the groupings were summarized using the following descriptive names: (1) eigenvalue; (2) reputation; (3) reliability; (4) impartiality; (5) rank; (6) significance; and (7) status. The structural connections were represented topographically. In a  second experiment, 180 Swedish high school students, college students, and adult professionals were asked to make preferential judgments about the intentional-semantic content of 50 statements about worth prepared by the subjects in the first experiment. A statistical analysis of choice alternatives then established an algebraic scale. Factor analysis led to the conclusion that the structure of the investigated concept was qualitatively invariant. The topological scale was preferred because it gave a synthetic representation of the underlying structure, while the algebraic scale only gave an analytic representation of details. (SLD)",

The experimental approach involved: (1) reading new concepts and materials followed by class discussion; (2) relating applications to real-life situations; and (3) conducting a spiraling review of concepts throughout the year. Subjects were 810 students (49% were males, and 51% were females) in grades 9 through 12. Matched pairs, which each included one class using the University of Chicago Math Project textbook, &quot;Geometry,&quot; and one class using a traditional textbook, were compared in terms of students' performance on a standardized test. The experimental classes reduced the gender gap by improving girls' test scores. On a content-specific test, girls in the  experimental classes significantly reversed the trend of boys' dominance on applications and coordinates. Girls remained on a par with boys on items of visualization in three dimensions and on transformations. On the open-ended proof writing test, girls in the experimental classes performed as well as did boys. In traditional classes, a negligible gap remained, favoring boys. Four tables provide study data, and 10 graphs illustrate the trends. Sample test items are included. (SLD)",

One group of the subjects was selected from the middle school students in a school system in a northeastern industrial city who had attended the school system since kindergarten; the other subject group had been selected when in kindergarten to receive an intervention based on a task analysis of curricula into steps necessary for mastery of the activity. It had previously been shown that the treatment group scored at a significantly higher level on standardized achievement tests than did a comparison group  drawn from the same pool of at-risk kindergarten students. Three problem-solving tasks from Piagetian and mathematics curriculum research were administered. The performance of both groups was comparable with age-related results in the literature, but the treatment group surpassed the other cohort on two of the three tasks. Every subject in the treatment group solved at least one task; 11 of the cohort group solved none. Implications for the teaching of learning strategies are discussed.

Two-dimensional data sets, which differed from one another in the interdimensional ability association, the correlation among the difficulty parameters, and whether the item discriminations were or were not confounded with item difficulty, were generated for 1,600 simulated examinees. The generated data were used for Bayesian computerized adaptive testing (CAT) simulations (three-parameter logistic model), and the CAT ability estimates were compared with the simulated examinees' known abilities. The dimensionality of response data shifted the focus for the minimization of measurement errors from known abilities (with unidimensional data) to the average of the latent abilities (with bidimensional  data).

Two simulated data sets, one with 1,000 simulated examinees and one with 500 simulated examinees, were generated according to a linear analytic model. Both contained responses to 180 five-alternative items, of which 55 were retained for 997 simulated examinees with infit statistics between -3.0 and 3.0. The MULTILOG calibration program of D. J. Thissen (1988) was used to obtain item parameter estimates for both models from the data set. It was expected that using a  data set fitted to the PCM model would result in no differences between PCM and GRM CATPs. However, the GRM CATPs provided more accurate information than did the PCM CATPs and the estimation was considered adequate. Reasons for difficulties with the PCM model are discussed.

The NTE Core Battery and Specialty Area Tests are used as part of the alternative process for teacher licensure in New York City. The ECET measures knowledge and skills required by entry-level teachers in the area. Only one form of the test was reviewed. Judgments were provided by 32 New York City educators with expertise in early childhood education (ECE). Each judge participated in two professional panels: (1) a job relevance panel that reviewed each test item and responded in one of four categories indicating the extent to which the knowledge/academic skills needed to answer each item correctly is relevant  to competent performance as a beginning teacher of ECE in New York City; and (2) a knowledge estimation panel that reviewed each item and responded in one of eight categories reflecting the individual item difficulty for persons who have the minimum levels of knowledge/academic skills needed for competent performance as a beginning teacher of ECE in New York City. Job relevance findings were reviewed by two statistical methods; 96.0% or 99.3%, respectively, of the items were found to be job relevant. Two analyses of results from the knowledge estimation panel resulted in scores of 500 and 510, respectively, as potential passing marks; 500 was the recommended passing score, partly because the statistical methodology agreed with that used in setting the passing score on the NTE Core  Battery. The content validity of the test was deemed acceptable. The methodology in this study could serve as a prototype for studies of other specialty area tests.

The EQIs developed are designed to provide information to assist practitioners in assessing the quality of educational programs and the delivery system by focusing on student outcomes. The fundamental principle of the EQI initiative is that no single indicator can fully describe the complexity of education. Many indicators, qualitative and quantitative, will be developed, guided by a four-dimensional model consisting of: partners (schooling, family, and society); conditions (context, inputs, and processes); student outcomes (cognitive, affective, and behavioral); and time (grades 3, 6, 9, and  12). The three criteria for a successful indicator are: (1) the interpretive framework; (2) student outcomes; and (3) points of reference. The modus operandi of the initiative is to sponsor 10 concurrent collaborative action research projects. The implications of the EQI initiative for student learning, system support, and shared responsibility are discussed. Two figures and one table complement the text. (SLD)",

Background multicultural standardization and validation information is presented for Tell-Me-A-Story (TEMAS)--a new thematic apperception test to assess personality functioning in Hispanic, Black, and White children. The test consists of 23 chromatic pictures depicting Hispanic and Black characters (Minority Version) and White characters (Non-Minority Version) interacting in urban settings. TEMAS protocols are scored for the adaptiveness of personality functioning based on each examinee's stories told in response to the pictures. The instrument's  reliability was established in a study of 73 Puerto Rican students in kindergarten through grade 6 in New York City. The utility of TEMAS in predicting psychotherapeutic treatment outcomes was investigated with 210 school children in kindergarten through grade 3 in New York City. Results from a study with 296 psychiatric outpatients and public school students support the validity of TEMAS for discriminating between clinical and school groups of minority children. The TEMAS was standardized on a sample of 642 white and minority children (281 males and 361 females), with ages ranging from 5 to 13 years. A 40-item list of references is included. (Author/SLD)",

As an outcome, a framework that links the literature of cognitive science and mathematical problem solving was developed for protocol analysis of mathematical problem solving. Within this framework, each behavior is categorized by heuristic episode and cognitive level. Data were obtained from videotapes of six small groups of seventh-grade students (N=27), who attended a middle school in Queens (New York City), as they worked together to solve a mathematical problem. Three coders viewed each tape in 1-minute intervals. Watching one or two students in the group, the coders assigned one of the following episodic categories and cognitive  levels: (1) read (cognitive); (2) understand (metacognitive); (3) analyze (metacognitive); (4) plan (metacognitive); (5) explore (cognitive or metacognitive); (6) implement (cognitive or metacognitive); (7) verify (cognitive or metacognitive); (8) watch (undetermined cognitive level); and (9) listen (undetermined cognitive level). Explicitly delineating the role of metacognition and cognition within the heuristics of problem solving gives researchers and mathematics teachers a tool to evaluate problem solving. Implications for cooperative group processes and classroom assessment are discussed. Three figures and one table contain the study data. The framework that was developed is outlined. (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"The role of survey data in assessing teacher supply, demand, and shortage is illustrated through a description of the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) of the National Center for Education Statistics. This survey exemplifies a method that involves: (1) a sample survey; (2) representative surveys; (3) cross-sectional surveys; and (4) comprehensive and national surveys. The SASS was administered for the first time in the 1987-88 school year. Its four questionnaires--the Teacher Demand and Shortage Questionnaire, the Administrator Questionnaire, the School Questionnaire, and the Teachers Questionnaire--supplemented by the Teacher Followup Survey will permit assessment through either prevalence or market based models. The complex question of teacher attrition can be addressed  through a framework for analysis termed the &quot;Comprehensive Attrition Model,&quot; developed from SASS data to consider transfer attrition and exit attrition. Survey research can also measure many of the factors affecting the magnitude of teacher supply. Limitations to the usefulness of the survey method in the areas of cost, errors, and forecasting are reviewed. The considerable relevance and utility of survey research methodology do not mean that other methods for studying and projecting teacher supply and demand are superfluous. Three tables present information about survey research. (SLD)",

        "description":"The issue of parallel forms is of paramount importance for producers of standardized tests. With increasing emphasis being placed on standardized test results it is necessary that each student achieve the same standard score regardless of the form he or she was administered. In the case of the American College Testing (ACT) Assessment Program, five different forms are administered annually. Each form is purported to be measuring the same skills with the same degree of accuracy. The parallelism of two forms of the Mathematics Usage Test from the Enhanced ACT Assessment Program (EAAP) that were administered to 2,500 examinees during the fall of the 1989-90 academic year was examined. Unlike traditional studies of parallelism, this study illustrated several new techniques that can  be used to study parallelism from a multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) perspective. Based on the MIRT analysis, the tests did not appear to be multidimensionally parallel, although conditions that could alter this conclusion are discussed. Recognizing the fact that most tests assess multiple abilities, it is proposed that the methodology can provide a basis for future research. Nine tables and eight figures, as well as an appendix that illustrates two test items, are included. (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"Use of clustering methods with data from the 1987 High School Transcript (HST) component of the 1986 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is discussed in an attempt to persuade data analysts and researchers that they should be interested in problems traditionally turned over to samplers. Nearly all surveys used by the National Center for Education Statistics incorporate a stratified, multi-stage cluster sample design due to the substantial economies involved in the cost of data collection. Although clustering is a simple idea for reducing costs, the assumption of independent and identically distributed errors is violated by the clustering of students within schools. Weighting alone does not correct for the lack of independence of the observations when computing  estimates of standard errors. No explicit mathematical solution can generally apply to the problem of clustering. The sample design and measures of course-taking used in the 1986 NAEP are described. Data for 21,446 students in the 1987 HST Study are included. Results, including comparisons with 1982 High School and Beyond results, indicate that the combined impact of large cluster sizes and large intra-cluster correlations is so large that one should not try to estimate standard errors without adopting a replication method. Secondly, since large within-cluster correlations exist, it is likely that further work using a hierarchical linear modeling approach is likely to be fruitful. Four data tables are included. (TJH)",

In this study, the MAT was derived from American College Testing (ACT) program assessment data, using a sample of 169,116 high school students (108,036 minority and 61,080 white students) from the ACT-tested graduating class of 1987. Use of the MAT reduced score differences between various races by sex groups that were present using the ACT Composite. However, based on a sample of 7,836 fall 1987 freshmen from three universities, the accuracy of the MAT was generally no better than the ACT Composite for predicting first-year college grade point  average and retention status, as measured by correlations and by proportions of students correctly admitted/not admitted. Other uses of the MAT for increasing minority representation and success in college are discussed, including recommendations for the use of the MAT at individual institutions.

        "author":["Smith, Michael W."],
        "description":"The insights provided by Rasch analysis of results from a literature test were explored. Students in grades 9, 10, and 11 (n=261) responded to a 28-item test before they received one of three treatments: (1) direct instruction, based on research on metacognition in reading, which attempts to give conscious control of strategies used to understand irony; (2) a tacit method, which seeks to have students develop their own strategies through extended practice with the genre; and (3) no treatment. The test made four statements about each of seven poems, five of which were ironic, and asked respondents to strongly agree, agree, disagree, and strongly disagree with each statement. A revised posttest with additional ironic poems was taken by 253 students. Test analysis suggested that the  interaction of confidence and understanding in some students made dichotomous scoring preferable to step scoring. Analysis, especially of the new poems on the posttest, suggested that the belief under attack as well as the difficulty of the language in the poems contributed to students' difficulties in understanding irony. Analysis of pretests and posttests indicated that experimental treatments had equal effects on students regardless of initial ability, although the direct treatment may have been more beneficial for the least able students and for the most difficult tasks. The test proved to be a reliable measure of students' understanding of irony in poetry. Results illustrate the benefits of Rasch analysis in test construction, interpretation, and scoring. Five data tables are  provided, and the test is included. (SLD)",

The definition used in the 1989-90 field tests of dropout statistics collected for the CCD provides operational criteria for identifying dropouts. For example, deceased, incapacitated, or currently suspended students are specifically removed from consideration. Factors to consider include whether a student is engaged in an elementary/secondary program, as opposed to adult education, and whether a completed credential will  be recognized by state or district officials. Those who conduct research or provide dropout statistics need to make their definitions explicit.

In a second study, 29 second-grade, 29 fourth-grade, and 25 sixth-grade teachers predicted which students (n=2,070) would score in percentiles 1 to 15, 16 to 35, 36 to 50, and above on standardized reading and mathematics tests. Students took the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills and a reading test. Fourth-grade teachers had similar accuracy rates for minority and white students, but had lower  expectations for students who had been retained. The second study demonstrated that the teachers were better at identifying students who were truly at risk, and that the teachers had difficulty identifying students below average but not seriously at risk. Overall, the teachers were more likely to make pessimistic judgments about minority and low socioeconomic students, suggesting that the teachers were not conscious of how non-academic factors biased or mediated their expectations for students.

A list of important characteristics of a standard-setting procedure was derived, drawing on the work of R. A. Berk (1986). The best method was found to be a highly formalized judgmental, empirical Angoff procedure with iterations, in which content area specialists in each field would be provided, after each round of ratings, with field test results and an estimate of the effects of ratings. The data collection process used a computer-based data entry form, and each judge entered ratings onto an electronic form. At the conclusion of a round, the forms (spreadsheets) were merged with a master form that automatically calculated means and  ranges of ratings and a passing score, and the computer created an output dataset to estimate passing rates and ratings for the panel. The method has been used to collect over 50,000 ratings from about 100 judges with no loss of data. In operation, the method was practical and could be administered to 20 judges by 2 staff members in a 2-day period. The method was sensitive to examinee performance data and appeared statistically sound. The method was approved by the State Board of Education, the Technical Advisory Committee, and the State Teacher Certification Testing Advisory Committee.

The rating scale, based on the theory of problem-based learning of W. H. Gijselaers and H. G. Schmidt (1989), covers educationally important dimensions through 10 subscales, most with Likert items. A new problem-based, community-oriented curriculum was instituted at the university in 1987. After each curriculum unit, the scale was administered to all students. Results were used to evaluate three variables: (1) quality of problems used; (2) adequacy of lectures; and (3) tutor performance. The problem of the absence  of absolute standards for what can be considered sufficient performance of a course is circumvented by applying a reliable measurement approach in which each course or teacher is compared to other courses and teachers, and in which the highest score constitutes the norm against which others are judged.

        "description":"A component analytic method for analyzing multivariate longitudinal data is presented that does not make strong assumptions about the structure of the data. Central to the method are the facts that components are derived as linear composites of the observed or manifest variables and that the components must provide an adequate representation of the observed variables. Specifically, the components are derived so as to minimize the sum of squared errors in the linear regression of observed component variables. Although no structural assumptions are required, the method derives components under a variety of stationary constraints. An advantage of the method for researchers studying change at the individual level is that scores on the derived components are uniquely calculable and  have clear properties. The method might, therefore, be usefully applied as a precursor to the application of strong models for change in the component scores at the individual level. The method can easily be generalized to encompass data measured longitudinally in multiple groups. A program has been written in FORTRAN to perform the method's analysis, although the program is not \"exportable\" at this time. An example of the application of the component analysis method is presented. (TJH)",

        "description":"A constrained component analysis method, which bears a formal resemblance to the confirmatory factor analysis methods developed by K. G. Joreskog (1969) and others, is presented. In confirmatory factor analysis, the constraints allow the testing of formally structural hypotheses within a model that is falsifiable, even in its &quot;just defined&quot; form. In component analysis, the goal is to determine whether a component solution that is restricted in various ways can still account for an adequate share of the variance in the observed data. The consistency and efficiency of the estimates under the constrained analysis are considered; however, no statistical tests of fit of the component are discussed. In this sense, the method is closer to the work in constrained canonical correlation by  W. S. DeSarbo and others (1982). Interesting applications of constrained component analysis exist in data that are longitudinal or cross-sectional in nature. In these cases, the natural constraints may involve the property of being stationary or the invariance of the compositing weight, component pattern, or component structure matrices. In data measured at a single occasion in a single population, constraints might be used to impose simple structure or achieve a sensible variable clustering. Boundary constraints might be used to achieve a positive manifold. (TJH)",

        "description":"The measurement integrity of M. A. Rahim's Organizational Conflict Inventory (ROCI-II) and D. M. Roussel's Managerial Frames of Mind Survey (MFMS) was investigated, as was the relationship between scores on the two measures. Subjects were 369 managers from three types of organizations: (1) higher education; (2) not-for-profit public sector organizations; and (3) a for-profit corporation. Analyses conducted included classical reliability analyses, both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, and a multivariate analysis of relationships between the two measures. Results focusing on the measurement integrity of the ROCI-II are generally supportive of the measure, suggesting that it evaluates five dimensions, as postulated. Confirmatory factor analysis suggested that the scales  were not orthogonal constructs. Results focusing on the measurement integrity of the MFMS are less favorable. Exploratory factor analyses supported the measure, but confirmatory analyses did not result in a reasonable fit of the model to the data. Results suggest the need for additional item refinement and construct elaboration. The canonical analysis identified some manager archetypes for further exploration. Six tables and two graphs present study data. (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"The reliability, sensitivity, and criterion-related validity of concept comparison (CC) ratings and computer-derived multidimensional scaling (MDS) maps were studied as ways of assessing reading comprehension. Fifteen experts (2 district coordinators and 13 reading specialists/special education teachers) were included in this study. Reliability was studied by comparing CC ratings and maps produced independently by 5 teachers reading eight 250-word passages from elementary level science and social studies texts. For the 3 of the 8 passages that had sufficient interrater reliability, instrument validity was assessed with 104 reading disabled junior and senior high school students. A randomized control group design compared CC tasks completed before and after students read related  or unrelated passages. Students reading related passages produced post-reading CC scores significantly more closely related to teacher scores than did readers of unrelated passages. Student and expert CC scores were then correlated with student scores on: (1) vocabulary and reading comprehension sections from norm-referenced reading tests; and (2) maze tests, multiple-choice questions, and oral reading fluency performance, all based on the passages. These three measures were substantially related to post-reading CC scores, but not to pre-reading scores. Standardized test scores were not significantly related to pre-reading or post-reading CC scores. Reliability and validity results support further research on the use of CC tasks and MDS maps for assessing reading comprehension for older  disabled readers. Nine data tables, six figures, and three appendices providing study results are included. A 132-item list of references is provided. (Author/SLD)",

(That study found that magnet school students expressed more favorable attitudes toward science than their comparison school counterparts, and that these attitudes continued through gender, ethnicity, and grade level). In the later study, participants consisted of: 124 fourth- and fifth-graders attending the John Moffett Neighborhood Elementary Science Magnet School; 85 fourth- and fifth-graders from the regular school that  participated in the earlier study; and 169 fourth- and fifth-graders from a regular school that was not involved in the earlier study. The same set of attitudinal items that was used in the previous investigation was used in this study, as well as results from the school district's citywide testing program. Investigations focused on general attitudes toward science, gender, and grade level. Results indicate that: (1) magnet school students were no more likely to select science as their first or second favorite subject than were their counterparts in the regular elementary schools; (2) grade, overall, was not a significant factor but it did emerge as significant in the magnet school and one of the comparison schools; (3) gender was not significant in the analysis reported here; and (4)  differences in achievement were slight in each of the comparisons. Designation of the school as a magnet school did have some bearing on desegregation. In general, findings of the study conflicted with those of the 1988 study. No firm judgment about the effects of magnet schools on attitudes or achievement could be made. (TJH)",

Most statistical packages allow educational researchers to test for differences across repeated measures using both the univariate mixed model F test and a multivariate test. Numerous researchers have suggested using both tests. The &quot;special&quot; orthonormal mean contrasts can be used to provide researchers with insights into why one or the other or both of these modes of analysis provide significant or non-significant results. Results of the analyses indicate that reporting the per group &quot;special&quot; mean contrasts and contrast variances is useful to understanding what is causing statistical significance (or non-significance) in  simple and complex repeated measures designs. Analysis of single groups found in real (and some fabricated) repeated measures data supported the recommendation to use both the univariate and the multivariate tests when considering such designs in exploratory analyses. In more complex designs, it is recommended that the patterns of mean contrasts and contrast variances be observed in each of the groups across each variable. Such patterns would be expected to remain stable when no interaction is present, but to differ when an interaction is found. Seven data tables and one graph are included.

        "description":"Three strategies for augmenting the interpretation of significance test results are illustrated. Determining the most suitable indices to use in evaluating empirical results is a matter of considerable debate among researchers. Researchers increasingly recognize that significance tests are very limited in their potential to inform the interpretation of scientific results. The first strategy involves evaluating significance test results in a sample size context. The researcher is encouraged to determine at what smaller sample size a statistically significant fixed effect size would no longer be significant, or conversely, at what larger sample size a non-significant result would become statistically significant. The second strategy would involve interpreting effect size as an  index of result importance. The third strategy emphasizes interpretation based on the estimated likelihood that results will replicate. These applications are illustrated via small heuristic data sets to make the discussion more concrete. A 37-item list of references, seven data tables, and an appendix illustrating relevant computer commands are provided. (TJH)",

        "description":"A procedure used to average several Mantel-Haenszel delta difference values for an item is described and evaluated. The differential item functioning (DIF) procedure used by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) is based on the Mantel-Haenszel statistical technique for studying matched groups. It is standard procedure at ETS to analyze test items for their differential difficulty with regard to gender and race/ethnicity of examinees. Test items used to perform the averaging procedure for this study were taken from the item bank of a large national testing program. Each form used in this study consisted of 80 items. Forms selected for the study had a large number of items in common. The delta difference average is the mean of single delta difference statistics across forms  weighted inversely to their respective error variances. Overall, the results of differential item functioning analyses are similar to the weighted average procedure. Even if test forms were constructed to have items in common, as is the case in common item equating, the cost of test development and subsequent statistical analyses would be considerable. The weighted average procedure, on the other hand, is quite easy to perform, particularly with the use of a personal computer, and it does not require reformatting of the original data. Seven data tables are included. (TJH)",

        "description":"A study involving 234 Texas college students was undertaken to develop and test the validity and reliability of an instrument designed to measure college students' attitudes toward alcohol. Special attention was given to the content and construct validity of the instrument. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 24 years. The mapping sentence served as a template for the development of attitude items and as the source of the regional hypotheses. The major hypotheses suggested that there were four basic facets underlying attitudes toward alcohol. Gamma coefficients of monotonicity were computed to estimate the pairwise associations among all the attitude items separately for each form of the instrument. This analysis resulted in two square symmetric proximity matrices. Each matrix was  submitted to the ALSCAL procedure of the Statistical Analysis System software package for classical non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis. Results indicate that the facet approach to attitudes research forces the researcher to systematize the process of instrument development and item writing. Mapping sentences have also shown advantages in the area of generating items, primarily in the context of criterion-referenced achievement testing. The Alcohol Survey is provided. (TJH)",

But Hispanics did not move as rapidly as observers had predicted because the diverse groups comprising the Hispanic community required the early part of the decade to develop a collective awareness. It was not until the latter part of the 1980s that their leadership could focus on a national political agenda. Political influence was reflected by an increase in the number of Hispanic elected officials and the appointment of several Hispanics to high-level government positions. Hispanic affluence increased,  Hispanic businesses proliferated, and the Hispanic consumer market also grew. However, the following shortfalls and losses are also noted: (1) an anti-Hispanic backlash, including immigration restrictions and the English Only Movement; (2) an increase in Hispanic poverty and unemployment levels; and (3) a serious decline in Hispanic educational attainment levels and the loss of bilingual education programs. The Cuban American community was negatively affected by the decision to cease granting automatic exile status to Cubans, the use of immigration as a negotiating tool between the United States and Cuba, and the deportation to Cuba of non-Mariel Cuban immigrants. The Cuban American school dropout rate increased as did participation in juvenile gangs. However, Cuban Americans experienced  political, economic, and professional growth.

        "description":"Comprehensive educational choice, implemented by a voucher system, would improve the quality of education of Chicago's elementary and secondary students and empower parents to choose the public or private school that would best serve their children's special needs. Enrollment in the Chicago Public Schools has decreased by 29 percent since 1971, partially attributable to a decline in public confidence in governmental institutions. A radical reform of public education is required to combat the following youth problems: (1) poverty; (2) unemployment; (3) dropping out; (4) juvenile crime; (5) alcohol and drug abuse; and (6) early parenthood. Educational choice would allow parents who were displeased with their child's public school to select another public school, remove the  financial disadvantage of choosing a private school, and give all parents the opportunity of choosing the public or private school that best meets their child's individual needs. The following recommendations are suggested: (1) a system of educational choice should be expanded throughout the Chicago Public Schools; (2) the current state system of funding should be replaced with a voucher system that is paid directly to parents; (3) the Illinois General Assembly should establish an adequate fund to support the voucher system; and (4) the Illinois State Board of Education should be responsible for supervising the system and designating schools eligible to receive vouchers on the basis of curriculum, physical facilities, teacher qualifications, and racial integration. Parent choice would act  as a catalyst to meaningful school reform and provide the optimum in educational opportunities regardless of place of residence or economic status. (FMW)",

The paper argues that freedom of choice in an educational context is a critical right of parents, and that schools of choice offer the best opportunity for all children to get a quality education. Research studies indicate higher levels of student achievement, teacher morale, and parent involvement associated with school choice, and &quot;choice&quot; students experience significantly fewer problems in school. However, despite the recommendations of the Detroit Public Schools Parental Choice Task Force in 1986, the demand for additional schools of choice remained unmet after three years.  Members of the community joined to form the HOPE Reform Team with the aim of changing the educational delivery system in Detroit. The HOPE campaign resulted in significant reconfiguration of the Detroit Board of Education and a mandate for educational change. Since his appointment, the transitional General Superintendent has accomplished a number of reform goals, including balancing the budget and winning support for additional taxes to finance comprehensive school system restructuring. The board's current plan calls for autonomous local schools administered by principals who are great leaders. The plan is designed to assure a structural change in how Detroit's children are educated and to assure educational quality throughout the Detroit district. (AF)",

STEP comprises the following goals: (1) enable students to enter and persist in college preparatory courses by teaching essential critical thinking, study, organizational, communication, scientific, and mathematical skills; (2) promote self-esteem and self-confidence; and (3) develop career awareness through exposure to minority role models. Fifty-two predominately black 7th-, 9th-, and 11th-grade students completed the first year summer and academic components of the program. A variety of  standardized tests and measures were used to evaluate student progress, including the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test (PSAT), the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale, and the Ravens Coloured Progressive Matrices. Analysis of student scores indicates that their self-esteem was positive and their performance on standardized tests was acceptable. The discrepancies between scores on tests of critical thinking and scores on standardized tests suggest that the program should increase emphasis on critical thinking skills and align the content of mathematics and science modules more closely with those of the regular school curriculum. This study is intended to become the first part of a 3-year longitudinal evaluation. Statistical data are included on eight tables. A list of 15 references is  appended. (FMW)",

The project was created to combat the high dropout rate in language minority student populations. Its main objective was for Spanish- and Haitian Creole-speaking special education students of limited English proficiency (LEP) to acquire optimal language proficiency in English while developing reading and writing skills in their native language (Native Language Arts, NLA). The project also provided students with career orientation and information. The following findings  are discussed: (1) students made significant gains on the Language Assessment Battery; (2) course grades suggested that both Spanish and Haitian Creole-speaking students acquired NLA skills; (3) the program met its content area objective in science and social studies but not in mathematics; (4) the project met its objective in career education; (5) the dropout rate of program students at both schools was more than 10 percent lower than that of mainstream students; and (6) data were unavailable to assess the objectives for parent involvement and staff awareness of student needs. Recommendations are made on how to improve the program. Three tables are included. (JS)",

        "description":"The Stewart B. McKinney Act of 1987 was intended to remove barriers and ensure access to education for homeless children. But despite a 1988 consent decree, the United States Department of Education (DOE) has failed to comply with its statutory duties to implement the Act, the states have also failed to implement the Act adequately, and homeless children are still being shut out of school. An extensive investigation included interviews with Federal and state officials and a 20-state survey of service providers. The following recommendations are suggested: (1) DOE should immediately comply with its obligations to distribute funds, monitor state compliance, provide technical assistance, remove limits on direct services, and report to Congress; (2) the states should take immediate,  affirmative steps to comply with the McKinney Act by removing all residency requirements, expediting the transfer of records, removing burdensome documentation requirements, and providing transportation to school; and (3) the McKinney Act should be expanded to provide additional services to children who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. The following material is appended: (1) pilot projects currently funded under the Act; (2) state coordinators' appraisals of the non-regulatory guidance; (3) state plan activity; (4) evaluation of initial state plans; (5) excerpts from interviews with state coordinators regarding their understanding of program dates; (6) state coordinators' assessment of communication with DOE; (7) letter from the National Association of State Coordinators for the  Education of Homeless Children and Youth (NASCEHCY) to DOE and DOE response; (8) state coordinators' suggestions to DOE; and (9) a summary of interviews with shelter providers.

        "description":"This digest is the first in a series of quarterly publications about topics related to educational equity, which will also include reviews of related resources. Its main article examines the adverse lifetime consequences for females of dropping out from school. Women who fail to complete high school are penalized both by their lack of education, which is the fundamental key to employment; and by the still prevalent myth that men are the primary source of income for most families, even though 67 percent of American women work and 60 percent of those working women are either supporting families or are part of households where the husband's yearly earnings are less than $15,000. Women from poor families must overcome an especially difficult set of obstacles to successfully complete  school. Despite the advances made in the past 30 years, schools are still primarily oriented towards the white, male student; females are denied teacher attention, socialized to be cooperative rather than aggressive, exposed to low expectations, and not provided pregnancy and childcare services that could increase the chances for young mothers to remain in school. Schools and teachers can help lower the female dropout rate by providing a bias-free educational environment that ensures that females achieve the same level of educational and economic opportunity as males. The second article, \"WEEA Materials Key to Dropout Prevention for Girls,\" reviews seven publications that can be directly applied to the educational needs of females. (FMW)",

Information was gathered from a survey of 139 Hispanic and 300 Black males in grades 6 through 8 at 4 inner city Chicago schools, police, and school records. Analysis indicates that a majority of both groups  demonstrated at least some limited gang experience or identification but different patterns of involvement were discovered between the two. Cronbach's alpha indicated a respectable level of inter-item reliability for both groups. School and police records were used to assess external validity. Fitting Rasch models to the eight items for the two subsamples produced two different, internally valid, seven-item scales. Statistical data are included on 13 tables.

Information was gathered from state Coordinators of Education for Homeless Children and Youth, regional coordinators of homeless programs, and national and local organizations. The programs described are organized into five categories. The first concerns educating school personnel and contains one program: the Massachusetts Department of Education Inservice Workshop Project, which identifies the problems of homeless students for educators. The second category focuses on school-shelter cooperation and contains three programs: the Home School Visitors Program (Apache Junction, Arizona), the Oakland Salvation Army Shelter/Oakland Unified School District Program, and the West Virginia Department of  Education Rural and Urban Projects. Grouped under category 3, &quot;school-based programs,&quot; are the following 7 programs: the Coeur D'Alene School Project (Venice, California), the Transition Room project (Madison, Wisconsin), the Denver Public Schools After School Program, the Maryland Department of Education Homework Assistance Tutorial Program and Helping Hands Homework Assistance Program, the Massachusetts Department of Education Volunteer Tutor Project, the Extended School Day Program (New York, New York), and the Students Living in Temporary Housing Program (New York, New York). Progams for homeless adolescents, the focus of category 4, are the Adolescent Shelter Project (Massachusetts), Project GAIN (Greater Access to Independence) (New York, New York), and the Youth Education and  Learning Project (Providence, Rhode Island). Finally, separate school programs, the subject of category 5, are the St. Vincent de Paul Joan Kroc Center/Harbor Summit School Program (San Diego, California), the First Place program (Seattle, Washington), and the Tone School (Tacoma, Washington).

Using the model of Bossert and his colleagues as a preliminary framework, the study analyzes principal interviews and demographic and questionnaire data. In addition, student outcome data focus on student attitudes and student achievement. Schools in the following areas are studied: (1) Chicago (Illinois); (2) Miami (Florida); (3) Newark (New Jersey); (4) San Antonio (Texas); and (5) Milwaukee (Wisconsin). The findings for each of eight schools are presented separately, and then findings are discussed based on a cross-site analysis. Findings indicate that the context of issues mitigating against student retention range  from within the school to placing blame on the student, family, and community. However, the attitudes and achievement levels of students seem to be unrelated to how the principal perceives the context of the student dropout problem. All the principals cite programs and strategies related specifically to school climate, and yet none of them addresses the issue of racial prejudice. None of the principals considers the cultural relevance of the curriculum when they place the context of the dropout problem within the school. The findings of this study imply that if principals care about the educational success of racially diverse students, they must begin to dismantle the unequal power relations inherent in the interactions within the school and with the community. Two figures are included,  along with a list of 42 references. (JS)",

The survey consisted of two questionnaires completed either by mail or by telephone. The following topics are discussed: (1) identification of schools that need improvement, including performance standards used by states, how the states measure changes in performance, and how many schools did states identify as needing improvement; (2) number of schoolwide projects; (3) reactions to the U.S. Department of Education's role in helping to implement the  regulations for the School Improvement Amendments; and (4) states' reactions to the Technical Assistance Centers (TACs). The following findings are presented: (1) states are using the lowest possible standards allowed by law to determine which schools are in need of such assistance; (2) the number of schoolwide projects has more than tripled from 1988 (180) to 1989 (664); (3) the States were generally satisfied with the Department's assistance; and (4) the TACs received high marks for their assistance.

Of the 49,986 students enrolled in 1985-1986, 40,754 were in bilingual education (BE) or English for speakers of other languages (ESOL) programs. The remaining 9,232 were enrolled in high school equivalency or other adult reading programs. Fifty-nine percent of the BE and ESOL students were female; 58.6 percent of the BE students were Black and 30.4 percent were Hispanic. Of the BE and ESOL students, 37.2 percent were employed full-time, 8.7 percent were employed part time, and 40.1 percent were unemployed. The average BE  and ESOL student is 33.33 years old. Very few reported their incomes. For those who did, the average annual income was $7,773. Almost 25 percent of the BE students and just under 20 percent of the ESOL students separated from the program during the course of the fiscal year. The BE students averaged achievement gains of about 8.5 months, and the ESOL students averaged gains of 13.2 raw score points.

In today's world, all speak, but more than one-fourth of the world's people--and more than half in developing nations--do not have the uniquely human capacity of reading and writing. The diffusion of literacy worldwide has been politically, socially, and economically thwarted. Nonliterate persons do not demand literacy because people do not always recognize their self-interests. Illiterate people are excluded from defining their own world and from contributing to collective knowledge, history, and culture. Literacy is intimately connected to knowledge--one must read something. Literacy brings the reader into touch with modern, scientific,  nontraditional knowledge, which is available primarily in print. Literacy is necessary for health, economic development, and social, political, and cultural survival. In this International Literacy Year, individuals, governments, and voluntary organizations must make literacy work for human survival and a more humane existence. (KC)",

Research from the past shows how important reading and writing have been over the centuries. Literacy was often invested with social and moral power as well, and religious literacy was the predominant form of reading and writing from before the time of the ancient Greeks through the Middle Ages. Some theories of literacy link the industrial revolution to the increase in literacy of the period, but others dispute this assertion. Mass literacy programs or campaigns have also been a focus of recent historical inquiry--showing that literacy campaigns never take place in cultural and historical isolation. Social science research today has grown tremendously. This  research has raised four main issues that are likely to be investigated often in the years to come: (1) defining and redefining literacy; (2) the acquisition of literacy; (3) retention of literacy; and (4) individual and social consequences of literacy. Future research is likely to focus on adult literacy campaigns, the advent of universal primary education, and changing levels of literacy requirements. (KC)",

        "description":"Significant reductions in adult illiteracy can be achieved most cost-effectively by focusing more resources on the education of women. These monies contribute not only to women's development but also to the educational achievement of their children. Educated adults have more influence on their children's education; the children become literate adults who, in turn, produce more educable children. Maternal education also has an effect on fertility rates and the mortality and health of children. The contribution of educated mothers to the cognitive and language skills of preschool children gives the children an advantage and continues to affect their educational success. International literacy statistics show that women comprise almost two-thirds of illiterate adults; of the 116  million children under 11 who are unable to attend school, almost two-thirds are girls. Studies showing the effects of women's education on children's literacy argue for greater investment in mothers' education. As greater numbers of women enter the work force and higher levels of literacy are demanded of workers, women's education becomes critical to a literate work force and to economic growth and development.

        "description":"Deaf children come from all races, classes, and backgrounds, but as a group they have a hard time learning to read and write. The more hearing a child has, the better the child performs on tests of reading ability. Parents who can communicate well with their deaf children help them to perform well at school, but beyond &quot;good&quot; communication, there are few specifics. Only about 10 percent of all deaf children have parents who are deaf. Research shows that, on average, the deaf children of deaf parents have better reading abilities than deaf children of hearing parents. Deaf children from middle-class, educated deaf families consistently perform well in reading and writing. For some deaf children, mainstreaming has been a disaster because they are isolated from other deaf children  and adults, and their special needs cannot be addressed in classrooms designed primarily for hearing children. For others, it has brought new educational opportunities. Deaf children need to know how hearing people use reading and writing in everyday life. At the same time, they need to learn the uses of literacy among other deaf people. To develop literacy for deaf children, educators need to understand better what kinds of knowledge the children already have about reading and writing before they come to school, how they use sign language and finger spelling, and how they learn about speech. Deaf children must learn the rules of orthography. The first step in producing literacy for deaf children is to recognize that deaf children are not hearing children who do not hear, but children  with special sets of knowledge.

The project focused on enhancing workers' careers by providing literacy training to assist them in remaining employed or advancing in their careers. Led by an advisory board, the project developed and delivered at eight work sites a mobile literacy education program individualized to the workers' needs. Use of a mobile learning center enabled the project to overcome some of the problems associated with literacy programs. The unit traveled to seven sites in the morning and afternoon/evening shifts, Monday through Thursday, for two classes, 2-3 hours in length. On Friday, the van provided two 3-hour  classes at the eighth site. Industry and workers contributed equal amounts of time. Participants were tested and provided with an individualized program using the computers and instructional equipment available in the van. A total of 164 workers participated in the open-entry/open-exit project. Workers and employers were pleased with the program. Final test results indicated that 103 of the 138 participants who completed 2 months of the program progressed. Of the 25 participants who took the General Educational Development (GED) test, 20 (80 percent) passed. The success of the program was demonstrated by the poultry industry's continuation of funding.

The College of St. Catherine plans to use the 2-year college campus to start a program for single parents. A survey (with a 44 percent response) of the 126 single parents currently enrolled showed that they have enough support from family and friends to make it through school, but that they need odd-hours child care and emotional and social support. Based on the results of the survey, the college has proposed providing housing specially designed for 25 single-parent students and their children within walking distance of the St. Mary's campus. Ideally, there would be a day care center or several family day care homes also within walking distance. The program  would be staffed by an administrator and an aide, who would oversee the program, pursue funding sources, and serve as a liaison to community resources in order to reduce stress and increase the potential for success for students. At present, possible sites are being explored and funding sources for the program are being pursued. (KC)",

A larger sampling of chief continuing education administrators then was surveyed, with 33 surveys returned. These administrators rated and ranked the tasks in order of importance, and the results were plotted on a matrix. Tasks most important to the continuing education operation were listed and categorized as those personally performed and those delegated to others. The DACUM task analysis initially developed by the 11 administrators was validated as an accurate occupational task list, the definition was verified, and professional workshops were recommended.

The taxonomy developed by the project is a system of classifying CAI packages based on the needs of the JTPA population and the degree of complexity and quality of the technology employed in the CAI packages used by JTPA programs in the remediation of basic skills. The taxonomy requires consideration of types of CAI packages and  quality measures. Two evaluation designs have evolved from the rationale and taxonomy: (1) a large-scale, longitudinal design equal to approximately six professional person years of effort; and (2) a small-scale, survey-type evaluation effort. Both evaluation designs are structured to provide information about the effectiveness and efficiency of CAI packages used in basic skills remediation in JTPA programs.

At all levels of education the rural population is at a disadvantage compared with the urban population. One out of five rural adults in Pennsylvania has not continued education past the eighth grade. Among the costs to businesses from employee illiteracy are costly mistakes made by employees who lack adequate basic skills, lost productivity and efficiency, decreased product quality, increased need for supervision, increased cost of training, problems in the relationship of workers with supervisors and coworkers, and accidents due to inability to follow safety directions. In 1986, 25 of the 41 Pennsylvania counties designated nonmetropolitan had no literacy programs funded under  State Act 143. The minority group funding priority of the act may discourage literacy programs in rural areas. These factors should be considered in the design of rural programs: geographic isolation means higher costs to deliver services, lower population density results in fewer students per class, the sociodemographic makeup of rural populations must be recognized in program allocation criteria, rural areas have fewer organizations that could provide literacy programs, isolation can lead to low self-esteem and affect motivation to participate in literacy programs, existing rural networks must be used to recruit students, and technologies that can deliver programs over distances are particularly important in rural areas. A set of policies for delivering literacy programs to rural adults  in Pennsylvania should be developed. (21 references) (CML)",

        "description":"Program directors, teachers, and counselors of Adult Basic Education (ABE) and General Educational Development (GED) programs were surveyed about their attitudes toward and knowledge of their students with learning disabilities (LD), the availability of services for those students, the availability of staff development activities about LD, and their desire for additional staff development and support services. Respondents included 205 teachers, 64 program directors, and 37 counselors. Many of the respondents defined LD in a manner consistent with federal legislation. Others defined LD as any unexplained learning problem. Attitudes toward LD students were generally positive, but there was less agreement on the extent to which programs should accommodate such students. Knowledge  about characteristics of LD students was greater than knowledge of their legal protection from discriminatory educational practices. Teachers wanted more information on where to refer students for assessment, and counselors wanted to know where to refer students for help. Relevant inservice training, assessment of students, and LD specialists were available to fewer than one-third of the respondents. More than two-thirds of the respondents wanted inservice training on characteristics of LD students and appropriate teaching methods, and more than half desired more LD assessment, consultation with LD specialists, and appropriate teaching materials.

The Senate report includes amendments to the bill as originally submitted and recommends passage of the bill. The report includes information on the following topics: history of the legislation, background and need, committee views, cost estimate, regulatory impact statement, section-by-section analysis, additional views, and changes in existing laws. The purpose of S. 543 is to provide improved job training and education services to those economically disadvantaged  individuals most in need of assistance. The bill revises both the adult and youth allocation formulas to target funds to areas with high concentrations of economically disadvantaged individuals. It targets services to those persons facing serious and multiple barriers to employment. It increases the emphasis on educational and workplace competencies and long-term retention. It stresses more intensive, comprehensive and coordinated services and mandates that both basic and occupational skills services be made available to all program participants who need them. (CML)",

Usable data were obtained from 62,938 armed services applicants who took the ASVAB in January and February 1983. Results showed that the parallel forms reliability coefficients between ASVAB Form 8a and the production tests (Forms 9a through 10b) on the subtests and composites ranged from .67 to .93. The subtest and composite reliability coefficients between Form 11a and the production tests ranged from .68 through .94. The subtest and composite reliability coefficients were quite consistent across test forms. Subgroup analyses indicated that reliability coefficients for subtests and composites were slightly higher for males than females and  slightly higher for Whites than for Hispanics and Blacks. However, the subgroup reliability coefficients were still acceptably high. Subtest scores were never used alone, with only composites scores used for selection and classification decisions. (CML)",

        "description":"A study was conducted by the General Accounting Office (GAO) to review U.S. education and training strategies; identify likely weaknesses; and examine the strategies of England, the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, and Sweden for preparing noncollege youth for employment. GAO reviewed the literature, consulted with experts, and visited the foreign countries. Results indicated that insufficient attention is devoted to preparing U.S. noncollege youth for employment. About 9 million of the nation's 33 million youth aged 16 to 24 will not have the needed skills to meet employer requirements for entry-level positions, including 5.5 million dropouts and 3.8 million high school graduates who lack high school competency. The four competitor nations have national policies that  emphasize preparing noncollege youth for employment. The following approaches used by some or all of the countries may be relevant for the United States: foreign countries expect all students to do well in school, particularly in the early school years; foreign schools and the employment community guide students' transition from school to work to a greater degree than in the United States; competitor nations establish competency-based national training standards that they use to certify skill competency, whereas the common U.S. practice is to certify only program completion; and competitors invest extensively in jobless out-of-school youth to assure them a job or further education and training.

Findings were as follows: (1) proprietary vocational schools play a large role in New Jersey's postsecondary educational system; (2) the licensure, regulation, and funding of proprietary vocational school programs is scattered among at least six state agencies; (3) the development of educational policy and oversight of proprietary vocational schools is not a central mission or major activity of any state agency; (4) the agencies do not have sufficient resources and staff expertise to maintain an adequate level of oversight of the educational  programs offered; (5) none of the state agencies maintain contact or share information with the proprietary school accrediting associations; (6) there are no common standards among agencies for school licensure, on-site monitoring, educational program accountability, or skills assessment for placing poorly prepared students; (7) there are no consistent standards for protecting the consumer's interest through prorated tuition refund policies or adequate financial protection against sudden school closures; (8) there are few formal mechanisms for regular exchange of data, program reviews, results, or notification of events such as school closures; (9) no one conducts systematic collection, tabulation, and publication of basic data about school performance measures such as dropout rates,  graduation rates, and placement rates; and (10) the adequacy of state regulation of proprietary vocational schools has become a national issue so that the New Jersey situation is not unique.

In addition, student coordinators have developed and implemented weekly volunteer reporting provisions of students' attendance and their progress. Volunteers receive course credit for providing 6 hours of tutoring each week. They are also expected to learn and understand the needs of the people they serve. Instructional training materials produced by Literacy  Volunteers of America have been purchased for tutors and clients. Students receive coursework on literacy and on teaching methods. The project will be evaluated by determining the number of tutors enrolled in class, the number of hours served per week, course offerings, and program accomplishment. This project should develop a corps of well-trained tutors in community agencies, introduce undergraduates to the needs and problems of illiterate adults, and provide an incentive to volunteer in the form of academic credit for undergraduates.

The practices include sustained silent reading; sustained silent writing; prepared oral reading as a social activity; language experience texts; reading, rereading, and retelling published texts; strategy instruction; and informal assessment. The second article, &quot;Building a Community of Learners (Schneider), describes how such a community is created at the ABE learning centers at the New York Public Library. &quot;Teachers Talk about Writing&quot; (Slivka)  contains a discussion by four ABE teachers from Region 3 of the New York City Board of Education on how they facilitate writing in their classes. &quot;Parallels in Literacy and Second Language Acquisition&quot; (Hill, Rabideau) argues that ABE and ESL teachers can learn from one another and provides examples. &quot;Teaching Writing through the Arts&quot; (Denis) explains how a drama and playwriting teacher from New York City Public Schools uses theatre games and writing exercises that build writing confidence and interest, including talk sessions, oral storytelling, monologues, two-character plays, free associative plays, team writing, and a sound effects writing exercise.

To conduct the NALS, 175 trained interviewers employed by the Educational Testing Service will interview approximately 13,000 adults, aged 16-64, residing in private households and dormitories. Each interview will consist of 15 minutes of background questions and 45 minutes of simulation tasks. In the simulation tasks, adults will respond to reading, writing, speaking, and listening tasks that will require them to demonstrate a range of skills and knowledge such as recognizing, acquiring, organizing, interpreting, producing, and applying  information found in various types of printed materials. The study defines literacy as the ability to use printed and written information to function in society, to achieve one's goals, and to develop one's knowledge and potential. The results of the NALS will be compared to those from other recent large-scale assessments of literacy. The survey results will be conveyed to the general public, policy and business leaders, educators, and program providers. Each of the 50 states is invited to participate in a concurrent assessment that will provide results comparable with those of the NALS. (CML)",

Information was gathered at the policy academy and at police headquarters through records and interviews and by visits to the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies and to three police departments. The study's findings were as follows: (1) there have been changes in the police academy course of study and academic requirements, although the academy did not document the changes and the reasons for them; (2) although there was little documentation, it appears that at least five recruit termination recommendations were overturned by officials above the director of training level; (3) police academy instructors are selected through a formal  selection process and receive both classroom and on-the-job training; and (4) a process exists for the police department to acquire accreditation for its training academy, and other avenues for the process may also be available.

        "description":"Policymakers and educators agree that technology education is crucial to the development of a technologically literate society that can compete successfully in the world of the 21st century. Technology education is the study of: the application of adaptive systems, including tools, capital, materials, processes, energy, information, and people; the uses of knowledge and technical means to solve practical problems; and the effects of technical solutions in individuals, society, and culture. As a leader in the field of technical education, New Jersey has produced an outstanding curriculum model. Although significant educational gains have been made, the state must continue to strengthen and encourage technical education programs in its schools. A 1989-90 study showed that New  Jersey elementary teachers are interested in including more technology education in their classroom instruction, feel that technology education is important, and would like more guidance on the subject. Middle school teachers said that hands-on technology courses encourage students' abilities to think and solve problems creatively. Scores on 1990 technology achievement tests indicate there has been a significant increase in the understanding of technology among middle school students. Students, parents, and administrators see technology education as a program that allows students to integrate many curriculum areas in a creative and thought-provoking manner.

        "description":"The accelerating growth of restitution as an institutionalized program in juvenile courts throughout the country is documented. According to studies, the number of formal restitution programs has increased from approximately 15 in 1977 to more than 400 in 1989. Program components include financial restitution, community service, victim-offender mediation, victim services, job information services, work crews, transportation, job slots in the private sector, and subsidies. Many existing programs are increasing their services by, for example, instituting new components such as paid work crews and supervised meetings between victims and offenders. The Restitution Education, Specialized Training, and Technical Assistance (RESTTA) program has contributed to this growth, providing  training and technical assistance to representatives of about 1,000 juvenile courts since 1984. Findings from the national evaluation of the major initiative on juvenile restitution operated by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) from 1978 through 1982 indicated that restitution is effective not only as a means of compensating victims but also in reducing recidivism. Indications are that the use of restitution will continue to grow. As courts move steadily from a treatment-based orientation to one focused more on offender accountability, restitution will increasingly occupy a more central place in the dispositional process.

The institutions were the Centre for the Study of Adult Literacy at Carleton University, Brock University, McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology, Literacy and Language Training Resource Centre, St. Francis Xavier University, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Institute for the Study of Adult Literacy and the Literacy Research Center at Penn State University, Center for Applied Linguistics, and the  proposed U.S. National Center for Adult Literacy. The critical factors in a model are its definition of literacy, scope of work, stakeholders and their needs, researchers' specialties, who sets the research agenda, and what work other than research will be done. Possible models include centers within universities, governmental and nongovernmental organizations, and quasigovernmental bodies. Steps to creating an acceptable model are to conduct an inventory, needs assessment, and feasibility study. The study recommends 5-year funding of a provincial or federal nongovernmental organization with a director, board of trustees, and a permanent staff of two or three. An alternate recommendation is a combination center such as the Center for Applied Linguistics and a foundation. (CML)",

Within a few years, 75 percent of those entering the labor force will be women and minorities, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The work force is getting smaller as well as changing in nature. To attract and keep the most qualified and productive workers, businesses must make changes in their management policies and practices that few employers or workers have anticipated or are prepared for. Among the companies that have promoted the benefits of a multicultural, diversified work force are Procter and Gamble, Digital Equipment Corporation, Avon, Xerox, Mobile, Honeywell, Colgate-Palmolive, and Ortho Pharmaceutical. For example, Procter and Gamble has established special mentoring programs to help bring women  and blacks into management by providing them information about organizational styles of management, leadership, communication, and networking. Digital Equipment Corporation has started a program to create management awareness of attitudes and assumptions about races and genders and how those attitudes and assumptions influence company and employee policies and behaviors. To manage a diversified work force, managers must learn to be sensitive to the cultural influences among their employees. Cross-cultural training is also crucial to success in international markets, as U.S. companies compete in a global market and form joint ventures that require the transfer of employees across continents.

The solutions to many current environmental problems require a local or national response, but solutions to other problems will require a global response. Major United Nations reports have recognized that solving global environmental problems will occur only through long-term strategies for achieving sustainable development. Education is one such long-term strategy, and adult educators possess much knowledge about adult learning and program planning and development that can be beneficial to environmentalists. However, the role adult educators should play in the environmental movement is not yet clear. Because adult educators are more accustomed to meeting the needs of  individuals rather than groups, they may have to adjust some of their strategies to work with existing environmmental groups. Adult educators will need to approach environmental groups as partners who want to support rather than supplant their educational activities. They also will need to be aware of some issues affiliated with environmental education. Among those issues are that: (1) environmental education is by its very nature a political activity; (2) questioning the merits of global development raises the issue of balancing environmental needs against the needs of developing nations; and (3) because adult environmental learning is primarily a cognitive activity, perhaps adult educators should engage not in adult education but in promotion of adults who take action.

Although part-time adult educators may be able to consult with supervisors in planning professional development, more often they work in relative isolation and must take sole responsibility for their inservice needs. Development of a plan provides a framework for the discipline and commitment needed to achieve changes. One type of plan, the Personal Professional Development Model, has four phases: initiating, planning, managing, and evaluative. The success of a professional development plan requires identification of resources such as print and nonprint materials, staff development opportunities, and other adult educators. Feedback is  also necessary as a measurement of progress. Guidelines for managing professional development include: (1) stating no more than three objectives; (2) acknowledging the existence of deterrents such as lack of time, resources, or support; (3) forming a network for collegial feedback; (4) making site visits; (5) pairing with a peer to learn a new technique; (6) joining professional associations and attending conferences; and (7) using ERIC resources.

        "description":"The number of adults with learning disabilities (LD) is difficult to estimate. They may comprise as many as 80% of adult basic education students, but a smaller proportion of students in other adult education settings. Many adults with LD exhibit strengths that enable them to compensate for their disabilities and perform successfully without supportive services. Among the most serious issues concerning adults with LD are lack of an agreed-upon definition and scarcity of appropriate assessment tools. Prevailing theories assume that individuals with LD have difficulty learning because of a difference in information processing that may have a neurological basis. This difference can affect self-esteem, education, work, socialization, and daily living. Adult educators should be aware  that few diagnostic tools are appropriate for use with adults. Adults with LD should assist in the assessment process, which is useful only to the extent that it helps adults live more fully. A combination of intervention strategies and teaching techniques is most effective in meeting the needs of these adults. Techniques include: assessing learning style and using multisensory techniques; motivating students through feedback and positive experiences; teaching memory techniques and transferable strategies; using compensatory aids such as tape recording, word processing, and computer-assisted instruction; and being organized and clear in instruction.

        "description":"Flexible work schedules are one response to changes in the composition of the work force, new life-styles, and changes in work attitudes. Types of alternative work schedules are part-time and temporary employment, job sharing, and flextime. Part-time workers are a diverse group--women, the very young, and older near-retirees. Although part-time jobs are disproportionately lower-wage jobs, a growing number of part-time jobs are in managerial and professional positions. Part-time workers often have extensive commitments to activities and responsibilities outside of work, such as child and elder care, which makes part-time work an appealing option. Temporary workers are a fast-growing segment of the labor force. Temporary jobs provide scheduling freedom and variety for workers, and  businesses often use contingent workers for cost containment and staffing flexibility. One response to a shortage of permanent, career-status part-time jobs is job sharing, typically an arrangement in which two people share one full-time job. Successful job sharing depends on the commitment of job partners and willingness of supervisors to be flexible. Flextime schedules allow variability in the starting and ending times of the work day. Flexible working hours can result in higher motivation and job satisfaction. A diverse work force and potential labor shortages imply that an array of scheduling options should be offered. Greater demand for alternative work schedules will require changes in the practices and attitudes of employers and employees, such as rethinking organizational  structures and task assignments, altering supervisory styles, conceiving new methods of performance appraisal, and preparing flexible, self-directed workers.

        "description":"School-to-work transition services are intended to help youth develop the skills and attitudes they need to find and keep employment, maintain a meaningful adult life-style, and develop positive social interactions. Eligibility for such services has now been broadened beyond disabled students to include students with economic or educational disadvantages or limited English proficiency. Barriers to effective delivery of transition services are: (1) lack of career exploration programs in middle schools; (2) lack of interagency coordination; (3) lack of case managers; (4) limited parental involvement; and (5) absence of a computerized management information system. Four types of models for effective delivery include: curriculum content models; instructional stages models; supportive  services models; and articulation and communication models. Successful transition service practices depend upon: (1) the availability and identification of a wide array of community services; (2) systematic procedures for prescribing appropriate services, such as individualized plans, case management, transition assistance centers, and parent resource centers; (3) articulation between service providers, within single agencies or institutions and between multiple agencies or institutions; and (4) systematic tracking of information regarding the availability, cost, and evaluation of services.

        "description":"One of the fastest growing social and economic trends in the latter half of this century has been the entry of women into the labor force, especially women with children. How a mother's working outside the home affects her children is far from clear. This study examined the relationship between maternal employment status and sex-role concept, autonomy, and locus of control in early adolescence. Level of maternal education and type of maternal occupation were examined as two components of socioeconomic status which may have some bearing on adolescent outcomes. The effect of maternal employment was studied in terms of the child's age when the mother first entered the work force. Subjects (N=81) were eighth grade students grouped in four social studies classes according to academic  level. A questionnaire measured sex-role orientation, autonomy, locus of control, and demographic factors. Results failed to reveal many clear patterns of effects from maternal employment variables. Correlations between maternal and child variables differed for boys and girls. Mothers who enjoyed their jobs were more likely to have daughters who held less stereotyped sex-role attitudes. High level of maternal education was positively correlated with daughter's autonomy scores, but not son's. For boys, internality was associated with higher academic level. For girls, an association was revealed between high level of maternal education and internality. (ABL)",

        "description":"This book of readings presents 33 articles that address topics of importance to counselors who serve middle school students. It was written for counselors already working in middle schools and for individuals who are preparing for careers as middle school counselors. The book will also benefit both elementary school counselors who help children make the transition from elementary to middle school and high school counselors who work with adolescents making the transition from middle school into high school. It deals with how counselors in middle schools can help early adolescents face the challenges of adolescence, noting that middle school counseling programs should focus on preparing students for the increased independence of high school life that is typically accompanied by  more social pressures and increased stress. The chapters in this book offer many ideas for helping young people improve their sense of self, their decision-making capabilities, their interpersonal relationships, their academic skills, and their abilities to deal with stress. Chapters contain articles that have been invited for the book in addition to articles that have been published in various counseling journals. Each chapter contains an introduction by the editors and a collection of articles on a particular topic. Individual chapters focus on: (1) self-discovery; (2) family relationships; (3) peer pressure and drug abuse; (4) stress and suicide; (5) sexual maturation; (6) academic achievement; (7) career exploration; and (8) organizing a middle school counseling program.

        "description":"Many studies on occupational stress have examined the buffering effects on stress of different variables. This study hypothesized that self-esteem support would buffer the effects of job stress on depressive symptoms. Subjects were 131 business administration students who were also permanently employed. Subjects completed questionnaires three times with a one-month period between administrations. The reassurance of social worth scale from the Social Provision Scale and the revised Daily Hassles Scale were completed at time 2, along with other items. Also completed at times 2 and 3 was a 10-item scale measuring depressive symptoms. Results of a regression analysis indicated that the job stress x self-esteem support interaction significantly predicted later depressive symptoms,  with prior depressive symptoms partialled. The findings are supportive of the hypothesis that self-esteem support buffers the impact of job stress, and imply that type of support, rather than amount or source of support may be the important factor in determining the impact of support on job stress.

Analysis of data revealed that alcohol was the most widely used substance among the students, followed by cigarettes and marijuana, in that order. Each of the remaining seven substances (inhalants, cocaine/crack, hallucinogens, stimulants, sedatives, tranquilizers, and other narcotics) was used by less than 8% of the students surveyed. Females reported using wine more often than did males; there were no significant differences between males and females in use of beer, liquor, cigarettes, or marijuana. Beer, cigarette, and marijuana use appeared to increase as grade level increased.  Students who reported higher levels of participation in school activities reported less substance use. Parental employment status did not correlate significantly with levels of substance use. Approximately 20% of the sample reported negative life events related specifically to substance use. Twenty-three percent reported driving a car while under the influence of drugs or alcohol; 48% reported riding in a car while the driver was under the influence. The findings support the premises that adolescent substance use increases with age and that a polydrug use phenomenon can be observed in this population. Students identified substance abuse counselors as the best source of accurate and complete drug information. (NB)",

The program is developmental in nature and attempts to integrate the various facets of students' development--intellectual, social, physical, and emotional. The CGCP focuses on student development in three major areas: (1) academic achievement; (2) career and educational decision making; and (3) personal and social development as a student. The counselor's role in the CGCP is defined in terms of the following components: group guidance, individual planning, responsive counseling services, and school program support. While suggested time allocations  for each area are outlined in the document, actual time allocations will be determined by individual school needs. In developing this program, the three MCPS Board of Education priorities which define student outcomes have been addressed specifically: improve the academic achievement of all students; implement a special emphasis program for improved academic performance and extracurricular participation of minority students; and improve student abilities to become independent learners, responsible citizens, and effective group members. These priorities and the goals of the CGCP are a shared responsibility of counselors, teachers, administrators, students, and parents. (TE)",

It indicates that 2,034 students in grades 9 through 12 dropped out of school, representing an annual dropout rate of 7.3%. Statistics from past years are included to chart trends and it is shown that the annual dropout rate has remained relatively steady over the past 3 years, with a slight downward trend during the last decade. A section on methodology discusses measurement and reporting of dropout information. The report presents a breakdown of the state's dropouts by grade and district and includes countywide patterns in dropouts. A table grouping dropout data by age and grade simultaneously shows that most dropouts left school at ages 16 and 17 and most were overage for grade placement.  Examination of the state's dropouts by race shows that the annual dropout rate for Blacks was 1.7 times the rate for whites and the rate for Hispanics was 2.3 times the rate for Whites. Reasons for dropping out are classified into three broad categories: school, economic, and personal. A section on the academic performance of dropouts presents data which suggest that significant numbers of dropouts are capable of satisfactory levels of academic achievement. The report concludes by emphasizing Delaware's commitment to understand and deal with the conditions that lead to dropping out of school. (NB)",

The manual explains and gives examples of some of the main concepts presented in the video, followed by learning exercises, and provides further primary references for more in-depth reading on the subject. Major concepts covered in the video which are explained more fully in the manual and for which examples are given on how each concept is used in counseling include metaphors, similes, imagery, metaphorical  stems, reframing, problem solving, therapeutic fairy tales and stories, guided imagery, client focused dreams, and lines of feelings. It is noted that the video provides five opportunities for the instructor to stop and practice concepts. The manual gives more details on how to conduct video exercises and suggests other exercises that can be employed in conjunction with the video. Exercises deal with: (1) using metaphorical stems in counseling; (2) problem solving using metaphors; (3) writing a therapeutic fairy tale; (4) telling of counselor stories; and (5) exploring dreams in a client-focused manner.

The program included the use of DISCOVER, a computerized career guidance system. Thirty-six students comprised the initial treatment and control groups. The Self-Directed Search, Career Decision Scale, Self-Esteem Inventory, and a program evaluation form were completed by the students. Teachers and counselors also completed evaluation forms and submitted logs containing program notes. The following variables were examined: self-esteem, career indecision, congruence, differentiation, number of identified job possibilities, and perceived usefulness of the program. It appeared that the program  may have impacted congruence, number of identified job possibilities, and career indecision. Students seemed to view the program positively. Interestingly, counselors chose to participate minimally in the program and rated it least positively. It is speculated that counselors may lack the competence to serve these students and may not see such activities as part of their roles. (Author)",

This document supports the view that school counselors should become involved in developing support groups for teachers and presents several ideas for developing such groups. It begins by briefly reviewing teacher stress and burnout and other sources of work stress as a way of establishing the need for support groups in the school. A section on starting support groups for teachers looks at types of support groups and presents questions a potential leader might consider in developing a support group. Helpful qualities of group members  are identified and hints are given on getting started. The remainder of the paper presents a sampler of topics or themes that may stimulate ideas for readers who wish to begin or enlarge a program of teacher support groups for professional and paraprofessional employees in schools.

The project concluded that: (1) unwed fathers need to be held responsible for their children and, for the most part, should be required to fulfill the minimum obligations of fatherhood; (2) it is generally in the best interests of the children if their fathers develop a personal relationship with them  and this should be encouraged; (3) these responsibilities and interests need to be balanced against the rights and needs of the young mothers, family members, and society as a whole; (4) young unwed fathers often need considerable assistance and encouragement to be able to fulfill their parenting responsibilities; (5) increasing job skills and opportunities of young unwed fathers not only benefits their children but society as a whole; and (6) many different sectors of society at national, state, and local levels will need to work together to meet the challenge of encouraging more responsible and involved parenting among unwed fathers.

An after-school program, Youth 2000 Visions, was designed to assist local adolescents in addressing and confronting problems they face. Implemented in a medium sized southeastern community and sponsored by a Boys and Girls Club, Youth 2000 Visions represented a collaborative community-based program aimed at bringing low- and high-risk adolescents together to create motivational and educational messages about social issues. Youth Teams worked with local businesses to create and disseminate their messages. Outcome data on a pilot program  involving 48 middle/high school students suggest that the Youth Team approach may be a fruitful addition to traditional community-based programs. Youth 2000 Visions represents a pilot program and, as such, calls for additional research to document program effectiveness and the relative importance of various program components. Nonetheless, the Youth Team concept appears to hold promise as a context for high- and low-risk adolescents to positively affect their own lives and the lives of their peers. (Author/ABL)",

Project specialists worked at two locations: the Alternative Learning Center (ALC) located at the Ridgeview Campus and the Travis County Juvenile Detention Center located at Gardner-Betts House (GBH). SCGC was designed to help these at-risk students improve in the areas of school attendance, academic achievement, behavior, and frequency of contacts with the court system. An evaluation of the program determined that: (1) enrollment at GBH (N=715) increased by 27 percent in 1989-90 with a student-teacher ratio of 15:1; (2) recidivism had increased; (3) follow-up data suggest that  attending ALC had no effect on academic performance; (4) insubordination, truancy, fighting, and obscene language were the most common referral categories; (5) a new practice resulted in the transfer of 151 overage middle school students to the ALC; (6) while few students wanted to remain at the ALC another semester, more than one-half were more confident about staying in school and most believed that their behavior had improved; and (7) few of the school district's employees had a positive view of the ALC.

        "description":"The \"pining\" for a sense of community, for roots, for a connectedness to others is a basic need that is felt but not understood, that is desired but not practiced, in either college settings or the greater society. Thus, the prevalent rootlessness and transience that students arrive with at college (due to a highly mobile society) is never overcome on college campuses because colleges do not practice what they preach. In reality, little is understood about the dynamics of community and the development of a sense of community is actually inhibited through the policies and procedures of institutions of higher education. Students arrive without an understanding of, or first hand experience with, a functional community and never experience anything to the contrary. Four doctoral  students combined knowledge, resources, and interests to develop a model for reclaiming community on the nation's campuses as a student project. The end result, a project called \"The Future Residential Community,\" has become the basis for further research into what the components of community are; how they can be implemented; and how a vision that does not have roots in tighter controls, restrictions, and regulations can be demonstrated to all constituencies of higher education. Colleges and universities must begin lessening distinctions such as those implied in viewing students' lives as separate and unintegrated and categorizing them as either inside or outside the classroom. The same philosophy must be applied to distinctions between faculty, administrators, and staff. It is also  logical that intentional communities outside higher education be experienced and studied, that the rich history of communal movements be drawn upon, and that model communities from Trappist monasteries to agricultural communes be explored.

        "description":"People in the counseling profession make some profound assumptions about the freedom that all people have (or seem to have). From the moment that each counselor began counselor training, the notion that people are able to generally choose and make decisions for themselves has been associated with the dominant process models of the profession. As a result, it is often difficult to imagine that some people as they grow older lose their freedom to make choices about their lives. Autonomy has been said to be similar to notions of self-determination, freedom, independence, etc. Autonomy gives a sense of well-being, but the older person may decrease his or her expectation of freedom of choice in order to retain a measure of life satisfaction. Situations in which individuals can lose  their autonomy as they grow older include the diagnosis of cancer and nursing home placement and residency. The diagnosis of cancer may cause a person (or family) to surrender to the forces of medicine without considering the choices that are available. Another potential source for the loss of autonomy in adult life occurs with nursing home placement and residency. The nursing home carries with it images of the \"last stop,\" a place where the poor, the frail, and the demented elderly go to wait to die. Counselors who work with persons in later life must constantly ask themselves what is truly best for the individual and consider too what allows them the most autonomy. (ABL)",

The concept of empowerment is explored in detail, developmental issues, the key to understanding the aging process are reviewed, and empowerment strategies are discussed through a holistic wellness model. Chapter 1 looks at aging and the need for empowerment, considering: demographic changes, gender and aging, health and disability, and the social context of aging. Chapter 2 examines self-efficacy and  empowerment and presents models of helping and empowerment, while chapter 3 focuses on developmental and transition theories for later life. Chapter 4 concentrates on reactions to late life stress, looking at mental health and aging, the social breakdown syndrome, and psychological components of social breakdown. Chapter 5 suggests strategies for reversing the breakdown syndrome by presenting the social reconstruction model and discussing societal, psychological, and other aspects of reconstruction. Overcoming learned helplessness and perceived lack of control and coping with depression and discouragement are also addressed. Stages of the empowerment process are outlined. The final chapter considers empowerment through developmental approaches, with an emphasis on wellness.  (NB)",

Subjects consisted of 26 third-grade students, of whom six were chosen for case studies, in a school in a large metropolitan area. All students were Latino, bilingual, and from working class homes. Modified cloze lessons were taught, and three types of data were collected with regard to the lessons: video tapes and field notes of the lessons observed, literacy artifacts, and teacher and student interviews. The focus of the data analysis was to discern how the various participants in the lesson (students, teachers, and ethnographer) understood the activity and the degree to which these understandings were shared across participants. Field notes indicated that the only issue which emerged was that at  times the children had difficulty in using the information presented after the blank to judge the meaningfulness of their responses. Literacy artifacts indicated that 93% of all student responses were meaningful. Student and teacher interviews indicated there was a large degree of misunderstanding between the teacher and the case-study students. It was the nature of school as an institution in general, and the lack of authenticity in the lesson in particular, which accounted for the discrepancy between teacher and student understandings.

The central question of the study asked if the experience of a developmental kindergarten was worth the extra year participating children must spend in the educational process. The format for the study was that of a three-way analysis of variance, with three groups of at-risk children: developmental kindergarten students (DK); retained students (RT); and students who were not retained (NRT). Children were placed in either the developmental or academic kindergarten on the basis of test placement results. Results indicated that there were significant program effects in favor of the DK students for all three academic outcome measures when comparing  the DK students with the RT students, indicating probable program effects in those measures for the developmental kindergarten program. Three self-perception measures were significant for DK students when they were paired with the RT students: school ability, school behavior, and global self-worth. Results indicated significant probable program effects for and strong effect sizes for the children, specifically white and female children who attended developmental kindergarten. Those effects were present in all academic subject areas, in work/study habits, and for self-perceptions of scholastic ability. (Six tables of data and a figure are included.) (MG)",

Three hundred fifty-one questionnaires were completed, with results indicating that the books were used daily or frequently. Qualitative interviews revealed that 60 of the 75 stories were considered relevant by the students. The  relevancy described by the children in these interviews was both personal and cultural. Background knowledge and experiences that the children brought to the text, combined with their ability to predict what was happening, affected readability the most.

Three tests were individually administered to each child: the Yopp-Singer Test of Phonemic Segmentation; the Beach-Singer Test of Auditory Abstraction; and the Gates-McKillop-Horowitz Reading Diagnostic Tests, Words: Untimed Subtest. Results revealed statistically significant correlations between word recognition and auditory abstraction and  between word recognition and phonemic segmentation. The findings support the predictive validity of the construct of phonemic awareness for word recognition and decoding. Findings also indicate that phonemic segmentation and auditory abstraction are important abilities for a child to develop to be successful in word recognition. Further research into causal explanations of whether phonemic awareness develops prior to or as a result of formal reading instruction appears to be called for.

The report suggests that what is needed is an integrative framework which informs educators about current theory, research, and promising practices in the teaching and learning of genuine literacy and serves as a guide for Oklahoma City Public Schools (OKCPS) to develop more appropriate, stimulating, creative, and academically productive environments for all  learners. The report states that the task force identified the following critical experiences in the language arts curriculum: (1) Reading: Transacting with Text; (2) Writing: Composing Texts; (3) Extending Reading and Writing; (4) Investigating Language; and (5) Learning to Learn. While the report focuses on the first experience, reading and extending reading and writing, it reflects commitment to the interrelationships of these experiences in an approach to learning which focuses on the process, not the product.

        "description":"Globally, knowledge of word meanings is related to reading comprehension. R. C. Anderson and P. Freebody's (1981) seminal paper on vocabulary set forth three hypotheses to explain this relationship--an &quot;instrumentalist&quot; hypothesis suggesting that knowledge of word meanings directly causes reading comprehension, and &quot;general knowledge&quot; and &quot;general aptitude&quot; hypotheses, which suggest that the relationships between vocabulary knowledge and comprehension are mediated by a person's aptitude or knowledge. These hypotheses are global. Beginning with the word level, under what conditions will an individual word disrupt or interfere with comprehension? Findings suggest that differences in contexts, readers, and tasks influence whether word meanings will affect comprehension. These  factors are used to develop a framework for deciding if a word should be directly taught and, if it is to be taught, how extensively. (A figure is included, and 66 references are attached.)

Differences appeared to be due instead to learning and experience--and specifically to learning and experience with print and print  concepts. Such differences can be taught away--provided that teachers have the knowledge, sensitivity, and support to do so. (RS)",

Storytelling was introduced as a possible weekly free-play school activity to children aged three to six, and most of the children chose to participate on several occasions. The storytelling of the youngest children differentiated out of imaginative play or conversation but soon became an intentional and bounded activity. Children typically drew on several sources for their stories, and they used several strategies when they had difficulty continuing the story. Smiles and laughter frequently accompanied story telling. Observations suggested that children had clear authorial intentions, that they were aware of themselves as  authors, and that they valued their stories. (Author/MG)",

        "author":["Black, Susan E."],
        "description":"A practicum was designed to improve and expand the writing skills of 13 fifth-grade students placed in an upper elementary school Alternative Education program. The major goal was to provide the students with the means to improve their written output and grammar. Secondary goals were to help the children to think logically about the writing tasks and to enhance student self-images. Students were trained to use the computer and word processor and engaged in such prewriting activities as discussion, determining the main idea and subordinate details, and judging for whom the composition would be written. They kept a daily journal to which the teacher responded in a nonjudgmental manner, and the word processor was used almost daily to improve writing and student attitudes. An  informal writing checklist was utilized to determine if writing skills improved. Analysis of the data revealed that the students benefitted from using a word processor in the following ways: they were able to write logically and coherently on a given topic; it was easier for them to see and correct mistakes; written output increased; they expressed their feelings in their written work; writing exercises seemed to provide an emotional release which lessened inappropriate behaviors; student use of adjectives and adverbs showed increases; spelling improved; and in some instances, capitalization improved. Classwork and homework were returned promptly. (Four tables of data are included. Appendixes include a dictated paragraph, checklist for informal evaluation of writing, first dictation and  final dictation samples, a letter of permission to use the informal checklist, a key to symbols denoting writing errors, and three writing samples.

        "description":"The idea behind this project created by two teachers of different age groups was that providing students with penpals would give students a real audience to write to and change their attitudes about writing. Seventh graders and college students exchanged letters and were required to send working drafts of some class assignments to each other to receive feedback on their writing. By the end of the project, each student had given and received feedback on several letters and drafts of a composition. The two groups did for one another what the teachers could never do: they engaged one another as writers because they personalized the act of reading and writing and, consequently, developed in ways that the teachers had not expected. Because they cared about being understood, they were  motivated to pay attention to mechanics and content. Students learned that instead of ceremonially giving the teacher what she wanted, writing required effort. Tips for a successful penpal project include: make it easy to do; make it part of what would be done anyway; be flexible; be committed to seeing it through; be sure each person sends and receives a letter; build some time to step back and look at what is going on; and have a purpose in writing beyond the letter exchange.

The labs were designed not only to provide training in the skills necessary for preparing a research presentation and paper, but to build on the foundation of faculty-librarian-student collaboration to actively engage the students as readers of primary and secondary texts, as listeners in a lecture, and as teachers themselves. For students in a writing course linked to a lower-division survey of Western Medieval and Renaissance history, by understanding that textbooks are written by individuals within disciplines students also realized that the lectures they heard were secondary material. Students then began to ask substantive questions  about the primary materials. Because students began the quarter learning to recognize kinds of questions asked by historians, they saw more clearly that their own writing participated in an ongoing conversation. During the first week of a reading fiction course, students discovered not only that there are recognizable types of questions and approaches within the discipline of literary studies, but also that the discipline is in the process of redefining and realigning itself, and that they themselves had a variety of critical biases and beliefs of which they had not been aware. By empowering students, teachers allow them to become part of a conversation, and thus to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of that conversation.

A successful approach in accomplishing these goals is two-fold. First, inquiry projects based on argumentation become real to students when they are generated by the class as a collaborative rhetorical community in which questions and answers are valued and sought after. Second, a gradual group investigation of the argument from different angles assists individuals in making sense out of a mass of information. Students obtain a  better understanding of the materials and issues that they and their classmates have sketched out in collaborative discussion, and they can begin to decide what directions they want to take in papers they are writing individually. The students gain valuable experience about audiences and contexts of materials, which they can incorporate in their individual projects.

When exposed to good models of writing, children can be encouraged to reflect on how authors and illustrators have shaped a story, and literary elements, story structure, and design can be identified. As children progress in their understanding of story elements and structure, they should be exposed to varied styles of authorship. Their awareness can be heightened by engaging them in creative responses to good books. As they internalize these models, they begin to take risks with them in their own writing. The valuing of authorship can be promoted through the creation of a writer's studio which includes: some things/ways to highlight the techniques and story craft employed by an  adult author or illustrator of renown; some things/ways to highlight classroom student authors and illustrators; and varieties of tools for writing and illustrating.

        "author":["Ezell, Jeanne R."],
        "description":"Within the field of composition, classical rhetoric was re-discovered in the early 1960s; that interest has been for the most part confined to the first three of the five parts of classical rhetoric--invention, arrangement, and style--with memory and delivery being ignored or, at least, neglected. Recent interest in &quot;the speaking-writing connection,&quot;&quot;collaborative learning,&quot; and &quot;whole language&quot; indicates an interest in delivery. One scholar suggests that teachers can help children consolidate their oral and written resources through exercises that make the functions of speech and writing as similar as possible, such as oral monologues and expressive writing and through using talk as preparation for writing. Teachers who apply collaborative learning to teaching writing have  students work in groups, talking throughout their writing processes. Students work together to discover topics and discover what they have to say about topics. Whole language combines talking and writing with listening and reading to counteract the fragmenting skills approach to education. Taking delivery back into composition classrooms and considering it along with performance is a fascinating possibility. It is hoped that the interest in delivery demonstrated in the speaking-writing connection, in collaborative learning, and especially in whole language will grow. It is an interest in delivery that is more fundamental than the matters of voice and gesture that were so long a part of rhetoric. (Eighteen references are attached.) (MG)",

        "description":"An adjunct faculty member who teaches in three very different colleges and universities sees the similarity of course objectives for freshman writing, in which each program emphasizes rhetorical mode requirements to the exclusion of writing as discovery. Student writing is product-centered, and the writing act is linear in that it adheres to a discourse formula. Students are not encouraged to express or explore their own ideas on an assigned topic, rather they need to find information for their topic, narrow the topic, create a thesis statement, and adhere to a preconceived outline. Furthermore, the writing programs transmit contradictory messages, simultaneously indicating the value of free writing and insisting on formal outlines and the finished product. The problem appears to  be one of mixing modern rhetoric with classical rhetoric in pedagogical theory and practice, i.e., illogically merging the process and product approaches into a current-traditional paradigm. Rather, the writing classroom should be opened up for personal expression in which the student is put on equal footing with the instructor. The writing instructor is no longer the true authority of expression, and the classroom becomes a discourse community. This atmosphere empowers students to be responsible for their learning. (KEH)",

        "author":["Blystone, Jane"],
        "description":"Many theorists agree that attention to audience in the act of writing is a very crucial component whether product or process oriented. Audience to the classical rhetorician is an audience to be persuaded, a weak-minded audience that needs someone to direct its thinking to a point of decision. Some high school teachers use this approach as they ask students to analyze the unknown audience so that the student can adapt the discourse to the rhetorical situation accordingly. In the informational perspective situation, the writer's main goal seems to be effective transmission of information to the reader. The main problem with this theory is that it does not allow for creativity in writing. The social perspective theory promotes the idea that all communication is a social act where  personal voice must give way to the opinion of the masses or at least to the voices in power. After a teacher has considered these three perspectives regarding the teaching of composition, there needs to be a reconciliation of issues voiced by each perspective. Teachers need to become writers to share the problems of writing with their students; this opens the door to allow real audiences to emerge for the teacher and students. Once students and teachers realize that the best way to develop a sense of audience in writing is through sharing real writing with real audiences, then there will be peace in the writing class.

        "author":["Cellini, Alva V."],
        "description":"As Latin American literature progressively enters into the English curriculum, two writers deserve special commentary for their representative contribution to the literary world. Through their works, the Columbian author, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and the Peruvian author, Mario Vargas Llosa clearly convey the Latin American writer's desire to be modern as they confront sociological problems and integrate a discussion of social, political, and economic issues. Garcia Marquez's &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; is a classic example of the innovative production generated by the Latin American literary &quot;boom&quot; of the 1960s. The novel best exemplifies Garcia Marquez's ingenious mixture of realism and fantasy and has resulted in the creation of a total fictional universe in which the  commonplace takes on an aura of magic and the impossible is made believable. In his numerous novels, Vargas Llosa struggles to capture the complexity inherent in diverse personal, social, and historical worlds. Structural complexities are combined with stories that exemplify Vargas Llosa's view of life; for him it is violent, chaotic, complex, absurd, and indefinable. Both writers as well as a rich literary production by Latin American women writers will no doubt enrich the English Curriculum in the decades to come with innovative courses in translation as American students become more interested in developing a closer bond with Latin American countries and their societies. (An appendix contains available works, some in translation, by 10 contemporary Latin American writers; 18 references  are attached.) (KEH)",

        "description":"Creative problem-solving can be used successfully in the writing classroom, for the problem-solving process involves three distinctive stages of thinking activity that remarkably parallel the prewriting steps in the composing process. Similar stages include: (1) data generation and preparation to write; (2) data manipulation and incubation; and (3) insight and revision. Prewriting activities such as brainstorming, freewriting, branching, dialoguing, and asking questions allow students to try various approaches to a topic without interference of critical judgment. Brainteasers used as warm-up exercises in writing classes require students to make inferences that push beyond commonplace or ordinary associations. Verbal reasoning problems require students to learn to combine insight  with systematic and logical thinking. These are useful in getting the students to read carefully, proceed systematically to a solution, and discover implications. Solving verbal reasoning problems also teaches students how to work together and to verbalize their thinking, especially when students alternate in the roles of problem solver and listener. Thinking aloud in solving problems also builds the attitude of openness that is important in the writing process and prepares students to benefit from the thinking protocols used by other writers, both peers and professionals.

The first session revealed a major problem with lack of concentration during the composing process. Next, a set of cue cards was developed and modeled for the student writer to be used as a tool during the writing assignment. Each card contained one directive statement representing one general category of activity, for instance elaborating, planning, and making improvements. The second session revealed significant  improvement in the student's attention to task, time management, planning behavior, and use of higher-level statements. The product was only marginally better than the first essay, however, indicating the need for further research. (The appendix contains six handouts of data and cue card prompts.) (KEH)",

The book suggests that the resulting reviews can be used by teachers as a screening device to reduce the number of books they review and pilot studies they conduct; thus educators will have more time to do  in-depth reviews of two or three textbooks which appear to match their course requirements and their students' academic needs. The book also states that the review instrument can be adapted by districts to reflect their own English objectives and test results. Every review in the book includes two parts and a publisher's description (which appears in the Appendix)--a section which depicts the extent to which the emphasis on content and process is given to each of the topics in the textbooks reviewed, and a section which includes topics on content and processes which might be found only in teachers' editions. The book does not make assessments regarding the quality of the books reviewed, but rather provides information which teachers may find useful in making quality judgments and  selecting specific textbooks for English programs.

The paper maintains that such activities will enable students to learn these important thinking strategies, particularly if the activities are interesting; engage students in using the target strategies; provide repeated practice of the strategies in a variety of situations  that are sequenced with more structure at the beginning and move to student independence at the end; and require students to contend with the immediate demands of a real audience in small group and whole class discussions.

        "description":"A study brought together literature appreciation, schema theory, and cross-cultural studies to explore the relationship between the backgrounds of students in one sixth-form literature class in Sierra Leone and the contexts of the plays described in the drama section of the &quot;A&quot; level literature syllabus of the West African Examinations Council. The study investigated: (1) what students felt about literature in general and &quot;A&quot; level literature in particular; (2) whether the students possessed the appropriate content and language schemata necessary to understand and critically analyze &quot;A&quot; level drama texts; and (3) whether the differences between the students' backgrounds and the contexts of the drama texts adversely affected students' appreciation of the texts. Three sixth-form  literature students were the principal participants in the study. They read two plays, one culturally familiar (Wole Soyinka's &quot;Death and the King's Horseman&quot;) and the other culturally unfamiliar (Shakespeare's &quot;Coriolanus&quot;). Data were collected through three in-depth interviews with each participant. The study found that students preferred culturally familiar texts--they understood and related more strongly to the content and language of the familiar text. However, the amount of material they did not understand in the culturally unfamiliar text was not great enough to seriously hamper their appreciation of the text as a whole. The research also showed that students employed such techniques as attempting to discern meaning from the context, imposing meaning from their own background  knowledge, and adopting what they perceived as the author's perspective on issues.

Story starters are one such activity which teachers can use to begin the creative writing process with their students. For example, large cartoon-like characters made on an opaque projector can be used to initiate discussion. The second step requires a drafting of ideas into story form. Thirdly, the youngsters use their peers in revising their stories. The writer is responsible for responding to the criticism and for making the essential corrections. Next, students rewrite their stories and proofread. They are encouraged to use a dictionary or get help from a peer. Noise levels may be louder than usual, but learning is taking place. Once all corrections have been made, the publishing  process begins. Given paper with an outline of the cartoon-like character on it, students write the final copy within the drawn character. They illustrate the paper and make covers for their books. Completed books are shared with the class. (SR)",

        "description":"To examine methodological issues of managerial gender communication, a study conducted a meta-analysis of the primary research of managerial gender communication. The study addressed the following four issues: (1) the inconsistent findings in managerial gender communication research; (2) the potential influence of male and female stereotypes on research methodology and outcomes; (3) the potential influence of expectancy bias and experimenter effect on primary research studies; and (4) the effect of time on managerial gender communication research outcomes. Twenty-five studies were selected for the meta-analysis. The following characteristics were recorded for each study: authors of the study; number of subjects; sex of target, sex of subject; types of variables in each study;  statistical tests; statistical findings; correlations; whether methodologies relied on perceptions or a record of actual behavior; whether subjects were inside or outside an organization; and specific calculations for each research question. Results indicated that there is no meaningful difference in the communication behaviors of male and female managers based on current quantitative findings. Furthermore, it appears that the behaviors of, or perceptions towards, female and male managers were never substantially different and have not changed over time as a result of female managers' greater involvement in the organizational environment.

The groups met for 25-minute sessions. One mixed-age group met for 60 minutes. Four objectives were formulated for each class, namely, to enable students to: (1) explain the meaning of the term communication; (2) understand some of the reasons why people communicate; (3) recognize the five basic elements of the communication process; and (4) identify some factors which affect the communication process. Results indicated that all objectives were met. The last objective, however, was the least realized goal; students did understand what was meant by a communication  variable but would not have been able to list all communication variables. Results suggest that communication instruction can be successful at the elementary level and that students have an interest in the subject matter. (MG)",

        "description":"While some analysts have asserted that the First Amendment was intended to prohibit laws against seditious libel (speech overtly critical of the government), the judicial record reveals a willingness to tolerate some onerous infringements on free expression. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, 25 states passed &quot;sedition&quot; or &quot;criminal syndicalism&quot; laws, which criminalized anti-government expression. Local ordinances designed to protect public health and safety were also employed in the suppression of speech. Not until the 1925 case of Gitlow v. New York was the First Amendment applied to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment. During this period, state courts also resisted free speech challenges to the sedition laws, as state constitutions offered even less protection for  speech than did the First Amendment. Judicial participation in speech suppression challenges the traditional view of the Supreme Court as protector of rights. Today, the First Amendment must be construed in light of present conditions. While the past cannot be ignored, there is a difference between mindless adherence to the ways of the past and appreciation for continuity, stability, and tradition.

        "description":"Senate confirmation hearings on President Reagan's nominees for the U. S. Supreme Court raise questions about what these nominations tell about law. The controversy that surrounded the confirmation of the Reagan nominees was a direct result of two competing conceptions of law: legal formalism and legal realism. Legal formalism views law as a science based on &quot;universal&quot; legal principles, binding courts to precedent and the decisions of higher courts. Legal realism rejects formalism, seeing reliance on precedent as a static disguise for judicial discretion. Realists see the law more as a collection of argument warrants than scientific principles. To formalists, the selection of a justice should depend on that person's ability to apply the law, not any political ideology. To  realists, it matters a great deal who is making the decisions, so extremist views justify rejection of a Supreme Court nominee. The disagreement explains the debate over the elevation of Associate Justice William Rehnquist to the position of Chief Justice, and the nominations of Antonin Scalia, Robert Bork, and Anthony Kennedy to the Court. Legal realists involved in the Senate confirmation hearings on the nominations focused on the nominees' perceived conservatism, while conservative Senators sought to emphasize the nominees' qualifications. The controversy surrounding the nominations foreshadows legislative battles to come; future nominees will be measured in an ideological crucible. (SG)",

This decline is due not to external factors, but rather to problems and abuses unique to NDT policy debate. Its demise reflects a much broader problem, the abrogation of intellectual leadership in the activity. Coaches and judges have lost sight of the educational purpose of the activity; far too many now view debate strictly as a contest where trophies are won and lost. Contemporary forensic practices (such as the use of excessive speed, counter-intuitive arguments, and destructive theoretical constructs) have contributed to the demise of policy debate. Some measure of vitality can be restored to NDT debate by adopting a more activist theory of  forensics, and by taking decisive actions capable of rectifying the evils of specialization, elitism, and gamesmanship. By remembering that debate is an educational activity and applying that awareness to coaching and judging responsibilities, the community can substantially improve the quality of this valuable type of intercollegiate debate.

        "description":"The United States Supreme Court in New York Times v. Sullivan (1964) extended the scope of protection provided to the press when covering public officials, requiring officials claiming libel by the press to prove &quot;actual malice&quot; (knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of truth or falsity). The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 limited expression by critics of the Federalist administration of President John Adams. The Court has implied in recent years that if a challenge to the law had been brought, the founders of the Republic would have rejected federal government restrictions on seditious libel (speech overtly critical of the government). Despite such suggestions in cases like New York Times v. Sullivan, a review of the literature shows that it is more likely that the Court  would have upheld the Alien and Sedition Acts. Three members of the Adams-era Court supported the statutes, and every justice was a Federalist appointee. Furthermore, the Court had upheld expression limits in other contexts, and state laws restricting speech enjoyed broad support. Justice Brennan's majority opinion in Sullivan, which suggested that the founders would have opposed seditious libel prosecutions, misread American history and begged the question presented to the Court. Brennan's approach also ignored the low value placed on expression by English common law, from which early American law borrowed heavily. The Court's 1964 declaration that the Alien and Sedition Acts were unconstitutional should have been based upon an analysis of the social functions of speech, not a misreading  of history.

Two-hundred and six beer advertisements which appeared on WTBS, the USA Network, and ESPN between September 1983 and September 1985 were studied. Event-specific ads and those in which a creative concept was not present in at least three of the commercials were deleted from the study, leaving 145 commercials. The remaining ads were coded according to a set of 26 categories adapted from earlier studies of magazine and television advertising. Results indicated that camaraderie, relaxation/change of state, and humor were the most common themes in the commercials, as an earlier study had concluded. Most of the  commercials were really about people, rather than beer--people with whom the viewer could identify, good friends to laugh with, and fantasy characters who achieved goals which the viewer could never obtain. In the commercials, beer was the American way, the way to bring out the best in a person, and the golden brew to serve when getting together with friends.

Scholars in these areas have explicated various indictments of the phallocentric, eurocentric, and essentialist linguistic strategies defined and perpetuated by dominant population groups, and some have begun the difficult task of addressing the complicitous nature of hegemonic discourse. This essay explores the problem of complicity as manifested in critical discourses that converge at the juncture of gender, race, and language. The analysis suggests that these discourses maintain the hegemonic dialectic by and language. The analysis suggests that these discourses maintain the hegemonic dialectic by their adherence to an underlying  epistemological principle of essentialist logic, the principle of negative difference, yet offer the possibility of an actively non-argumentative approach to discourse grounded in a rhetoric of definition.

For Vygotsky, language and thinking are initially separate but come to have mutual effects on one another. Vygotsky's perspective is the most effective at linking language and thinking with communication. Language is seen as first a means of communicating with others, and later as an aid to thinking, which becomes more powerful as &quot;inner speech&quot; than it was earlier.

Thirty reticent students, including 9 males and 21 females, were placed in either a control class, which received the usual vocal delivery instruction of a reticence class, an oral interpretation class, or a third class using computer-aided instruction (CAI). Students in the oral interpretation class showed the greatest increase in fluency, while the control group showed the most improvement in intensity modulation. In all three classes, males had a consistently higher degree of change than females. While the  CAI class showed less increase in fluency than the oral interpretation class, they began the study with greater fluency and therefore needed less improvement. Results suggest that when establishing a reticence program, the beginning level of vocal skills, gender-related vocal differences and training requirements, instructor gender, and perception of vocal behavior all must be taken into account. Individualized training, lectures, rehearsals, and presentations all appear to help students improve vocal performance. (SG)",

The collection of valuable information is particularly challenging in the social sciences, which often call for qualitative field research. The effective field research interviewer must not only be knowledgeable of the theoretical background of a given study, but must also be well versed and practiced in a wide variety of communication skills. Beginning in 1970, Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) have emerged as a major vehicle for prevention and treatment of alcohol, drug, and other emotional health problems in the workplace. In 1985, to meet a perceived need for quality education in the core tasks of EAP work and to study the socialization processes  associated with this work, Cornell University together with the New York State Division of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse launched the Employee Assistance Education and Research Program (EAERP). For the research program, three researchers conducted interviews with 278 people who had either graduated from EAERP, dropped out, inquired about the program, or obtained jobs in employee assistance. To prepare participants to be EAP interviewers, weekly research meetings conducted over a 3-year period served as dress rehearsals. Potential participants were persuaded to participate through appeals to trust, credibility, logic, and emotion. Interview strategies varied with the participants. Data collected in the study is still being analyzed, and results of the research effort are anticipated by  1991. (SG)",

        "description":"While contemporary communication perspectives often make a distinction between reality and the televised presentation of reality, viewers may find this distinction difficult to maintain. Television is imbued with perceived objectivity. The use of recreations in popular television programming requires a reconceptualization of how viewers perceive reality. Televised recreations potentially challenge credibility as they provide a point at which the believability of the narrative could be open to question. To study the effects of recreations on credibility, groups of 12 and 17 students (all were white) in an undergraduate communication class at a small northwestern university were asked to view a 12-minute portion of the reality-based television program &quot;Rescue 911.&quot; Some students  noted frustration in trying to distinguish actual events and recreated segments. Most enjoyed the perceived realism of the program, which seemed to contribute to acceptance of the story's social themes (for example, that a black man was portrayed as a criminal and that law enforcement reflected a racist discourse.) The disparity between fact and fiction in dramatic recreations may influence believability without undermining authenticity. Lacking recourse to experiences which discredit dramatic recreations, audiences will continue to rely on television as a source of information about other social groups. (SG)",

        "description":"Tobacco companies have the ability to target their products to segmented audiences by advertising in specialty magazines. Segmentation is a means of providing audiences with ads appropriate to their behavioral, demographic, and psychological characteristics. Through a content analysis of cigarette advertising in 10 popular magazines, a study examined how advertising strategies vary depending on characteristics of the primary readership of different popular magazines. The analysis demonstrated that black and youth-oriented publications have received an increasing number of cigarette ads since 1965. Compatible with segmentation approaches, an analysis of ad content indicated that groups with high smoking rates are often encouraged to switch brands, while groups with low smoking  rates are enticed to smoke by the depiction of attractive models having fun. A logistic regression of romantic content that compared trends over time to the general growth of specialized magazines indicated that the incidence of horseplay and coy model poses has increased over time, while the incidence of eroticism has remained relatively stable. In accord with psychographic theories, significant content differences are found in magazines read by different market segments: horseplay is usually targeted at women, poorer, and younger readers; and overtly sexual appeals and coy model poses seem to be targeted at women, black, and poorer readers more often than at men or general audiences. Knowledge of the tobacco industry's segmentation techniques may help health professionals design smoking  prevention and cessation programs to counter cigarette advertising more effectively.

        "description":"A study examined whether billboard advertising of tobacco and alcohol products is differentially targeted toward White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic neighborhoods. The study analyzed 901 billboards in neighborhood commercial districts in San Francisco, California, giving particular attention to tobacco and alcohol billboards. Neighborhood census data were merged with billboard data to address this question. The study also proposes a theoretical model to explain how this medium is effective. The social aspects of drinking and smoking are posited to be important positive product attributes. The study suggests that the modeling of social cues can serve to motivate product use, disinhibit behavioral restraints, and reinforce existing habits. The data suggest that: (1) across all  billboard advertising of products and services, tobacco (19%) and alcohol (17%) products were the most heavily advertised; (2) Black and Hispanic neighborhoods had more tobacco and alcohol billboards than White or Asian neighborhoods; (3) Black neighborhoods had the highest per capita rate of billboard advertising; and (4) there were more Black models per 1,000 Black people than there were ethnic models for other ethnic groups. Furthermore, the analyses of the content of the billboards revealed that alcohol and cigarette advertisements use social modeling cues such as anticipated rewards, attractive models, and similarity. This understanding of social influence and modeling on billboards should provide health professionals with information to counter the strategies of tobacco and alcohol  advertisers.

Censorship arises because American society is litigious, art is ambiguous, and good teaching is dangerous (in that its relevance threatens those who yearn for the simpler times of the past). The way in which school theater directors respond to school administrators' criticism of material may say a  great deal about both society and those who lead theater programs. Directors may respond by moving challenged productions off school grounds. Students can get involved by clarifying the controversy; researching the legal issues involved; analyzing media coverage of censored artworks; writing essays in support of challenged material; inviting opponents of the production to talk to the cast; or arguing from the other point of view. Controversy can become part of the educational process. (SG)",

School theatre proponents have opened a Pandora's box by promoting theatre's potential to teach, rather than focusing solely on its aesthetic goals. Both sides in the theatre censorship controversy share the misperception that theatre causes behavioral changes, when in fact there is no proof of causation. Furthermore, directors cannot control audiences' interpretations of plays, even if the audiences consist of children. An overriding fear is self-censorship. There is a concern among school play directors that a particular play might prompt theatre program opponents to harass a school board over some highly exaggerated controversy. A teacher finds herself &quot;editing&quot; suggestive  and loaded words and gestures as well as sexist and racist references out of scripts, for fear of criticism. School play directors must continue to select worthwhile scripts based upon what teachers know about children; to direct challenging plays; and to educate audiences. Directors can prepare for controversy by: (1) avoiding inflammatory concepts while highlighting positive themes; (2) allowing teachers a sense of ownership in play selection; and (3) evaluating plays in advance on paper. Teachers must empower children to express freely their perceptions of their theatre. (SG)",

Twelve specific techniques found which model psychologically healthy family communication skills include sharing feelings; allowing  alternatives instead of commands; maintaining composure in the face of sensitive and emotional issues; taking decisions to logical conclusions; setting limits; role playing to show consequences; encouraging expression and awareness of feelings; sharing problem-solving with children; accepting responsibilities; evidencing appropriate expressions of anger and displeasure; spending time together; and modeling values and beliefs.

The class forms a simulated organization with the primary mission of service. Students submit resumes and interview for executive and managerial positions; the rest of the students are assigned to divisions. The class spreads out to other rooms so that each division and executives have separate meeting places. The executives are responsible for creating a vision for the organization, setting specific goals, managing time lines for completion of work, reporting to the board of  directors, evaluating the managers under them, and managing the development of the organization's culture. Work groups receive proposals for projects that the organization would undertake, make estimates of resources needed to put the proposal into operation and forward the proposals to the executive group for their consideration. Other students gather information necessary for the projects and for the other operations of the organization and develop their own project proposals. The board of directors puts in place an evaluation system and conducts two all-organization meetings for evaluation purposes.

Examples of successful programs aimed at young children include: (1) &quot;Kidspeak,&quot; an after-school program for grades three through six designed to teach oral communication skills; (2) a Florida State Department of Education program for middle school students; and (3) a cross-generational debate program emphasizing communication skills developed as a 4-H project.

        "description":"Although conventional collective bargaining has helped teachers achieve greater professional status, its win/lose approach causes participants to overlook shared educational objectives. Since the first experiments in win/win bargaining, the acrimony generated by the adversarial process has led an increasing number of school districts to incorporate trust, problem-solving, and cooperation into their bargaining procedures. This book describes ongoing experiments with collaborative bargaining, using information gleaned from journal and newspaper articles, reports obtained through ERIC database searches, and telephone interviews and correspondence with personnel in districts employing collaborative bargaining. Insights are shared regarding the most effective collaborative bargaining  procedures and pitfalls threatening the process. Chapter 1 reviews teacher union achievement, the pros and cons of union membership, teachers' professional image, and the unions' role in school reform. Chapter 2 examines collective bargaining as traditionally implemented in industry and education and lists reasons for current efforts to restructure the process. Chapter 3 addresses whether the collaborative style can compete with traditional adversarial bargaining as a method of securing higher teacher salaries and benefits. In chapter 4, specific district models are presented to show how districts have adapted collective bargaining processes to their specific situations, focusing on drawbacks and necessary modifications. Benefits and common elements are also summarized. Chapter 5 offers  24 guidelines to consider before, during, and after implementing collaborative bargaining. An appendix presents position statements by four national educational organizations. (50 references) (MLH)",

Two conceptions of accountability are addressed: accountability as measurement and as ethics. A major source of confusion is the disagreement between the two ways of thinking about the meaning and implication of accountability Accountability as measurement stresses objectivity and empirical measurement, and accountability as ethics places trust in subjective but rational judgment. However, both perspectives are incomplete in that they fail to critically address the sociopolitical context and its effects on the work of schools and teachers. Conclusions of this study point to the need to recognize accountability as a multidimensional  issue, having different definitions and measurements valid for certain situations.

Factors for the exclusion of private schools from public funding include: (1) anti-Catholic sentiment; (2) reactions against rapid Irish immigration; (3) Catholic distrust of private schools; and (4) the view of publicly funded religious schools as a threat to individual religious expression. The paper presents an argument that the move away from spiritual values in a quest for neutrality has resulted in a constitutional leveling of all religions and a secularized school system. The Canadian educational system, which is perceived by Americans as more protective of religious expression, is more effective in the prevention of social problems than is the American  system.

Two complementary hypotheses are proposed to explain the success or failure of educational reforms. The first hypothesis is based on an inverse relationship between restructuring and allocation of power and resources. It states that reforms requiring the most extensive restructuring in education, government, and/or society have the least possibility of enduring. The second hypothesis, based on unresolved societal problems, states that reforms will recur if the problem requires a restructuring in education, government, and/or society that cannot be accomplished. An overview of educational reform  in the United States, such as movements to change school accreditation requirements, student evaluation, teacher pay plans, and resource allocation, is presented to test the hypotheses. The discussion supports the usefulness of the hypotheses in generating theory to predict the success of future reform efforts. (21 references) (LMI)",

        "description":"Designed to aid school personnel considering school choice as a possible desegregation method, this booklet explains the principles of controlled choice, presents an overall plan and flow chart, and reviews the types of organizations that might be developed. Controlled choice is a desegregation method that is voluntary, empowers parents and school staff, and leads to new and exciting reorganizations of school and curricula. Controlled choice makes all schools &quot;magnets&quot; for student enrollment, celebrates diversity, and acknowledges differences in learning styles. Although choice alone may increase the comfort level of parents, students, and staff and facilitate school improvement, only controlled choice will also lead to desegregation. Through a controlled choice system, three  Massachusetts cities (Lowell, Fall River, and Cambridge) have increased the integration of their schools. Controlled choice has enormous potential for restructuring schools so that they are racially, ethnically, and sexually integrated, as well as high-quality, effective learning places. As this book shows, that potential can only be realized through an extensive, complex planning process involving all elements of the community. The planning process involves five phases: (1) Mechanisms for Initial Planning; (2) The Development of a City-Wide Plan; (3) Planning Individual Schools of Choice; (4) Implementation and (5) the First Year of Full Implementation. School administrators must make a major commitment to school organization and curriculum diversity and to school-based management. Five  appendices present Massachusetts cities' plans and provide further information sources. A brief index is also provided. (MLH)",

This booklet examines the labor organization's role in its members' job-related training. Although unions have historically played a major role in their members' knowledge and skill development, no comprehensive or authoritative information sources on training programs with union involvement exist. The study summarized here attempts to rectify this situation by examining apprenticeship programs conducted under the auspices of the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training (BAT), the Department of Labor agency responsible for the administration and technical support of  programs meeting federal standards. Journeyman upgrading programs are also investigated, along with the Air Line Pilots Association's involvement in training and evaluation. Study results indicate that union training programs and union involvement in issues around training serve to further the collective interests of individual unions' members. Apprenticeship and other training programs help unions: (1) define their respective crafts; (2) adapt to trade changes; (3) ensure maximum employability of their members; (4) ensure workers' skill consistency; and (5) tie increases in compensation to increases in skills. Intermediary government agencies do not necessarily eliminate unions' training and evaluation role, but instead define areas of union involvement. (39 references) (MLH)",

The second section examines what the public wants to know about the educational system regarding its context (historical/political, legal, economic, demographic, social, and technological); inputs (financial costs and expenditures); process (teaching performance); and student outcomes. The third section comments on methodologies for keeping the public informed, such as committees of inquiry and standing committees, and discusses monitoring methods and their difficulties. Systematic national  or statewide testing programs are costly, define literacy and numeracy in limited ways, and may have undesirable backwash effects. The Australasian Cooperative Testing Program (ACAP) uses a diagnostic approach to help teachers understand and improve individual students' performance. The final section outlines strategies for improving public education accountability: (1) improving the statistical base and its analysis; (2) improving the system review process; (3) operating the system using a research and development approach; and (4) monitoring outcome through testing.

The country's two major educational challenges include the extension of a full, formal secondary education, and the maintenance of teaching quality. A conclusion is that school governance cannot be reduced to simple issues and should include participation in decision making at all levels.

Major issues concern the adequacy of information on educational quality provided by the schools and the responsiveness of the school system to parental concerns. Interviews, document analysis, and observation generated data from DOD schools in Germany and the Pacific region. Chapter 1 outlines the background, objectives, and methodology of the study. Chapter 2 examines the need for more effective assessment methods and offers suggestions. Chapter 3 addresses the role of advisory committees. Chapter 4 reviews facilities' physical problems and the effectiveness of substance abuse programs. Recommendations call for: (1) the use of measures  other than test scores for school evaluation; (2) the implementation of better substantiated methods of documentation; and (3) the inclusion of school advisory committees in decision making. Appendices provide information on regional enrollment and methodology, comments from the DOD, and a list of contributors. (LMI)",

        "description":"Given the importance of pupil control in the school's social system, it would seem reasonable to predict a significant relationship between educators' pupil control ideology and their reactions to disruptive behavior incidents. This study examines whether humanistically oriented educators would prefer to levy less punitive measures on disruptive students than their custodially oriented, authoritarian counterparts. Also the study examined whether those directly responsible for student control (teachers) would be more custodial in their pupil control ideology than those less directly responsible (principals or counselors). To test these hypotheses, operational definitions were required for two variables: pupil control ideology and incidents of disruptive behavior. The Pupil Control  Ideology (PCI) was used to assess the first variable, and the Pupil Disruptive Behavior (PDB) Scale was used to assess the second variable. The subjects were full-time educators from three states (Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin). Stepwise multiple regression techniques were used to test the first hypothesis, and analysis of variance was used to test the second. Study results supported both hypotheses. The more custodial the educator's control ideology, the more severe the reported reactions to pupil's disruptive behavior incidents. Those directly responsible for pupil control were more custodial-minded and preferred levying more severe penalties for pupil misbehavior. Included are 6 tables and 24 references. (MLH)",

        "author":["LeTendre, Brenda G."],
        "description":"Despite the blizzard of reform activity since 1983, neither state legislation nor state education department mandates have diminished the failure rates of at-risk youngsters. One-third of all elementary students are at risk of failing academically. This paper reviews past state department of education reform efforts and suggests innovative ways for states to accelerate the learning of high risk students. The accelerated school, as envisioned and implemented by Henry Levin and associates, invites school staffs to use their expertise, interest, and resources to restructure their schools' organization, curriculum, and instructional practices. Such schools seek to make all youngsters academically able by the time they leave sixth grade. Accelerated school communities abide by three  guiding principles: (1) unity of purpose; (2) empowerment to make and implement important decisions; and (3) willingness to alter perceptions of themselves and their students by building on strengths. At present, 39 schools in California, Illinois, Missouri, and Utah have adopted accelerated school concepts. State department educators in Illinois and Missouri are creating accelerated school networks and are making the shift from enforcer to supporter. Other state-level educators are beginning to see themselves as collaborators rather than regulators. These officials are facilitating real reforms by assuming new roles as catalysts, brokers, coordinators, ombudsmen, coaches, publicists, and demographers. Several cautions and challenges for states are presented, along with an agenda for the  1990s. (Nine references) (MLH)",

The first is that there have been surprisingly few takers of regulation waivers; and second, whether, even if current deregulation efforts are successful, the end result is really the sought-after improved educational outcome. It appears that a major stumbling block to the practical implementation of state-level deregulation legislation is the dearth of suggested alternatives to the existing educational system. However, this may change as innovations become more widely available and establish credibility. (9 references) (MLF)",

Structural functionalist and symbolic interactionist theories are integrated with the Leader As Social Control (LASC) model to develop an instrument to measure teachers' and principals' perceptions. Development of the model, which is based on the two independent variables of motivation and orientation, is described. The instrument was administered to all teachers and principals in 13 schools. A shadowing technique using qualitative data and a comparison of biographical and situational factors were used to confirm the validity of the model. Findings indicate that teachers rated their  principals lower than principals rated themselves in the use of all types of social control communications. Teacher perceptions of principals' communication patterns were strongly correlated to three situational factors: (1) the degree of closeness teachers felt to the principal; (2) the teachers' perceived frequency of teacher-principal interaction; and (3) the teachers' perceptions of the principals' visibility. Seven figures illustrate the characteristics attributed to nine communication cells of the LASC model. (7 references) (LMI)",

        "description":"Identification of principals' instructional leadership behaviors and the time they spend involved in the process of school improvement is the purpose of this study. A second focus is on the ways in which principals build school cultures. The Principals Instructional Management Rating Scale (PIMRS) (Hallinger 1983), the National Task-Time Survey (NTTS) (Howell, 1980), and semistructured interviews with principals were used to collect data. The sample included all principals and 151 teachers (97 percent) in the five most effective Chapter I elementary schools participating in a school improvement program. Principals indicated that their most frequent behaviors were related to academic concerns, followed by interactive behaviors, and then by behaviors requiring intensive time  commitment. Purkey and Smith's model of four process variables, or culture concepts, necessary to sustain a productive school culture are applied to the principals' reported behaviors. They include collaboration, community, expectations, and order. Findings indicate that most principals have internalized the norm of high expectations for their students and teachers, and were least concerned with behaviors related to maintaining order. Recommendations call for building positive school cultures to promote academic success, and for providing principals with the necessary knowledge and training. The primary focus should be on the development of a sense of community and collaboration, with an understanding of culture concepts. Tables present the statistical results of the three methodologies.  (21 references) (LMI)",

Case scope, categories of offenses, district actions, and arbitrators' decisions are presented and compared by 4-year periods. Changes in the types and frequencies of arbitrated offenses reflect a decrease in cases involving teacher competency and an increase in conduct grievances. Although an increasing number of school  district decisions have been upheld, arbitrators rule against districts a majority of the time. Findings indicate that the number of least severe corrective actions has decreased significantly, accompanied by an increase in the number of most severe sanctions.

The second chapter examines the extent to which pedagogical reasons enhance cooperation and argues that optimal school performance can only be achieved through cooperation. In the last chapter three types of conditions hindering cooperation are identified: structural, subjective, and training. The most effective way to increase parent-teacher cooperation is through a restructuring of the power imbalance between the two groups. Balance of power is most effectively achieved in private, free, or alternative schools, which  provide the best examples of pedagogical parent-teacher cooperation.

The team, composed of voluntary potential administrators, acts as a special task force to facilitate informed decision making by the school superintendent. Topics discussed are member selection, role functions, career impact, and benefits to participants. Findings based on observation and participation suggest that team success depends on being able to integrate individual strengths and address personal weaknesses. Implementation of the team provides the district with an inexpensive research resource and gives potential administrators the opportunity to develop useful skills for future positions. (LMI)",

        "description":"Based on the premise that deficiencies in student learning are inherent byproducts of the traditional school structure, this study compares the effects of an experimental curriculum program on student learning with its traditional structural counterpart. The traditional school structure is characterized by a heavy teacher workload, segmented student schedules, and limited individual teacher-student interaction. The Renaissance Program (RenPro) at Masconomet High decreased the student course load and increased the amount of teacher-student interaction time. Students took two 100-minute long courses per trimester. Students also participated in seminars, independent studies, foreign language programs, and physical education. Approximately 80 students, one-half of the ninth grade,  volunteered. Initial assessment by the Harvard Graduate School of Education is inconclusive after only one year of program implementation. However, in a comparison of RenPro and traditional students' (TradPro) final examination scores, RenPro students performed marginally better than their TradPro peers. Other preliminary results were improved student-teacher relationships; increased student motivation; greater opportunity for indepth exploration of course material; decreased grading time; and the implementation of more effective teaching styles. Problems cited are student discipline problems and distrust of the program by the traditional school. However, the findings generally indicate that such programs are feasible alternatives to stimulate students' critical learning and thinking  processes. (LMI)",

        "description":"In spite of affirmative action efforts, the percentage of female school administrators has barely risen since 1970. When nearly half of the educational administration students are women who are completing both certification and doctoral programs in record numbers, this seems especially puzzling. As it has become more difficult to blame the shortage of women administrators on their unwillingness to earn the necessary credentials, there has been a shift toward blaming women for not applying for the jobs. While all the studies conducted in the 1970s found that men were much more persistent in their job search efforts, the results of studies done in the 1980s indicate a change in that pattern: women were more likely to be making greater job search efforts than men. Additionally,  studies revealed that men are twice as likely as women to be preselected for the position of secondary school principal and women reach this administrative position only after much effort. The only administrative job for which women had to make less effort than men was the position of elementary school principal. Women continue to indicate that they are asked illegal questions during the hiring process. In fact, the women perceived more sex discrimination in hiring in recent years. (16 references) (KM)",

        "description":"A study was undertaken to investigate gender differences in the career paths of aspirant and incumbent certificate holders for line positions within educational administration. In October 1985, 1,338 Pennsylvania certificate holders were mailed a 4-page survey probing the areas of career pathways, job search strategies, time usage, mentor's functions, and barriers experienced. The 622 respondents included 205 male incumbents, 173 male aspirants, 93 female incumbents, and 151 female aspirants. The results indicate that two-thirds of the female certificate holders were channeled into staff positions where their performance is directed by line officers. These women's contributions may remain largely unrecognized or undervalued because organizations tend to recognized only overall  goal accomplishment which is typically attributed to the line officer. While the men in this study served 2.5 years longer than the women in terms of their educational experience, the men had gained 4 years by the time they attained their first administrative position. These findings cannot be attributed to either an unwillingness of women to move or to extended absences due to female parental obligations; it is apparent that administrators must reexamine their promotion policies and attitudes to determine whether opportunities for women to assume line positions are being provided. Tables indicating the quantitative results of the survey are included. (23 references) (KM)",

Specific research questions are concerned with assessing changes in program use and content, the influence on interaction between research and practice, and the impact on school reform. Data were collected from computer log files, printouts of network  papers, and telephone interviews with 44 focal participants. Conclusions point to the need for local support, an organized network structure, improved time and access, provision of participant incentives, and attention to substance. Computer network systems provide the \"medium\" for activities; however, they must meet participants' needs and support their work.

The methodology relates high school teachers' attitudes in two high schools to different social contexts with the cultural attributes that affect teacher participation in schoolwide decision making. School social context is defined by educators' and students' perceptions of the school's level of safety. The sample includes 19 high schools from 13 school districts chosen because of a concern about increasing Latino gang activity in the schools. Data were collected from surveys of 150 to 250 students and 13 to 15 randomly selected teachers, and from interviews  with administrators and counselors. Findings indicate that teachers in schools with unfavorable social contexts, unlike teachers in schools with favorable social contexts, lack the psychological conditions necessary for effective participation in decision making. Teachers in unfavorable cultures feel alienated from their schools, which is antithetical to collaboration. A long- term implication is that cultural transformation is necessary for increased teacher involvement. However, the problems that initially created unfavorable school contexts must also be addressed. Tables present statistical substantiation of the findings. An extensive bibliography is provided.

Roundtable discussion participants assessed 10 educational goals and their associated indicators in relation to validity of the indicators, barriers to achieving the goals, steps to achieve the goal, and target date. Discussion groups also ranked five goals they considered to be most significant for Iowa and for the nation. A follow-up survey of all participants (297) yielded a 57 percent response rate, or 169 completed surveys. Participants generally agreed that indicators proposed for consideration in each goal area were valid indices of the goals but were limited to quantitative  assessments. Two barriers to achieving educational goals were consistently cited: the structure of the current education system, and insufficient community and parent support. Findings of the conference proceedings and the survey indicate that participants viewed state and national education goals to be equally important. However, a discrepancy existed between educational priorities identified at the conference and in the follow-up survey. Only literacy and school readiness were identified each time as significant goals.

Third-party evaluations are recommended for local programs supported by state funding. Collegiality among teachers, administrators, and policymakers is crucial for incentive program success. Descriptions of 1989 incentive programs by state and a list of state contacts are included. (13 references) (LMI)",

Successful school restructuring must include the following innovations: site-based management; public school choice; competitive markets; realistic accounting; meaningful incentive programs; and valid evaluation processes. An initiative to close the gap is proposed, in which U.S. institutions and training facilities allocate at least one percent of their budgets for a research and development fund to be managed by a new National Institution for Learning Technology.

The evaluation design consisted of a process evaluation to assess the extent to which the project achieved its objectives during the first 2 years and a product evaluation to assess student performance. Feedback from use of an evaluator checklist resulted in more efficient use of classroom time through increased time on task,  broader use of teacher aides, and greater use of the second language.

A needs survey documented that students, parents, and teachers felt that development of organizational skills was needed. Teachers indicated that disorganization of the students' notebooks caused problems in locating assignment sheets, study materials, and completed work. The students indicated that they wanted to learn to manage their time better. The practicum involved having the students purchase a folder for each course and instructing them in proper organization of these folders. The students also completed time  charts daily and reviewed them with the teacher. At the conclusion of the intervention period, students reported that they were able to manage their time better and to complete tasks properly and expeditiously. Teachers reported a significant improvement in the quantity and quality of assignments completed. Improvement in folder organization was slow, but consistent. (JDD)",

The guidelines integrate information from the fields of medicine, health care, social services, psychology, and education and describe practices to advance the field of early intervention and improve services to children and families. The document first describes the requirements of Public Law 99-457 regarding screening and assessment. A theoretical viewpoint about childhood development is presented, and the differences between screening and assessment are outlined. The complex  factors involved in defining the population to be served by Public Law 99-457 are noted, and guidelines for screening and assessing young disabled and developmentally vulnerable children are then proposed. A sequenced planning process is outlined and future tasks are listed. Appendices are attached that contain illustrations of several different models, representative lists of screening and assessment instruments and procedures, a glossary, and regulations from Public Law 94-142 and Public Law 99-457 that pertain to screening and assessment.

        "description":"The popularity of home care for chronically ill or technology-dependent children has moved professionals into unfamiliar settings. Factors responsible for the relatively sudden surge of effort to place children with complex needs at home include costs, individualism and autonomy, changing views of medicine and its institutions, limits of medical technology, and growth of technical capability. The movement carries many imperatives for behavior and attitude changes in adapting to the public nature of the care, the need for families to assume risks usually assumed by hospital staff, and the need for professionals to dissociate the management of risk from their direct control. Bringing home the medically complex child may create problems which must be anticipated by candidate  families, such as loss of privacy, terror concerning the patient's survival, role confusion, exhaustion, endlessness, and guilt. Participation of caretakers from outside the immediate household requires establishment of criteria for training and clear negotiation of the terms of the arrangement. Psychological concerns of professionals who participate in home-care planning include belief in the hospital as the best locus of care and the nature of professional responsibility. The plan for discharge should consider the: adequacy of funds, screening and supervising of paid and volunteer caregivers, best use of home space, respite care, and other issues.

The computer-based instructional treatments were presented as an educational game called the \"Yes-No Game,\" with visual effects using the high resolution graphics capability of the Macintosh computer. As learners created sentence-pictures and built yes-no questions, animated graphics pictured the transformation of sentences to questions. Textual and graphic corrective feedback were displayed on the computer screen to respond specifically to each error that students made in building English questions. Seventeen treatment subjects in grades 8-11,  compared with 15 control subjects, showed significant gains in recognition of correct grammatical structures but showed only marginal improvement in actual sentence production. With accompanying pictures to aid comprehension, and with multiple opportunities to practice and to receive immediate visual feedback, the experiment demonstrated that an instructional foundation and methodology can be provided that will help deaf students overcome their difficulties in building yes-no questions in English.

Suggestions are given to families regarding the law's provisions in the areas of:  assessing needs, providing devices and services, disseminating information, training and technical assistance, assisting support groups, setting up model service delivery systems, coordinating public awareness, and providing access to information. The second law provides services to Medicaid-eligible infants and children including speech pathology and audiology, psychological services, physical and occupational therapy, and medical counseling and services.

The workshop prepares parents for developing specific plans for forging alliances with the state PAMI. The first chapter reviews services for children with emotional disorders from 1850 to the present, concluding that community programs are more effective than institutional programs. The second chapter discusses Public Law 99-319, the Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act of 1986, including the role of the developmental assistance and protection and advocacy (DD-P&amp;A) agencies, provisions and specific requirements of PL  99-319, and results of a survey investigating the potential impact of PL 99-319 on children. Chapter three provides an assessment of current P&amp;E activity with six worksheets designed to help parents assess agency activities. Chapter four focuses on forging alliance with emphasis on P&amp;A limitations and parent strategies including requesting direct services and forging organization-to-organization alliances. Appended is the text of PL 99-319 and names and addresses of four resources for parents. (DB)",

The disorders discussed are: depression, mania, primary disorder of vigilance, narcolepsy, developmental specific learning disorders, conduct disorders, and acquired neurological deficits. The introduction briefly reviews the history of ADHD identification and treatment. A study in which 100 referred children (ages 3 to 17) were systematically examined found ADHD criteria were met in 63 of the children but only four had ADHD alone. Forty of the children had both developmental specific learning disorders and depression as well as ADHD. Two  longitudinal studies reporting relationships between hyperactivity and depression and between learning disability, depression, and ADHD are also briefly reported. Each of the other disorders is discussed including criteria for diagnosis, course of the disorder, biological correlates, the presence of concurrent disorders, and treatment approaches. It is noted that methylphenidate and pemoline, often prescribed for children doing poorly in school, can decrease hypomanic symptoms and improve vigilance but worsen or induce depression. Prognosis for children and adolescents with primary affective illness is reported to be good with appropriate management. Includes 84 references. (DB)",

The instrument can also be used in determining appropriate placement for students with learning disabilities and for programming the transfer of skills learned in the special setting to the regular classroom. The instrument measures: teacher task statements, student compliance, direction (to the individual or the group) of task statements, response type required by the student, type of task statement, and teacher consequence following student response. After a discussion of the theoretical framework, the observation instrument is detailed, and a pilot study using the instrument to code classroom video tapes is reported. Analysis of  pilot study results indicated two areas of difference between special and regular settings--the type of responses. Includes 20 references. (DB)",

        "description":"Two studies investigated the modification of tasks by students in different public school settings. The first study examined task modification in physical education settings and the second study considered task modification by learning disabled students in a resource room and in two mainstream settings. In study 1 a systematic observation system was used to describe interactions among students, teachers, and the environment. Teacher task statements, student tasks, student responses, and response consequences were classified. Subjects were nine physical education teachers and one target student in each of 24 lessons. The special education study involved similar classification of interactions during 72 lessons involving two 14-year-old eighth grade learning disabled males. Results  of both studies indicated very low levels of student verbal negotiation in modifying tasks. Students modified tasks in the physical education setting by engaging in the task with a high rate of error. Learning disabled students were more likely to emit responses which did not comply with or which only partially complied with the stated instructional tasks. Results confirm previous studies' findings that ability level of the student and the amount of risk involved in tasks is related to how students attempt to modify them. Includes 14 references. (DB)",

It considers the medical, cultural, social, legal, psychological, and economic implications of this condition; and how these factors relate to the vocational rehabilitation process. VR management issues considered include Federal responsibility, the role of state VR agencies, procedural barriers to service, organizational structure, and advocacy. Basic information includes the historical context of the epidemic's course; the spectrum of HIV, symptoms, and opportunistic infections; routes of transmission; and infection precautions for caregivers. Also discussed are cultural and social issues,  characteristics of the population, psychosocial issues, the counselor, the co-worker, and HIV and attitudes. Counselors are encouraged to look at AIDS as just another disability. Service delivery is considered in terms of case finding, the initial interview, functional limitations, eligibility, and development of the Individualized Written Rehabilitation Program. Legal issues such as confidentiality and the duty to warn are also addressed.

The visual confusion caused by the chart was eliminated by printing single symbols on 9X9 test cards. Other adaptations included designing disposable cardboard eyeglasses with flip-out lenses to serve as an occluder for one eye and the development of the Blackbird Storybook Home Eye Test to help identify vision problems, especially amblyopia, in children not in a preschool program providing vision screening. With the new test 99% of children ages 3 to 5 are able to be screened. A brochure  describing and illustrating the screening test materials is attached. (DB)",

Parents are encouraged to understand that such children are significantly different from other children and have two primary needs: to feel comfortable with themselves and to develop their astonishing potential. Suggestions are given for dealing with public attitudes toward exceptional performance in very young children and for dealing with the multiple developmental ages the gifted child may exhibit simultaneously. Problems of schooling the highly gifted child are discussed in terms of lack of fit with the usual school, the various possibilities of acceleration for this type of child, and ways to  help the gifted child meet his or her social/emotional needs. Stressed is the importance of providing the child with a safe home in which the child feels loved and accepted. Includes 18 references. (DB)",

(2) What are some commonly used techniques for the identification of gifted and talented minority language students? and (3) What types of programs are available for gifted and talented students, and are they suitable for minority language students who are selected to participate? Specifically described are  enrichment programs, parent involvement programs, acceleration or honors programs, and mentor programs. The following recommendations are made: broaden the concept of giftedness; expand research on giftedness and minority language students; employ more well-rounded assessment techniques; increase staff awareness of their potential for developing a gifted and talented program; explore various program models; and increase awareness of different ways giftedness may be manifested in different populations.

Mathematical talent is defined and the characteristics of mathematically talented students are listed. Some mathematically talented students do not achieve well in school mathematics due to a mismatch between the student and the mathematics program. Ways that various standardized tests--intelligence tests, creativity tests, mathematics achievement tests, mathematics aptitude tests, and out-of-grade-level mathematics aptitude tests--can be used to identify mathematical talent are offered. A systematic process for talent identification is suggested involving first a screening phase and then out-of-grade-level mathematics abilities assessment. Characteristics of appropriate instructional  programs for mathematically talented students include the following: they bring mathematically talented students together to work with one another; they stress mathematical reasoning and independent exploratory behavior; they deemphasize repetitious computational drill work and cyclic review; they involve a comprehensive mathematics curriculum appropriate for potential mathematicians; and they provide flexible pacing. Specific ways to provide flexible pacing include continuous progress, compacted courses, advanced-level courses, grade skipping, early entrance, concurrent or dual enrollment, and credit by examination.

Indications that students are having difficulty coping with the multipotentiality of their talents may be evidenced by early difficulty in making choices and decisions and difficulty in choosing an academic major in college. Possible intervention strategies for multipotentiality at different educational levels are offered. Alternatively, children may be early emergers who have extremely focused career interests and require balanced encouragement of their special interests. Indicators of early emergence characteristics as well as possible intervention strategies at each age level  are offered. Both multipotentiality and early emergence characteristics require skillful career education and guidance. In addition, special populations such as minority gifted students and gifted girls and women have unique career guidance needs. Includes 12 references. (DB)",

Four potential pitfalls are identified: using an adversarial rather than a persuasive approach; assuming that people in administrative and political positions are not too bright or not very knowledgeable--or both; being impatient; and ineffectively coping with intragroup tensions. In contrast, effective advocay involves four basic phases: needs assessment; planning; contact; and follow up and evaluation. Eleven guidelines for establishing and maintaining a successful parent advocacy group are suggested and include: focus on a mission and a sense of purpose; include not only parents but also business leaders and school professionals; contact the state advocacy group; adopt a constitution that  spells out the organization's goals; identify and respect the group that holds the power; allow professionals to develop the program; conduct short- and long-term evaluation of the advocacy process; and be an informed advocate.

Information and suggestions contained in the handbook are compiled from survey responses of individuals who have taught ESL in China. The first chapter gives general information on the purpose and nature of teaching in China, describing the Chinese educational system, Chinese educators, teaching contracts and salaries, and employment prospects. The second chapter suggests actions to take in preparation for teaching in China, including application timelines, travel arrangements and documentation, choosing  professional and personal materials to take, and dealing with culture shock. Chapter three discusses aspects of living and working in China, including: organizational design; documents, permits, and coupons; currency and banking; day-to-day living; medical and dental facilities; bringing a family; Chinese etiquette; and making friends and contacts. The fifth chapter contains practical suggestions from former teachers. Chapter six describes individual institutions and the areas in which they are located, including sources of information, the nature of living accommodations, courses taught by foreigners, other professional services, materials and facilities, teacher/student/faculty relationships, and specific strengths and weaknesses. An extensive list of professional source materials is  also included. (MSE)",

        "description":"Previous cognitive science research demonstrates how the Agent-action-Objective (AaO) paradigm controls the cognitive processes of differentiation and integration. The present discussion advances the process to the fourth of five phases. Of the four dependent variables emerging at this stage, two are discussed: zero processing and variations in form. A short introduction provides some of the basics governing the process. Discussion of the variables begins with some arguments put forward in cognitive science. In agreement with general conviction, symbol processing results in strings of symbols or sentences on which operations such as addition, deletion, and insertion can be performed according to formally defined rules. By propositional knowledge, statements about the world, and  by truth conditions, meaning of symbolic expression is defined. However, meaning (semantics) is not bound to a linguistic context of interpretation. Meaning denotes the knowledge system underlying various approaches to natural language processing. A system's semantics represents the constructor's world view, but also a theory of how it is organized to enable disambiguation of strings of symbols. Consequently, the conceptual base is constructed within formally different boundaries compared to the linguistic base, and the semantic principle cuts across the linguistic/non-linguistic dimension. Implications of this approach to semantic interpretation are discussed. (Author/MSE)",

        "author":["Lempert, Henrietta"],
        "description":"Many researchers now believe that the representations and processes underlying syntactical development are specific to a &quot;language faculty.&quot; If so, reference animacy would not be expected to influence acquisition of linguistic structures such as the passive sentence construction. Specifically, children should be comparably able to acquire the passive sentence construction from animate (A) patient instances (e.g., &quot;the baby was picked up by the clown&quot;) and static inanimate (SI) patient instances (e.g., &quot;the book was picked up by the clown&quot;). After tests for comprehension of semantically reversible passives, 52 children aged 2.6 to 4.8 years repeated a passive sentence description of A-patient drawings; 51 children aged 2.10 to 5.3 years received descriptions of SI-patient  drawings. In post-teaching, all described animate agent drawings, counterbalanced for animate and inanimate patients. Then 45 A-patient and 45 SI-patient children were retested for comprehension. Mean comprehension increased significantly only in A-patient children. Also, more A-patient children than SI-patient children &quot;knew&quot; word order relations for passives in post-teaching production tests. Findings indicate that the conceptual distinctions that children make between animate and inanimate beings can constrain language learning, and imply that language acquisition can not be fully understood in terms of the functioning of a purportedly language-specific faculty.

        "description":"A study examined the nature of functional literacy among 671 Moroccan children, aged 11-14, and the relationship of functional and classroom literacy to background factors and school experience. Students were assessed on a series of household literacy tasks sampling knowledge of spatial and monetary print conventions, specialized vocabulary, and ability to relate the written word to real-world contexts. The most difficult tasks involved spatial, monetary, and telegraphic text conventions. Correct responses were associated with grade level achieved and with remaining in school. Among younger children, cognitive level, reported home literacy activity, and urban environment were significant predictors of both household and school-type literacy. By contrast, predictors of household  literacy differed considerably from those of school literacy among older children. Cognitive level, factual knowledge, and grade level attainment predicted both types of literacy, but urban residence, male gender, and home literacy activities appeared to play a greater role in fostering household literacy, while school dropout and age predicted school-type literacy only. The pattern of results indicates that knowledge of literacy conventions required for successful performance of common household literacy tasks may be acquired only partially, even after five years of formal schooling, and different pedagogical approaches may be required to promote development of each literacy type.

When this happens, a shared understanding of meaning between tester and test-taker is not present, and the test results are invalid. Although this problem exists for all test-takers, it is more acute for members of non-mainstream speech communities because they are less likely to suspend their normative expectations of discourse. This study was undertaken to identify potential sources of linguistic distortion that might undermine a multiple-choice test's validity for measuring job-relevant knowledge, skills, and abilities among Black English Vernacular speakers in a southern urban setting.  Problematic linguistic features identified include: undue syntactic complexity, tense switching, the use of incomplete question stems, plural/possessive ambiguity, and others. Included is a bibliography of significant references on multiple-choice test bias, and a form that can be used when examining test items for sociolinguistic bias. (JL)",

Courses and research include linguistic analyses, examination of language distributions, biblical and other translation work, and literacy training for the Aborigines in both English and their native languages. This annual report  highlights the events that occurred in 1989, including workshops, research seminars, conferences, and projects, and provides information on the computer and publications departments.

        "description":"Language Development Support Systems (Project LDSS) offered 215 limited English proficient (LEP) students at two New York City elementary schools the opportunity to improve their English skills through special language learning centers. These language learning centers were established at both schools and provided students with instruction in reading, writing, and content area subjects. Students were also trained in the use of microcomputers. Computers were used to assist in the instruction of certain subjects. The project's primary goals were to increase language development and reduce language regression in students while teaching them to become computer literate. Technical assistance and opportunities for development were made available to staff working with these students. A  secondary objective of the project was to increase staff effectiveness at fulfilling job-related responsibilities. A statistically significant improvement in students' scores on the Degrees of Reading Power test indicated that the project achieved its primary objective, and observations of educators' classroom performances suggested that the secondary objective was also realized.

Because such projects will usually not be able to implement a traditional true or quasi-experimental design, BEES employs a &quot;gap-reduction&quot; evaluation design that is easily implemented, satisfies regulatory requirements, and yields an index relating to the growth made by project participants without requiring a comparison group of students. This evaluation method was tested at nine school districts in six states. This report describes this field test and the training and assistance program offered to participating educators. The report also summarizes the participants' comments and suggestions about how the evaluation system  might be improved. In particular, it is suggested that the written materials be improved and that user-friendly software be provided to assist in the database management tasks and to perform the gap-reduction computations. Extensive documentation of the field test is appended including survey instruments and sample forms. (JL)",

Because of their interactive nature, dynamic stories may be used to effectively teach English as a Second Language (ESL). Existing dynamic stories, however, are usually inadequate for this purpose. In book form, they involve too much page flipping, while those stories available on computer software are either aimed at a very young audience, or use a lexicon that non-native English speakers would neither know nor need to know. A better way to employ these stories in the ESL classroom is to have students create the stories. By writing such stories, students improve their lexical and grammar skills, and learn about the process of writing while  gaining confidence in their English abilities. A method is described here for the classroom creation of computer-based dynamic stories using commercially available, user-friendly software. One example of this method is detailed, and several story &quot;openings&quot; are appended. (JL)",

The third paper, &quot;The Interlanguage Hypothesis Extended to Children,&quot; reports on data gathered in a Toronto French immersion program, showing that, at least in some settings, it is plausible to infer that young children do form interlanguages. The paper called &quot;Systematicity/Variability and Stability/Instability in Interlanguage Systems&quot; addresses a number of  issues concerning variation in interlanguages, based on variable data from morphology, syntax, and semantics. The fifth paper, &quot;Two Perspectives on Fossilization in Interlanguage Learning,&quot; looks at the &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; conceptions of fossilized language that argue for or against the inevitability of fossilization, and the potential for teaching communication under these conditions. The last paper, &quot;Researching the Discourse Domains View of Interlanguage,&quot; summarizes recent work in this field, focusing, to some degree, on the application of discourse analysis to Southeast Asian languages and language instruction.

This kind of research collects data from genuine language classrooms or from experimental settings sometimes established to replicate what takes place in the classroom.

Within this group are a number of limited-English-proficient individuals. Whether seeking a first American job or better employment, this group encounters a job market that is changing drastically in the number of jobs it can offer to individuals with limited English skills. As a result, growing numbers of these individuals are seeking courses in Vocational English-as-a-Second-Language (VESL) that combine language education with job specific skills. VESL refers to the language needed to interact with English speaking customers or employees, to fill out job applications, or to use manual or catalogues, and its goal is to teach the language required for successful participation  in training programs and for job performance. Several different program models have evolved to meet the different skills, education levels, and vocational goals of students. These models include: (1) the ESL approach; (2) the vocational approach; (3) the work experience approach; and (4) the workplace approach. Another model that should be mentioned is the bilingual vocational training model.

However, the two countries have taken different approaches to multilingualism and language policy development, due to the following dissimilarities: ethnic revival affected Australia and the U.S. at different stages of their development; the United States War of Independence symbolizes  its national unity and identity, while the idea of Australia as a nation is recent; Australia has great language diversity, with none predominant in any community; and decision-making is more centralized in education and related domains in Australia. The 1980s have seen new beginnings for language policy in both countries. The United States has been examining either/or exclusive policies (English-speaking vs. foreign-speaking) while Australia has embarked on an inclusive multicultural policy. Political influences will shape the final policies. In Australia, a united effort of ethnic communities and language professionals has had an important impact on policy development. (MSE)",

Part II focuses on classroom applications and is directed to the teacher considering better ways to teach reading in another language to adolescents or adults already literate in one language. Methods are also discussed for analyzing readers' processes, choosing appropriate reading texts, motivating students through self-selected reading, moving beyond reading comprehension to literary analysis, adapting textbooks when necessary, and testing reading.

The evaluation system proposed involves a process component, an outcome component, and procedures for integrating them. An innovative element is a gap-reduction design for assessing student outcomes. This element assesses the academic growth of project participants relative to one of two recommended comparison groups: national norms or non-project students in the same grade. The user's guide to the evaluation system consists of two volumes. The first volume contains all of the system's procedures and  practices. The system is divided into nine steps, each corresponding to a chapter of this volume: assuring that the project is evaluable; planning the evaluation; documenting program processes; selecting/adapting/developing instruments for assessing student outcomes; collecting outcome data; implementing the gap-reduction design; processing and analyzing data; integrating and interpreting results; and preparing evaluation reports. The second volume contains explanations and discussions of the rationale underlying recommendations for procedures and practices made in the first volume, and detailed guidelines on how to perform certain tasks. Topics include the following: classroom observation; interrater reliability; functional level testing; translating tests into other languages; major  publishers of nationally standardized achievement tests; test reliability; quasi-experimental designs; gap reduction calculations; extrapolation procedures; and correcting for regression.

Chapters 1 and 2 discuss variables that help shape linguistic interaction between parent and child. Chapter 3 examines the  character and functioning of baby talk, and the next four chapters focus on how adults influence their children's development of conversational skills, phonology, lexicon, and grammar.

Both teachers, fluent speakers of Hawaiian, were new to teaching. The teachers spoke only Hawaiian after the first 2 days of school, and students were reminded to speak in Hawaiian. By spring, lapses into English or pidgin became infrequent. Visiting parents were impressed with the warm relationships evident between children and teachers. Classroom organization combined adaptation to Hawaiian values and cultural practices with practices common to other elementary classrooms. While occasionally correcting  students' Hawaiian, teachers more commonly modelled correct form or set up repeating routines to support student learning. Teachers treated students as true conversational partners, focusing primarily on content comprehension, with brief but significant instructional sequences inserted. Language learning in peer-peer interactions was encouraged. The students were found to take their work seriously, and were on task a high proportion of the time. (MSE)",

Videotape recordings of dramas (movies, television programs, and plays) offer a means and an interesting context for developing linguistic knowledge into usable language skills. A good movie provides a self-contained world with language expressed in a visual context. The teacher is in a position to exploit this rich resource by making the story and its language comprehensible to the student much as any literature teacher would, in terms of plot, characters, setting, and theme. A method used in one Japanese university involves showing a full-length movie in 10-minute segments over a period of about 12 classes. The classes consist of a  review of the movie to date, student viewing of a new segment, discussion and explanation of the segment shown, and a summary, usually written by pairs of students. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the method is effective for helping students gain confidence in using English to ask and answer questions and to listen and comprehend details. Students' attention span and interest also appear to improve. Role-playing and additional discussion are seen as potentially beneficial with this approach. (MSE)",

        "description":"A discussion of bilingualism and second language learning distinguishes three types of bilingualism, namely, compound, coordinate, and sub-coordinate. A compound bilingual is an individual who learns two languages in the same environment so that he/she acquires one notion with two verbal expressions. A coordinate bilingual acquires the two languages in different contexts (e.g., home and school), so the words of the two languages belong to separate and independent systems. In a sub-coordinate bilingual, one language dominates. As illustration, language development is examined in case studies of the following Italian/English bilingual children in Italy: (1) a two-year-old whose Italian father uses both languages and whose English mother uses mostly English; (2) two sisters aged  five and nine whose parents are Italian but who have always attended English-language schools; and (3) two Italian teenage boys whose mother has always spoken English to them and who have always attended English-language schools. The successes and problems faced by the children and their parents in developing bilingualism are discussed. It is concluded that in addition to biological predisposition, motivation and context play a significant role in bilingual development, and that overall, the bilingual experience is enriching.

A total of 320 questionnaires were used in the study, 100 written in English and 220 in Polish; of this total, 248 were returned for a response rate of 78 percent. Language preference was defined in terms of the language of the questionnaire the respondents chose to answer. The study demonstrated differences in stereotypes about Canadians, Poles in Poland, and Polish immigrants to Canada that suggested these immigrants tended to perceive themselves as relatively Polish, but with many characteristics that make them distinctive from both Poles in Poland and from Canadians. Evidence also  indicated that language preference was associated with ethnic identification, ethnic involvement, attitudes, and language confidence. However, language preference was not associated with stereotypes. Principal components analysis identified six orthogonal dimensions following a varimax rotation including: integrative acculturation, linguistic assimilation, stereotyping, Polish proficiency, age, and ethnic loyalty. Causal modeling analysis of those variables typically linked to ethnic identity supported a model in which ethnic identity is dependent upon language proficiency. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for research on both acculturation and second language acquisition of immigrants. (Author/MSE)",

The literature of both intercultural communication and of communicative competence are examined for commonalities, themes, and conceptual problems. Research on components of ICC is seen as derived from the following perspectives: personality strength; comunication skills; psychological adaptation; and cultural awareness. Eleven propositions and related theorems concerning ICC are outlined. Three challenges presented in the study of ICC are noted. The first of these is the increasing sophistication of its conceptualization and its confusions with the  definition of \"competence.\" The second challenge is the operationalization of ICC (what and how to measure). The last challenge concerns how many elements individuals must possess in order to be considered \"competent\": scholars need to investigate whether the degree of ICC is affected by the number of competent elements or by some other measure. It is concluded that while still very new, the study of ICC is critical to the modern world. (MSE)",

The referential theory takes the meaning of the name as being the same as its referent. Four classical problems associated with this approach are identified. The description theory holds, generally, that names are semantically equivalent to descriptions. The chief problem seen in this approach is the modal argument. The causal theory says that the meaning of a name somehow involves the causal chain that connects the current use of the name to earlier uses of it, ultimately going back to some original ostension. This is  seen as a sophisticated version of the referential theory. This theory is also seen as having some problems. Elaborations of the description theory are not satisfactory. New arguments against the nominal-description theory are presented, including the distinctions between proper and common names and between vagueness and ambiguity in shared names. These arguments are seen as making the complete-description theory more plausible. In support of this thesis, it is proposed that names, like pronouns, take only wide scope. (MSE)",

        "description":"Properties of maintenance and loss of Spanish/English bilingualism were investigated in 308 high school students of Mexican background. Key variables investigated included: (1) actual and self-reported proficiencies in Spanish and English; (2) self-reported language choice behavior in various settings; and (3) language attitude. The biggest difference in Spanish proficiency was found between the student born in the United States of parents born in Mexico, and the student whose parents were born in the United States. Maintenance of Spanish proficiency was associated mainly with adult language practice in the home, and was not predicted by the subjects' choice of language outside the home or by language attitude. In turn, adult language choice was found to be affected by the  demographic fact of immigration, the adult's ability to use English in the home, and increasing distance in the familial social ties to Mexico. Outside the home, language choice showed rapid and constant shift toward English, unrelated to Spanish proficiency but predicted by the subjects' language attitudes. Language attitude also appeared to contaminate self-reported proficiency in both Spanish and English. Finally, testing suggests that attrition of Spanish is best characterized as difficulty of retrieval rather than total loss. (Author/MSE)",

Research in second language learning has led to the following conclusions relevant to bilingual educators: (1) the native and second language are complementary rather than mutually exclusive; (2) the native language's structural patterns have minimal influence on patterns, especially syntactic, of second language learning; (3) language proficiency is not unitary but consists of diverse skills, not  necessarily correlated; (4) age may constrain some aspects of acquisition; (5) affective factors studied in other language contexts may not be relevant for English as a Second Language; (6) bilingualism is associated positively with greater cognitive flexibility and linguistic awareness; (7) language skills transfer globally rather than piecemeal; and (8) expertise in translation exists in all bilingual children, demonstrating considerable ability to transfer regardless of content. Issues for further collaborative research between researchers of bilingualism and educators of bilingual education include the discrepancy between psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic equity, valuing language diversity as a natural resource, assessment of bilingual students, and developing an international  perspective.

Ideally, these programs are composed of elementary or secondary students half of whom are native speakers of English and the other half of whom are native speakers of the other language of instruction. Subject matter is learned through both languages, enabling students to become proficient in a second language. The objectives of two-way language development programs include the following: language minority students will become literate in their native language as well as in English; language majority students will develop high levels of proficiency in a second language; both language groups will perform academically at their grade level,  develop positive attitudes toward the two languages being learned and toward the communities they represent, and develop a positive self-image. Two-way programs are different from transitional and immersion programs in that the two-way programs target both language minority and language majority students and do not separate native English speakers from limited-English-proficient students during instruction. In designing a two-way program, classroom composition, program length, staffing, languages of instruction, the separation of the languages of instruction, and instructional setting must all be considered.

        "description":"A model of literacy instruction for limited-English-proficient (LEP) adults is described that is designed to increase effective parent involvement in children's education. Through the implementation of this model, LEP parents acquire language and parenting skills that allow them to participate more fully in their child's educational process. The model stresses the five following program components: (1) parent involvement; (2) a unique instructional process; (3) curriculum materials development; (4) teacher training; and (5) coordination with other entities. Parental involvement is achieved through recruitment procedures, site selection, and encouraging parental input on program decisions. Instruction is provided to parents in Spanish or English based on their individual needs as  determined by their scores on the CTB/McGraw Hill Tests of Adult Basic Education. The curriculum materials used, videotapes and accompanying worksheets, are designed to train the parents in English and teach parenting skills, while employing familiar settings such as homes and schools to introduce information. Teachers are trained to recognize the needs and abilities of LEP adults in special workshops, and, in order to improve the delivery of services and increase project impact, the program is coordinated with other entities, such as Adult Education Cooperatives and public access TV stations.

The project provides for: (1) direct instruction to parents; (2) use of home literacy events to involve both parents and children at home in literacy-related activities; and (3) creation of a library of high-interest books for participant use. The project management team consists of the Project Director; a Literacy Specialist who provides technical assistance and liaison;  and the Chief Consultant, who assists with curriculum development, evaluation, and training. Initially, five community-based organizations implemented the program; others will be added in the second and third program years. The report focuses on implementation of the Parent and Child Literacy Intervention Model, and addresses instructional and training issues relative to the Chief Consultant's participation in the family reading program. The report outlines general evaluation questions for the first year that relate to specific program objectives, presents recommendations and discussion by the National Council of la Raza and the local project sites, briefly discusses design and implementation problems, and concludes with a discussion of evaluation results.

This approach has been used in the developing world in successful native and second language literacy projects sponsored by governments and voluntary organizations in both urban and rural settings. The two most distinct features of the Freirean approach are dialogue and problem-posing. Dialogue is used as a means in which two parties confront each other as knowledgeable equals in a situation of genuine two-way communication. In Problem-posing, cultural themes in the form of open-ended problems are incorporated into materials (e.g., pictures, songs, short stories) that are used to gnerate discussion. This questioning process leads students to  define the real-life problem being represented, discuss it's causes, and propose actions to solve it. The Freirean approach can be used in native language literacy education and adapted for use in English-as-a-Second-Language literacy education. (VWL)",

This handbook was developed at a 2-day workshop sponsored by the Northwest Educational Cooperative (NEC) and is designed to help improve the competencies of teacher trainers and bilingual staff responsible for providing cultural orientation. The handbook is divided into three sections. Section 1 consists of workshop handouts including a questionnaire aimed at determining participants' opinions about, and knowledge of cultural orientation programs, and a curriculum guide for such a program. Section 2 is a review of existing bilingual materials, including a listing of the language and purpose of materials housed in the NEC's library.  Section 3 is a selection of cultural orientation lesson plans on topics such as the sponsor/refugee relationship, social customs, and using public transportation. The cultural-specific materials in this handbook were taken from materials used in Southeast Asian refugee camps. A bibliography of selected bilingual cultural orientation materials, and sample cultural orientation lessons are included. (JL) (Adjunct ERIC Clearinghouse on Literacy Education)",

        "description":"Newspapers can be inexpensive and useful tools in the literacy classroom, but newspapers written for native English speakers are not always appropriate for English-as-as-Second-Language (ESL) students. Adapting the newspaper to classroom instruction is a natural way to introduce students to cultural and linguistic concepts. The newspaper can be used for ESL students at all proficiency levels. Many practitioners have compiled detailed and level-appropriate lists of classroom activities for using the newspaper as text. The newspaper industry itself is providing materials for use in adult literacy classrooms. These efforts involve using the newspaper as curriculum. Nationally, newspaper groups have encouraged their local newspapers to develop literacy projects and coalitions. On a  local level, newspaper groups cover literacy activities, provide free advertising space, and establish community-wide coalitions. Newspapers, a cultural and community constant in American life, can help newcomers acquire literacy skills and useful information at the same time.

This proclamation was linked to the formulation of a plan of action to assist member states in all regions of the world to wipe out literacy by the end of the twentieth century. The goals of International Literacy Year include the following: (1) to promote better understanding internationally of the problems of illiteracy; (2) to strengthen and revitalize existing primary education programs; (3) to encourage new programs to reach adult illiterates; and (4) to promote the struggle against reverting to previous levels of illiteracy. There are a number of  major international efforts to promote literacy, largely through the International Task Force on Literacy, a coalition of over 35 international nongovernmental organizations involved in adult education and literacy. UNESCO will publish a study this year arguing that unless an all-out effort is made to boost the quality of primary schooling, making it accessible to all children, and to give education renewed financial priority, the fight against illiteracy will be lost.

        "description":"In English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) classes at the college level, students are often enrolled who have a high degree of oral fluency, but little proficiency in reading or writing. Developmental ESL students need a solid start toward &quot;inventing&quot; themselves as readers and writers. One method of teaching ESL students to write is to build on their level of oral fluency. Situations can be created in the classroom where students collaborate as partners by sharing their personal histories aloud. After students have discussed their broadly focused personal histories, they narrow the focus to one specific aspect (e.g., a childhood memory). Students are encouraged to take notes during the talking and listening phase of their work. This helps them make the transition from the oral to the  written phase of their work, and enables students to understand how texts are created on the basis of personal significance. Writers narrow and organize their material on the basis of what is significant to them. Likewise, readers/listeners focus on areas they find to be significant. Within this approach, students begin to make connections between writing and reading that they did not make before. (VWL) (Adjunct ERIC Clearinghouse on Literacy Education)",

The goals of the program are to recruit students of high academic quality and to provide a better understanding of, and a greater appreciation for, agriculture. This report details student characteristics, such as age, gender, background, school activities, parents' occupations, siblings, and family's level of education and then provides a program  evaluation based on the postconference questionnaire administered to students at the end of each Ag Horizons program. The data indicated that Ag Horizons had a positive effect on student plans to attend college, on student plans to attend the University of Georgia as freshmen, and on student plans to enroll in the University of Georgia's College of Agriculture.

The survey, conducted between December 1987 and October 1988, examined demographic characteristics, workload, compensation, retirement plans, and job satisfaction. Major findings included: the typical full-time faculty member is a white middle-aged male with tenure; racial/ethnic minorities comprised only about 10% of the full-time faculty, and women only 27%; the average full-time faculty member reported working a total of 53 hours per week for an annual income of about $49,000; a high percentage of full-time  faculty were satisfied with such job dimensions as academic freedom, colleagues, and job security; fewer were satisfied with their salaries, institutional authority and leadership. On most issues higher percentages of part-time rather than full-time faculty indicated satisfaction though part-time faculty were less satisfied with benefits, job security, and opportunity for advancement. Plans to retire or otherwise leave their job within 3 years of the survey were reported by nearly one-fourth of full-time and one-third of part-time faculty.

        "description":"The efforts of Kentucky State University to inaugurate a comprehensive development program to increase private financial support for essential programs are described. The 14 major objectives established by the institution's development office in 1982 and the programmatic approaches used over a period of 7 years to achieve each objective, are featured. Highlights include: the university's annual fund drive; alumni participation; special fund-raising programs; endowment building efforts; research, preparation, and submission of competitive proposals to outside funding agencies; and major donor identification and cultivation programs. Particularly significant in the remarkable results achieved by the university are the institution's restricted access to wealth and the limited  resources allocated by the university in support of its development program. For 2 years, the program has been recognized nationally for its effectiveness. (Author/MSE)",

The program's success depended on collaboration among KSU, a community college, and high schools in the state to prepare academically talented minority students for careers in teaching. KSU faculty members visited high schools to talk with students and provide them with information about the myths and facts of teaching. Students were invited to the KSU campus for a Teacher Education Day and other orientation events. This allowed prospective  students to speak with currently-enrolled teacher education students and to talk further with faculty regarding teaching as a career. Many students enrolling at the university and indicating teaching as their possible major were awarded teacher education scholarships. All enrollees in the teacher education program were assigned a special mentor and/or advisor who is responsible for monitoring their academic progress. In addition, KSU administrators sought an agreement with local schools to hire highly qualified minority teaching graduates where vacancies occur. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"The project's objectives included strengthening the research capability of Kentucky State University, a historically black institution, allowing faculty to participate in professional development workshops, and aiding public administration graduate students with data from which to write theses. Four hypotheses were tested: that public managers participating in in-house managerial training programs tend to: (1) acquire a higher level of public service values, managerial skills, awareness of public policy issues, and involvement with professional organizations for continuing public service education; (2) have a stronger professional identity as public managers; (3) have a strong commitment to public service occupational values; and (4) achieve a higher level of vertical and  horizontal mobility in organizational structure. A total of 1,500 trained Kentucky public managers and a control group of 1,500 Kentucky public managers without such training were surveyed, with a response rate of 48.9%. Preliminary analysis of results reveal that respondents, mostly male and college-educated, agreed on the importance of college education, professional training, and continuing professional education activities. An overwhelming majority shared certain public service values, and most were sensitive to the political ecology of public administration and supportive of the Ombudsman role. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"Positive Adolescent Choices Training (PACT) is a health promotion program providing violence prevention programming targeted at black youth, at high risk for becoming either perpetrators or victims of violence. Conducted by the School of Professional Psychology of Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, in cooperation with Dayton Public Schools, the project builds on recent research on primary prevention programs that suggests such programs are more successful with economically disadvantaged and predominantly minority populations when developed with sensitivity to ethnic/cultural issues. PACT has developed a culturally specific version of an existing, well-tested cognitive behavioral training program to focus it directly on the problem of interpersonal violence and issues  relevant to black youth. The program provides structured training on the specific behavioral components of eight social skills enhancing the capacity of adolescents to form and maintain violence-free relationships. The approach exposes participants to minority peer role models demonstrating skills to be acquired and emphasizes intensive rehearsal and practice of the target skills through videotaped role-play and psychodrama. PACT is currently being implemented with 30 middle school students. The project also provides clinical training experience for doctoral-level clinical psychology students. Pilot experiences show the ty and potential effectiveness of the approach. (Author/MSE)",

Persistence was examined at two points: after the first year and 4 years after enrollment. The study was conducted at an urban university using the American College Testing's Entering Student Survey and Student Opinion Survey. Key variables such as region, satisfaction with campus social life, freshman quality point index, attendance at a summer orientation and registration program, and satisfaction with academic advising were identified as cogent predictors of persistence after the first year. Six variables affected the odds of persisting 4 years after enrollment: gender, financial aid, academic advising, institutional attitude toward students, satisfaction  with institution, and membership in a sorority or fraternity.

The system, an interactive modeling approach to conduct longitudinal and comparative studies, used multi-year admissions, financial aid, and academic data integrated with student surveys of college adjustment, reasons for leaving, student involvement, and college experience. The system enabled users to model attendance patterns and degree attainment for selected student subpopulations. Improvements in the system were considered necessary in order for it to provide feedback that is timely, not only for purposes of research,  but for operational use in improving student recruitment and retention strategies.

Interviews with 60% of the respondents were conducted to gather further information. Particular attention was paid to the relative weight and importance placed on the tangible, intangible, and non-work related benefits in the decision making process. Comparisons were drawn from previous faculty recruitment studies and to the complementary retention study, as well as between the urban and rural subject universities. In all, of the ten most influential factors found in the decision making process, eight were intangible  benefits of employment and present in all analyses: institutional, department and associates reputations; research opportunities; teaching assignments/opportunities; career advancement opportunities, congeniality of associates; and rapport with departmental leaders. The ninth common factor was the tangible benefit &quot;teaching/research load,&quot; and the uncommon factor found in the top ten of one of the universities was the tangible benefit of &quot;library facilities&quot;; in the other university it was &quot;research funding.&quot; (19 references) (GLR)",

Study results indicated that satisfaction exerted a stronger influence on grades than grades did on satisfaction. More research was determined to be needed on seniors to assess the effects of involvement and coursework on students'  educational outcomes.

The study's primary purposes were to: (1) describe the development of a comprehensive decision support system for alumni and fund raising activities at one independent university--the University of Hartford, Connecticut; (2) examine specific research and management applications of that system; and (3) feature examples of effective analyses and reports it can generate. Discussions focused on early collaboration between institutional researchers and advancement professionals which facilitated the study and led to construction of a multipurpose alumni survey. Preliminary results indicated that  administrators desiring to strengthen fund raising programs should concentrate on the following areas: improve community and donor relationships; gain the confidence of the institution and the participation of its president; build commitment among staff to improve outcomes; interact with people (including staff); and participate in other cultivation/solicitation activities.

The following questions were explored: (1) Do aid recipients' evaluations of university services differ from those of non-aid recipients? (2) Does the level of student indebtedness impact satisfaction? (3) Do women and men view their college experiences differently? Receipt of financial aid did not have a major impact in students' levels of satisfaction with the university. Analysis of the relationships between the types of aid students received and their levels of satisfaction with the university yielded only modest differences. Women  were found to be more satisfied with their overall undergraduate education and were more critical of the curricular and academic environment than their male counterparts.

        "description":"A &quot;formal information inventory&quot; survey method was used to help educate a university campus about outcomes assessment while identifying assessment activities already being undertaken. The survey was sent to 102 individuals identified as being responsible for, or having knowledge of, any assessment activities within a department or area, with 93 responses for a response rate of 91%. The survey was designed to be brief, educational for the respondent, and effective in collecting information for the outcomes assessment coordinator. The survey uncovered 265 assessment activities being currently conducted or recently completed. In addition, 49 campus units expressed a willingness to participate in a pilot project in outcomes assessment. The survey also identified &quot;Student Evaluation  Studies&quot;, &quot;Student Needs Studies&quot;, and &quot;Student Evaluation of Teaching&quot; as the three types of studies which could most effectively be used to make improvements to the programs or services of the respondents. One major area of concern was the relative lack of cognitive measures; efforts should be continued to develop and provide these outcome assessments as well. The value of this approach lies in the educational aspect of the instrument, the construction of an institutional statement regarding outcomes assessment, the project's high level of visibility, and the involvement of high level administrators.

        "description":"An environmental scanning system was developed by the admissions office of a graduate school of management in a small southeastern university. The school's strategic planning committee felt that it would be beneficial to acquire information concerning issues, trends, and possible events that might impact upon the school in the future and to analyze this information so as to better prepare the school for change. Six broad categories were to be scanned: four of these were in the traditional social, technological, economic, and political areas; additionally it was felt that regulatory matters involving accreditation and the category of competitive intelligence should be included. The planning committee chose the ED QUEST model for its planning efforts. After the categories were  chosen, information resources were identified and streamlined to aid convenience, time management, and better resource utilization. The major outcomes of the environmental scanning process were the development of an environmental scanning notebook, a newsletter, and the development of Delphi statements which were constructed to propose possible future implications of the themes and items of information suggested for the school. Outcomes indicated significant progress for the school of management. The process itself was viewed as being more important than the product because it elevated planning to the status of a regular activity, thus improving the organization's strategic management and planning.

The model was examined in relation to various assessment instruments and the evaluation of functional areas and programs. Surveys of six different target groups were conducted for each program under review; these groups were: program administrators; part-time faculty; currently enrolled students; graduates of the program during the last three years; program advisory council members; and employers of program graduates. The process of constructing the matrix required a thorough examination of each survey instrument, the identification of items common to the various surveys, and the  determination of uniformity in measurement of those various functional areas or components. This resulted in the design of two matrices: the Program Evaluation matrix and the Student Survey matrix. The matrix model facilitated integration of data from a variety of survey instruments into a composite report on any given service or functional area. An additional outcome of the matrix model was that it provided a rationale for the revision of survey instruments. Contains four references. (GLR)",

The study focuses on how environmental scanning activities are organized and used to support institutional planning and decision-making. Special emphasis is placed on describing how environmental circumstances influenced the development of the environmental scanning process and analyzing how environmental scanning information is utilized within various institutional sectors. The research questions addressed at the case study sites are: (1) What events and circumstances led to the development of the environmental scanning process at the case site? (2) How is the environmental scanning process currently structured and organized within the  case site? (3) How are the environmental domains defined and scanned by the organization? (4) How is environmental scanning information incorporated into the planning and decision making activities of the case site? (5) What is the perceived effectiveness of environmental scanning upon the planning and decision-making efforts at the case site? Results indicated that support from the chief executive officer was a necessary but not sufficient step in establishing a credible environmental scanning process; that decision makers were looking for ways to reduce environmental uncertaintly; and that scanning information was used for several functions including strategy formulation, problem identification, decision selling, and goal and objectives setting.

The Long Range Strategic Planning Study, the first of the studies to be undertaken, was charged with reviewing all academic programs, identifying program strengths, and making recommendations for redesigning the university into a smaller, more manageable institution. Peat Marwick Main &amp; Co. conducted numerous educational institution organizational audits and is developing a comprehensive statewide informational data base. The data base is to provide a framework for coordinating and establishing policy for postsecondary education in Iowa and to encourage dialogue on postsecondary education public policy in Iowa. All the study activity created  considerable apprehension on campus. Several studies were viewed as program eliminators. Data collected externally compared with departmental data was often shown to be inconsistent, further enhancing apprehension. Reconciling the data proved to be difficult and underscored the need for an information system: an electronic storehouse that can efficiently and consistently meet the data needs of future studies.

        "description":"A review of more than 3,000 books, monographs, journal articles, papers and other reports was conducted to discover what kinds of design, measurement, and analytical lessons have been learned as a result of the enormous volume of college-impact-on-student studies that have been published in the last 20 years and to determine how these lessons might help researchers in this area to be more effective. Eight &quot;lessons&quot; are discussed which are meant to offer a constructive critique of current research designs, methods, and substantive foci; in addition, a constructive critique is offerred suggesting ways in which that research might be made more rigorous, informative, and supportive of educational program and policy decision making. It is suggested that greater efforts be made in the  following eight tasks, which are examined in detail: (1) differentiating between simple change occurring in students during the college years and the &quot;net effects&quot; of college, (2) better estimating the magnitudes of college effects, (3) better examining when student change occurs, (4) better exploration into measuring indirect as well as direct collegiate effects, (5) more focus on college's effect coming about because of specific student characteristics (race, age, etc.), (6) making greater use of qualitative research methods, (7) expanding the theoretical perspectives that guide research and assessment study designs, and (8) greater focus on the effects of the academic program and the teaching-learning process on students overall.

        "description":"A study examined the role higher education institutions play through their educational strategy in supporting student retention. Educational strategy was defined as patterns of institutional practices designed to support undergraduate education, and the question posed was: Do the practices a college implements at the institutional level to support undergraduate education have anything to do with its ability to retain students? The practices were aggregated into strategy categories and compared to student retention at 528 four-year and comprehensive colleges and universities. Results indicated that although educational strategy added little to the predictability of retention in the total sample of institutions, it may be that it plays a critical role for those colleges and  universities which make a concerted effort to counteract the low retention rates that would follow from their institutional characteristics. For less selective public institutions, the practice of engaging in a broad array of activities that support undergraduate education may be related to improved student retention rates.

        "description":"The state profiles contained in this document are based on a 1989 survey of statewide or systemwide approaches to assessment and outcomes measurement in postsecondary education. All 50 states, the territory of Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia are included. A common format provides information on the following aspects: origins of the initiative, a description of the assessment initiative, the primary purpose of the assessment, whether or not common data or test results are collected in the state; whether institutions are required to report to the state about assessment or receive state-level approval of its initiative and how the initiative is funded. Additional comments provide information on state trends in assessment. An introductory reprint from the April 1990 issue  of the AAHE (American Association for Higher Education) Bulletin contrasts the 1989 survey results with those obtained from a similar survey carried out in 1987. It is noted that (unlike the earlier group), most of the 1989 respondents clearly distinguished between assessment of basic student skills on entry and assessment of college outcomes; an increasing recognition of assessment as an identifiably distinct policy arena was also observed. Twenty seven states have identifiable assessment initiatives consisting of legislation or board policy in place with only eight states reporting no such initiatives being planned; most new state initiatives stress institutional flexibility; most states are requiring local fiscal support of assessment efforts; and most respondents saw the purpose of  assessment to be instructional improvement rather than accountability.

        "description":"The paper examines policy implications of recent trends toward state mandated assessment of higher education services. Two differing purposes of assessment, that of academic improvement and that of accountability, are distinguished. Current trends in how policy makers and higher educators approach a &quot;new accountability&quot; include seeing assessment as a mechanism for actively shaping institutional agendas toward greater attention to instructional quality. External requisites for accountability are based on three broad policy directives: re-establishing credibility, expanding the base of resources, and creating a vision for the future. In contrast, internal requisites for accountability also involve three policy directives: recreating standards for student competence and achievement,  sending a clear message on priorities, and revitalizing curriculum and instructional practice. Effective assessment requires a commitment for the long term and state leadership that will sustain assessment as a process with academic integrity. Contains 10 references. (DB)",

        "description":"The conference reported in this document was attended by representatives of seven states (Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New Mexico, Tennessee, Virginia, and Washington). Participants focused on three key questions: (1) what are the issues and objectives behind assessment in each state? (2) what can be done regarding the implementation of assessment? and (3) how should the results be communicated? Concern with assessment was seen as reflecting interest in educational quality, as encouraging more effective use of resources, and as a means for faculty self-improvement. Variations across states were noted in terms of external forces, internal forces, initial fears and ultimate advantages of assessment as policy, and current issues. Suggestions directed at both campus leadership and  state leaders are made for the improvement of assessment implementation especially in the areas of resolving differences between the two groups and maintaining good communication. A concluding section notes that the power of the assessment movement lies in the cogency of the questions it asks and that the biggest shortcoming of many state assessment initiatives is their failure to communicate a compelling set of reasons for mandated assessment. The conference agenda, a list of participants, and names of members of the Assessment Advisory Committee are included. (DB)",

The following questions are considered: What is citizenship and public life? What is higher education's role in educating for citizenship? and what are the skills for a renewed civic life?. The importance of citizens integrating their public and private lives for maximum social productivity is stressed. Higher education offers a setting, a curriculum, and an established community, all aimed at developing human beings for living in a public world. Three models can define the citizen's role: electoral-competitive, representative, and participatory democracy. Each model requires different attitudes, skills, and levels of participation. Colleges and universities can help  students expand their notions of citizenship through the classroom structure, by providing opportunities for experiential learning, and in creating a campus community where all constituencies can think together about their shared lives.

        "description":"This digest summarizes issues raised in a research report on fund raising in higher education. The following questions are addressed: What are the changes and trends since the early days of educational fund raising? What are the implications? What is known about spending? What is known about donor behavior? What are the major ethical issues? What are the practical implications? and Where should future research focus? Among trend changes noted is the expansion of fund raising from independent colleges to public institutions, the replacement of the notion of charity by that of philanthropy, and the changing place of fund raising from a peripheral to a central institutional activity. A consistent association between dollars spent on fund raising and results of fund raising is noted,  and it is suggested that internal rather than cross-institutional comparisons should be used for determining optimum spending levels. Research on donor behavior is seen to favor exchange models over models of altruism. Ethical issues are identified concerning provision of information to donors, knowing which gifts to refuse, and determining obligations of fund raisers. Practical suggestions are made to institutions (e.g., they should consider sources of private support strategically) and suggestions are made to professional associations and foundations (e.g., they should support institutions in shaping their fund raising to reflect demographic changes). It is recommended that additional research address spending and the effectiveness of fund raising, consistency of college mission, and  formation of alumni donors' attitudes.

What is known of donor motivation? and What is the connection between successful intercollegiate athletics and successful fund raising? Research findings indicating the consistent association between dollars spent on fund raising and results of fund raising, and the preference of exchange models over models of altruism in understanding donor motivation are noted. The first section of the report looks at the American tradition of private philanthropy by considering annual alumni funds, charitable gifts from business gains and professional fund raising and fund-raiser organizations. Institutional effectiveness, policies, and  programs are examined next, and this is followed by a brief consideration of organization and costs in the third section. Donor behavior and motivation are discussed in the fourth section, which takes up the issues of modeling donor behavior and predicting alumni giving donor behavior in relation to tax incentives and economics, the effect on donor behavior of intercollegiate athletics, and corporations and foundations as donors. In the fifth section, ethics and values in fund raising are considered in sub-sections on institutional priorities, sharing information with donors, refusing a gift, and obligations of fund raisers. The final section provides analysis, discusses implications, and offers recommendations. Contains about 200 references. (DB)",

Subjects were 28 students (10 second year, 8 fourth year, and 10 fifth year) and 10 family physicians with at least 4 years of experience. Subjects were presented with either a typical or atypical case of pancreatitis which they were to diagnose while thinking aloud and then to describe by writing out the pathophysiological processes they believed to underlie the case. Level of expertise correlated with number of case findings subjects responded to with knowledge application propositions. Fourth year  students applied the most knowledge propositions and fifth year and experienced physicians the least. Results suggested that the overt role of biomedical knowledge in expert clinical reasoning is virtually absent, though this knowledge has not decreased but increased. Comparison of the overlap between applied and available knowledge suggested that, in approaching the unstructured information of the atypical case, clinical knowledge was preferred over biomedical knowledge. It is concluded that biomedical knowledge becomes increasingly integrated in the clinical knowledge base with increasing expertise. Contains 11 references. (DB)",

In the course of their medical training, students develop rich, elaborated causal networks, explaining the causes and consequences of disease in terms of general underlying pathophysiological processes. Through extensive and repeated application of knowledge and exposure to patient problems, the network type of knowledge organization is replaced by list-like structures called &quot;illness scripts.&quot; As these scripts are verified through experience they become &quot;instance scripts.&quot; Finally, the various knowledge structures develop through a sedimentation process into multiple  layers which are accessed when ontologically more recently acquired structures fail to adequately represent a clinical problem.

College students (N=39) were randomly assigned to either an experimental condition or a control condition and asked to brainstorm about a presented problem and to propose explanations. The free recall protocols produced by the subjects were first passed into subject-predicate units (or clauses) each expressing a single idea. In addition, the clauses were categorized as either &quot;explanatory&quot; or &quot;descriptive.&quot; One-way analysis of variance were carried out on the data, and it was found that subjects in the problem analysis discussion group produced more than twice as many correct  clauses as compared with the control group. The problem analysis group also produced a significantly larger proportion of explanatory clauses whereas the control group produced a larger proportion of descriptive clauses. Results suggest that problem analysis using small-group discussions not only activates prior knowledge but encourages subjects to reconstruct their existing knowledge in such a way that a more coherent &quot;situation model&quot; is produced.

Findings indicated that the more time subjects had available the more knowledge about the subject they were able to produce; that the amount of prior knowledge  produced is a function of level of expertise (physicians produced more information than students); but that &quot;experts&quot; (physicians and sixth-year students) recalled less information but more relevant information about the case than did intermediates (fourth-year students).

        "description":"In two studies, the role of biomedical knowledge in the diagnosis of clinical cases by physicians and medical students was explored. Experiment 1 demonstrated a decrease in the use of biomedical knowledge with increasing expertise. This result appeared to be at variance with some findings reported in some but not all of the literature. In Experiment 2, three possible explanations for this phenomenon were investigated: rudimentation of biomedical knowledge, inertia, or compilation. Using a combined think-aloud and post-hoc-explanation methodology, it was shown that experts have more in-depth biomedical knowledge than novices and subjects of intermediate levels of expertise, but use this knowledge in a tacit way, the result of a process of knowledge compilation. The findings  generally support a three-stage model of expertise development in medicine: (1) during the preclinical stage biomedical and clinical knowledge develop separately with an emphasis on biomedical knowledge; (2) during the clerkship stage, emphasis is shifted toward the acquisition of clinical knowledge; and (3) after both knowledge bases have matured to a sufficient extent, biomedical knowledge is compiled and integrated into clinical knowledge.

        "description":"The paper describes the use of writing as an instructional strategy to integrate several contemporary issues all of which focus on the teaching of human development theories. Issues include postmodern thought, higher level thinking process, conceptual conflict, and arousal, motivation, and integrating the writing process into the psychology curriculum. Each issue is briefly discussed and the literature reviewed. The instructional methodology involves use of a dyadic technique and the writing of nine short essays throughout the semester. Students write essay questions and model answers based on assigned readings and text material. Students also write answers to each others' questions, then discuss answers both in dyads or triads and as a whole class. Finally, students' questions  and answers are evaluated both by peers and the instructor. Students who received this instructional approach generally felt it was highly beneficial to their learning of both the content of the class and of each other's perceptions of that content. Results support efforts to expand writing activities across the college curriculum. Samples of questions and answers and a form for writing and rating questions are attached. Contains 55 references.

        "description":"University administrators must realize that past management styles they used to acquire their positions of campus power often become the future incarnations of their failure as administrators. The conundrum of power is that the less power a leader grants to people, the less powerful the leader becomes in the eyes of the people. Individuals have a need for power though they tend to deny the need's existence; acknowledgement of the power motive must precede any mastery of the conundrum making up the power-complex of leadership. Power has multiple descriptions as leaders utilize several power bases, including raw power, person power, legitimate power, coercion power, reward power, expert power, information power, and referent power. Power's scope and scale can be configured as a  representation of x-axis and y-axis intercepts. The scope of power refers to the purpose or motive for which it is being employed, ranging from low to high congruence of one individual's motives with another individual's needs. The scale of power gauges the degree to which the resources of a position are brought to bear on the followers as the leader attempts to carry out his or her power motive. Includes 59 references.

Among the questions addressed are: What prompts an interest in the emeritus status? What trends presage its restructuring? What changes in the emeritus rank are likely? How might a new emeritus rank help solve problems of abolishing a compulsory retirement age? and What should colleges and universities do? The interest in emeritus status is now coinciding with the demise of compulsory retirement. Recent studies illustrate how personnel procedures can utilize fresh conceptions abut the meaning of emeritus status to the mutual benefit of faculty and institution. Trends show the number of emeriti is large and growing, they are becoming more assertive, and they  are organizing. Changes in emeritus status would include a part-time working rank, the benefits of which would be negotiated on an individual basis within stated institutional policy. Several problems will emerge if compulsory retirement is abolished, such as making funding available for new teachers and getting rid of deadwood. It is recommended that universities start planning roles now for the emeritus role using the faculty senate as the planning vehicle. Contains 4 references. (GLR)",

What changes in the emeritus rank are likely? How might a new emeritus rank help solve problems of abolishing compulsory retirement age? and What should colleges and universities do? Recent studies about the emeritus rank illustrate how personnel procedures can utilize fresh conceptions about the meaning of emeritus status to the mutual advantage of faculty and institution. The report begins by examining the theory, research, and advocacy for emeritus positions and concludes with a review of policy and practice considerations while also providing a definitive review of the rank itself. Also discussed is the apparently increasing need by  retiring faculty to seek role continuity long into their later years and the lack of studies in preparing and guiding institutions for these new roles. Next the issue of forced retirement versus a negotiated agreement to alter tenure for those who wish to transfer to an emeritus status is examined. Eight conclusions resulting from this analysis are presented in conjuction with recommendations on how institutions may find new and productive roles for the professor emeritus rank.

        "description":"This report reviews the literature on high-risk students at the higher education level in terms of the following questions: are high-risk students and nontraditional students the same? what is the impact of high-risk students on institutions of higher education? are high-risk students treated differently in elementary and secondary schools? do instructional styles vary in classrooms depending on students' racial and socioeconomic status? and do teachers' negative attitudes adversely affect socioeconomic status? and do teachers' negative attitudes adversely affect students' self-esteem and performance? Among conclusions are the following: high risk students are minorities, the academically disadvantaged, the disabled, and those of low socio-economic status; high-risk students  affect institutions in such ways as declining enrollments and increased average cost per student; discrimination based on class, race, and gender affect educational quality in the elementary secondary program; minority and poor children tend to be taught more by rote and less by questioning and teachers' negative attitudes may result in prejudgment or avoidance of culturally different students. High-risk students need to develop skills and competencies associated with success in college. School administrators, teachers, and counselors should facilitate persistence and program completion. Institutions of higher education must guarantee financial assistance for the duration of the student's degree program. Businesses and community-based organizations can form partnerships with educational  institutions to reduce risk. Includes approximately 240 references. (DB)",

These components encompass a media program of services and instruction which make the facility, equipment, and collection accessible to the entire school community through the design and management of a professional media staff. To this end an operational model, guidelines, and assessment guide have been developed for use by  media personnel in meeting the mandates of P.L. 94-142 (The Education for All Handicapped Children Act). This model consists of the operational model, the guidelines, an assessment guide, and instructions for developing a plan of action using data gathered with the assessment guide.

Drawing on this  analysis, parameters for an educational approach to promote responsible computer use are outlined. It is argued that such an approach must: (1) make visible (as opposed to hiding) the consequences of computer-mediated actions; (2) help students understand that people control the use of technology (including where and for what purposes technology is used); (3) help students to identify and clarify the conventional aspects of computer use; and (4) stimulate students to develop a watchful eye for unanticipated consequences or abuses of computer use. The paper concludes with a brief description of a strategy for applying these guidelines in the classroom using student self-governance to resolve many of the social issues that concern their use of computers.

        "description":"This study examines the relationship between societal forces and school computer use in the context of two issues surrounding computer technology: computer property and computer privacy. Four types of data were collected from district administrators, principals, computer teachers, and students over a 9-month period in a high school with a broad, well-integrated computer education program. Methods employed were naturalistic observation, informal interviews, historical document analysis, and structured interviews. Observed conflicts surrounding classroom interactions pertaining to copying software were partly in response to the institutionalization at the district level of a policy that upheld the property rights of computer programs, but failed to provide compensatory funding for  purchasing programs. This inadequate funding helps explain why teachers at times condoned and at times prohibited unauthorized copying of commercial software, and why so little explicit instruction addressed the issue of ethics with students. Observed conflicts surrounding the issue of computer privacy resulted from a conception on the part of the principal, teachers, and students that access to computer files was subordinate to and determined by learning--the central task at hand. This finding helps explain why students neither asserted nor protected the privacy of their files, and why the classroom projected a nonchalant attitude toward accessing electronic information despite the societal climate.

        "description":"This paper describes the use of educational research and development resources by practitioners within the National Education Association's Mastery in Learning Project (MIL), a 5-year national second wave reform effort. Four research questions were addressed: (1) What are practitioners' information needs over time in the context of research-based school reform? (2) From where did practitioners' information come? (3) To what extent were the practitioners satisfied with the information they received? and (4) What are practitioners' information needs for the future? Data sources include documentation of materials mailed to practitioners in 24 of MIL's schools, annual reports from each school, computer network activity analysis, and the results of an information-use survey.  Practitioners' need for research and development was categorized by teaching function. Results indicate that 21% were concerned with the executive functions, 14% with the interactive functions, and 66% with the organizational functions of teaching. The extent to which practitioners' information came from three Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) sources was reported to be \"none\" for 52%, \"some\" for 30%, \"a lot\" for 3%, and \"most\" for .77%. Implications are: (1) teachers consider educational improvement to be primarily affected by changes in the school-wide organization; (2) teachers have great confidence in the wisdom of practice and rely principally on each other for information on topics of concern; and (3) the computer network shows potential for linking that  practical wisdom with research findings. Data are presented in 15 tables and five figures, and instruments used in the study are appended. (19 references) (GL)",

        "description":"An evaluation of the Mathematics and Computer Assisted Remedial Teaching (MASCART) project in the Pre-Entry Science Course (PESC) at the University of Botswana focused on two questions: (1) Considering the conditions for successful implementation highlighted in the literature, has the implementation of computers in the PESC department been such that institutionalization can be expected? and (2) Did the use of the MASCART software result in knowledge gains? A case study design was utilized for the first question and a pretest-posttest design for the second. Most of the factors influencing the success of implementation were fulfilled. Although the institutionalization phase is not yet complete, developments are promising. Based on the case study design, it can be concluded that  there is no reason to doubt, for the time being, the validity of the theoretical starting point of the study--that the implementation and institutionalization of an educational change depend on the existence of specific conditions at the level of the materials themselves, the institution, and the society. With respect to the second question, a general improvement in basic algebra knowledge and skills was measured. While this gain cannot be unequivocally attributed to the quality of the MASCART materials, data indicate that the combination of increased time on task and working with MASCART materials was effective.

The actual application of the technology in these courses is examined in order to demonstrate the versatility of the technology and the range of instructional designs possible with the telewriter. Instructional strategies used in the courses are described and the interrelationship between instructional strategies and subject matter is explored in each case. In conclusion, the paper notes the following instructional issues arising from the experiences described: (1) using  the telewriter requires considerable advance preparation; (2) instructors found effective new ways to use the telewriter in distance delivery; (3) the best interaction occurred when students were able to use the technology actively as a tool to promote their participation; (4) since students were intimidated by the equipment, the simplest ways of responding (pen and pad, typing with keyboard) were best; (5) perceived advantages of the telewriter include its capacity to transmit symbolic content (math formulae); (6) the instructional effectiveness of the technology varies according to the nature of the subject matter; and (7) instructors felt that the care and attention required to offer a course using the telewriter improved the quality of instruction.

        "description":"An audioteleconferencing system enhanced with a microcomputer-based telewriting system was used for the delivery of an introductory statistics course designed for home study which was offered by Athabasca University. From the instructor's point of view, the telewriter system made supporting the delivery of the statistics course much easier and more convenient than was possible by using either the telephone or teleconferencing alone. However, a number of technical problems with the telewriter system were cited by all students as a major problem throughout the project. Instructionally, the students were dissatisfied with the lecture style of presentation used by the instructor and with the rate of pacing used to cover the course content. Students particularly questioned the  reproduction of material given in the text and student manual. In fact, many felt that they could progress as well reading the material on their own, at home, and to a large degree this would account for the substantial fall-off in attendance at sessions at the six study sites, and the termination of the course with a 67% completion rate. Students indicated that two of their initial expectations for the course--personal contact with the instructor and personal contact with other students--were not met. Possible explanations for the overall negative assessments of this course include a negative reaction to the instructor and the associated instructional style, the technical problems experienced, and the nature of the subject matter.

A description of the two program sites--Volusia County and Okaloosa County school districts in Florida--is followed by an outline of the essential components of the project, its goals and objectives, and its philosophical and theoretical foundations, highlighting the project's focus on opportunities for active learning, shared responsibility and learner control,  cooperation, and fair competition. The four phases of the comprehensive evaluation plan--development, initial implementation or formative evaluation, continued implementation and summative evaluation, and dissemination--are described. The results presented are based on: (1) classroom observations and teacher meetings; (2) interviews involving administrators and teachers; (3) teachers' journals; (4) the nominal group technique (conducted during teacher retreats); (5) surveys of teachers, principals, and parents; (6) parent feedback (collected during meetings with parents); and (7) student performance analysis. Findings are summarized and 11 issues concerning components of the project are addressed. The report concludes with recommendations concerning teacher journals, the use of teacher  aides and other volunteers, planning time and time management, availability of materials and supplies, student work station utilization, reporting to parents, and program continuation.

        "description":"With the increased funding made available by California Assembly Bill 1725, community college faculty members have the opportunity to inform themselves and make changes in policy regarding the disabled. The disabled are often overlooked as a special interest or underrepresented group in affirmative action plans. Individuals involved with the disabled can play critical roles in assisting local academic senates to make their schools aware of the need to recruit and hire the disabled. These specialists can help the senates by pointing out the poor representation of the disabled among faculty, staff, and administrators, and by influencing local policy development and hiring decisions. They should also serve on affirmative action committees as representatives, in order to further  sensitize the campus community to the needs of the disabled. Districts and local senates should work together to review district affirmative action plans. Because our culture places extreme value on physical perfection, the disabled face formidable obstacles in becoming part of the community. Within the collegiate setting, these harmful perceptions can be changed. This legislation's focus on staff and faculty development will facilitate modifications in the curriculum and the teaching-learning environment in order to encourage greater recognition of and sensitivity toward the disabled.

        "description":"At the Daytona Beach Community College (DBCC) Library, collection development, selection, and acquisitions function as levels of a hierarchy. The highest level is collection development, which constitutes the planning function. Meetings are held annually to assess user needs, evaluate the present collection, discuss budget considerations, plan for research sharing, set collective and individual goals, and revise the written collection development policy if necessary. The second level is selection, which involves decisions about inclusion and exclusion of specific items in the collection. DBCC faculty, staff, and students are involved in the selection process, but librarians have primary responsibility. Close contact with students and faculty through reference services and  participation in campus committees allows the librarians to be aware of collection deficiencies and to anticipate future needs. The third level is acquisitions, which involves implementing selection decisions and collection development plans. At DBCC, all selection requests are forwarded to the head of Technical Services who coordinates bibliographic verification, duplicate checking, preparation of orders, receipt of materials, and payment processes. The disadvantages of this system are that there are no formal faculty representatives in the collection development meetings, and that collection development is time consuming. The advantages are better knowledge of the collection among librarians, greater librarian involvement in administrative decisions, no delay in selection, and no danger  of areas left uncovered. This model works at DBCC because the campuses are linked by computer, and librarians have a great deal of experience and complementary interests. It may not be appropriate for all community college libraries. (WJT)",

        "description":"During the 1988-89 academic year, the public community colleges in Illinois reviewed the general education component of their baccalaureate/transfer degree programs. Subsequently, the colleges were asked to respond to a series of questions about the following: (1) the relationship of the general education curriculum to program objectives and other curriculum components; (2) objectives for the development of skills in written and oral communications, mathematics, and analytical thinking; (3) the communication of these objectives to students; (4) methods used to assess student progress; (5) results of the assessment of student progress; (6) the support provided by faculty-related institutional policies to teaching and learning development; and (7) the resources needed to support  changes and improvements. In conducting the general education reviews, all of the colleges used committees consisting of administrators, faculty and, in some cases, students. In most cases, the results and recommendations of the committees were presented to the college at large and to the board of trustees. Colleges described the objectives of general education as the development of a breadth of knowledge and an understanding of the different modes of inquiry and expression within the basic fields of humanities, social and behavioral sciences, and natural sciences. To fulfill these objectives, all colleges required a distribution of coursework in the arts/humanities, social/behavioral sciences, and natural sciences. Based on college responses, nine recommendations were developed,  concerning the continuation of the general education reviews, closer collaboration with universities, the further development of assessment and tracking systems, follow-up studies, and the identification of resource needs.

The study found that all of the community college districts, except one, have foundations to assist them in maintaining, developing, supporting, increasing, and extending their facilities, services, and programs. Other survey findings included the following: (1) the foundations had an average of 22 board members, who were usually selected by nomination and/or election; (2) the colleges estimated that their foundations generated a total of $9.1 million in resources during fiscal year 1989; (3) on an individual foundation basis, resources  generated ranged from $25,500 to $1.1 million, with an average of $216,564 per foundation; (4) in addition to cash revenues, the colleges estimated that the foundations received $1,157,000 worth of donated items in fiscal year 1989; (5) the major types of events sponsored by the foundations during 1989 were general campaigns to solicit money (through telephone, mail, or other direct contact solicitations), sporting events to raise money, and fund- and friend-raising dinners or luncheons; (6) the most successful and rewarding foundation activities were scholarships, awards, and recognition programs; and (7) the most frequently given suggestion for enhancing foundations was greater selectivity in choosing foundation board members.

        "author":["Hernandez, Kathleen Rodarte"],
        "description":"Although the role of the student development professional has changed along with the mission of the community colleges, the models providing a theoretical framework for the profession have remained relatively unchanged. In 1937, the American Council on Education published a statement which declared that student development professionals were to facilitate the intellectual, personal, social, and moral development of the student. A number of theoretical models have since evolved. In 1972, a Human Development Facilitator Model was proposed that presented the student personnel worker as committed to positive human development and as possessing the skills and expertise needed to implement programs for the realization of human potential. Another model, the Maintenance Model, reduced  the student development function to an unintegrated set of services available through various offices of the college. In 1975, the American College Personnel Association released a position paper which emphasized the intentional and systematic use of adult development theories in carrying out assigned functions, such as skill and attitude development and the integration of learning experiences. In 1986, the League for Innovation in the Community College reaffirmed the principles of student development established in previous years and recommended minimum requirements for assuring student success. Challenges expected to influence the student development profession in the coming decade include the quality reformation, educational technology, financial constraints, changes in institutional  mission, and enrollment management. These challenges will required the development of innovative strategies and practices to address future needs. (JMC)",

        "description":"For twenty years, the DACUM (Developing a Curriculum) model has been used for the design of occupational programs at the secondary and postsecondary levels as well as the design of training programs for business and industry. Over the past five years, the Maryland DACUM Resource Center project has disseminated the DACUM model among the community colleges of the state to support the development of exemplary curricula and address area labor market needs. In 1990 an evaluation was conducted of the Maryland DACUM Resource Center to assess the scope, quality and impact of the products and services of the Center. The six activities included in the Maryland project were: (1) DACUM chart development, curriculum design, and instructional development; (2) DACUM model development and  refinement; (3) personnel development; (4) Resource Center organization and operation; (5) response to technical committee requirements and initiatives; and (6) personnel and administrative support. Documentary inquiries, surveys, and interviews resulted in quantitative and qualitative data from administrators, facilitators, and faculty as well as the Center staff. All of Maryland's community colleges participated in phase I training--chart development, with nearly all (93%) completing phase II training--curriculum planning, and with some (40%) continuing into phase III training--instructional development. Surveys of the three phases of DACUM indicated that they were all considered very effective, especially phase III which was the focus of the most recent research and development. The  strengths of the program included aspects of both the training process and its content, represented by such items as on-site support and mentoring, and the overview and presentation of DACUM principles and process. Areas for further development included program development and institutional impact and support. Five recommendations were developed to support expanded service delivery, selected application development, and publication production. Appendixes provide the evaluation design and protocols, documentary inquiry data, survey data, and interview data. (JMC)",

        "description":"Over the years, researchers have defined \"leadership\" in myriad ways. On the whole, they have found that there are various kinds of leadership, that leadership works in many ways, and that it has distinctive requirements and processes. Leadership does not result merely from individual traits, but also involves attributes of the transaction between those who lead, those who follow, and situational variables. Transforming leadership occurs when one or more persons engage with others in such a way that leaders and followers raise one another to higher levels of motivation and morale. A study of the most effective college presidents found that exemplary educational leaders relied on respect rather than popularity, worked longer hours, made decisions more easily and confided less in  other presidents than did their counterparts. Five attributes emerge which define transformational leaders: influence; people orientation; motivation; values; and vision. The development of good leadership qualities requires good communication, promoting mutual rewards between leaders and followers, handling power with care, learning to make decisions, becoming a positive force, and articulating a winning mission. Mentoring programs can also help to strengthen leadership by linking experienced administrators with those who are interested in learning new skills. A leader competency checklist is appended.

        "description":"Discussions about the social responsibility of businesses have led to questions about the social responsibility of academic institutions. As governmental support of community activities appears to be lessening, activities by educational institutions in support of local communities becomes more essential. New developments in the linkage between school and community have required departmental and divisional chairpersons to take the proactive step of promoting community service. At Catonsville Community College (CCC), one of the most visible community programs is the Volunteers in Tax Assistance (VITA) program, in which accounting students and the accounting faculty give assistance to elderly, low-income, and handicapped citizens in preparing their tax returns. The VITA program  allows CCC students and faculty to reach out into the community to help residents in an area of great need. And while the college is helping those who need assistance, the mission and faculty of the college become better known to the community. Another community outreach program at CCC is the Volunteers in Legal Assistance (VILA) program. Similar to the VITA program, the VILA program involves law faculty in diagnosing legal problems for community residents and referring such individuals to competent legal professionals who can provide the assistance needed. A third program, VIFA (Volunteers in Financial Assistance), provides referral service to community members who need financial advice. The role of the departmental or division chairperson in promoting the myriad of services to the  community is to create an environment that supports creativity and community involvement. Chairs should recognize faculty who participate by nominating them for service awards and by sponsoring them for attendance at conferences and workshops. As colleges meet more or their community responsibilities, the community expands its own interest in their programs and in using their services. (JMC)",

        "author":["Little, Doric"],
        "description":"The question of whether academicians are or should be ethical requires serious discussion, especially given the presence of select instances of unethical behavior among some professionals. One history professor responded to claims that he was a boring lecturer by presenting videotaped instruction; one English professor failed a student on an exam because the student missed the exam, even though she had called the professor with a valid excuse; and one male faculty member sexually harassed students whom he believed would not be taken seriously if they reported his abuses, such as foreign, obese, mentally retarded, emotionally disturbed, and/or physically handicapped students. There are four strong reasons why academicians should be ethical. The first is the long historical  tradition of ethics in education, described by Plato, Aristotle, and Quintilian, among others. Second, academicians are members of a profession with a code of ethics and professional judgment to which the courts of the land defer; this legal deference carries a concomitant expectation of ethical professional behavior on the part of educators. Third, academic accrediting institutions have an obligation to assure themselves that institutions under review conduct their affairs with honesty and frankness. The fourth reason for ethical behavior is that educators are role models for students. In order to promote an ethical climate on campus, academicians should take personal action by becoming advocates for victims of unethical behavior, by implementing a code of ethics on campus, and by  encouraging their institutions to offer a course in ethics on campus.

        "description":"In order to encourage active participation in the learning process on the part of students, the faculty in the Collin County Community College District (CCCCD) adopted experiential modes of teaching. The specific structure, methods, and content of the experiential component purposely remained individualized to the needs of the subject area and the creativity of the teaching faculty. However, common features characterized the experiential components: they were learner-centered and student-directed; they were perception based; and they placed emphasis on problem-solving, discovery, inquiry, practical application of course content, holistic understanding, and the heuristic process. The experiential component was applied to many disciplines, including accounting, mathematics,  humanities, and sociology. Two very different disciplines which were developed and evaluated were psychology and history. The psychology department implemented a laboratory component, extensive writing to learn, classroom research, and business/industrial linkages through internships. The challenges for the psychology department's comprehensive experiential learning process were: physical space to conduct experiments, coordination of laboratory equipment between part-time and full-time faculty and multi-campuses; and grading time. The history program required students to create a video documentary in place of the traditional research paper. Other projects which history students completed included a sociological analysis of television shows and historical re-creation. The 1988 CCCCD  student survey was completed by a broadly representative sample of 750 respondents. Positive student responses and below average withdrawal rates demonstrated the effectiveness of the experiential learning programs. (JMC)",

Major findings of the study included the following: (1) the service region population increased at an annual rate of 2.4% between 1970 and 1980 and was estimated to increase by 1.5% per year between 1980 and 1990; (2) the region's population as a whole grew at a faster rate than the state average, although the population density (73.6  people per square mile) was half of the state average (149 people/square mile); (3) residents of Charlottesville, Greene County, and Albemarle County enrolled at PVCC at a higher rate than residents of the service region as a whole; (4) family and household incomes in the service region were lower than the state averages; (5) the number of families classified as living below the poverty level, the unemployment rate, and the percentage of residents with less than 12 years of schooling were much higher in outlying counties than in those closest to PVCC; (6) enrollment projections for the 1990's included a large increase in older adults, a decrease in students aged 18-35, and a rise in the number of minorities and women; and (7) economically, the PVCC service region was characterized by a  highly professional work force, a service or government orientation, and little manufacturing.

        "description":"In July 1989, the members of Project Cooperation, 10 community colleges that had been invited to serve as demonstration sites for research on institutional effectiveness, were brought together for the second national colloquium on institutional effectiveness through outcomes measures. This report contains the presentations made at the colloquium and summaries of subsequent group discussions and break-out groups' reports. The first presentation was \"Assessing Institutional Effectiveness,\" by John Harris, which focused on the evaluation of assessment instruments, selection vs. criterion testing, assessment in accreditation and self-study, assessment and the improvement of educational quality, quality improvement in a global context, the Deming Approach to quality control,  inspection vs. process improvement, continuity, training, and leadership. The second presentation was \"Outcomes Assessment in Action: The Northeast Missouri State University Experience,\" by Terry B. Smith, which covered the creation of an assessment program; value-added assessment; stages of the assessment experience (i.e., readiness, implementation, acceptance, and commitment); and eight ingredients for success (i.e., large-scale student assessment, multiple measures, faculty ownership, student acceptance, assessment at all appropriate levels, usable and understandable data, flexibility, and the use of data to improve not punish). The final presentation was \"Student Assessment Practices in the Community College: Current State, Desired State, Getting There From Here,\" by Kay McClenney.  McClenney provided a brief overview of the current status of assessment in community colleges, propositions regarding desired future characteristics and directions for assessment programs, and key considerations in the development and implementation of assessment programs on local campuses. Lists of participants and their institutions, and of discussion group members are appended. (JMC)",

Part 1 begins by explaining that the program goal of encouraging high school students to go to college is achieved by allowing the students to earn college credits while still in high school. This is accomplished through agreements between high school and college faculty that a given high school course is equal to a course in the college curriculum. After listing the benefits of these agreements, part 1 considers the types of courses involved (e.g., introductory or developmental courses); and the steps in developing course equivalent agreements. A sample  agreement establishing the equivalency of a high school typing class and a college keyboarding class is provided. The agreement describes proficiency requirements and core competencies and includes a course outline. This section concludes with BCC's guidelines for developing an equivalence agreement. Part 2 focuses on program management, including a summary of the stages in the overall process and detailed discussions of the roles and responsibilities of the high schools and colleges at each stage. The high schools' responsibilities are identified as completing statements of intent to participate, sending beginning-of-year enrollment data to the college, awarding college equivalency credit for course completion, and sending a final report to the college. College responsibilities include  granting college credit to entering students, tracking student progress, and awarding certificates and degrees. Relevant forms are attached. (GFW)",

The program focused on the theory and practice of floral design and marketing, complemented by courses in employability skills, entrepreneurship, and salesmanship. The sample for the study was a nonrandom sample of all 278 students who had enrolled in the program from fall 1987 through spring 1990. Major findings of the study were as follows: (1) program enrollments increased in each year of the study, and most of the enrolled student were female; (2) although there were no minority students enrolled in the program in  its first year, minority enrollment increased every year thereafter; (3) withdrawal rates fluctuated greatly every term, with the highest rate of attrition (36%) occurring in winter 1988; (4) fewer students enrolled in the management courses than in the three design courses, and only 32 students enrolled in the cooperative internship program over the 3 years; (5) only seven students completed all course requirements for the program since its inception, many leaving because they had acquired jobs with the skills attained before program completion; (6) all of the program graduates were employed in the floral industry, with over half employed full-time; and (7) 48% of the non-graduates were employed in the floral industry, with the remainder employed in other areas.

        "description":"In 1990, a study was conducted to holistically evaluate the activities of the Employee Development Program at Paradise Valley Community College (PVCC) and to determine if employee groups differed significantly in their evaluations of the effectiveness of the activities. Of the 114 full- and part-time board-approved employees of PVCC, 86 (75%) returned questionnaires. Four employee groups were represented in the survey respondents: residential faculty (RFP); management, administrative, and technical personnel (MATP); professional staff (PSA); and maintenance and operations (M&amp;O), which included Crafts employees. Overall, the employees rated their participation in employee development activities as effective in aiding them to achieve the goals of the program. The M&amp;O group rated  the overall effectiveness of the activities significantly lower than did the other three employee groups. In addition, the M&amp;O group rated the activities designed to help them meet three of the program's four goals significantly lower than did the three other groups. Based on results of the study, several recommendations were proposed to improve the employee development program. Given the negative responses and low response rate (23%) of the M&amp;O group, the recommendations were made to invite an M&amp;O employee to serve on the Employee Development Committee and to conduct a follow-up study to determine more accurately how these employees perceive the effectiveness of the program. Appendixes provide the questionnaire, its attendant memorandum and data sheet, and employee responses to two  survey questions. (Author/JMC)",

        "description":"With the growing technological, economic and political interdependence between nations, the word &quot;community&quot; has come to have international implications. In order to alleviate American ignorance about other nations and global issues, community colleges must institutionalize international perspectives into their curricula. More than 50% of all foreign undergraduate students are enrolled at community colleges, and these students are an untapped resource for promoting cultural awareness on campus and in the surrounding community. Rockland Community College (RCC) and Brevard Community College encourage foreign students to offer tutoring in their native languages and advice on travel to their homelands. Community college curricula can be internationalized through specifically designed  courses or through the incorporation of lectures or assignments on global themes into existing courses. The nursing department at RCC, for example, has added a cross-cultural perspective to its curriculum by exposing students to local immigrant populations and the health issues affecting them. Some colleges bring an international flavor into their curricula through foreign language courses or study abroad programs. Work-study abroad programs offer career-oriented students a chance to gain employment experience and contacts while exploring another country. Another important aspect of an international curriculum is broadening the outlook of faculty and staff. This can be accomplished through travel study programs, faculty exchanges, and college consortia. The soundest advice for colleges  attempting to internationalize their curricula is to relate new international ventures to the existing resources, programs, and mission of the college. (JMC)",

        "description":"With the growing demand for accountability by legislators, outcomes assessment has become a much higher institutional priority for community colleges. According to a recent survey, two-thirds of the states have implemented formal assessment initiatives, compared to a very few states only 1 year earlier. Institutions, however, must be careful that assessment is not used only to ensure accountability, but also to enhance institutional quality. Effective and meaningful assessment evolves within a collaborative framework in which both legitimate legislative needs and the integrity of institutional autonomy are respected equally. Follow-up studies and job placement surveys are often adequate for institutional needs but do not sufficiently fulfill state requirements. Some colleges have  therefore implemented comprehensive assessment programs which attempt to evaluate quality at all levels, over time, through systematic reviews of academic programs and services and longitudinal studies of educational trends. One model identifies six areas of concern faced by all colleges: access and equity; employment preparation and placement; college/university transfer; economic development; college/community partnerships; and cultural and cross-cultural development. In 1988, a national study of outcomes measures investigated the use of academic progress and employment outcomes, student learning outcomes, and student satisfaction outcomes among a sample of 675 institutions of the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges. Over 90% of the respondents expected outcomes  measures to maintain their current priority or increase in priority over the next 3 to 5 years. The results of outcomes assessment should help colleges identify where present efforts and priorities lie and where they should be placed. (JMC)",

        "description":"Recent studies on correctional education point to the value of such programs in helping to train and rehabilitate those inmates disposed to such opportunities. Because of their vocational curricula and community service orientation, community colleges are in an ideal position to educate prison inmates. While in 1965, only 12 correctional education programs were in operation, by 1982 at least 350 functioning programs were reported. Three-quarters of these programs are sponsored by community colleges, which provide courses that range from basic math and reading to vocational instruction. Over 80% of the programs are held inside of the prisons, and most are staffed by part-time faculty. Recent studies have shown that prison programs have produced positive behavioral changes,  improved math and verbal skills among student inmates, and may account for a decrease in the recidivism rate of inmates who receive vocational training. Along with such benefits, prison programs also encounter problems including an unstable financial base, inadequate coordination and articulation among prisons, interagency and interpersonal conflicts, and high faculty turnover. In many cases, faculty are unprepared for the significant differences in the environment and their roles between regular classroom instruction and prison instructors, and many burn out quickly. Important characteristics for correctional program teachers include good listening skills, the ability to curb their own aggressive behavior, the capacity to work effectively in a relaxed classroom atmosphere, and the  ability to work one-on-one with students.

An evaluation of the impact of the MIHOW project on prenatal health behavior, infant feeding, and quality of home environment compared client information to information on a comparison group and made use of interviews with clients in their homes. The evaluation showed mixed results concerning prenatal care and pregnancy outcomes, but unequivocal success in the postnatal  phase. Monthly home visits made a difference in prenatal self-care and may have had an impact on prenatal care use, but had no apparent effect on the birthweights of infants. The results showed that a family support intervention using paraprofessional home visitors can improve the quality of the home environment of rural low-income children. (RJC)",

In this document, the view of appropriate pedagogy just described is elaborated by discussions of three questions: (1) What should be learned? (2) When should it be learned? and (3) How is it best learned? The first question is discussed in terms of four types of learning goals: knowledge, skills,  dispositions, and feelings. The second question is discussed in terms of the normative dimension of development and three subcategories of the dynamic dimension of development: ways in which human beings change; delayed impact of early experience; and long-term, cumulative effect of repeated or frequent experiences. The third question is discussed in terms of principles of pedagogical practice applicable to the four categories of learning goals and pedagogical principles generally applicable to most goals of early childhood programs.

The report indicates that children in the United States are frequently at greater risk than children in other developed countries for social, economic, and health problems. The greatest disparities are in the number of children affected by divorce, youth homicide, child poverty rates, infant mortality, and teenage pregnancy. In some instances, such as  births to unmarried women, demographic and social changes in other western countries over the last two decades closely parallel those in the U.S. Some conditions of U.S. children, such as youth suicide and unemployment rates, are similar or less troublesome than conditions in other industrialized countries.

Experimental studies and clinical data suggest that grammatical rules for spoken language predominantly rely on the left hemisphere of the brain, while the grammatical rules for body language (expressing emotions) rely more on the right hemisphere. The neurolinguistic approach also holds that: (1) in normal children and adults there is a strong relationship between expressive speech ability and reading and writing; (2) dyslexia is related to a left hemisphere lesion or to the absence of left hemisphere dominance for auditory discrimination of speech sounds; (3) speechless persons  can develop reading and writing skills; (4) there are some basic abilities that must be available to these persons; and (5) it is possible to support the development of these abilities by using pictorial symbols.

        "author":["Cotton, Rickey A."],
        "description":"A study examined notable contemporary novels published for adolescents to determine the extent of religious concerns and issues in the critical dialogue. Twenty-four novels published for adolescents on Donelson and Nilsen's Honor Listing for 1982-86 were examined. Eleven of these novels were found to have a strong religious dimension, indicating that not only is religion a significant aspect of the protagonist's milieu, but also that the protagonist is strongly involved in religious issues or situations. The religious contexts vary dramatically, including, as examples, contemporary witchcraft, Eskimo pantheism, the African \"mystery tradition,\" and traditional Protestant and Catholic spiritual experiences. Additionally, four novels were found to have a moderate religious  dimension, indicating that while religion is a significant aspect of the protagonist's milieu, the protagonist is not strongly involved in religious issues or situations. Nine novels had little or no religious dimension. These findings suggest that quality adolescent literature requires a response to the religious dimension. Literature teachers in public schools should recognize the validity and importance of religious issues in the literature as well as in the lives of their students, without promoting or denigrating specific religious orientations in their instruction.

        "description":"This study examined transitional knowledge during literacy development, hypothesizing that there are times when the integration of reading and writing knowledges into literacy knowledges is problematic for children because these knowledges are out of synch with one another. Data were gathered from 46 kindergarten pupils, each of whom wrote and read back six stories (during individual writing sessions over a 2-year period) which were analyzed for developmental patterns. Results revealed two mixed-level relationships between the sophistication of children's narrative compositions and their readings of those compositions: &quot;Low level writing/high level reading&quot; and &quot;High level writing/low level reading.&quot; The first type represents the relationship of pairing stories composed of letter  strings with written-language-like readings while the second represents the relationship of pairing compositions consisting of invented spellings and conventional orthography with readings judged to be oral or written monologues. Findings suggest that while there might not be a clear cut boundary between emergent and conventional literacy, there does seem to be a time in development when a greater than average amount of cognitive reorganization occurs that functions to integrate production and comprehension knowledges and thereby facilitates the advent of conventional literacy.

        "description":"A study investigated the contention that secondary school literature programs have offered, and continue to offer, what could be construed as a literary canon, a relatively small body of literary texts to which a majority of students have been and are continuing to be exposed. Several surveys of the literary works teachers assign, dating back to 1907, were examined and revealed several trends. First, there is a clear shift from a predominantly British curriculum to a predominantly American one from 1907 to 1990. A study of students' reading interests in 1950 revealed that major changes in the literature curriculum had taken place by mid-century. Only 12 titles on a 1964 list had also been on the 1907 survey list, and almost half of the top 40 titles were by Americans. Second,  many major characters in works of fiction are now adolescents. Third, many of the top 40 titles for grades 7-12 are now suitable for students with moderate reading ability. Finally, there seems to be a decline in tales of adventure and humor as well as in collections of poems and serious essays. To judge by these lists, there does not seem to be any strong evidence for the existence of a canon in high school literature programs over the past century. Most secondary school students in this country now read few literary works in common. These findings raise a number of questions for English teachers concerning intellectual content, moral content, and civic mission of the schools. (Four tables of data are included.) (KEH)",

        "author":["Doyle, Charlotte L."],
        "description":"A study used a case-contrast approach to explore children's multiple story-telling motivation. Kindergarten children were invited to dictate stories during free play once a week. The stories were written down in a book-like pamphlet and later, read to the class during story time. Many children chose this activity but one child, Rachel, told many more stories than the others. Various possible motivations were explored by comparing the case of Rachel with those of her peers. Factors examined included verbal skill, the opportunity to express themes of concern, creating pictures of wish-fulfillment, family constellation, interaction with a valued adult, signs of value and status from adults and peers, discomfort with other activities, the fun of creating humor, progress in cognitive  development, and pleasure in exploring the medium. One factor evidenced by Rachel that distinguished her from other steady, but less frequent, storytellers was her zest for exploring various storytelling genres. (Author/KEH)",

        "description":"The grading standard of the Language Skills Center at the State University of New York (Geneseo) has been adapted from the Diederich-French-Carlton Composition Scale and is designed so that instructors may respond objectively to student writing in six important areas: ideas; organization; vocabulary; sentence structure; punctuation; and capitalization. In addition, the scale is divided into two main concerns. The two parts of the scale complement each other and stress, first, the communication of ideas and the reactions to those ideas and, second, the editing and revision of the essay for the niceties of conventional grammar. For the writer the scale provides an objective, clearly defined editorial voice which pinpoints concrete areas of strengths and weaknesses that can be  readily comprehended. The instructors retain their humanistic approach, but the response is supported by obvious and understandable guidelines which suggest a common and shared method of effective communication recognized by both instructor and student. The main advantage of freshman testing using a writing sample scored on an analytical scale is the feedback provided: when a student enters the classroom, instructors (using the six categories) know what his or her writing weaknesses are. Another advantage is the practice of reading in pairs, which helps cut down on reader fatigue and ensures more objective grading. The only disadvantage is the cost and time involved to rate the papers; on balance, however, this method effectively identifies students with writing difficulties and provides  direction for their instruction.

Nevertheless, a variety of sentence pattern exercises and sentence combining lessons based on the students' own writing can be used to augment, challenge and improve students' writing skills and vocabulary. In the first exercise, students receive a xerox copy of one or two drafts of their fellow students' writing. Each student then counts the number of words in each sentence of a paragraph and underlines the subject and verb of each sentence: the student then rewrites and combines two short sentences using conjunctions, semicolons, or colons. In the second exercise, each student rewrites at least three sentences in a different paragraph and indicates which is his/her  worst rewritten sentence. Students work in teams to help each other rewrite the poorly rewritten sentences. If class time permits, the students then rewrite the entire paragraph. This series of exercises helps students learn more vocabulary and to use those semicolons and colons which seem to have disappeared down the television tubes. (RS)",

The changing environments require adjustments for class size and location (to retrain laid-off mature workers), in types of examples and vocabulary buzzwords teachers use, as well as in professional attitudes and development. Flexibility and the need for preparation led business writing educators to establish links with the corporate community, address the needs of life-long learners, attend professional as well as local seminars, work together to gain new perspectives (e.g., with part-time faculty of different disciplines), be honest with self-assessment, put to practice what they teach  (personal writing), make choices leading to fundamental changes, and involve people at all levels. The list continues as educators attempt to keep up with the process of change. Teachers and departments, however, are renewed through their efforts to effect change. Coordination and concentration lead to revitalized energy. (KEH)",

        "description":"This paper recommends that the high school journalism curriculum assume a prominent position in the teaching of ethics in the public academy. The paper proposes to lay the foundation for strategies that will foster student journalists' skill and enthusiasm in covering controversial issues, while requiring them to justify their decisions--particularly those with ethical implications--based upon the principles of sound moral reasoning. It relies upon principles referred to as the &quot;virtue ethics canon,&quot; (a set of principles set forth by the ancient Greek philosophers for moral education and the development of individual virtue), namely that: (1) there are certain fundamental, universal, and immutable moral values; (2) these values can be taught; and (3) these values must be applied  through the process of moral reasoning as a precondition for virtuous behavior. The paper begins with a brief examination of the philosophical foundations of the virtue ethics canon and its early role in the American educational system. The paper then discusses the demise of the canon in the face of the relentless pressure from the forces of pragmatism, progressive education, and moral relativism that precipitated the present crisis within the public academy in general and scholastic journalism in particular. The paper then examines the theoretical foundations for a restoration of the canon within the journalism curriculum and some of the guidelines that should be considered in the teaching of moral reasoning to student reporters and editors. Ninety-one notes are included. (SR)",

The third section, &quot;Classroom Spelling Programmes,&quot; discusses how spelling  programs can be organized, personal spelling lists, word study and vocabulary extension, and studying and mastering the core vocabulary of written English. The fourth section, &quot;Evaluating Progress in Spelling,&quot; deals with evaluation and measurement, measuring spelling as an aspect of writing, measuring spelling in relation to peers, measuring spelling of individual words identified for study, and measuring spelling weaknesses before starting remedial instruction.

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine whether manipulating the classroom environment to be either apprehension producing (AP) or apprehension reducing (AR) could significantly change the level of students' dispositional writing apprehension. Five student teachers and one secondary education supervisor volunteered to participate in the experiment and developed two classroom environments, one AP and one AR. Subjects were 272 students, grades 7-12, enrolled in English classes at cooperating secondary schools. Each student teacher selected two comparable classes in which to implement one AP treatment and one AR treatment, randomly assigned. The treatments lasted 6 weeks and consisted of six writing assignments--one administered per week. In AP classroom environments, students were  exposed to high levels of conspicuousness, intense evaluation schemes, continually novel assignments, and ambiguity of directions. In AR classroom environments, students were exposed to low levels of conspicuousness, de-emphasized evaluation schemes, articulation of assignment sequences, and clear directions. Maintenance of treatment was insured through student logs and supervisor observation. Daly and Miller's Writing Apprehension Test, designed to measure dispositional apprehension, was administered to all classes both before and immediately following the treatments. It was hypothesized that posttest scores would indicate significant differences in levels of dispositional writing apprehension between the AP and AR classrooms. Results indicated that classrooms with apprehension-producing  environments yielded significantly higher levels of student apprehension than did classrooms with apprehension-reducing environments.

        "author":["Donlan, Dan"],
        "description":"A study was conducted to determine where a sample of English language arts teachers, identified as educational leaders, get their ideas. Twenty-five English language arts teachers agreed to participate in the study which took the form of a 10-item survey. Five items dealt with trivial knowledge about language conventions and five items required teachers to describe continually successful teaching practices. Results indicated that these 25 teachers tended to trace their trivial knowledge of language conventions to teachers they had once had and that they continued to use this knowledge in teaching their own classes. They did not rely on their own teachers for the development of what they perceived to be continually successful teaching ideas. Rather, these teachers tended to claim  original creation. A sub-sample of 10 teachers was drawn from the original 25 (the five most and five least experienced) to determine whether these subgroups drew their teaching ideas from the same sources, whether the nature of the teaching ideas between the two groups was different, and whether their ideas labeled as &quot;original creation&quot; were perceived as being original by their peers. Results indicated that the two groups perceived that sources for teaching activities were distributed in a similar way and that both groups cited &quot;original creation&quot; as the most frequently used sources of ideas. To test whether claims of originality were warranted, a sample of 10 purportedly original ideas was submitted to a panel of 23 teachers under the guise of a &quot;teaching idea contest,&quot; where prizes  were to be awarded for originality. Results indicated that in none of the 10 cases did a majority of the judges determine that the idea was original. (Seven tables of data are included and nine references are attached.) (MG)",

The five-phased project used the following methods: (1) teachers-as-researchers: naturalistic-descriptive mode; (2) teachers-as-researchers: interventive-descriptive mode; (3) teachers-as-researchers: interventive-descriptive mode; (4) teacher-researcher collaboration: experimental mode; and (5) teacher-researcher collaboration: case studies-descriptive mode. Phases one, two, and three involved the same three instructors, each responsible for at least one class of freshman composition. Results  indicated that the three-tiered, five-point approach to collaboration appeared to increase the level of the students' interest and competence in collaborative learning and writing and was ready to be tested in more rigorous experimental conditions. Phases four and five involved four different instructors who taught freshman composition classes. Results indicated that collaboration throughout the writing process legitimized group talk about crafting writing, attitudes toward writing, and attitudes toward collaboration in all four experimental classes. The pedagogical plan may have a built-in gender bias, making it particularly appealing to female students. (Forty-eight references are attached.) (MG)",

One such program encourages parent participation in the classroom for parents who are able to volunteer their time, but also emphasizes parent participation at home. It is realistic to think that as parents move through the three levels of increasing classroom involvement (monitoring, informing, and participation), the audience of parents narrows. Teachers cannot let this be discouraging. Instead, they must continually remind themselves that the obligation to reach a wider audience of parents remains. When parent involvement reaches the level at which parents are actually involved at school  and/or at home, teachers must recognize that it was attained through effective communication in the beginning or at previous levels.

CEDA philosophically and, at least to some extent, practically supports the concept of the intent--or spirit--of the resolution. Three ideas from general semantics are particularly suited to thinking about this problem: non-identity, non-allness, and self-reflexiveness. Claiming that there is a true meaning of the topic violates the concept of non-identity. Non-allness means that a word does not represent all that it is supposed to represent, while self-reflexiveness implies that a final  conclusion can never be reached about anything. In short, teaching debaters that resolutions have a certain intent is tantamount to saying to them that there is a predetermined, all-encompassing, objective truth, beyond which there is an intellectual void. There is nothing worse for an activity that stresses critical thinking. (Sixty-one references are attached.) (RS)",

        "author":["Burns, Gary"],
        "description":"There are numerous ways to structure the introduction to film course so as to meet the needs of the different types of students who typically enroll. Assuming there is no production component in the course, the teacher is left with two major approaches to choose from--historical and aesthetic. The units in the course will typically be built around certain categories recognized as forming the canon of films: (1) primitives--something by the Lumieres, Melies, and Porter; (2) D. W. Griffith's films; (3) silent comedy; (4) Soviet Classics; (5) German Expressionism; (6) Renoir; (7) Italian Neorealism; (8) French New Wave; (9) Alfred Hitchcock; (10) recent American films; (11) documentaries; and (12) experimental films. Film textbooks provide a glimpse of the canon as well as  demonstrating some ways to organize the subject of film either historically or aesthetically. The best way to select a textbook is to compare the organization and look briefly at which films are selected for detailed analysis in each text. Film textbooks typically differ significantly from each other and thus provide the teacher with distinct alternatives. The teacher must also decide which films to show, in what order, and in which of the various available film and video formats. Scheduling feature-length movies weekly can wreak havoc on fairly rigid university class schedules. Such a course is sometimes frustrating to teach, but the opportunity to put together a program of films, watch them for the dozenth time, and talk about them to a mostly eager audience is a most rewarding  classroom experience.

        "description":"Two naturalistic studies examined how children attempt to exert dominance over their peers, which tactics are most frequently used, and which appeals are most successful. The first study identified 3 categories of dominance behavior by a 6-week observation of playground interactions of 20 4- and 5-year-old children. The second study, conducted at the same child care center 5 months later to quantify the findings of study one to provide validity to the inductive constructs, coded 78 domineering behaviors, counted the number of behaviors in each category, the sex of the initiator(s) and target(s) and the success ratios. Results confirmed that verbal assertiveness was the most frequently employed domineering strategy of 4- and 5-year-old children, accounting for 72% of dominance  behavior. Successful use of verbal assertion was found most frequently when commands were given by assertive children and when males attempted to dominate females. Domination of same-sexed target and female assertiveness over males were successful slightly more than half of the time. Results also revealed that physical assertiveness (12% occurrence) seemed to serve as a successful means for exerting dominance only when a child was able to exhibit athletic superiority. The most significant finding was the ability of some children to use theme plays to exert dominance over their peers (13% occurrence), a strategy used most often by females who feel confident that the target will play along with the scenario and assume the submissive position.

        "description":"This study examined eight research questions designed to measure students' perceptions of conflict management in the classroom (grades three through eight). In addition to assessing students' satisfaction with the particular conflict management strategies, student self-concept was also measured to determine if the level of self-concept had any bearing on the students' degree of satisfaction. Subjects for this study were 178 students enrolled in grades three through eight of a school system located outside of a small, midwestern city. Results indicated that several of the questions produced significant results that led to an improvement of conflict management in the classroom. Although the findings of this research are not as straightforward as they might be, several of the  results do improve on the picture of conflict management in the classroom. Strategy F, mutuality of concern, was the conflict management technique that was most often identified by the students. Strategy B, the invoking of class rules, also received considerable support from the students. Now that certain strategies have been identified, teachers may be in a better position to use these conflict-managing techniques to their advantage in dealing with problems that arise in the classroom. By effective application, the teacher should be making improvements toward creation of a more pleasant, more productive educational environment for both student and teacher alike.

Professional broadcasters often complain that broadcast students receive too little &quot;hands-on&quot; training, while academicians decry current broadcasting programs which do not challenge the students intellectually. In addition, broadcast students have their own set of expectations based on the view that college education is primarily a training ground for gainful employment. Most broadcast educators realize that, in the midst of the information age, students of mass communication must not only acquire a broad liberal arts education but must also be exposed to the cultures, politics, and problems facing other nations. Only those media students who clearly understand and appreciate the enormous power and influence of the  mass media can succeed in becoming responsible producers, directors, reporters, writers, announcers or performers. A recent national survey of broadcast education programs indicated that most are carefully designed to offer students a balanced practical and theoretical experience. The &quot;trade-school image&quot; of broadcast education is simply an unfortunate misconception. (RS)",

Furthermore, even though most warm body entries are not identified as such and in turn are evaluated as legitimate competition, competitors generally do not see widespread damage to overall competition. Also, while the warm body practice may be leaning toward &quot;overuse&quot; in certain events or at certain tournaments, and in rare  incidents may cause more harm than the intended good, student participants seem to have no major qualms or objections to warm bodies when used to meet qualifying requirements.

Unlike the traditional public speaking course, speech writing classes emphasize the preparation of the content of a speech over the delivery of the message. Students develop the ability to construct an eloquent and appropriate message that fits the oral style of a speech. Factors such as arrangement, idea or argument development, evidence, emotional and ethical appeals, transitions, as well as stylistic features like the use of metaphors, antithesis, and personification come to the forefront. Additionally, instructors are not limited to five minutes of harried evaluation on the day the student gives the speech. Careful  semester-long feedback is given to the students to indicate the strengths and weaknesses of their manuscripts. Speech writing classes complement the traditional public speaking class experience because they emphasize those elements of the public speaking process that tend to receive less attention due to the nature of a performance class.

Four learning principles and their implementations comprise the heart of this system including behavioral objectives, mastery learning, individual prescription, and modular flexibility. Additionally, computer-video technology has allowed instruction to be specifically tailored to the learner and has evidenced five immediate, important benefits: (1) it helped instructors individualize leaning experiences for students; (2) it helped provide multi-channel stimulation during the learning experience; (3) it helped orient the novice graduate teaching assistant and  part time instructors to course content and assignments; (4) it helped update experienced teaching assistants and full time faculty; and (5) it helped facilitate the creation of innovative teaching materials through the cooperation of students, teaching assistants, part time faculty, and senior staff.

Fuzziness of the image of communication as an academic discipline and faculty and administrative concerns about the degree of connectedness of the curriculum in relation to the liberal arts led to the creation of an interdisciplinary major firmly grounded in the liberal arts. In an effort to construct a unique, interdisciplinary communication major in keeping with the mission of this small liberal arts college, the administration appointed a committee of faculty from almost every academic discipline to enumerate realistic objectives and to implement the necessary changes. The committee became involved in extensive meetings,  research, formal and informal discussions, and sessions with a consultant. The result was a new communication major that contains seven communication courses and eight liberal arts courses, whereas before eleven speech/communication courses and only one liberal arts course were required. It is felt that this significantly changed blend of communication with the liberal arts will better prepare students for the job market or for graduate school.

Methodology involved formal and informal interviews with 20 secondary school assistant principals and their colleagues, direct observation, and document analysis. Factors for career mobility were identified; these include school and district norms, relationships with colleagues, career timing and planning, degree of risk-taking ability, and personal drive. The typology provides a framework for viewing the career orientation of assistant principals and the factors influencing their careers and also identifies four  emerging themes: organizational influence, site level, the principal, and personal responses. A recommendation is made for using the typology as a basis for structuring recruitment, training, selection, support, and organizational assessment practices. Two tables and one figure are included.

        "description":"School reform efforts may prove ephemeral without changes in the teaching occupation. The field lacks professional discretion, career advancement, and adequate compensation. As a result, the profession fails to attract enough educationally qualified people. Experiments in changing teacher work roles are being done to try and fill this shortage. These efforts fall into three types: (1) career ladder programs; (2) shared decision-making; and (3) altered school organizational structures. The first category divides teachers into four types: novice, classroom, enhanced classroom, and expert. With each &quot;rung&quot; comes increased responsibility and pay. Shared decision-making includes site-based management, in which significant educational decisions are made by teams of teachers and  administrators, and trust agreements that enable teachers to help develop written management decisions. The third type consists of instructional team teaching, charter schools (with &quot;charters&quot; allowing them to explore educational innovations), and small group models. Some schools incorporate multiple reforms as there is no one correct strategy. Targeting reforms at problem areas is of critical importance as well as considering the amount of responsibility teachers are willing to accept, the principal's role, and labor reconfigurations. Bureaucratic inertia can be a significant barrier; however, legislative action can serve as a catalyst for change and break many obstacles. (EJS)",

        "description":"After being placed on the back burner during the 1980s, school finance is again a major issue. In the 1970s, reliance on property taxes created school district disparities because of unequal tax bases. Legislative reforms enacted between 1971 and 1985 had the following characteristics: school finance formulas were revamped; the state role in school, special needs, and urban district funding was increased; and limitations restricting local tax rate control were imposed. One major policy issue left unresolved conerns whether the problem of inequities was in tax base variation (solved by guaranteed tax bases) or in nonmandated per pupil spending. State funding increased from 40 percent to 47 percent during the 1970s and then by 3 percent during the 1980s. Litigation that occurred  during the 1980s had three main characteristics: (1) some funding systems were found to be unconstitutional; (2) courts were more restrictive in fiscal disparity magnitudes; and (3) courts emphasized spending differences rather than just the differences between spending and wealth. Over the last two decades a healthy national economy and tax hikes have contributed to increased school funding. The main concern for the 1990s is deciding the best use to make of education revenues; this is best done by analyzing program tradeoffs, education as an investment, and effective allocation of revenue. Three inserts on Utah, California, and Arizona are included. They are: (1) &quot;School Finance in Arizona,&quot; by Robert Stout; (2) &quot;California School Finance,&quot; by Lawrence Picus; and (3) &quot;Perspective on the  Finance of Education in Utah,&quot; by Patrick Galvin.

A conclusion is that redesigning aspects of the work of teachers and the work environment in schools are two important means by which principals can enhance the appeal of teaching as a worthwhile vocational choice. Because teachers are a source of ideas, a recommendation is made for principals to listen, interpret, and respond to teachers' concerns.

Mailed questionnaires to 261 parish Louisiana Cooperative Extension home economics and agriculture agents yielded 240 returns, (a 92 percent response rate). Stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that desirability of movement (organizational commitment) is the strongest single predictor of intention to quit an organization. Another finding is that organizational commitment and job  satisfaction interact to form the desirability of movement component, suggesting that the strength of these variables should be determined before testing desirability of movement.

The relationship between the safety characteristics of Virginia's three-tiered speed limit system and school bus operation is examined to determine the optimal level of safety for school bus travel. Virginia allows the following three maximum speeds on its rural interstate highways: 45 mph for school buses, 55 mph for trucks, and 65 mph for other vehicles. Methodology involved a statute review of the 50 states; a literature review of speed and speed variance; a school bus safety survey; an accident data analysis; an attitude survey of 127 administrators, 487 drivers, and 81 special interest groups; and the development of a risk assessment model. Findings show that 45  states allow school buses to travel at higher speeds than Virginia does, and survey responses indicate that a majority favor raising speed limits for buses on rural, but not urban, interstate highways. A second factor was the presence of speed governors on the buses, which could contribute to an overall increase in travel speeds. A conclusion is that there are no compelling reasons to raise the maximum speed limits for school buses. Appendices include state statutes, accident data, questionnaires, sampling data, and opinion survey tables. Six figures and 21 tables are included. (10 references) (LMI)",

Interviews with Department of Education and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) officials indicate that the primary reasons for delays in issuing regulations are: (1) the volume of regulations; (2) lengthy periods required to obtain and respond to public comments; (3) complex legal and policy issues; and (4) concurrent program  duties. Appendix 1 identifies causes for and offices responsible for delays. Appendix 2 presents data on the number of calendar days taken to process 83 regulations within the Department of Education and OMB.

Findings indicate that more minority elementary students attend school outside their neighborhoods than do majority students and that minority students are assigned to higher choice schools less often than majority students. Overall, minority parents have a limited degree of informed choice in terms of information sources available to them.

A secondary focus is the development of a conceptual framework for creating local incentive programs. A survey of 1,319 selected school districts within the seven north central regional states--Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio--yielded a response rate of 78.9 percent. Findings indicate that incentive plans that focus on career status are used less frequently than those that stress professional enhancement and workplace conditions. Most plans correlate positively with district characteristics, but rural areas lack  incentive programs. A trend in new teacher roles is identified, with many districts considering career ladders, peer evaluation, salary increases commensurate with additional responsibilities, and mentor teacher programs. Appendices contain the survey instrument, the availability of selected incentives by regional states, and an updated report on state incentive programs. Fifteen tables and seven figures are included.

Following a brief summary of the origins of the middle school is a discussion of survey results regarding changes in rationale and specific preparation undertaken for introducing middle school organization and problems perceived in teacher education. Survey results are discussed as they relate to the following characteristics of good middle schools: (1) an interdisciplinary organization with a flexibly scheduled day; (2) an adequate guidance program including a team advisory plan; (3) a  full-scale exploratory program; (4) comprehensive curriculum that provides for students' personal development, acquisition of learning skills, and basic knowledge; (5) varied and effective age-appropriate methodology; and (6) continued orientation and articulation for students, parents, and teachers. Finally, conclusions are presented regarding the differences between schools containing grades 5-8 or 6-8 and those with grades 7 and 8 or 7-9. Included are four tables and five graphs.

America 2000 is described as having four major &quot;parts,&quot; and this booklet is organized around those parts: (1) Better and More Accountable Schools (improving the 110,000 existing schools, for today's students); (2) A New Generation of American Schools (bringing 535 new schools into existence by 1996, for tomorrow's students); (3) A Nation of Students (persuading yesterday's students/today's work force, to keep on learning); (4) Communities Where Learning Can Happen (identifying and designating committed &quot;America 2000 Communities,&quot;  willing to adopt the six national goals, develop a report card to measure their progress, and create and support one of the 535+ &quot;New American Schools&quot;). Some of the specific operational concepts involved in pursuing this strategy are: (1) &quot;New World Standards&quot; for what young Americans need to know, for each of the five core subjects (English, mathematics, science, geography, history); (2) &quot;American Achievement Tests,&quot; a new (voluntary) nationwide examination, based on the five core subjects; (3) &quot;Presidential Citations for Educational Excellence,&quot; awarded to high school students who do well on the achievement tests; (4) &quot;Presidential Achievement Scholarships,&quot; rewarding academic excellence among needy college/university students; (5) &quot;Merit Schools Program,&quot; rewarding schools that make  notable progress toward the six goals; (6) &quot;Governors' Academies for School Leaders&quot;; (7) &quot;Governors' Academies for Teachers&quot;; (8) Alternative Certification Systems for Teachers; (9) &quot;America 2000 Communities,&quot; designated by their governors; (10) The &quot;New American Schools Development Corporation,&quot; a new nonprofit organization, to be established by the business community, that will award contracts for 3-7 &quot;R&amp;D Teams,&quot; that will help communities create the new schools.

The majority (64 percent) of parents were satisfied with their child's educational program. Only 19 percent were dissatisfied. Parents of children with physical disabilities were the most satisfied (75 percent) while parents whose children had learning disabilities were the least satisfied (57 percent). Satisfaction rates also differed significantly based on the child's age and the rural/non-rural location with parents of younger children and residents of non-rural areas being more satisfied. The three most common concerns raised by parents were: (1) lack of personal attention/education (19 percent); (2)  not enough time spent with non-handicapped children (18 percent); and (3) inadequate teacher training (18 percent). The following facts are rated in the report: New York ranks highest among the states for the percentage of handicapped children segregated from other children; one-quarter of parents reported that recommended related services were not provided; 85 percent of parents attended their child's individualized education program meeting; and most disputes were resolved through informal means.

The workshop attempted to develop criteria for the structure and material selection of a handbook on training teachers for the mainstreaming of visually disabled students and to develop prototype components of the handbook. After an introductory chapter, chapters address: the planning of educational services; planning for implementation--educational services for  the visually disabled; development of an exemplar guide book structure for training teachers of the visually disabled; and seminar and workshop recommendations and suggestions. Recommendations include 14 addressed to member countries (e.g., formulation of definite policies to effect mass educational services to the disabled) and 8 recommendations addressed to international agencies.

Examples are given of speech disorders (phonological impairment, verbal dyspraxia, and dysarthria); language disorders (form errors, content errors, and use errors) and expressive and receptive language disorders. The concept of delay versus disorder is discussed. The process of handicap identification is described, noting conditions which must be ruled out and stressing the importance of  early identification and intervention. Current methods of therapy are described, and research is cited indicating that speech disorders may be outgrown by adolescence but that difficulties involving language use may persist into adulthood. Ongoing research involves investigation of differences in brain organization, investigation of the genetic connection, and the use of computers to train children with language impairments to process speech and language more rapidly. Seven organizations are listed to write or call for additional information. A chart of language milestones for ages one through six is also provided. (BRM)",

        "description":"This report describes the methodology used in an evaluation study to measure the effectiveness of the West End Special Education Local Plan Area's program for improving the transition of special needs students from secondary school into adult life. Goals of the San Bernardino, California, study included measuring students' quality of life upon their leaving school and annually thereafter; reporting on students' status; evaluating the effectiveness of the transition program based on this information; and recommending modifications to the program. The program's concept of quality of life is described, including such variables as occupational placement/maintenance, income level, continued education, community leisure, transportation, residential arrangements, advocacy arrangements,  medical/health needs, and personal/social adjustment. The research design is then explained, which involved collecting data from each student's Individual Education Plan; conducting a teacher exit questionnaire, a student exit questionnaire, and a student follow-up questionnaire; and computer analysis. Analysis of answers to the questionnaires suggests changes are needed in the questions asked due to inconsistencies or lack of clarity.

The purpose of the program was to expand the knowledge and skills of job developers in placing severely handicapped students in appropriate occupational and adult service agency situations. It offered seven job developer workshops related to increasing occupational opportunities available to Specialized Instructional Environment (SIE) students, organized 10 ongoing development committees, assisted 42% of the job developers in creating transition teams in their schools, produced a draft of a Job Developer's Handbook, and effected a positive change in workshop participants' level of knowledge. The program was not  successful in meeting objectives of providing turnkey training at the schools and enabling participants to develop Individualized Transition Plans. Program participants reported that the program was effective in helping to develop a consistent approach to facilitating and optimizing SIE students' transition into the work world. They commended the program for providing useful information, facilitating networking, and providing new resources. Participants suggested that workshops needed to provide more opportunities for discussion and should focus more directly on certain categories of students, students' transportation needs, and communication between developers of Individualized Education Programs and Individualized Transition Plans.

Emphasis is on how remedial teachers can integrate computers into their writing activities in resource rooms and classrooms. Based in three Massachusetts school districts, the project focused in the first year on intensive observation of 14 fourth-grade children as they wrote with word processors. The study found that the computer aided the child's sense of ownership, of being in control and \"authoring\" the writing, and of his/her involvement in writing. Teachers brought three different approaches to teaching writing with a computer: skill building; guided writing; and strategic. The strategic  approach, which provided students with strategies for managing the writing process, appeared to result in the highest level of student involvement and independent work. The skill building approach resulted in the least positive impact on students' involvement and sense of ownership. A model environment for teaching writing with computers is proposed, guided by such principles as the basic capability of learning-disabled children as \"authors\" and the use of writing strategies that keep the child in control.

Two contrasting teaching environments were identified: the compliance model, aimed at promoting students' mastery of specific writing conventions and writing structures/ideas presented by the teacher; and the facilitation model, aimed at helping students generate and expand ideas and structures of their own. Facilitative models which promote student involvement in composing were found to have three overall characteristics:  (1) teachers give children strategies for generating and organizing their own ideas; (2) teachers focus children's attention at the drafting stage on developing ideas in writing, rather than revising and editing, or on mastering the word processor; and (3) teachers reinforce children as capable thinkers and writers.

Results indicated that both the PVT and CPT were useful in differentiating between hyperactive and control preschoolers. Discriminant analyses revealed that for all combinations of data, the PVT produced significantly higher percentages of correct group classification than did the CPT. The PVT is seen to have potential in the identification of preschool children with  Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder.

In general, the use of technologies depended on each individual's unique background especially characteristics of the disability, characteristics of the person, psychosocial characteristics, as well as characteristics of the technology. Specifically, use of assistive technology devices (ATDs) was influenced by disability type, age at onset, degree of severity of disability, cognitive abilities and aptitude,  personality traits, judgment and preference, adjustment and outlook, exposure and opportunity, expectations, social support, design factors of the ATD, and service delivery. In addition, factors influencing the decision to use or forego an educational technology (ET) were identified and grouped into the following categories: characteristics and nature of the educational goal and purpose of use; characteristics of the ET; characteristics of the person; and psychosocial characteristics.

Subjects performed a task under two conditions, non-competitive and competitive with the results manipulated for success/failure outcome. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of four groups: success followed by success, success followed by failure, failure followed by success, and failure followed by failure. Results revealed  that outcome was a critical factor for most variables. Boys approached both tasks with more optimism and regarded the task as more difficult. The competitive condition elicited a diminished perception of ability for girls. Main effects for sex were obtained for efficacy, luck, difficulty and skill. Goal structure influenced some ratings. Unexpectedly, anxiety and effort ratings were non-significant for sex or success-failure outcomes.

        "description":"This study investigated young children's development of understanding of two written genre registers, story and information books, by analyzing 5-year-olds' repeated pretend readings of a typical text of each genre. Ten female and 10 male kindergarten students were read 3 books in each genre during their kindergarten year. At each child's reading session, both a storybook and an information book were read and the child was invited to &quot;pretend read&quot; each book after it was read. All sessions were audiotaped. Results indicate the children were successful in re-enacting both genres and were very sensitive to the co-referentiality versus co-classification features of the two books. The ability to sustain the distinctive textual feature of the respective genre in their readings appears  to be the same for each child. Book preference appeared to be unrelated, because most children preferred the information book. It is suggested that the preference for stories comes from pedagogy in early literacy, where story reading is emphasized, based on an unexamined ideology about young children's capacities in learning to use non-story language. Such pedagogy is seen as a possible barrier to children's full access to literacy. Transcripts of the children's &quot;readings&quot; are appended. (MSE)",

        "description":"This study investigated how Finnish-Swedish bilingual 10-year-olds (n=26) produce self-repairs in a narrative discourse, in comparison with monolingual agemates (n=10), in three respects: (1) types of repair; (2) number of repairs; and (3) the structural organization of repair. Altogether, 36 Finnish and 36 Swedish narratives were examined. The narratives were the retelling of a story based on a silent cartoon. The narratives were divided into six categories according to language and the model of instruction the child participated in (instruction in Finnish, in Swedish, or mostly in Swedish). Results show no differences between the groups in two of the investigated aspects: all informants used the same types of repair and all conformed to the main interruption rule. The bilingual  children had a higher proportion of error repairs and covert repairs in their weaker language. (MSE)",

After these observations, discussion focuses on the following four topics in relation to the paper: (1) the notions of a \"critical period\" and \"age-dependents effects\" in language acquisitions; (2) the notion of success in UG/L2 theory; (3) evidence from speech and speech perception; and (4) evidence from judgments of grammaticality.

The tasks included: (1) listening (without any subsequent comprehension testing); (2) speech shadowing (repeating a message in the same language while listening to it); and (3) simultaneous interpreting into the subjects' dominant language. It was predicted that if pupillary dilation adequately reflects average mental load, the simple listening task should be associated with the lowest dilation levels, the highly complex simultaneous interpreting task should be associated with the highest dilation levels, and the shadowing task should fall between the two. Subjects were nine native Finnish-speaking third- and  fourth-year students in the University of Turku (Finland), department of translation. All were highly fluent in English and had had a minimum of 1 year's training in simultaneous interpreting. Three English language texts were used as source texts. Pupillary responses were filmed. Dilation was associated with task difficulty as predicted. Mental load also appeared to be greatest at the beginning of each task. The measurement technique is seen as promising for describing interpreters' use of processing resources and the factors affecting real-time performance. (MSE)",

The report begins with an  overview of the linguistic situation of Zaire and of Kinshasa, particularly in public administration, justice, the army, the media, and education, and the colonial and post-colonial ideology. The report proceeds to describe the indoubill community, the origins and development of the language variety, monolingual and bilingual constructions, variations in form and spelling, variations in meaning, and borrowing.

The model is based on a theory that the activities and concerns of the wider contexts outside school are relocated for the purpose of school learning, and that the resulting instructional and regulative discourse both exist within pedagogical discourse. First, it is proposed that any teaching/learning episode is an instance of \"curriculum genre,\" having a distinctive schematic structure. Second, using a systemic functional grammar it is argued that it is possible to demonstrate the operation of two different registers in such a genre, with one relating to generation and maintenance of learning activity and the other  relating to lesson content. Third, it is suggested that the two registers do represent the two discourse types hypothesized, but with a slightly different relationship than that originally proposed in the theory.

        "description":"The study of systemic functional linguistics has been particularly relevant to the development of an educational linguistics. Recent theory has viewed language as a tool for mapping experience, with semantics and grammar treated as interrelated, not distinct. To the systemicist, one of the greatest theoretical challenges has been how to account for the manner in which text relates to context. The general response has been in the form of register theory. Systemicists tend to differ over their approach to register theory, principally in the issue of genres and how they are conceived. It is the view of recent Australian systemicists that the terms genre and register are not interchangeable and that both notions are necessary. Australian educational linguists have been seeking to  identify the genres valued in the culture, most notably for reading and writing, so they may be made overt objects of teaching and learning in school. A social theory is involved here, with consequences for a pedagogical theory. Genre theorists have been unfairly criticized. Systemic linguistics can assist in the study of educational processes and practices. A 35-item bibliography is included. (MSE)",

Nine 2-hour class sessions with 18 students were videotaped. During this period, using the theory of emancipatory education, the students developed a theater script based on an incident in a Central American country. In class, the students interviewed each other, discussed and debated news articles about the incident and related events, studied grammatical structures, contributed and discussed additional articles about oppression and the struggle for justice, and collectively wrote and read the script. The students became politically vocal and emotionally involved in the class discussions, and the class was reorganized in the  process. It is concluded from ethnographic analysis of the experience that by using the students' language, educators make statements about the political dimension of literacy, legitimating their experiences and allowing them to generate their own knowledge. In addition, through the use of theater, the students are allowed to critically analyze their world by examining issues of race, language, and culture alongside social, economic, and historical factors.

The main paper, by William Massey, presents a conceptual model explaining the forces driving up costs in academic departments of institutions of higher education. Under the model there have been increases in curriculum specialization and unsponsored research activity and declines in curriculum structure and the quality of undergraduate teaching. The paper recommends changes in structure, curriculum, and financial incentives. Indicators, discussed and illustrated with graphs, show that costs per student are going up; tuition and fees are rising faster than inflation; and state appropriations have not kept up with costs. Five  reasons for cost increases some familiar and some not, are: regulation and micro-management; \"cost disease\"; \"growth force\"; \"organizational slack\"; and \"output creep.\" Output creep is analyzed in terms of process dynamics, winners and losers, the ratchet relationship between teaching load and departmental research, destructuring the curriculum, and curriculum structure and cost. Four necessary conditions for change are identified: strategic thinking; incentives, recognition, rewards; individual and group empowerment; and firm constraints on available resources. State higher education executive officers are encouraged to stress growth by substitution; link incentives to substitution; empower institutions and avoid micro-management; and be as clear as possible about future resource  availability. A reaction by Robert Zemsky and a discussion are included. (DB)",

Some practices are discussed which, if adopted, could lead many more students to complete their Ph.D. expeditiously. A framework is presented that is intended to help the student and the supervisor to recognize when things are starting to go wrong in the progress towards completing the Ph.D. program. Some of the reasons are discussed, most particularly those associated with research methods, problems of completion time or failure to complete. Guidelines are suggested for each stage of progress towards a completed Ph.D. program, as well as ways to enable both the supervisor and the student to recognize whether the student  should continue on for the Ph.D. A checklist on good supervisory practice is provided, in question form, which reinforces the main points addressed in the report.

This report investigates those demands and suggests ways to facilitate the necessary adaptation. It outlines a cohesive vision of legal education which begins with a recommended pre-law curriculum; proceeds to the acquisition of doctrinal knowledge, analytical abilities, and research skills during law school; includes compulsory post-graduate training in practical skills in conjunction with undertaking private practice; and concludes with the mandatory continuation of legal education for all active bar members. In addition, the report focuses upon the following major issues in the administration of civil justice:  accelerating dispute resolution and lowering its cost; engendering a commitment to pro bono service; enhancing professional competence; and allaying public distrust. The report begins with an overview of the legal profession in New England, including the role of lawyers, profiles of law schools, and technology and the law. Next, critical issues involving the education and training of lawyers are discussed. Finally, critical issues involving legal administration of civil justice are examined, including legal fees, alternatives to litigation, lawyer-referral services, and small-claims reform. (GLR)",

The instrument consists of 56 items concerning presently occurring and normative economic development activities. Surveys (N=416) were mailed in the summer of 1989 (244 were eventually analyzed) to research administrators in higher education. Five factors accounting for 72.1% of the total variance emerged: (1) capacity building; (2) technology development; (3) research, analysis, evaluation; (4) human resource development; and (5) new business development. Each factor confirmed an underlying dimension theoretically included  during developmental stages of the instrument. Multiple analyses of variance were also computed indicating that HEEDS does reflect the theoretical dimensions underlying its construction. The instrument is recommended for use by higher education administrators in assessing their institutions' unique economic development strategies. Contains 186 references. (GLR)",

The outreach program, used by faculty to find student senior project material, is described along with the MET program's Autodesk Training Center which invites attenders to submit hands-on projects from their work to be done by MET senior design students. The report briefly discusses senior project courses, the resources available for senior projects, the university's Center for Community Services which handles the outreach program, faculty contacts, and the co-op program which is viewed as having been successful over the past four years  in placing interested students in local industry. It is noted that outreach programs, whether they be formal technology transfer programs, extension or other non-credit courses, or professional and scholarly interactions, can provide a multitude of real-life senior project ideas and financial support. Conversely, a strong senior project component of a MET program can add an important element to the department's outreach activities. (GLR)",

Prior to taking the first of three exams each student was asked how they expected to perform on the test. Before taking exams 2 and 3, they were questioned as to whether, based on the results of the first test, they did anything different in preparing for these exams. The results showed several differences between the two groups in relation to their preparation: of the eight changes in preparation strategies students had to choose from, the two groups differed in the use of five of them. Additionally,  task, luck, and effort were the preferred attributions for the psychology students, while knowledge and ability where preferred by sociology students. The study demonstrated that the use of psychology students as representatives of all undergraduates is not justifiable. Nine references. (GLR)",

An Oral Communication Program (OCP) designed to overcome potential problems was instituted at Radford University, Virginia. Results of the program's first year assessment suggest that OCPs, if appropriately planned and implemented can successfully and effectively enhance communication training in a cost-effective manner. Based on Radford's one year of operation and review of other OCPs the following recommendations are offered: (1) that quality control over communication-intensive courses should be provided; (2) that ongoing efforts should be maintained to secure funding from both public and  private agencies because of high costs involved in the implementation of such programs; (3) that a clearinghouse for the sharing of instructional materials aimed at serving increased number of clients without increasing staff should be established; and (4) that evaluation and assessment of all major activities should be carried out. OCPs carry several implications for the Speech Communication discipline. If successful, they could create additional demand for speech communication courses as more students become interested in improving their communication skills; and they could also increase awareness of faculty, students, administrators, and funding agencies of the importance and academic credibility of Speech Communication.

The use of English, which is a language college students from foreign countries have generally studied, is also a consideration. To meet the needs of foreign graduate and professional students, universities in the United States should emphasize skills, academic values, and learning strategies, rather than moral or religious  values; be open to foreign ideas; be expeditious; insist on good English and good English-language instruction; teach diversity of ethnic, linguistic, and religious backgrounds; respect, honor, and help preserve the language and culture of the foreign student; orient foreign students' studies to the type of work they will be doing in their native countries; develop international exchange programs for both students and faculty; deal with United States' own ethnicity and parochialism; and engage in worldwide research and research on international issues.

        "description":"This study was conducted to determine the different perceptions that potential students have concerning Cardinal Stritch College (Wisconsin) and to determine the usefulness of various sources of information about the college. Students (n=76) accepted as entering freshmen were surveyed in order to determine their perceptions of sources of information and college characteristics. Analysis of responses by sex, distance of college from home, American College Test scores, high school percentile rankings, and intended department of study revealed differences in perceptions according to respondent groupings. Major influences regarding a final decision on college attendance, decision time lines, and identification of competitive colleges are also presented. Among the findings were the  following: (1) in rating desirable college characteristics, students gave the highest mean ratings to quality of faculty, student/faculty ratio, career placement opportunities, general reputation, size of college, and variety of courses; and (2) influences on making a final decision included size of college, distance from home, general reputation, student/faculty ratio, career placement opportunities, and financial aid. A comment section lists the written responses of students concerning the admission process. Appendices contain a copy of the survey instrument and details about the response rates. (JDD)",

        "description":"As part of the congressionally mandated Higher Education Cost Study, a Higher Education Survey (HES) was conducted to provide reliable national estimates on the financial condition of higher education and the sources of tuition increases as perceived by financial officers at higher education institutions. Questionnaires were mailed to financial officials at 473 higher education institutions, excluding specialized schools (e.g. medical schools, dental schools, etc.). Results indicated that (1) respondents were more satisfied with their institutions' ability to control expenditure than with their ability to obtain revenue; (2) tuition and fees increased at a rate between two and three times the rate of inflation from 1980-1981 to 1988-1989. Public institutions identified the  greatest impact on tuition as coming from a combination of state tuition policy requirements and a decrease in the proportion of state/local funding. Private institutions regarded the greatest impact on tuition as coming from an increase in operating expenditures, increased institutional student aid, and a decrease in the proportion of Federal funding. Financial officials felt, however, that increases in tuition would have little effect on the number of students applying for admission to their institutions. Appended are 21 tables, technical notes, and the survey questionnaire. (LT)",

In institutions of higher education most costs are manageable and can be contained without jeopardizing key services. This can be achieved by designing and conducting a comprehensive cost-management study incorporating all aspects of an institution's support services. Such a study is based on the premise that there are four factors that determine success in achieving those goals: the university's strategy, the work it performs to pursue that strategy, the way in which the work is organized, and the actual results. An effective cost-management study should be holistic, long term,  strategic, focused on people and work, and alert to cost/benefit tradeoffs. It should include seven basic components: (1) project definition and planning; (2) fact-finding; (3) analysis; (4) recommendation development; (5) implementation planning; (6) implementation; and (7) communication. The result of the study should be a series of recommendations to improve services and reduce costs, and may be categorized as follows: structure, service definition and delivery, alternative funding, work procedures, operational redundancy, management organization and productivity.

        "description":"Data from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 were used to evaluate the contention that big-time college sports exploit athletes, denying them an education that will help them succeed after college. The sample (N=8,101) consisted of six comparison groups of students who attended four year colleges: varsity football and basketball players; varsity athletes in other sports; intramural sports participants; performing arts students; nonathletes; and a residual group who claimed to be active in athletics, identified by transcript entries for &quot;varsity&quot; or &quot;intercollegiate&quot; sports, whether the entries carried credits or not. Major findings of the study include the following: (1) varsity athletes, including football and basketball players complete the  bachelor's degree at a reasonable rate, but it takes them longer to do so than other groups, their grades are lower, and their curricula are less demanding; (2) ex-varsity football and basketball players do very well economically in the first decade of their worklives, whether or not they earned college degrees; and (3) at age 32, they had the highest rate of home ownership, the lowest rate of unemployment, but were the most likely to have lower status occupations than other groups. Results suggest that colleges do not exploit athletes but that the near term educational promises colleges make to students are not being kept. Includes 19 references and 17 tables. (LPT)",

Various lists are provided of the salient factors, and their explanations, that contribute to underachievement, as proposed by several authors on the subject. Among these factors are: too little or too much self-conficence; procrastination; fear of failure; lack of concentration; poor judgment; and wallowing in personal difficulties or excessive self-pity. Nine common reasons for \"failure\" or lack of success are also listed and include: lack of commitment; poor interpersonal skills; self-destructive behavior; poor management; and not being properly focused. Along  with these, additional self-defeating behaviors or cognitions are described, such as an inordinate use of alcohol and drugs, excessive escapism, burn-out, emotional disturbance, and a lack of coping skills. It is suggested that in studying underachievement, the role of personality and motivation should be emphasized more and that less reliance should be placed on I.Q. test scores and their relationship to achievement test scores or performance in the real world.

The programs are: (1) a doctoral program in children and youth studies; (2) a doctoral program specialty in vocational, technical, and occupational education; and (3) the postgraduate Snowmass Institutes on Strategic Planning and Management. Preceding the program descriptions is a review of data concerning what happens to students as they move through their required years of public schooling and into the workforce or pursue additional education. The data suggest a need for thinking strategically about education and training in an advanced technical society.  It is concluded that graduate programs tend to prepare a specialist as a service provider or a manager of a relatively small unit or establishment, when what is actually needed in today's society is a generalist perspective which spans numerous disciplines and applies across several diverse establishments.

The two primary questions to be answered were: (1) do faculty perceive their departments as promoting or restricting workplace democracy? and (2) are there significant differences among departments in their promotion or restriction of workplace democracy? Faculty members (N=273) in about half of the academic departments at the University of West Florida were mailed a 72-item survey, instrument (the Humanistic Climate Scale) of which 100 were returned and found usable for the study. The results of the study showed that there is a significant difference among  faculty in 14 departments regarding the perceived importance placed in their work environments on authentic self-disclosure and expression, on experiencing and exploring the work environment, on sharing with others, and on having a feeling of community and connection. The findings lead to the conclusion that departments at the University of West Florida are not all facilitating a humanistic work climate. Contains 25 references. (Author/GLR)",

Among other findings, the data reported show that: (1) low educational attainment levels prevail among southeastern Massachusetts residents in general; (2) the region has experienced comparatively high unemployment and low personal income; (3) half of the residents age 25 and over have not completed high  school; and (4) low high school completion rate affects the numbers of college educated workers in the region since New England higher education institutions and employers draw from a smaller base of high school graduates.

This monograph addresses the following budgeting concerns: environmental factors framing the state budget process for higher education; how these factors affect state budgeting; the primary elements of the state budget process for higher education; how the state higher education budget links resources with state objectives; accountability; costs, productivity, and quality; affordability; economic  development; minority and nontraditional students; independent higher education; and the implications of what we know about state-level budgeting for higher education. It is emphasized that all participants, from the state level agency to the department within an institution should be aware of the overall picture of state budgeting for higher education.

Based on structured interviews with participating teachers, the workshops are designed to support classroom teachers in observing their own students, collecting data about their work, and assessing their learning of Logo. Printouts of student Logo programs and a critical aspects checklist provide data for group discussion. The case study approach is used to help teachers in presenting data and research questions about a student's work. It is noted that an important outcome of the research seminars involves documenting the professional development of participating teachers. Personal experiences of one  participant are included, as are samples of students' Logo work, a student data template, and the critical aspects checklist. (21 references) (DB)",

        "description":"The results of four research studies conducted with subjects ranging in age and ability from elementary to graduate school students demonstrate that Logo programming environments can be instrumental in the development of five particular problem solving strategies: (1) subgoals formation; (2) forward chaining; (3) systematic trial and error; (4) alternative representation; and (5) analogy. In fact, computing environments may be uniquely conducive to the development of such skills, in that they can support quasi-concrete, malleable representations of abstract strategies that can help learners bridge the gap between concrete and formal understanding. Results also indicate, however, that problem solving strategies will not be developed through Logo programming alone, but rather must  be explicitly taught and practiced.

Findings also suggest that computer based instruction (CBI) classroom environments that are student-centered and cooperative, and promote individualized instruction, may change the perceived locus of control of the students involved to one in which they believe themselves to be more in control of their own learning. Analyses of interviews conducted with 197 teachers and 718  students participating in New York City's Computer Pilot Program for educationally disadvantaged students in grades 3-12, the standardized test scores of 3,795 students, and classroom observations support the efficacy of CBI for the delivery of basic skills remediation to these students. It is suggested that the success of the CBI programs evaluated is derived at least in part from the effects of the CAI environment on the students' perceptions of control over their own learning.

The model proposed addresses some mediating factors of the environment in which computers are used that affect learners' cognitive processes. The thesis is based on work conducted by a research group on large scale computer-based instructional systems to teach basic skills, instructional design for teaching computer implementations, and teaching problem solving using Logo. It is noted that: (1) programs are improved when they are structured to utilize other media in addition to computers; (2) computer training materials should support inferential  learning; and (3) within computer environments, mediated learning approaches are more effective methodologies than either strict instruction or discovery-oriented approaches.

The impact of these partnerships on distance learning is discussed, as well as the cooperative role of private enterprise in serving the public authority by addressing the educational needs at the local, regional, state, and national levels. Two models for public/private partnerships are proposed: the public/private cooperative and the private corporation as a stand-alone provider. The critical needs, as well as the barriers for implementing the models, are outlined. As a backdrop to this discussion, a historical perspective is established by reviewing the role of private entrepreneurship in technological innovation of distance learning  technology (telephone, broadcast and cable television, microcomputer, and satellite) and the influence of legislative and regulatory mandates in the educational application of these technologies. The paper concludes by hypothesizing the impact and challenges to the educational partnership on distance learning activities in the future. (25 references) (Author/DB)",

Responses pertaining to the impact of educational technology revealed that while most teachers believe that slides, films, and computers would be appropriate aids to teaching, only overhead projectors are used with any frequency by both teachers and students. Responses pertaining to staff development needs revealed that the major areas for  concentration are production of overhead projector materials and training in computer skills, computer usage, and computer/classroom integration. Finally, it was determined that several barriers would have to be removed before innovative instructional materials could be used appropriately, including lack of time available to develop innovations; ill-equipped facilities; scarcity of relevant hardware and software; and lack of knowledge, resources, and materials.

It is concluded that most students in most elementary and secondary  schools have access to computers, albeit limited access, and there exists a genuine desire to integrate computers into the classroom; however, computers are most frequently used for word processing and least used for integrated subject-matter instruction, and the course most frequently taught using computers is computer literacy.

A study of the use of the system in the first year revealed that: (1) only one-third of the students logged on extensively; (2) the primary values of the medium were increased communication, a reduced sense of isolation, and direct feedback from tutors to the central staff and to students; and (3) while most communications were banal in content, the practical-help conference was successful. Changes were made in the course after the first year, the success of the changes was evaluated, and it was concluded that the use of teleconferencing  as a tutorial rather than as a course delivery medium was beginning to exploit its educational potential. Areas of improvement in the second year were a decrease in the number of misplaced, irrelevant, or inappropriate messages; an increase in the number of students keeping up-to-date with messages; efficient management of queries, requests, and course news; and an increase in the amount of interactive discussion of course issues. Ongoing problems with the use of the computer conferencing medium include student passivity, technological limitations, and the necessity for teaching practical work at a distance. (DB)",

Competent systems are based on models known as influence diagrams, which graphically capture a domain's basic objects and their interrelationships. Among the benefits offered by influence diagrams is their underlying psychological and mathematical validity. For most users, the salient feature of influence diagram modeling is the precision and clarity that it forces on both the domain expert providing information and the system designer building the model. This paper presents a user-oriented perspective of a vertical approach to system design.

Initially, schools developed computer studies as a separate area of study instead of promoting the use of computers across the curriculum, an approach supported by the Micro-electronics Education Programme (MEP). The debate between these two approaches involved parents, pupils, and employers as well as MEP experts and inservice teacher educators. In 1987, upon realizing that the bulk of information technology resources in schools had been used only for students 16 years or older who were taking General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) classes, the National Curriculum demanded an information  technology dimension in each of the core subjects and a cross-curricular approach to information technology competence. Despite the good intentions of such educational changes, it remains to be seen if this new strategy can succeed in its aim to make information technology competence a natural part of every pupil's repertoire.

        "description":"The purpose of this report is to provide both formative and summative results concerning the 1990 academic year operation of the Eastern Iowa Community College District's (EICCD) Televised Interactive Education (TIE) system. The TIE system is composed of a two-way microwave connection whereby two colleges and one university are able to produce and transmit a live video and audio signal from their interactive television classrooms, thus allowing instructors and students at distant sites to interact actively. Six main measures are reported: (1) system use, which identifies the major uses of the system in hours for EICCD instruction, for other local college usage, and for administrative uses; (2) class enrollments, which notes the number of students enrolled in TIE classes both on  site and at remote sites; (3) average grade per site, which examines final grades for each TIE class and grade point averages; (4) student evaluation of the TIE system, completed at midterm and end of term; (5) evaluation of students who withdrew from TIE classes; and (6) instructor evaluation. Also included are recommendations arising from the study regarding the technical aspects of the system, staff development, and necessary support systems. The appendices include all evaluation forms used in the study as well as a telephone survey. (DB)",

The case studies were conducted in an effort to gauge the types of computer usage, instructional problems using computers, the impact of computer assisted instruction on student learning, the role of computers in higher education, issues involved in computerizing a campus, and a host of other related issues. All interviews were videotaped and diverse perspectives were compiled and edited  into a coherent summary. This transcript examines the changing character of instruction in writing, foreign languages, natural and social sciences, mathematics, and professional training, as well as the costs of computing and providing computing resources.

        "description":"Broadcasters, television engineers and the production industry have encountered many problems with diverse television standards since the introduction of color television. With the advent of high definition television (HDTV), the chance to have a common production standard for international exchange of programs and technical information has returned once again. However, this seems to be impossible with HDTV developers in Japan, Europe, and the United States supporting different production standards. International cooperation would be a means of reaching a single world production standard for HDTV. Such cooperation would reduce the high costs of reinventing the systems and would unite many-sided experts and resources to search for the best standard. The payoff of this cooperation  would benefit all parties as they could share a larger market and eliminate the costs of converting from one system to another. Licensing agreements, worldwide investment, research and development, and the formation of consortia are examples of cooperative activities that would lead to this end. (16 references) (DB)",

        "description":"A majority of today's college students face circumstances that make it difficult to study full time on campus. They are usually 25 years old or older and may have jobs, children, or impairments to their mobility that prevent them from attending college easily; however, there are ways in which colleges and universities can help these students by changing the uses of educational resources. For example: (1) direct instruction, usually conveyed by lectures and textbooks, may be in the form of correspondence materials and video, or telecourses; (2) live conversation with faculty and peers may take place through audio conferencing, involving only sound, or through audiographic conferencing where visuals may be added through a computer link; (3) other exchanges of ideas and materials  with faculty and peers can take place over electronic mail, computer conferencing, fax machine, and voice mail; and (4) learning by doing can be emphasized through online library services, computer assisted design programs, word processors, statistical packages, and other technology-based resources. The evolving college is an institution that is more open to the outer world with shared resources and services, and promotes collaboration between faculty, students, and institutions.

        "description":"Since 1987 Hezel Associates has studied how each of the 50 states is or is not coordinating the planning of technology, especially the use of telecommunications for education and related activities. The study documented telecommunications activities of state departments of education and higher education, boards of regents, boards of vocational and technical education, state universities that have formed pockets of technology within states. Based on this research, it is recommended that policy issues concerning technology be formed at the same time that uses in educational technology are being developed. Some of the policy issues to be considered are: (1) the locus of planning, e.g., who establishes technological goals for the classroom; (2) economics and funding, specifically,  different sources of funding, availability of funding, and the ways in which funds may be used; (3) technology planning, in which information about the availability and practicality of different technologies is considered; (4) state policy, which is particularly important because of the impact it has on agencies and institutions dependent on state funding; (5) governance and development of guidelines for educational technology; (6) system management, which determines the uses of, entrance into, and access to a system; (7) instructional programming; (8) faculty involvement in the planning and implementation of technologies; and (9) pedagogy and impact on teaching and learning. It is concluded that policy priorities can be established after consideration of these issues, and a coherent  approach to educational technology may be developed. (20 references) (DB)",

        "description":"In the past, computing facilities at the Open University in the United Kingdom have been provided through terminals and modems in local study centers. A new policy to implement home computer use will rely on student owned microcomputers. While this policy reflects a commitment to increasing the use of computers as distance education aids, it may have a deleterious effect on the university's female student population. Research shows that Open University female students are less likely to have access to a computer than male students. Also, women are less likely to register for courses that contain a compulsory computing component. Such inequality in the face of commitment to a sophisticated new technology may have serious ramifications on the success rates of women students. (7  references) (DB)",

What are the academic credentials and experience of those who evaluate unsolicited manuscripts? and What criteria are used to evaluate the quality of unsolicited manuscripts? Their replies indicate that: (1) each clearinghouse uses the services of professional experts with advanced degrees and experience in the particular areas of education which it is responsible for covering to review the manuscripts it receives; (2) reviewers  follow an explicit and impressive set of criteria to decide which documents to include in the database; (3) the impressive dissemination system of the ERIC database includes microfilming the entire document, abstracts printed in a monthly periodical, the capability for Boolean searches of the database through online and CD-ROM systems, and depositories of the microfiche collection throughout the United States and several other nations; and (4) the ERIC system has demonstrated a commitment to provide useful information to the professional educator in colleges and universities, as well as to the teacher, administrator, and other practitioners in the K-12 school systems.

Several scholars of gender who conduct research in various disciplines are mentioned, and their areas of work are briefly outlined: Kate Millett, Shulamith Firestone, Simone de Beauvoir, Anne Oakley, Nancy Chodorow, Dorothy Dinnerstein, and Carol Gilligan. Points about gender-balancing the curriculum, written by Peggy Macintosh, Associate Director of the Wellesley College Center for Research on Women, are summarized: (1) a candidate for a higher education position who is incompetent in scholarship on women is a poor candidate for several decades of tenure; (2) the time is past for the objection that Women's Studies is political; a curriculum that  leaves women out is also highly politicized; and (3) an inclusive curriculum stands to benefit, and to change, men as well as women. She argues that our collective human survival depends on different processes from the ones set in motion in the past, and that no investment that colleges and universities can now make bears more importantly on both individual and collective human futures than does that of transforming the curriculum.

With the assistance of Developmental Services Center (DSC) staff, 14 adults with mental retardation were selected as subjects. These subjects were randomly divided into three groups in which varying levels of bibliographic instruction were administered, ranging from no instruction at all (control group) to a library tour and two instruction sessions that included an introduction to the library's various nonprint services. All three groups  participated in both a pre-test, which was designed to test their knowledge of library resources, and a post-test. Analyses of the data suggest that there was more appropriate use of the library by the participants after bibliographic instruction, and that neither IQ nor proximity to the library appeared to be a significant factor in determining library usage. Appendices, which make up more than half or he paper, include the pretest questions; an outline of the presentation to the Champaign Public Library staff; data on library card use by the research subjects; their responses to the pretest and posttest questions; and an annotated bibliography.

Other strategies that are suggested to strengthen preservation education are the training of librarians through apprenticeships and internships, financial support for Ph.D. candidates, the targeting of specific groups for whom preservation education should  be identified (teachers, preservation administrators, library and archives professionals), and revised school curricula.

Information literacy, which has been defined as the ability to effectively access and evaluate information for a specific need, requires certain integral skills, including the ability to evaluate information or to plan a search strategy. As a result of the introduction of computerized circulation systems, collection databases, online database services, and computer-assisted instruction, library media centers have developed into school information centers. Through the cooperation of teachers and administrators, library media specialists are able to integrate  information skills into the curriculum, and to evaluate information about the curriculum. It can be seen that information literacy efforts are well underway. Several states in the United States have integrated library instruction into their curriculums, and the American Federation of Information Processing Societies (AFIPS) has prepared a detailed curriculum to teach information skills to secondary school students. Educators today realize that information literacy can only benefit society--and information illiteracy can cause real harm to individuals and to society. (MAB)",

        "author":["Schamber, Linda"],
        "description":"Basic options for the automation of management functions in the school library media center are the circulation system, the online catalog, the acquisitions system, and the serials check-in. In order to select the most appropriate system, library media specialists must: (1) research both the library's needs and the technologies available, and (2) develop plans to guide decisions about purchases, training for staff, and maintenance. The findings of this research will be used to develop detailed plans and budgets that include training for the media specialist and the costs of hardware, software, and databases. Since few integrated systems exist which incorporate all of the library's automated functions, a decision will have to be made whether to install two or more limited  integrated systems (such as catalog/circulation and acquisitions/serial check-in) or four separate systems. In either case, compatibility--i.e., the ability to transfer data between systems--is an important feature to be considered. Another major concern is the entry of data in the new system, particularly catalog and circulation data. In addition, retrospective conversion of existing catalog records to machine-readable form can be expensive and time-consuming, whether performed on-site or externally by a vendor. The impacts of automation are both immediate and long-term. School library media centers which have automated their management operations have found that students and faculty have been able to access information more easily and that routine tasks can now be performed more  quickly. However, these same library media centers must be prepared to handle a lack of standardization at various access levels, and to learn to work on upgraded software and hardware as they become available.

The school library media center is the ideal place for students to learn how to develop metacognitive strategies; that is, they can learn how to connect new information to former knowledge, deliberately select thinking strategies, and plan, monitor, and evaluate these thinking processes. There are six basic strategies for developing metacognitive behaviors in students: (1) they must consciously identify what they &quot;know&quot; as opposed to &quot;what they don't know&quot;; (2) they must then develop a thinking vocabulary so that they can verbally describe their thinking processes; (3) they should keep a thinking journal or  learning log in which they reflect upon their learning processes; (4) they must also learn how to assume responsibility for regulating their learning activities, including estimating time requirements, organizing materials and scheduling the procedures necessary to complete an activity (the media center's resources lend themselves quite well to this task); (5) they must learn how to review and evaluate these strategies as either successful or inappropriate; and (6) they must participate in guided self-evaluation through individual conferences and checklists focusing on the thinking process. Metacognitive environments must be established in schools if teachers and media specialists are to be able to encourage students' development of problem-solving and learning skills.

Issues and implications for teachers, students, researchers, and librarians are suggested and the emergence of the electronic network as a general communication and research tool is described. Developments in electronic communications and computing since the late 1960s are reviewed, including the development of such networks as ARPANET, NSFNET, Internet, BITNET, CSNET, and CREN. Implementation of the National High Performance Computing Act of 1990 would provide for: (1) the involvement of science agencies and national libraries in the development of resources for the NREN; (2) the linking of federal and industrial laboratories, educational institutions, and  libraries; (3) the development of electronic information resources and services; and (4) the development of supercomputers and advanced software to support scientific and engineering research. However, before such a network can be instituted, several issues need to be resolved, including how to determine costs and management policies, guarantee universal access, provide user support and training, overcome organizational resistance to networking, maintain quality control of information resources, and adapt network services to research and education norms. New initiatives for network research, services, and advocacy have emerged as a result of growing support for national networking; these include the Corporation for National Research Initiatives, Reference Point, the Coalition for  Networked Information, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. One common goal of these initiatives, one that educators and librarians share, is the desire to shape the future of national networking in such a way that its benefits are made available to a broad range of users.

Two fundamental issues that affect productivity are access and control; two major strategies for improving productivity are cooperation and education. Expanding information services can foster innovation and development among their users--government agencies, industries, libraries, and information centers that disseminate information to a broader spectrum--which can play a vital role in aiding productivity. Yet, these same entities that provide access to information must, at times, limit access to information. The issue of control extends to U.S. policy makers, who  must decide whether the release of certain technical and scientific information developed by the United States would undercut U.S. competition globally or threaten national security. The protection of intellectual property rights is yet another issue of control. It seems that information providers must distinguish between what information falls into the realm of the private (classified information) and public (unclassified) domains. The concept of the &quot;virtual library&quot;--whereby the world's knowledge is accessible to anyone sitting at a desktop workstation--is becoming closer to a reality through recently proposed federal legislation, which would, if passed, establish a network to link government, industry, business, and university resources. However, the establishment of such networks  will be inappropriate if educators fail to foster the development of information skills in students. (12 references) (MAB)",

In addition to this, public education is also experiencing funding shortages. Distance education seems to provide a solution for both of these problems as it offers an equitable way to distribute educational resources, while at the same time making instruction cost-effective. School library media specialists can contribute to developing distance education programs through their roles as instructional consultant, information specialist, teacher, and technological coordinator. They can help to match information resources to course objectives, teaching and learning styles, and subject content to facilitate more creative thinking and critical  analysis among students. It is the lack of involvement of individuals, not the course structure, that is the main obstacle to effective distance education programs. The success of a distance education program depends upon the ability of library media specialists to network with teachers, students, administrators, technical experts, and database vendors. An example of a successful program can be seen in the Bay Area (Wisconsin) Public School District. (References and additional readings are provided.) (MAB)",

        "description":"Private liberal arts junior colleges reached their peak during the 1940's, when nearly 350 of them provided an educational alternative for over 100,000 students nationwide. In 1989, only 89 private two-year institutions were in existence, accounting for less than 1% of the nation's two-year college students. Following the second World War, several factors combined to stem the expansion of private junior colleges including the introduction and growing strength of public community colleges, the demands of World War II veterans for educational opportunities, and financial constraints brought on by small enrollments. While enrollments have declined significantly, the Association of American Colleges in 1975 stressed the importance of maintaining a system of private education,  highlighting its ability to add diversity, provide leadership, offer competition to the public system and save the taxpayers money. The most serious threats to private junior colleges are competition for students from public community colleges and financial constraints. Proposals to solve these problems include establishing cooperative programs to share resources with local community colleges, employment of part-time faculty, and more heterogeneous recruitment and curriculum development, particularly in the church-related colleges. The potential for private junior colleges to survive into the 21st century depends upon their ability to effectively market their strengths, expand their enrollment bases, operate in a fiscally responsible manner, and maintain strong leadership and a committed  faculty.

        "description":"In 1990, a survey was conducted of all full-time humanities and social sciences faculty at eight community colleges in the Virginia Community College System (VCCS). The study collected demographic data and examined the relationship between aging (both an individual's chronological age and length of time in the system) and job satisfaction through scaled questions in which faculty rated their institutional environment and their morale. A final section of the questionnaire sought open-ended responses. From among the 76 faculty completing usable questionnaires, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) the average faculty age was 48 years; (2) only 16 faculty had been teaching for less than 10 years with nearly half of respondents (referred to as &quot;veterans&quot;) having taught in the  VCCS for 15 to 20 years; (3) among veteran faculty (n=37), 11 found the intellectual climate &quot;poor,&quot; while 12 rated it as only &quot;fair&quot;; (4) 27 of the 15- to 20-year veteran faculty rated the &quot;quality of life at their institution&quot; as &quot;poor&quot; or &quot;fair,&quot; while four of the six faculty having worked over 20 years gave this category a &quot;poor&quot; rating; (5) the majority of veteran faculty reported that professional development activities were inadequate to meet their needs, although a similar percentage indicated that they would &quot;still become community college teachers if they had to do it over again&quot;; and (6) 31 of the 37 veteran faculty reported being strongly committed to the community college mission. A comparative analysis of faculty responses from Piedmont Virginia Community College with that  of the system as a whole, and the survey instrument are included. (JMC)",

        "author":["Bushnell, Jay R."],
        "description":"In fall 1984, a program was implemented at Daytona Beach Community College (Florida) with the dual purpose of integrating subject material between courses and establishing a close community of learners to cooperate in the mastery of subject matter. In the fall semester, participating students enroll in a block of three courses; English I, Humanities I, and Psychology of Adjustment. For the winter term, the block courses are English II, Humanities II, and General Psychology. The courses are all team taught by the instructors from each discipline, and a central theme is used each semester around which academic inquiry and discussion is centered. As a dialogic instrument and a personality measure, the Myers-Briggs Type Inventory (MBTI) is administered in the fall to help students  assess their own strengths and weaknesses, as well as to help faculty evaluate and modify their teaching styles. The test classifies students and teachers as Sensing versus Intuitive, and Feeling versus Thinking. A study using the MBTI results over a 6-year period was conducted to determine whether different personality types among students and teachers led to different academic success rates. Personality type did not seem to correlate significantly with retention rates or student grades. In general, though, the program format produced higher overall student successes (only 23% not succeeding) and has created a collegial interactive atmosphere which has been a very important and valued part of the program for both teachers and students. The paper includes a detailed literature review of  the different characteristics associated with each personality type. (PAA)",

The five major steps in the planning process are: information gathering, identifying trends affecting CCC, setting goals and objectives, relating planning to the budget, and reporting outcomes. This five-part 1990-91 planning report for CCC describes the planning process; reviews the committees and personnel involved in the process; presents the planning agenda; examines 10 trends affecting the college and lists the college's goals for addressing  these trends; and describes CCC's objectives for 1990-91 in the areas of administration, affirmative action, continuing education, planning and development, the president's staff, student services, and instruction. For each of these categories, the related trends and goals from the preceding section are identified. Among the college's 1990-91 objectives are the following: (1) develop partnership with business and industry; (2) engage in proactive recruitment of underrepresented groups among the faculty; (3) enlarge the Adult Basic Education program and include low levels of literacy; (4) evaluate the image of the college in the community; (5) design and implement new staff development programs; (6) expand the 2 + 2 program to all public feeder schools; (7) develop self-paced,  open-entry/open-exit, competency based programs; and (8) employ team teaching approaches whenever possible.

        "description":"In Maryland, Catonsville Community College's (CCC) 1990-91 marketing plan deals with the community's perceptions of the institution and strategies to improve CCC's image. Both the 1989-90 and 1990-91 plans targeted the same markets for special recruitment strategies; i.e., high school graduates with transfer plans, part-time adult students, minority students, and high school students with technical or career program interests. The 1990-91 plan sets forth seven goals, offers a rationale for each goal, and indicates tactics used to achieve the goal. Goal 1 deals with a community research instrument to gather data for image improvement. Goal 2 is concerned with continuing the external image-building process through the improvement of existing programs and services. Goal 3 involves  increasing college participation in marketing efforts. Plans for the recruitment of the target markets are set forth in the remaining goals. These goals and tactics include the following: (1) increase transfer students' awareness of program quality by expanding CCC's promotional campaign, using personal testimonials of successful graduates in recruitment materials, and publicizing scholarship recipients in local newspapers; (2) increase minority students' awareness of the benefits of a college education by promoting minority scholarship opportunities, creating television spots highlighting student diversity at CCC, and committing resources to develop a minority student recruitment program; (3) increase adult students' awareness of CCC through an open house for parents, informing local  business of the benefits of CCC-provided employee training, and initiating a direct mail campaign for applicants who never registered; and (4) inform potential students of technical training opportunities at CCC by working with the Western School of Technology, holding an open house, and sending lecturers to feeder high schools.

The \"Seven Principles for Good Practices in Undergraduate Teaching\" instrument was completed by 106 employees, split almost evenly between teaching staff and non-teaching staff. Study findings included the following: (1) with respect to college climate, only 20.8% of the respondents indicated that there were \"often\" functions on campus when students and faculty got together informally, and only 33.1% felt that administrators \"often\" recognized faculty and student contributions to institutional policies and practices; (2) many  statements in the Academic Practices section received high proportions of \"don't know/does not apply\" responses, including statements related to comparative salary levels for male and female staff, limitations on the number of incompletes a student may carry, and institutional assessment of changes in students' knowledge and competence during their attendance; (3) the section on Curriculum revealed that CCC does not have many instances of independent study, contract learning, mastery learning, cooperative work programs, or internships; (4) the Academic and Student Support Services section had the largest number of statements with many \"don't know/does not apply\" responses, including statements dealing with orientation, financial aid, student activities, and advisement; (5) the largest  perceived problem in the Facilities area was parking; and (6) the responses of teaching and non-teaching staff were similar on 53 of 66 statements.

        "description":"Growing institutional concern for excellence coupled with legislative mandates calling for accountability have prompted many colleges to emphasize student outcomes when evaluating and designing courses and programs. A careful review of the accountability literature, however, suggests that continuing education courses and students, in spite of their increasing numbers, have been largely ignored. Collecting student outcomes data for non-credit courses can help an institution: (1) improve an area of college operations that has been expanding significantly in recent years; (2) establish or enhance routine data collection concerning continuing education; (3) document the contribution of continuing education to economic development; (4) enhance the public image of continuing education;  (5) respond fully to accountability mandates; and (6) preserve tax-revenue support for continuing education. Among the obstacles to assessing student outcomes in continuing education courses are that such courses may not be integrated into the college's routine research function, or that program administrators may be used to considerable autonomy and therefore resist outside efforts at assessment or change. Indicators which can be used to measure learning outcomes include student attendance and course completion rates, subsequent student employment, student and employer satisfaction, and student pursuit of further education. Information systems containing data on course content, student evaluation of courses, follow-up surveys, and employment records can serve as useful assessment tools.  A literature review and a 19-item bibliography are included. (GFW)",

        "description":"Designed to identify and describe the key challenges facing community colleges as a result of major changes in the social, economic, and demographic make-up of students and service areas, this paper combines information gathered from two national environmental scanning groups, a review of the literature, and input from educational professionals. The 10 community college issues discussed are as follows: (1) increasingly diverse service areas and student populations; (2) growing numbers of academically underprepared students; (3) an unclear workforce agenda for the information age; (4) the need to ensure and provide evidence of institutional effectiveness; (5) the need to improve college governance by developing boards of trustees that have vision and purpose; and are goal-driven,  unified, supported by inspired leadership, and politically astute; (6) the need to promote organizational wellness through environmental scanning, broadened redefinition of college purpose, emphasis on quality, and concern for employee and public opinions; (7) an impending faculty shortage and the aging of the existing faculty; (8) the need for a resurgence of campus collegiality; (9) the impact of external forces, including business people, lay citizens, and legislators, on college governance and decision making; and (10) the role of ethics in institutional management and curriculum. Each topic section concludes with a series of specific questions to initiate further discussion. (GFW)",

        "description":"In 1989, the Eastern Iowa Community College District (EICCD) undertook a project to develop a collective image of what the community college should be in the coming century. The reasons for seeking this &quot;shared vision&quot; were to create institutional focus, foster commitment, build communication, and reaffirm the college's mission and beliefs statement. The efforts to develop a shared vision, termed the &quot;2020 Vision Process,&quot; involved a series of all-day, in-service meetings, administrative retreats, a survey of the academic community, and the development of a series of environmental impact statements focusing on factors likely to affect the college in coming years. The process involved every college employee and resulted in the revision of the EICCD's Mission and Belief Statements,  the formulation of new goals and objectives, and the creation of specific implementation strategies to obtain the objectives. Among the new institutional goals identified were the following: (1) develop and maintain administrative and staff support dedicated to student learning; (2) recruit and retain students from diverse backgrounds; (3) encourage initiative, risk-taking, and individual responsibility; and (4) become an active partner in defining and addressing community and business needs. Detailed appendixes provide definitions of the functional areas of the community college; goal statements in the areas of instruction, student services, administration, research and planning, and community services; the Vision 2020 survey instrument; and the EICCD's Belief Statements.

The purpose of the study was to assist program planners in understanding the motivations, enrollment and viewing patterns, demographics, and goals of students who enroll in telecourses. Survey responses were obtained from 53% of the 731 students enrolled in telecourses in FY 1990, although not all classes were surveyed and no efforts were made to obtain a random sample. Where relevant, comparisons were made with survey responses from FY 1989. Study findings included the following: (1) a majority of respondents to the telecourse survey were either female (73%), under age 30 (57%), white (82%), or employed full-time (73%); (2) over half of telecourse  enrollees each semester were new to the concept of telecourses, and over half were taking other courses at the time; (3) 52% of the respondents indicated that their primary goal in taking a telecourse was to earn credits to transfer to a four-year institution; (4) 96% had a video cassette recorder at home, and 56% used it to record classes; (5) 64% said they would be interested in using a modem to communicate with their on-campus instructor; (6) a majority of enrollees expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the courses and indicated they would enroll in another telecourse; and (7) as was true in FY 1989, the \"presentation of material\" category received the lowest overall satisfaction rating by respondents.

The goal of ES is the implementation of proactive, anticipatory policies that will be robust under a variety of futures. This two-part report provides an introduction to ES and presents the results of a collaborative business needs assessment conducted by Prince George's Community College (PGCC) in Maryland. Part 1 describes: the role of ES activities in the college setting; the relationship of ES and strategic planning; two alternate approaches to ES (the committee approach and the institutional research and planning model); six  environmental variables which should be monitored in ES (demographic, economic, legal-political, organizational-competitive, socio-cultural, and technological); data and information sources for ES (including local and national sources); and dissemination of ES findings. Part two describes a study conducted by PGCC to assess area employee educational and training needs through a mail survey of area businesses. Among the findings reported (from 182 business responding for a 4% survey response rate) are the following: (1) employee oral communications, writing skills, and interpersonal relations were most in need of improvement; (2) over one-third of respondents indicated a need for improved employee skills in collections/accounts receivable and developing marketing plans; and (3) most  employers preferred open enrollment courses offered at existing college locations.

        "description":"In response to newly revised enrollment projections, the defeat in November 1990 of a $450 million higher education bond issue (Proposition 143), and the California Governor's proposed 1991-92 budget, this report provides an update on the long-range planning activities of the California Postsecondary Education Commission and its segments. The introduction to the report reiterates the three primary recommendations of the Commission outlined in previous versions of the long-range plan. These recommendations state that increasing enrollments must be anticipated for in all segments of higher education with appropriate plans for expansion, that policy assumptions contained in the Master Plan (such as qualified student access and low fees) must remain in place, and that the segmental  governing boards must lay the groundwork for balancing competing educational goals in the face of budget constraints. Following the introduction, section 1 presents the status of long-range planning activities for each of the state's three public higher education segments (the University of California, the California State University, and the California Community Colleges). Section 2 provides enrollment projections, with specific data covering the community colleges for the years 1989-90 through 2005-06. Report conclusions include the following: (1) budget deficit figures indicate that California higher education will not be able to enroll the thousands of additional students will be seeking enrollment during the next 15 years; (2) given these same budget figures, each of the three  postsecondary education segments will have difficulty in serving students already enrolled; and (3) the uncertainty of current conditions will severely hamper planning activities.

The mission of LCC is to meet the needs of adults throughout their lives by providing excellent learning opportunities through high quality programs and services. Demand for these programs at the college is determined by three factors: employment opportunities for graduates; career interests of potential graduates; and training initiatives promoted by sponsoring agencies and governments. While the college's overall program mix is diverse, there are a number of unique college programs including irrigation technology, farm financial management, and engineering design and drafting  technology. Recently, five substantial planning activities have been initiated to address aspects of the college's continued development. In addition, four trends and issues have been identified by college constituencies as most likely to affect college operations in the 1990s: (1) the influence of learners; (2) the type of educational/training services which will be required during the 1990's; (3) the content and quality of instruction available during the 1990s; (4) and the availability of financial resources and the appropriate human and physical resources during the 1990's. Inspired by its diversity, LCC foresees development as client-centered, building on strengths, extending programs, and pursuing new technologies. From these foundations, the college anticipates increased  enrollments, a current staff, the maintenance of facilities, increased funding, and a change in mandate.

In this paper, a summary of the research findings on the latchkey group is followed by a review of what is known about children in arrangements that are supervised by adults. Methodological limitations and disparate results preclude the drawing of definitive conclusions from the studies. In spite of this, the continued proliferation of school-age programs makes it imperative that current knowledge of child development and the effects of child care arrangements be used to define and measure the indicators of quality child care for school-age  children. Sections concern: (1) research on school-age children; (2) children in self-care; (3) programs for children in self-care; (4) school-age child care programs; (5) definitions of program quality in school-age child care; and (6) lessons for program evaluation, including methodological issues and suggestions for future research.

        "description":"This publication on the New South Wales' Basic Skills Testing Program (BSTP) describes the development of the program's tests, the analysis of students' results, and the communication of results to parents, teachers, and schools. In BSTP tests, basic skills are defined not as low-level, rudimentary survival skills, but as major areas of learning that have a central role in the school curriculum. Part I of the book describes the skills typical of students performing at each of five skill levels in each of five areas of learning (Reading, Language, Number, Measurement, and Space) on the tests. Part II shows how different subgroups of students performed on the tests. Results on each aspect of literacy and numeracy are reported separately for girls and boys, students with  non-English-speaking backgrounds, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, and several age groupings. Part III explains and gives examples of reports mailed to parents, more detailed reports given to teachers, and summary tables generated for each school. Part IV describes procedures used to develop BSTP tests and to analyze students' results in preparation for reporting. Numerous test items are presented. (RH)",

(2) Are caregivers receiving adequate training for providing appropriate environments for children of 1 or 2 years of age? (3) What are the obstacles and encouragements for caregivers of toddlers who wish to pursue further training? A review of the play behaviors of toddlers indicates that toddlers' play is both qualitatively and quantitatively different from that of younger or older children. Caregivers need specialized training if they are to provide toddlers with developmentally appropriate physical, social, and emotional environments. A teacher interview was designed to determine teachers' views of their training regarding  the care of toddlers, and a director interview was designed to determine directors' assessments of the skills, abilities, and training needs of teachers of toddlers. A 28-item program assessment instrument, the Toddler Program Profile, was developed to serve as a measure of the physical environment, the daily schedule, adult-child interactions, and adult-adult interactions. Staff of six centers participated in the study. Findings identify areas in which caregivers of toddlers need additional training. Interview schedules and the assessment instrument are appended.

        "description":"This paper focuses on improving communication between home and school in the areas of curriculum and assessment. Research based on interviews with headteachers, management staff, guidance staff, subject-based staff, and parents, suggests several guidelines. Suggestions for preferred practices are offered so that school staff can check them against actual practices. These suggestions concern: (1) the school in its community; (2) the roles of asking and listening in the two-way process of communication; (3) the process of meeting with parents in groups; (4) written communication; (4) the process of communicating information about individual students; (5) the need to work on the development of personal relationships between parents and school staff; and (6) the process of improving  school communication. It is concluded that the formation of partnership between home and school is not without difficulty. Two areas seem to demand immediate attention. The first is the challenge of discovering ways of tapping into the views of parents who do not readily answer survey questions or respond to invitations. The second area is teacher education. In terms of working with parents, the &quot;sink or swim&quot; situation of simply learning on the job can no longer be allowed. (RH)",

The activities discussed are varied and offer a range of opportunities for child involvement. Several categories of activities are included. Exploring activities are those that allow children to freely examine materials. Cooking experiences allow children to handle food and assist in the preparation of foods. Chores activities offer experiences which lead to the formation of good work habits and responsible behaviors.  Play activities encourage children to express themselves freely and creatively. A section on talking and storytelling provides suggestions for promoting open communication, language development, use of symbolism, and growth in imagination. (21 references) (BB)",

The construct of engagement is predicated on the assumption that the more time an individual spends attending to and interacting with his or her surroundings, the more opportunities he or she has to learn. A total of 48 children were observed on 8 occasions each during either free play or structured activities. Findings indicated that age had little effect on engagement with adults, but was associated with overall engagement. Engagement with materials was associated with age by grouping interaction. Structured activities promoted engagement  with adults and free play promoted engagement with peers. Both children with handicaps and normally developing children engaged with peers more in free play than in structured activities. Children with handicaps spent almost three times as much time observing as playing in free play and over twice as much time observing as playing in structured activities. Younger children were more likely to be engaged with materials in same-age groups, and older children more likely to be engaged with materials in mixed-age groups. Results are discussed in terms of implications for future research and recommendations for practice. (30 references) (Author/RH)",

Mean scores were generated in eight specific and three general categories for all four target individuals. Mean scores for target individuals were compared. Mothers were the most likely source of support in the family. Siblings were rated higher than mothers for dating support, and were a more likely source of support than fathers for several areas. Peers were the most likely source of support, with higher ratings than siblings in all categories, and with higher ratings than parents in all areas except financial support, career planning, and personal values. Although  ratings were similar for both genders, where differences did exist, females were more likely to go to peers and mothers for support than were males. Younger adolescents showed strong preferences for mothers and peers, while older adolescents were likely to give higher ratings to fathers and siblings in several areas. Peers were rated higher than other targets on most areas of support-seeking. Findings reinforce the importance of context and its interaction with gender and age in determining adolescents' support-seeking behavior. (Author/RH)",

The study was designed to identify important practices that should be incorporated into the transition process and barriers that interfere with implementation of transition. Early childhood special education teachers, kindergarten teachers, and supervisors in suburban districts of a large metropolitan area of Minnesota were surveyed by questionnaire in an effort to obtain a comprehensive perspective. Results indicated that while some teachers and administrators can identify important transition practices, many factors interfere with implementation.

A suggested timeline emphasizes transition as a year-long process that involves a variety of practices that occur throughout the year. While this model was developed for movement from early childhood special education into kindergarten, it could easily be adapted for other  transitions made by young students with special needs.

A series of sequenced in-service workships provided teachers and administrators with knowledge, understanding, and skills related to parental involvement in children's learning at personal, practical, and conceptual levels. Each in-service workshop included a pretest/posttest and a discussion of: (1) federal, local, state, and corporate policies which might affect parents and teachers; (2) family backgrounds directly influencing parental involvement in the schools; (3) effective communication skills; (4) methods for effectively conducting  parent-teacher conferences; and (5) methods for increasing home-school cooperation and parental involvement. An evaluation was conducted in order to determine the most and least effective activities and materials in each in-service course. Workshops were offered to early childhood and elementary education teachers and administrators employed by a county school district. Results were positive.

Since tests provide limited data, the accurate assessment of kindergarten children requires the use of different perspectives. The method of observing and recording peer interaction during free play seems to yield particularly relevant results.

        "description":"Children's memory for spatial locations in a room designed to look like a grocery store was examined. In the first of two studies, 48 preschoolers completed a memory task for spatial locations problem and an incidental recall task in two room arrangements varying in logical organization. Memory for spatial locations was higher in a clustered and logical arrangement than in a nonclustered and random arrangement. In the second study, a total of 74 kindergartners and first and second graders were assessed for knowledge of classification, spatial operations, field dependence and independence, and memory for locations of items in a logically organized room arrangement. Memory for the general area of the room in which objects belonged was expected to relate to knowledge of  classification, while memory for more specific locations was expected to be related to knowledge of spatial operations and field independence. Surprisingly, most children performed well on memory for general location, leading to the rejection of the first hypothesis. Consistent with the second hypothesis, results of a multiple regression showed that memory for specific spatial location was related to spatial operational knowledge, strong performance on the Children's Embedded Figures Test, and the strategy used to complete the reconstruction. When children were asked to recall the contents of the space, performance was related to age and accuracy on the spatial reconstruction. (31 references) (RH)",

        "description":"The five chapters of this book discuss children's development and learning. Chapter 1, by Barbara Z. Presseisen, raises fundamental questions about schooling and learning. Chapter 2, by Robert J. Sternberg, presents a theory of intellectual styles and discusses its relevance for education. The theory concerns the ways in which people use their intelligence and is based on a notion of mental self-government. Chapter 3, by Kurt W. Fischer and Catharine C. Knight, discusses skill theory as a tool for analyzing the development of children who vary in capacity, motivation, and emotional state, and act in specific contexts. The theory shows how children can exhibit both stagelike developmental levels and wide variations in performance. Chapter 4, by Reuven Feuerstein, outlines the  critical elements of the theory of structural cognitive modifiability and the role of Mediated Learning Experience (MLE) in producing the plasticity and flexibility of adaptation that human beings call intelligence. Particular attention is given to MLE and the condition of cultural deprivation. Chapter 5, by Barbara Z. Presseisen, analyzes each theorist's position, examines practical aspects of education, and offers answers to questions raised in the first chapter. Implications of the emerging paradigm change in education are presented. (RH)",

Several questions were addressed by the study. (1) Are North Carolina kindergartens being taught in a developmentally appropriate manner? (2) Are certain aspects of kindergarten emphasized more than others or taught more appropriately? (3) What is the relationship of kindergarten classroom quality to various teacher, principal, and school characteristics? (4) How frequently and for what reasons does kindergarten retention occur? (5) What are the obstacles to developmentally appropriate  kindergarten instruction? (6) What avenues are available to help improve kindergartens? The five main sections of the report cover kindergarten history and research; the study methodology; results; discussion of the results and their implications for kindergarten in North Carolina; and recommendations for action. Citations number 29. Numerous appendices include a list of the members of the study's advisory board; items from the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale; a checklist of kindergarten activities; teacher interviews; the Attitude to School Questionnaire; related letters; elementary school principal and teacher questionnaires; questionnaire codes; and descriptions of hypothetical classrooms.

Children with special needs confront teachers in mainstreamed early childhood programs with the responsibility of promoting social interaction and peer acceptance among children with different levels of maturity, social skill, and experience. Subjects in this study were enrolled in a mainstreamed, early childhood program which included five children with special needs and five nonhandicapped peers of the same age. Two of the handicapped children had Downs' syndrome, and three had developmental disabilities associated with neurological impairments. All subjects with special needs had communication problems; two were nonverbal and three had severe  language delays. Two were on medication for epilepsy. There were three teachers in the program. Data were gathered by means of 6 months of weekly 45-minute observations from a viewing room during morning free play periods. Six videotapes were made to permit cross-checking of observations. Results indicated that teachers can successfully facilitate peer play with strategies such as initiation of play, participation, and elaboration. It is concluded that teacher strategies mediate prosocial behavior and encourage and invite participation. (RH)",

Pastors' children have traditionally been thought to have more behavioral problems than other children, since they face high expectations and are part of families which are often under public scrutiny.

        "description":"This report re-examines previously gathered ethnographic data derived from approximately 3,000 hours of interviews with migrants across the United States to determine what factors associated with migration affect children's educational outcomes. The data suggest the existence of a &quot;culture of migrancy,&quot; which is manifested in similar attitudes, lifestyles, and behavioral patterns among migrants of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds in the three major migration streams. The survival-oriented priorities of the culture of migrancy make all migrant children potential dropouts. Migrant children are affected by poverty, poor living conditions, isolation from mainstream society, fragmented education received between moves, and low self-esteem related to the trauma of moving. A  migrant child's success or failure in the educational system is related to the emotional and economic support available to the child, the child's decision-making power, and the child's economic contribution to the family. Migrant education programs differ greatly among states and often are not coordinated with other social services. The seven chapters in this report define the migrant population, outline the ethnographic methodology used, discuss migrant lifestyles and living conditions in home-base states and &quot;upstream&quot; states, describe the move from the first kind of state to the other, examine role relationships and social behavior among migrants, detail the component parts and services of the Migrant Education Program, and highlight national questions of educational policy.

Rejecting the view of Appalachia as an area dominated by a culture of poverty, these papers portray a strong regional culture based on family, community, and religion. This cultural context has implications for development of mental health problems and coping skills, and for delivery of mental health services.

        "description":"This paper examines racism and discrimination against rural blacks, especially as these factors relate to poverty caused by unemployment and underemployment. While overt racism in the rural South and Appalachia was sharply reduced during the 1970s, statistical evidence indicates that related differences, such as the black-white &quot;income gap,&quot; were not greatly affected. Historical, cultural, and non-market factors can be conceptualized as racism and discrimination and seen as contributing to unemployment. Differences in income comes not by chance but from racism in the South and, more specifically, in Appalachia. Institutional discrimination by complete or partial restriction from job opportunities systematically keeps blacks in a low status and affirms continuing discriminatory  images held by the larger Appalachian community. Different forms of institutional racism are described, notably the perception and separation of &quot;black jobs&quot; from higher-paying &quot;white jobs.&quot; Census figures from 1983 indicated that hourly wages were lowest in the three regions of the South; in these regions of the country blacks were most heavily concentrated in low-income divisions. Although their educational backgrounds are similar to those of whites, black youth are excluded from some service-industry jobs. A study of hourly wages reported by a regional hotel and conference center shows that 70% of the black employees held the lowest-paid positions. The paper concludes by recommending more complete research, better training programs and employment standards among employers, and outreach  programs that better define employer commitments to hiring and retaining blacks.

        "description":"Research on the influence of instructional time on student achievement has focused on the concept of academic learning time and its major components--allocated time, engaged time, and level of difficulty. This report reviews three studies that concur that increasing allocated time, in itself, has little influence on student achievement. Walberg notes that time is only one of nine major factors affecting student achievement, and argues for the expansion of \"productive time\" (allocated plus engaged time) through a classroom emphasis on individual student learning differences and small-group instruction. Dewalt and Rodwell's observations in a rural elementary school and Cotton's review of research findings reinforce the necessity of employing sound teaching methods and classroom  techniques in conjunction with increased allocated time. Cotton's recommendations for teachers and administrators are listed. Among 12 other related studies, 1 found a clear positive relationship between allocated time and student achievement; 4 found learning time to be a moderate predictor of school achievement; and 7 suggested that considerable increases in the amount of schooling would be required to produce even modest increases in achievement. A table lists state requirements for minimum school days and hours. (SV)",

        "description":"The use of multiple indicators of educational achievement is called for to replace a single measure of student achievement in order to identify the school context in which education occurs. School-level indicators have been identified, such as access to knowledge, press for achievement, and professional teaching conditions. These indicators are vital in understanding the context of schooling and in influencing the outcomes of the educational process. The school indicators, however, do not provide the interpretive frame necessary for understanding schooling within the context of the community. In rural communities, where resources are often more limited and where schools are central to social and cultural activities, community context is vital in understanding and influencing  school indicators. As federal and state assessment of school achievement is moving toward the creation of such school-level indicators, rural schools and communities face the choice of being compared to the urban context or developing additional indicators that capture the rural context. Rural schools seem to be influenced more by the economic and cultural outlooks of their communities than are other schools. Student, family, and community socioeconomic characteristics and attitudes are major determinants of educational achievement. More research is necessary to determine what makes up an effective rural school and the community context in which such schools operate. (ALL)",

        "author":["Strand, David A."],
        "description":"Fifty-nine Mexican-American families, each with a child between age 5 and 9, participated in a study to determine whether paternal proximal behaviors related to child ability and achievement. Proximal behaviors studied were: (1) teaching strategies; (2) language in literacy related activities; (3) involvement level in childcare; and (4) select gender-specific behaviors. Additionally, the study examined associations between acculturation level and proximal paternal behaviors. Instruments used were the Parent Background Form (PBF), the Cognitive Home Environment Scale (CHES), the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), and a revised version of the Maternal Teaching Observation Technique (MTOT). In addition, primary teachers rated children for classroom performance and academic  potential. To study father-child interactions, research assistants videotaped fathers teaching their children on a model assembly task. Interviews with mothers identified childcare responsibilities in the home. Results showed that fathers who incorporated independence training in their teaching approach and used English in literacy-related activities had higher rated children. No significant differences were found in involvement level with respect to father level of acculturation or in teaching approaches with respect to gender. Among the implications of the study are the following: (1) future research should account for paternal as well as maternal influences when assessing home environment variables; (2) teaching methods in school should complement paternal methods; and (3) parental  behaviors which promote child self-efficacy should be encouraged. Study limitations are described; they concern sample size and selection, validity of the instruments, and the nature of the father-child task. (KS)",

It is also important that the disabled be accepted as participating, contributing, and cherished members of the community. Distance and isolation, which typify rural areas, directly impact each of these issues. Individuals with disabilities have significant contributions to make to rural communities, and education of the rural disabled has a twofold purpose: (1) to increase their skills and knowledge as individuals; and (2) to educate communities about their potential. The Education for All Handicapped Children Act (Public Law 94-142) established that public education has a responsibility to provide education for all children and required substantial and  system-wide changes in providing such education. These changes have had a disproportionate impact on the budgets of rural schools and have created problems. Small, rural schools need waivers from categorical funding requirements so that all children experiencing problems in school can benefit from the skills, technologies, and processes developed by special education. Pull-out programs need to be replaced by specialized support and consultative help from itinerant specialists for classroom teachers. Small schools have few self-contained classrooms and need permission to experiment with model programs. Computers and augmentative communication boards need to be provided by PL 94-142 to rural schools. These waivers and special provisions to PL 94-142 would enable rural schools to educate the  disabled to be productive in the rural community. (ALL)",

        "description":"Many rural communities share these complaints: (1) an exodus of the best and brightest young people; (2) a changing and ambivalent self-concept about the identity and the future of the community; and (3) a scarcity of good jobs to act as the mortar that bonds the other elements together. The South Dakota Rural Schools and Community Development Program was begun for the purpose of economic development and community-building through the public schools. Based on observations and interviews with community members and school personnel, five communities in the West River region are profiled to show how the program is working: Edgemont; Belle Fourche; Buffalo; Presho; and Custer. Identified problems are similar in all of small-town and rural America, though to different degrees. The  problems are: (1) administrators with an overabundance of roles; (2) higher expectations of already overworked teachers in an effort to expand curriculum offerings; (3) the centrality of professional development to school improvement; and (4) the enormous and growing gap between what schools are doing now and what they will need to be doing to meet the demands of the information age. The aim of saving rural communities through their schools runs counter to the ways in which the school establishment has operated for generations. In striving to affect both rural life and life within schools, the goal of the Rural Schools and Community Development Program may not be reached for many years, as the obstacles that face the project are formidable, growing out of the deepest structure of  schooling, untouched by generations of reform.

        "description":"South Dakota's graduation rate in 1986-87 was above the national average: 79.7% compared to 71.1%. The dropout rate for 1990 was 4.3%. Of 180 districts, 25 with large numbers of Native Americans have a dropout rate of over 7%. Increasing the rates of graduation for Native American students will require a comprehensive, long-range program. Schools need to break down the barriers between school and real life by using the model of adult learning: working cooperatively on complex tasks of significant duration; and bringing to every problem all intellectual resources. This paper discusses the problems relating to dropouts, and suggests a number of approaches to teaching young people how to learn: (1) expanding the community as a focus of study; (2) redesigning courses or curricula to  include entrepreneurship education, so students learn to create as well as to get jobs; (3) creating opportunities for monitored work experiences, including cooperative education, internships, apprenticeships, pre-employment training and youth-operated enterprises; (4) designing community and neighborhood service opportunities that include individual voluntary efforts and youth-guided service programs; (5) redirecting vocational education to offer students hands-on methodology for jobs of the future; (6) providing incentives such as guarantees of postsecondary and continuing education, employment, and training; (7) offering career information and counseling, exposing young people to job opportunities and career options; (8) showing more flexibility on district and state levels in allowing  young people over the age of 18 to return to high school; and (9) encouraging closer cooperation between high schools and post-secondary institutions including dual enrollment.

The type of education available in rural schools typify, on a small scale, the recommendations of effective schools research. Rural educators have experienced the limitations of the current knowledge base and rely on practice and experienced-based knowledge. New knowledge to improve practice comes from personal interactions with other rural educators rather than  from research or outside resource persons. State departments of education establish monitoring and compliance relationships with rural schools, mirroring the larger society's undervaluing of rural education. They assume that rural schools are financially inefficient and educationally ineffective, although all state-wide test data proves contrary. New models for knowledge production and utilization are necessary for improving rural education. Three alternative models are: (1) clustering schools with similar interests to share programs, personnel and equipment; (2) sponsoring grassroots research on rural education and rural schools; and (3) creating Centers on Rural Education at colleges and universities.

This booklet profiles 3 of the project's 12 pilot schools: Takini School on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation, Estelline, and Belle Fourche. The three communities differ greatly in their histories, lifestyles, economic bases, and expectations. The specific methods of developing school-community alliances in these three cases are less important than the spirit of experimentation behind the methods. In Estelline, the community has become a classroom. With encouragement of the local development corporation, a new elective high school class--Rural Economics--allows students to learn about local businesses and their hometown and encourages student  entrepreneurship. Takini--a K-12 reservation school planned by federal bureaucrats--was sited equidistant from three towns and has no town of its own. Nevertheless, with parent and tribal support, the school plans to build an auxiliary building surrounding an arena, to be used for community rodeos and powwows. Classrooms will have &quot;storefront&quot; openings onto the arena, which students can use for running food concessions and selling items such as horse halters. In Belle Fourche, a &quot;classroom without walls&quot; approach has led to high school students surveying the local business climate, mapping the town for the 1990 census, writing for the local paper and radio station, and completing requirements for a town listing in the governor's directory for national business recruitment.

        "description":"A major concern of science educators is the lack of talented females selecting science careers. In spite of attempts during the past few decades to create equality in all facets of life in the United States, many sexual stereotypes persist. The research presented here is designed to examine the relationship of sex to the relevant factors influencing the decision to choose a college major in the technical sciences. Data from students in the High School and Beyond sophomore cohort who had participated in surveys in 1980, 1982, 1984, and 1986 (n=188) were analyzed and a path model was constructed. While noticeable gender differences did emerge in this study, there was a very small direct effect of gender on the dependent measure of science major. Many of the strong paths showed  similar results for both sexes, for example, the path leading from family background through ability, achievement, and advanced courses, to college major. Separating the analyses by sex helped to point out some interesting path differences. The most interesting difference involved the path for females--from self-efficacy through science and mathematics attitudes, to advanced courses, and then on to college major. The same path was virtually absent for males. A list of 16 references is included. (CW)",

        "description":"A Task Force created in 1989 was asked to provide the Carnegie Commission on Science, Technology, and Government with a brief statement outlining both functional needs in environment and energy and institutional forms to enhance the government's capability to address the emergent issues. One key need the Task Force has identified is for a greater emphasis on developing and structuring incentives to prevent environmental problems, rather than responding to problems only after they occur. A second need is to grapple with the multitude and subtlety of interfaces between issues, not only of environment and energy, but of the economy as well. This report suggests that there is an abundance of organizations that deal with specifics, but not with their integration. Discussions include:  (1) limitations of command and control; (2) linking economic and energy needs to the environment; (3) international dimensions; (4) short and long term objectives; (5) matching organizations to the problem; and (6) coordination between existing systems. Key and supporting recommendations of the Task Force have been included. Appended is a discussion on the greenhouse effect as an illustration of the linkages between the environment, energy, and the economy. (KR)",

Leland Griffin, who put forth the &quot;life-cycle&quot; theory, has been acknowledged as the founder of social movement study. However, his theory does not adequately explain movements that do not evolve over time. The Nation of Islam movement, in the context of a &quot;steady state&quot; theory, defies Griffin's model in that it does not evolve at all. Generally, social movements seek to change social, political, religious, or economic norms and values. The Nation of Islam does not represent a part of  the established order, but maintains a philosophy of remaining separate from the establishment. The group's leader is analyzed in relation to other black leaders, the history of the movement is discussed, and the beliefs of those who join it are reviewed. (NL)",

Section 1 provides a history of early church and private schools and traces Britain's educational development up to the reforms of 1988. From the year 600 to 1988 the varied and complex school systems show that England and Wales educated their elites but delayed extending higher education to the working class until the 1960s and 1970s. Then the countries attempted to equalize educational opportunities largely through comprehensive schools. Section 2 explains school structure, organization, administration, and changes under the Education Reform Act of 1988 (ERA) and offers insight into education  policy changes that show a change of direction from a child-centered, progressive, teacher-guided system to the conservative, differentiated, central government-directed, industry-serving school system of today.

Previous researchers believed that women in Cote d'Ivoire were less likely than men to work for wages because of child-related obligations and low wage rates. This report contradicts this commonly held view by finding that women's limited participation is attributed, at least in part, to their having less education. A model based on the simultaneous determination of wages and choice of participation in the labor market is presented and is claimed to be more accurate than the common practice of treating these variables separately. The study also focuses on the differences between males and females in access to schooling. Numerous figures and  tables of statistical data appear throughout the report. (DB)",

In order for the United States to function in such a world its young persons, the leaders of tomorrow, must be able to understand how such a world works. Yet, as recent studies have show, the youth of the United States are woefully underexposed to other countries' languages and cultures, and to U.S. foreign policies. Many states have been responding to this need through the establishment of commissions to recommend ways of introducing broader instruction in international studies into schools, or have mandated some form of international education in all grades, from kindergarten through high school. A multitude of issues concerning global education has  yet to be fully addressed, however, including specific questions as to teacher training and curriculum design and development.

An assessment is made as to how successful the policies have been in achieving their original intention. The paper's conclusion is that policy outcomes fall far short of matching expectations, mainly because of insufficient, or the absence of, implementation. The reason most educational policies are not implemented is that they are vaguely stated and the financing implications are not always worked out. Another reason for failure is that the content of a policy is based on an empirically unsustained theoretical relationship between instruments and outcomes. The paper makes a  plea for the formulation of more concrete, feasible and implementable policies based on documented cause-effect relationships. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"This paper reviews the scholarly literature concerned, directly or indirectly, with the implementation of educational policies in Sub-Saharan Africa. The first part considers the reasons both for the past neglect of implementation issues and for the current interest in the subject. It also introduces some conceptual issues relevant to the analysis of implementation questions, drawing heavily on the literature that focuses on policy processes in Western countries. The second part offers general observations concerning the literature on the implementation of educational policies in Africa, and characterizes this literature with respect to the policies considered, the countries studied, and other variables. The third part outlines the major conceptual frameworks that have been  developed for the analysis of implementation issues. It then considers the matter of causation as this is addressed, explicitly or implicitly, in the literature on educational policy implementation in Africa. Six major sets of variables are identified, and the arguments that have been advanced with respect to the explanatory significance of each set are summarized. The paper concludes with some comments on the deficiencies of literature reviewed and with a call for research that is better informed by the often more sophisticated work of those who have studied implementation issues in other policy domains and in other parts of the world. The appendices follow the text. The first lists the journals surveyed systematically for purposes of this paper, and the second is a bibliography.  (Author)",

        "description":"This paper reviews the evolution of the Kenyan education system since independence from Britain in 1963. At the time of independence, very few resources were devoted to the education of Africans as compared to non-Africans, resulting in critical shortages of trained manpower. Educational segregation and differentiation also reinforced racial and ethnic prejudices. After independence, education was to be a significant tool not only for social justice and rapid development, but also for the promotion of unity and &quot;nationhood.&quot; The report outlines the institutional and legal steps that were taken to improve the educational system and traces its development through four 5-year development plans. In the space of 20 years, the system has expanded dramatically and universal free primary  education has been achieved, the progression of the system has been restructured, and the curriculum has been significantly revised, placing more emphasis on the technical and vocational skills which remain in high demand. However, educational development in the post-colonial period has been hampered by insufficient resources due to poor economic conditions, a high rate of population growth, teacher shortages, the need to balance native language with foreign language instruction, poor internal efficiency, and continued problems with curriculum relevance.

        "description":"Of the three East African British colonies (Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania), Tanzania was the least well off at the time of independence in 1961. At that time, only 16,691 students were enrolled in secondary schools, and all general education at higher levels was provided outside the country. Thus, the goals of post-independence educational policy were the distribution and equalization of educational opportunities and the expansion of the system at all levels, including the attainment of universal primary education. This report reviews the initial evolution and implementation of educational policies through government (5-year development plans. From 1969-1978, the Education for Self-Reliance (ESR) program became the basis for all major educational policy changes. The final section  of the report evaluates the implementation and success of educational policies and finds that the emphasis on achieving universal primary education has led to a system where there are secondary school places for only 4 percent of primary school graduates. The author reviews the financial and macroeconomic circumstances, educational theories and internal and external efficiency criteria that inform the debate about educational quality and ESR, which stressed that education should help to promote a socialist transformation of society, and which emphasized preparation for rural and community life over theoretical knowledge, particularly at the primary level. The report finds that some policy objectives were contradictory and that, in the short run, quantitative and efficiency objectives have  been incompatible. (Author)",

        "description":"At the time of independence in 1966, education in Lesotho was inadequate in scope, in quantity, and--from the African perspective, in quality as well. Only the few who received education outside Lesotho were treated as &quot;first class Basotho.&quot; After independence, the role of education was seen to be the production of two kinds of indigenous manpower--administrators to run the civil service and scientists and technicians. With the help of outside experts, educational policies were developed and codified in a series of three Five-Year Development Plans. This paper reviews the progress of educational development according to the development plans and evaluates their implementation. Some programs have been successfully implemented, including those for book supply, classroom building,  non-formal education, the establishment of educational associations, and the replacement of small church-run teacher training colleges by a national college. The country experienced a steady increase in the number of students and schools. However, the &quot;push out&quot; rate is so high that only 14 percent of primary school entrants continue on to secondary school. Other problems include nonattainment of the goal of universal primary education, an apparent decline in educational quality, teacher shortages, insufficient training in the English language, lack of employment opportunities even for graduates, and practical studies that are not relevant to rural economic activities.

        "description":"At the time of independence in 1968, education in Swaziland was characterized by poor quality, uneven distribution of schools, high dropout and repeater rates, serious shortages of teachers, and inappropriate and highly academic curricula. This paper describes the status of present-day education in Swaziland in terms of the effect of government policies on the primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors. Because current trends in education are the cumulative result of policies followed since independence, the historical development of education policy is traced in quinquennials that correspond to each of the four post-independence 5-year National Development Plans. The policies of the first three 5-year periods are followed by an appraisal of the achievements and failures of the  period with regard to policy objectives and policy procedures. The final chapter on the Fourth Plan (1984-88) lists priority areas for continued improvement--improved teacher training, curriculum development, support to the sector from the Ministry of Education, and more systematic educational planning, monitoring, and evaluation. An annex includes the detailed recommendations of the National Review Commission Report of 1985. (Author)",

        "description":"At the time of independence from Britain in 1962, education in Uganda was more advanced than in neighboring countries, although still unsatisfactory. This paper reviews the recommendations of commissions, educational reviews, and 5-year plans for the development of educational policies since independence. There have been two main long-term government objectives--primary school expansion toward the goal of universal primary education, and the provision of sufficient manpower of the quality needed to meet the skill requirements of the economy. The implementation of these goals was severely hampered by the events of the 1970s, which were a decade of &quot;total national calamity&quot; that affected all sectors of the economy, including the education system. The Recovery Program in 1982/84 was  adopted to reconstruct and rehabilitate the educational infrastructure. The report reviews the present-day status of education in Uganda with regard to internal and external efficiency, equity, and non-quantitative criteria such as national policy and Ugandanization. It finds four remaining major problem areas: continued illiteracy, high dropout rates at almost all levels, unqualified teachers and a shortage of qualified ones, and a widening gap between educational preparation and actual employment opportunities.

        "description":"At the time of independence from Britain in 1964, the educational system in Zambia was, as elsewhere in Africa, racially segregated and heavily biased against Africans. This paper briefly reviews the situation at independence before enumerating post-independence educational policy landmarks through both acts of Parliament and national development plans and related documents. It discusses successes and failures in program implementation as evidenced by internal and external efficiency criteria. Particularly the primary school system has expanded substantially, although there are few data about internal efficiency. Nevertheless, the young and growing population continues to put pressure on the system--a doubling of primary school places by the year 2000 would be necessary simply to  maintain the present gross enrollment rates. High rates of unemployment, especially after completion of primary and secondary school, point to poor external efficiency. Other factors contributing to problems with the successful implementation of educational policies have been a poor economy, inadequate supply of teachers above the primary level, problems with curriculum relevance, and an entrenched debate about the merits of English language versus native language teaching.

        "description":"Zimbabwe has been independent only since 1980. It has, however, attempted to change significantly the inherited educational policies, which it considers to be inappropriate to the nation's adopted socialist ideology. This paper outlines and critically appraises Zimbabwe's educational policies and finds that post-independence educational policy formulation has been influenced not only by the ideological goals of national policy, but equally strongly by the inherited colonial capitalist infrastructure. A thorough review of the main factors influencing policy formation in the colonial period helps to explain why the transformation in educational policies has been more quantitative than qualitative since 1980, the emphasis on socialist development notwithstanding. Additional factors  which have hindered substantial qualitative change have been the short time period since independence and shortages of both human and material resources. A particular problem is the preference of students and parents for a traditional, academic education of the sort often denied Blacks under colonial rule over the new, more practical and vocational curriculum. In conclusion, the paper reviews the implications of the dichotomy between pre- and post-independence social, economic, political, and educational goals for the specific areas of private schools, teacher education, curricula, and examinations.

This concern for a people whose culture and political institutions are significantly different reflects a continuing and compelling interest in China. Although historians and journalists in the United States long have observed a &quot;special relationship&quot; between the two countries, which has included periods of optimistic friendship as well as tragic conflict, China studies have been neglected in U.S. classrooms. Where it is not overlooked, China is too often the victim of stereotyping or specious generalizations. To encourage effective teaching about China, this ERIC Digest examines: (1) the political status of China; (2) reasons for teaching  about China; (3) approaches to teaching about China; and (4) China's place in the pre-collegiate curriculum.

        "description":"A program of observation of local government bodies was implemented to make 12th grade U.S. government students aware of their local governments and how local government affects them. The program consisted of three components: orientation, implementation, and evaluation. The students were given a slide presentation and an information packet that explained the program and its requirements. The packet also gave a description of the groups the students would be observing and a map that showed the locations of the meetings. The students had 5 weeks in which to complete three observations, not less than one hour each in duration, of three different types of governmental bodies--local legislative bodies, advisory boards, and trial courts. They were given worksheets on which to record  pertinent information with spaces for sign-in, sign-out, and an official's signature. As a follow-up, each class discussed what had been observed at the meetings, and a posttest was given to measure how much had been learned, comparing its score with that of a pretest given at the beginning of the program. Students scored an average of 25 percentage points higher on the posttest than on the pretest. Though somewhat apprehensive before the observations, students on the whole reacted favorably to the program. Appendices include documents sent to gather information, the students' packet, the pretest-posttest, and a chart showing the students' reactions to the program. (DB)",

As international trade and exchange continues to grow, it is increasingly important for students to be aware of other cultures and how they contrast with the United States on interpersonal, organizational, and societal levels.

        "description":"Recent research has shown that computer technology, including databases, is becoming a part of social studies instruction. Yet it still is not clear how teachers are using databases and what are the outcomes from such use. The research reported in this document addresses three principal questions: (1) How do teachers use computer databases in teaching problem solving? (2) What do students learn during this kind of activity? and (3) What are the enablers and inhibitors of successful database use during teaching and problem solving? A case study approach was used in exploring the answers to these questions. Eight teachers and their students were observed during at least 10 class sessions; teachers and selected students were interviewed; and written teaching plans, class materials,  and student projects were reviewed. Some of the inferences drawn from the study are that: time pressure affects teachers and students alike, but there are specific techniques for making good use of time when attempting computer based problem solving; lack of student knowledge must be anticipated by the teacher, who has to incorporate specific ways of overcoming the problem in teaching; and using small non-competitive groups of students works well. A 32-item list of references is included, as are 4 tables. (DB)",

The beliefs prospective teachers have developed about teaching as a result of their long immersion as students in the culture of schooling appear to have a profound influence on the way they teach and the way they think about teaching. The majority of teachers and prospective teachers initially demonstrate a tremendous resistance to the notion that students possessing a sense of agency can be empowered to take responsibility for constructing their own understanding and, ultimately, determining the direction of their own lives. It is argued that teachers' beliefs are culturally  constructed ideological systems, frequently unconsciously held, pervading their entire ways of knowing and acting, not just their explicit philosophies of teaching and learning. This fundamental resistance to reflective teaching is illustrated with extensive excerpts from a professor's reflective journal about students in an inservice teacher education class. The method used in this class was Paulo Freire's approach to critical pedagogy which attempts to enable teachers to develop more enriched ways of knowing, a more empowered sense of agency, and more progressive pedagogical beliefs. The course syllabus is appended. (JD)",

A discussion is presented on the reflective teaching program at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, which attempts to implement a genuinely reflective curriculum seeking to induce change in beliefs about teaching. Analysis of program results has indicated that students retained their pre-existing beliefs about teaching and  learning irrespective of whether they were constructivist and critical or authoritarian and didactic. The permeability of the individual student's beliefs is considered, as well as questions on the effect that socialization agents, such as teacher preparation and entry into the culture of schooling, have on student teachers' implicit and explicit belief systems concerning the nature of teaching and learning. A list of 12 questions provides a basis for further research on evolving beliefs about teaching and their implications for preservice teacher education. (JD)",

        "description":"This paper discusses several interrelated processes aimed at helping teachers to use an experimental approach to improve their teaching. In making a diagnosis, the teacher generates a hypothesis about the relationship between his/her potential behavior and its effect upon the students. Following the formulation of such a hypothesis, the teacher observes the student responses to his/her behavior. These observations are interpreted in terms of the purposes that motivated his/her behavior in the first place. To practice teaching as experimentation, teachers need interrelated, overlapping categories of knowledge and abilities: (1) background knowledge; (2) abilities to use concepts to guide analysis and actions; (3) capacity for generating hypotheses; and (4) ability to carry out  actions suggested by the hypotheses and to learn from the results. A discussion is presented on the role and content of these interrelated abilities and the methods that have been developed to help teachers acquire them. It is pointed out that developing these abilities enables a teacher to use class discussion as an effective teaching tool. (JD)",

Comparison of the results of the 1979 and 1989 studies indicated that the positive factors in the relationships were very similar. Positive factors included: willingness to share, helpfulness, supportiveness, positive reinforcement, fairness, constructive criticism, sense of humor, and care. Comparison of the negative factors in the relationships indicated a more strained classroom environment in 1989. In 1979 negative criticism focused primarily on delivery of instruction, while in 1989 there appeared to be an ongoing struggle between teachers and students over behavior. (JD)",

        "description":"This paper considers the theoretical positions that ground teacher education programs and asks whether these theories reflect the experiences and voices of all society or merely those of the dominant culture. The paper proposes the incorporation of elements of critical pedagogy as taught by Paulo Freire and reflective thinking according to John Dewey's philosophy as bases for a teacher education program that would engender critical reflectivity. The emerging conception of critical educational psychology presented in the paper embodies the notion that current use of traditional psychological theories in the classroom perpetuates the ideologies of the dominant social order. Also, the prevalent information-processing model of learning engenders a technocratic approach to teaching  and teacher preparation. Through the process of critical reflectivity, preservice teachers are encouraged to examine and expose the culturally reproductive aspects of the current use of the traditional psychological theories, seeing them in part as institutional supports for the dominant social order. A preservice teacher in a critical educational psychology course is seen not merely as a technician who reproduces the culture as it stands but rather as an intellectual capable of transforming self and society through the act of teaching.

Participants in the 1-year demographic study were 40 teachers in a middle school. Evidence from teacher narratives and participant observations revealed the following teacher definition of teacher empowerment: &quot;Teacher empowerment is the opportunity and confidence to act upon one's ideas and to influence the way one performs in one's profession. True empowerment leads to increased professionalism as teachers assume responsibility for and involvement in the  decision-making process.&quot; Three principal findings emerged: (1) the organizational culture as reflected in the cultural norms promoted and sustained teacher empowerment; (2) the social practices and social knowledge of empowered teachers promoted and sustained teacher empowerment; and (3) enpowering leadership, as transformative leadership, promoted and sustained teacher empowerment. Teacher's meanings and social actions were found to be most consistent with those situated in the discourses of teachers' associations, the conservative and liberal education theorists, and authors of organizational transformative leadership.

The purpose of the program is to provide educators who evaluate classroom instruction with the tools that result in professional growth for the teachers and improvement of classroom instruction. Joint participation by teachers and administrators is encouraged in all phases of the evaluation process. The training program has five modules. The first module reviews the research on teacher evaluation, addresses the concept of common vision, presents a model of a growth-oriented evaluation system, and provides training in conducting a planning conference. The second module informs participants of the kinds of classroom behavior that can be recorded through observation, familiarizes them with the use of common observation  tools, and demonstrates the utility of teacher-made observation tools. The third module presents methods for analyzing and interpreting descriptive data and provides procedures for a mutually productive postconference leading to meaningful goal setting. The fourth module presents means of measuring instructional effectiveness: student assessment, teaching artifacts, student evaluations, and self-assessment. The fifth module includes criteria for productive goals, and ideas for motivating teachers and providing resources. The modules follow a sequential procedure and include all back-up materials. The format for each module is: module overview, training agenda, activity instruction sheets, participant handouts, and hard-copy transparencies. A separate &quot;Teacher Education Profile (TEP)  User's Guide,&quot; dated December 1989, with related and non-duplicative content, has been appended. (JD)",

        "description":"Feminist pedagogy is characterized by a sustained effort to acknowledge the dialectical relationship between the learner and that which is to be learned. In a feminist classroom the teacher insists upon the integration of personal experience and affective response with subject matter, discourages students from being passive recipients of knowledge, and works to create a learner-centered and learner-active environment. The hypothesis of this research project was that one semester of exposure to feminist pedagogical practices could improve, in a quantitatively demonstrable way, the self-esteem of female students, their interest in and liking for the subject matter, and their willingness to continue in higher education. The participants were 20 postsecondary teachers and students of  sociology, physics, French and English language and literature, computer science, and early childhood education. The overall objectives of the feminist pedagogy was to empower the students as active participants in the learning process, to incorporate a learning method more comfortable for female students, and to help students integrate learned materials into their own thought processes. The pedagogical practices included self-disclosure (interviews and journals), peer support partnerships, writing-to-learn strategies, and collaborative course units. Although the hypothesis of the study was not proven, qualitative data in the form of interviews with the participating teachers and analysis of their records of pedagogical intervention in the experimental classes strongly suggest that there  were improvements in a number of areas which bear upon the original hypothesis. Appendixes include letters, tests, and explanations of qualitative measures used in the project. (JD)",

In an attempt to construct an instrument for measuring the attitudes of faculty, administrators, and staff members toward their staff development programs, a 44-item survey was administered to 64 respondents during May 1990. The sample was drawn from the school districts participating in the East Mississippi Center for Educational Development, a 21-district effort to meet educational reform requirements and improve teaching. The Cronbach alpha coefficient was .6954. The standardized-item alpha was .7367. As a result of this analysis, it was determined that the instrument was a  reliable measure of staff development attitudes. Analysis of variance completed the comparisons for demographics: age, gender, level, experience, and position. Further research utilizing this instrument is presently underway. (Author/JD)",

Mentors pass on to beginning teachers, through their teaching and discussions with the beginning teachers, many messages about teaching and learning in an urban context. Yet, as with the existing but often competing and conflicting rules that govern junior high dances and lead to uncertain expectations and outcomes, there are conflicting ideas about what mentoring is supposed to lead to. Most notable in the data are conflicts mentors experience in fitting role expectations with role  enactment and the difficulties of criticizing beginners' teaching practices. Two conditions of the work, the limited time available to mentors and the norms governing the work, add to the conflicts. An implication of the study is that mentors could provide a model for beginning teachers by showing how their own struggles to overcome the dilemmas of their practices result in worthwhile experiences in which they study and learn about teaching over time.

The purpose of the study was to assess program impact on a matched sample of 227 entering and graduating teacher candidates from a 5-year data bank (1984-89). The indicators focus on the commonalities across 5-year programs in early, middle, secondary, and special education and 4-year programs in physical, art, music, and theater education. Indicators of program quality assess the  acquisition of a liberal education, pedagogical knowledge, development of pedagogical reasoning, and other valued outcomes (self-efficacy, conception of teaching, professional beliefs, multicultural sensitivity, and teaching commitment). Measures include five program-developed instruments, three nationally developed standardized tests, and one state-developed observational instrument. Instruments include standardized paper and pencil tests, self-report measures, and both high- and low-inference classroom observational ratings. The goals of the project are to identify the underlying conceptions of teaching embedded in the teacher education program, to determine valid indicators of program quality, and to design a comprehensive teacher education data-based plan which contains these  conceptions and indicators. Appendixes comprise the greater part of the document. An analysis of interviews, the interview guide and prompts, an analysis of the surveys, and a description of the measures used for indicators of teacher education program quality are appended.

The experiences recounted focus on a course entitled \"Advanced Child Development for Teachers,\" a university requirement for inservice teachers studying for their master's degree. The primary goal of the course was that students would come to terms with the possibility of learning as a constructivist process that includes the active participation of the learner in the process of meaning-making. A second goal was that the teachers become conscious of themselves as  teacher-researchers, rather than as passive recipients of received wisdom about pedagogy. The classroom was intended to foster a nurturing environment; the assignments included a reflective dialogue journal. The paper presents excerpts from the journals of both students and professor. The excerpts reveal the difficulties involved in developing a self-reflexive pedagogy and the professor's feelings of failure and inadequacy. (JD)",

The successful program tries to identify and meet the instructional and noninstructional individual needs of beginning teachers and to develop their personal strengths. Such a program must recognize that the concerns of a first-year teacher are not always specifically associated with actual instruction and usually involve nonteaching duties, administrative details, human relation skills, and job perception difficulties. To help fashion a needs-based developmental model a number of decisions must be made to fit the characteristics of  the school system. The size, geographical restrictions, and financial resources of the school system will influence the scope of the components. To serve as a possible guideline, a continuum of decision areas that should be considered is presented, as well as a list of the goals and critical components of this type of induction program. A 3-page chart detailing the elements of local needs-based induction decisions is included. (JD)",

Education is seen as an agent of social change with various national approaches having common concerns and facing similar key issues to be resolved. In the second section, changes and responses in teacher education to societal concerns are considered. Among the major issues for resolution are the need for new approaches to teacher training, the career development of teachers, and the need for support services. Recruitment and selection of teachers is critically important worldwide, and the initial preparation of teachers and their continuing professional development are seen as key factors in improving education at all  levels. Section 3 deals with the means of response to the need for change. Pre- and inservice training are discussed with a focus on the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to teacher education. Incentives and barriers in inservice education are considered along with different modes of inservice education. The final section discusses the importance of evaluation for program improvement, accountability, and the selection and promotion of teachers. (JD)",

        "description":"Much of the literature concerning the challenges facing beginning teachers treats their problems as generic in nature. While researchers acknowledge the different problems encountered by beginning teachers, they often fail to take into account the varied knowledge, skills, beliefs, and dispositions which prospective teachers bring to their first years from their preservice teacher education programs. Further, many studies of beginning teachers are initiated in the fall of their first year of teaching; hence, they do not track the student teaching experience and novices' newly developed strengths and unresolved problems. This paper draws on data collected from eight student teachers who had completed programs of secondary English teacher education (four at a small midwestern  liberal arts college and four at a large southeastern university). The discussion: (1) focuses on the student teachers' knowledge, skills, beliefs, and dispositions as they begin their first year of teaching; (2) speculates about the sorts of induction programs that would most benefit these teachers; and (3) poses questions, for those developing induction programs, that will move these programs to more constructivist positions.

        "description":"The relationship between job performance and job satisfaction was evaluated using a longitudinal model. During the winter quarter of 1987, approximately 2,000 students at the University of Tennessee (Knoxville) received a student satisfaction survey designed to measure student opinions about programs and services at the university and department levels as well as classroom experiences. The response rate was 63%. During the 1987-88 academic year, slightly more than 1,800 seniors took a required test of general educational knowledge and skills. A total of 314 students had completed both the student satisfaction survey as juniors in 1987 and the senior survey in 1988. The combined data were then matched with student records to obtain additional data on students' pre-college  characteristics (American College Test scores, grade point average, gender, and race). Results indicate that a substantial proportion of the association between performance and satisfaction is an artifact of other variables. The results indicate that satisfaction has a greater influence on performance than performance has on satisfaction. This finding runs counter to theories and research about work performance and satisfaction and also calls into question the causal ordering of many of the models used to explain student attrition and persistence.

A total of 138 right-handed adolescents and young adults (aged 14 to 22 years), who were gifted in music, mathematics, or dance, were tested on two tasks of music and one task of speech perception. Focus was on studying the comparative nature of laterality patterns for music and speech perception among heterogeneously talented students. Also studied were the responses of the cerebral hemispheres to sensory stimuli and the role talent training might play in shaping ear asymmetry. Ear asymmetry for the musically gifted students seemed largely task dependent. The mathematics students possessed procedural knowledge without task content  mastery, a finding that is consistent with learning taxonomies that position the skill of knowledge hierarchically before that of analysis. Results also suggest that, although each hemisphere appeared to prefer processing in differentiated form (&quot;parts&quot; for the left and &quot;wholes&quot; for the right), the two hemispheres functioned in collaboration. These findings emphasize the usefulness of initiating research combining neuroscientific and educational parameters. (SLD)",

This methodology allowed the evaluation of whether any such differences could be attributed to differences in item position after controlling for the background effect of scale drift on b-values. Usable real or scored items in a large licensure examination were selected for study. The final sample consisted of 406 administration difference pairs. For each item, a record was created containing: (1) administration dates; (2) item positions for several administrations ending with July 1987; (3)  classification code; (4) type of administration (real or tryout); and (5) b-value and standard error. The block-wise placement of tryout items had no apparent effect on their b-values. Neither differences in booklet nor test item locations were significantly associated with differences in b-values across consecutive pairs of administrations. A small but significant increase in b-value differences in pairs having earlier administration (between February 1981 and July 1986) suggested that scale drift increased over this period.

The activities of the project have been divided into two categories. The first category is concerned with identifying fundamental learning abilities by determining how learners differ in their abilities to think, remember, solve problems, and acquire knowledge and skills. A four-source framework is adopted which assumes that observed learner differences are due to differences in processing speed; processing capacity; and the breadth, extent, and accessibility of conceptual  knowledge and procedural skills. The second category of research activities is concerned with validating new models of learning abilities. To do this, several computerized intelligent tutoring systems have been built that serve as mini-courses in technical areas, such as computer programming and troubleshooting electrical circuits. A major objective of this part of the program is to develop principles for producing indicators of student learning progress and achievement. These indicators will serve as learning outcome measures for ability test validation. Four figures and a 76-item list of references are included. (Author/TJH)",

Although many adaptive allocation procedures have been proposed for clinical trials, few have actually used adaptive assignment, largely because classical frequentist measures of inference are difficult or impossible to calculate when the allocation is adaptive. The general problem of making inferences in classical trials, whether randomized, adaptive, or open, is discussed; and Bayesian inference is described as being well-suited to the scientific method. Bayesian analyses of adaptive and other studies are illustrated with examples drawn from the following studies: (1) a study by R. H. Bartlett and others (1985) involving  12 patients; (2) a 39-patient study by J. H. Ware (1989); and (3) a study by D. O. Dixon and others (1989) involving 16 patients.

During 1989-90, data were collected on 1,196 college students at California State University (Fullerton), some of whom were enrolled in courses specifically designed to improve CT skills. Instructor-related factors were also evaluated for their impact on CT skill development. Regression models were developed for predicting CCTST results. Relationships between reading ability and native English language ability and the CCTST were also examined. CT skills could be predicted by a  combination of verbal Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) score, mathematics SAT score, and grade point average. CCTST results correlated positively with reading test scores for vocabulary, comprehension, and total score. Non-native English speakers showed virtually no gains in CT skills from pretest to posttest. Only instructor years of teaching experience and recent experience teaching CT skills were related to CCTST results. No evidence was found to suggest that improvement in CT skills is a natural outgrowth of baccalaureate education; skills improvement did result from courses targeting such skills. Twelve tables provide study data. (SLD)",

        "description":"The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) issued two reports in 1990 assessing the nation's current educational abilities in reading and writing. The &quot;Reading Report Card, 1971-88&quot; presented and analyzed results over an 18-year period for ages 9, 13, and 17 years (grades 4, 8, and 11, respectively). The 9-year-olds and 13-year-olds were significantly more likely to reach the basic difficulty level than were their 1971 predecessors. However, the report contained frightening information about the nation's students' chances of functioning competently in today's complex society. The writing report, &quot;The Writing Report Card, 1984-88,&quot; which in fact ranges across testing from 1974 to 1988, enabled the NAEP to conclude that there has been no change in writing performance  over the 14-year period. Relatively more positive than the reading report, the writing report still raised questions about the recent emphasis on the writing process and how reading and writing reports may be related. Among the positive findings of both reports were gains for Blacks and Hispanics in some reading areas and relative improvement for some minority groups in writing. Overall, however, the reports do not provide an encouraging picture of the reading and writing competence of the nation's youth. (SLD)",

(2) what are some reasons for the decline that has taken place in information gathering activity? and (3) how far does the problem in information gathering extend? Federally sponsored research and information gathering in the area of education has decreased dramatically, with a shift from data production toward dissemination and the investigation of fewer educational areas. A review conducted in 1987 established that the lack of economic resources was the major factor, in conjunction with the changes in congressional mandates, leadership, and educational priorities. Since that review, further declines have been noted. The review processes  of the Office of Management and Budget also influence education information, narrowing the types of data collection approved. The use of local data requires major organizational efforts, and still bears many limitations. Recent developments suggest that the search for quality educational information is improving, but sizable efforts are required to properly assess the seemingly accessible world of schools, teachers, and students.

Findings are presented of an evaluation of the procedure conducted in Victoria (Australia) between 1981 and 1984. This procedure, called &quot;consensus moderation,&quot; compares teachers' assessments with clear criteria for the assessment tasks, criteria that were developed by groups of teachers. The procedure requires teachers from different schools to meet in groups of 10 to 12 at least 3 times per year with the aim of aligning grades with quality of work. Members of the Australian evaluation team directly observed the work of 6 of 30 consensus moderation groups for the first 4 years of their operation. The team also participated in  central meetings and received the results of surveys of geography teachers (n=100), principals, and students. Teachers, and the vast majority of students and principals, were generally confident that the procedure was fair. The process appeared to support teachers by giving weight to their assessments and to reinforce and clarify the links between the models of assessment that teachers chose and their curriculum objectives.

        "description":"A study was conducted of four urban middle schools in Boston serving 1,600 students, mostly from low-income minority families, to assess urban public school effectiveness. School level practices were the primary focus of the study, but self-reports of classroom teaching behaviors were also studied in relation to student achievement through interviews with 20 to 30 teachers in each school. The study resulted in the creation and validation of indicators that schools can use to assess their climates, set policies for reform, and choose strategies based on research. More than 90% of the students placed a high value on the importance of family and education, recognizing that they were in school to learn and get a good job in the future. Teachers in these schools were well educated and  experienced, but their individual caring was not always mirrored on an institutional level. The most effective school combined emphasis on academic learning with an ethic of caring. Clarity of purpose and positive relationships among teachers were mirrored in higher levels of student achievement, higher rates of prosocial behaviors among students, and lower incidences of antisocial behaviors. Teachers who reported more frequent use of direct teaching and student-led small groups with teacher supervision had students with significantly higher levels of achievement in reading, mathematics, and problem solving. Teachers who reported more frequent use of workbooks and other individual assignments had students with significantly lower levels of achievement. Indicators of input, processes, and  products were developed and are summarized. An important contribution of the study was the development of a measure of higher order thinking and problem solving for students in grades 4 through 8, the Test of Problem Solving (TOPS). In all, 56 tables and 8 figures present the study data. A 208-item list of references is included. Four appendices contain instruments used, including the TOPS. (SLD)",

Thirty examinees were drawn from the pool of existing experienced teachers in Florida. A committee of six to eight experts in each field identified the competencies and skills needed to be an effective teacher. The committee members modified hypothetical examples of EOT tests, which were reviewed by additional experts in the fields, and used the examples in  pilot testing with one teacher from the pool for the furniture repair test and three for the commercial art test. There were three raters for each test. The level of rater agreement was good. Future research will require larger samples to test the methodology proposed.

Twenty-nine items were scored with a 3-point Likert-type format, and four items were scored with a 5-point format. An exploratory maximum likelihood factor analysis with an oblique rotation yielded an 8-factor solution. These factors, consisting of 26 items, were interpreted as: high-risk behaviors; drug use; school issues; infection transmission knowledge; infection prevention knowledge; sex practices; birth  control prevention knowledge; and intrapersonal prevention knowledge. The primary factors were collapsed using a second order maximum likelihood factor analysis to yield four secondary factors for use as instrument scales: (1) drug use; (2) school issues; (3) transmission and infection knowledge; and (4) AIDS prevention knowledge. The items within each factor displayed too little homogeneity or were not present in sufficient quantity to form scales. The survey items have great potential as a standardized instrument, but extensive development work is needed before they can be used as such. Four data tables are included. (SLD)",

Male and female college students (N=189) were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups and a control group. Each experimental condition involved a different type of training strategy (advice, feedback, or advice and feedback) for solving analogies. The training trials were administered in order to establish problem solving schemata during practice. The control group received no training. Following the training trials, a common transfer task was administered to determine whether general and/or specific problem-solving schema were used as the basis for transfer. The first study included a transfer task administered immediately after  training (on-line transfer), while the second study involved a 7-day interval between the training and transfer tasks (memory-based transfer). Results indicate that transfer was superior in the experimental groups of both studies. In addition, on-line processing and memory-based processing produced similar transfer effects. Consequently, the findings support the interpretation that the problem-solving schema established during training was utilized for the transfer task. Three tables and one figure are included.

In 1989, community colleges served about 43% of all students in higher education, many of whom might not be eligible for typical 4-year institutions. For many students, community colleges are an avenue to 4-year colleges. The second article, &quot;The Ford Foundation--ETS Transfer Project,&quot; describes an Educational Testing Service (ETS) program supported by the Ford Foundation to monitor the transfers of students from five community colleges into  four-year institutions. The diversity of the colleges and the transient nature of their student bodies made research difficult, and it is concluded that more information is necessary to help colleges assist students in transferring.

Outcome assessments differ widely in design, measures, and data collection, but they share a common focus on outcomes as individual achievements, statuses, or behaviors. Assessments of special education outcomes often have an evaluative purpose in reflecting how well the special education system in general is performing. The assessment process consists of the following sequence of key activities: (1) identifying key issues and information needs; (2) developing a conceptual framework to guide the assessment; (3) specifying the nature of comparisons to be made; (4) designing and selecting a sample; (5) selecting and operationalizing outcome measures; (6) choosing independent variables to illustrate outcome variations;  (7) selecting data sources and collection methods; (8) choosing appropriate analysis methods; and (9) communicating findings to encourage their use in policy making and program planning.

Each state testing officer was asked about the state's activity or interest in alternatives to multiple-choice testing at the state level, using a relatively inclusive definition of alternative assessment that did not include simple direct writing assessment. About half the states are currently involved in performance assessment to some degree. Most of the activity and interest was found in the areas of math and science, followed by social  studies, expanded writing, and expanded language. Five major areas of concern were noted: (1) costs; (2) logistics; (3) technical aspects; (4) support for implementation of performance-based assessment; and (5) the role of performance-based assessment in a state testing program. In spite of this interest, about 50% of the states were not currently implementing or planning to implement performance-based state assessments for a variety of reasons. One table summarizes selected responses from the states. (SLD)",

The first paper, &quot;The Effects of Testing on Teaching and Learning&quot; (Joan Herman, Shari Golan, and Jeanne Dreyfus), describes a study focusing on standardized, norm-referenced tests. A questionnaire was administered to 85 teachers (kindergarten through grade 12 levels) attending a conference. The 131-item questionnaire was designed to determine: (1) the effects of mandated norm-referenced testing on curriculum and teaching; (2) variables that mediate these effects; and (3) the extent to which the results of testing represent school improvement. The study found that significant pressure on teachers improved test scores, teacher attention to test scores, and instructional time devoted to testing. Teachers did not  report that emphasis on testing was narrowing the curriculum. The second paper, &quot;Psychometricians' Beliefs about Learning&quot; (Lorrie A. Shepard), examined, through interviews, the beliefs of 50 school district test specialists about learning. A majority operated from implicit learning theories encouraging close alignment of tests with curriculum and the judicious teaching of tested content. Beliefs associated with criterion-referenced testing were associated with a model of learning requiring sequential mastery of learning skills and behaviorally explicit testing of each learning step. Two tables and nine figures are appended to the second paper. (SLD)",

To make the illustrations concrete, an actual data set, involving responses of 91 medical school admissions directors to 30 variables, was used. The 30 variables involved perceptions of barriers to medical school with respect to characteristics of medical students. The propensity of researchers to apply statistical significance tests to evaluate how many steps should be implemented is considered. The problems of using statistical significance testing in conjunction with stepwise methods are elaborated, but the emphasis is on better alternatives to stepwise methods. A two-stage approach to variable selection is recommended. If variables must be eliminated, a better procedure is to  compute effect sizes for every possible predictor set using readily available computer software. In the two-stage process, variable selection does not depend on the results in previous steps. The first step is to determine the desired size, &quot;k,&quot; of the predictor variable set. The second step is to select the best predictor set of the desired size, consulting the effect size; however, a better approach would be to select the predictor set based on theory, previous empirical results, or the accessibility of variables in a given set.

Theoretically, coefficient alpha is an estimate of the correlation between two tests drawn at random from a pool of items like the items in the test under consideration. As a practical matter, coefficient alpha can be an index of internal consistency (i.e., an index of the degree to which item response scores correlate with total test scores). Cronbach's procedure is a method of calculating coefficient alpha. Three factors affecting coefficient alpha--total test variance, sum of item variances, and homogeneity of item difficulty--were examined using a mini Monte Carlo model. Small data sets generated by a computer program were used to make the discussion  concrete. By considering bivariate correlation, multiple R correlation, beta-weight, and structure coefficients, total test variance was shown to account for the most variance of coefficient alpha, followed by the standard deviation of item difficulties, and the sum of item variances. Seven tables and three figures illustrate the discussion. (SLD)",

Specific questions about the use of district scores were addressed in a study of three districts involving 3,043 students in grade 3, 3,048 students in grade 5, 3,018 students in grade 8, and 2,046 students in grade 10. Findings indicate that students' scores from NRTs could be used to exempt students from the SSAT, the SSAT-I, and the SSAT-II. The NRT scores identified approximately 75% of students whose SSAT performance was unsatisfactory. The effectiveness of different NRTs used by the districts was similar,  although different cutoff points were necessary and the results varied across grade level. Ten tables contain data from the study. An appendix provides a 15-page table of test scores and 15 scatterplots of the relationships between tests. (SLD)",

This first phase of a two-phase study focused on the IAR's use as a predictor of job performance. The IAR is an empirically keyed biodata inventory containing 112 multiple-choice items. Item content deals with educational background, work-related skills and abilities, and achievements in interpersonal endeavors. All items: deal with an event under the individual's control; have an apparent relevance to job performance; are verifiable; avoid invasion of the individual's privacy; and avoid stereotypes associated with race, sex, or national origin. An exploratory factor analysis was performed on 6,300 job incumbents. The analysis  identified four factors: work competency, scholastic achievement, academic achievement, and leadership skills. Composites consisting of individual IAR items were used as observed indicators of the factors. Twelve composites, three per factor, were formed using 63 items. A specification search was conducted using four models to improve fit and meaning. The fit of one model was cross validated using a sample of 1,600 additional job incumbents. Results indicate that the derived model portrays the underlying content of the IAR model well. Phase II will compare factors and other measurement domains.

        "description":"Three variables (verbal aptitude, listening ability, and notetaking) that may mediate how much college students learn from a lecture were studied. Verbal aptitude was operationalized as a Verbal Scholastic Aptitude Test (VSAT) score. Listening ability was measured as the score on an auditory short-term memory task, using the serial running memory span task. Notetaking was judged by the length of notes students took during a lecture. Initial subjects were 498 students from the psychology department's subject pool at the University of California (Davis). The span task identified subjects with extremely good or very poor recall, resulting in samples of 51 students with low recall and 53 students with high recall. Learning was assessed using multiple-choice and short-answer  examinations. The results provide support for the &quot;encoding&quot; function of notetaking, but only for some individuals. When few notes were taken, the short-answer performance of the high VSAT subjects was very similar to that of other subjects. With brief note lengths, the multiple-choice scores of the middle VSAT subjects were indistinguishable from those of the high VSAT subjects. With longer notes, the performance of these two groups in these test contexts was enhanced. High VSAT subjects performed better on short-answer items if they took medium length notes. Middle VSAT subjects benefited from longer notes when tested via a multiple-choice format, and middle VSAT subjects performed better on short-answer items if they took medium-length, as opposed to brief, notes. In contrast, the low  VSAT subjects' scores were uniformly low, regardless of the amount of notes taken. These findings support an individualized approach to understanding notetaking functions. Two tables and three graphs provide study data. A 36-item list of references is included. (SLD)",

Data are generally shown by calendar or school year for various years from 1976 through 2001. The report also contains a methodology section describing models and assumptions used to develop the national-level and state-level projections. Projections are based on an age-specific enrollment rate model, exponential smoothing models,  and econometric models. The enrollment model uses population estimates and projections from the Bureau of the Census. The exponential smoothing models are based on the mathematical projection of past data patterns into the future. The econometric models use projections of exogenous variables from the Macroeconomic Model of the U.S. Economy, developed by Data Resources, Inc. Most of the projections have three or four alternative sets of assumptions regarding various growth paths. Although the first set of projections is deemed to represent the most likely projections, the other alternatives provide a reasonable range of outcomes. In all, 110 data tables are provided.

The scores on the essay test were less reliable and were susceptible to a significantly larger standard error of measurement than were those on the objective test.

For the first sample, principal components analysis indicated a three-factor solution. A possible third factor was also indicated for the second sample. The factor analyses suggest a general confirmation of the model with a majority of subtests loading on the factors as predicted. However, several clear exceptions were found, indicating that the structural model was not completely  confirmed. Further refinement of the subtests appears necessary.

        "description":"Structural equation modeling has become increasingly popular as a technique for the analysis of non-experimental data in the social sciences. This increase can be traced in part to the development of computer programs that facilitate structural equation modeling. The Linear Structural Relations (LISREL) program is the most widely used tool for implementing structural equation models. LISREL is applicable across a wide range of study, but is most useful in analyzing social science data. Some characteristics of the LISREL program are examined. The general LISREL model is explained along with methods for establishing the identification and goodness-of-fit of the overall model and its individual parameters. It is concluded that the most important aspect of LISREL methodology is its  flexibility; almost any type of problem involving regression or factor analytic procedures can be computed using LISREL. LISREL models should be theory driven, but should not be used to explore the grosser aspects of a theory. LISREL may be seen as a revolutionary synthesis of classical measurement theory/methodology with computer technology. Although LISREL methodology requires a good deal of technical understanding, it currently is in a form that is accessible to a large number of users. (SLD)",

(2) What are citizens getting from U.S. schools? and (3) How does the United States get what is needed? The paper is divided into three sections. The first section, &quot;The Transformation of the American Economy,&quot; examines the following data sources reflecting the skill implications of economic changes: (1) skill trends in employment by occupation; and (2) industry case studies of changes in the nature and structure of work. The second section, &quot;Are We Getting What We Need from Our Schools?&quot; discusses the following questions: (1) What do students need to learn? (2) Who should learn? (3) When should they learn? and (4) How should crucial thinking and work-related skills be taught? This  section summarizes four broad contrasts that raise important questions about educational effectiveness for nonschool activity: (1) individual cognition in school versus shared cognition outside; (2) pure mentation in school versus tool manipulation; (3) symbol manipulation in school versus reasoning in out-of-school contexts; and (4) generalized learning in school versus situation-specific competencies outside. The third section, &quot;How Do We Get What We Need from Our Schools?&quot; endorses an assessment system that clearly signals performance expectations and standards.

        "description":"Early, unplanned childbearing is often harmful for young fathers as well as for young mothers, their children, and society. The development of policies and programs for males who are at risk of becoming or who have already become fathers to children of teenage mothers should recognize and address the needs of young males as well as those of women, children, and taxpayers. This report suggests the following criteria for the continuing development of these policies and programs: (1) they should be concerned with the economic empowerment of the disadvantaged; (2) they should be developmentally appropriate in their services and demands; and (3) they should show explicit concern for issues of sex equity. The report recommends that these criteria be applied in the following three  areas: (1) prevention of unwanted pregnancies; (2) child support; and (3) services for young fathers. Research and interventions are summarized for each area. Strategies discussed include the following: (1) promoting easy access to contraception; (2) addressing needs for education, training, and employment; and (3) developing curricula and staff training methods explicitly to help young fathers participate in various aspects of child rearing and share responsibility for planning and raising families.

Ten days of observations, interviews, and reviews of student records were conducted at eight New York City schools. Of the eight, three were Catholic high schools, two were zoned high schools, and three were special public magnet schools. Less intensive observations were conducted at three schools in Washington (District of Columbia) and two additional schools in New York City. Important similarities were found between the Catholic schools and the special-purpose magnet schools. These schools are referred to as &quot;focus&quot; schools. Focus schools have higher graduation rates than zoned schools, and disadvantaged graduates of focus  schools perform better on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) than disadvantaged graduates of zoned schools. The following key features of focus schools could be reproduced in public schools to the benefit of low-income students: (1) concentration on student outcomes before all other matters; (2) strong social contracts that communicate the responsibilities of administration, students, and teachers and establish the benefits that each group receives; (3) strong commitment to parenting and molding student attitudes and values; (4) centripetal curricula that draw all students, regardless of ability and preference, toward learning core skills and perspectives; (5) flexibility to change programs to meet emerging needs; (6) staff recruitment and orientation that protect and sustain staff's  distinctive character; and (7) accountability to parents, students, neighborhood and parish groups, and financial supporters.

The academies are supported by three-way partnerships between the local school, local business, and the State of California. Evaluation information was gathered from a telephone survey of June 1988 graduates of 8 of the  12 academies operating from 1985 through 1988. The following findings are reported: (1) fewer academy students dropped out in their senior year than students in a comparison group of regular high school students; (2) most graduates of both the academies and the regular schools are continuing their education and somewhat more academy graduates are enrolled in degree programs; (3) about two-thirds of both academy and regular school graduates are working about 30 hours per week but, among those graduates who both work and attend school, the academy graduates began with higher wages than the regular graduates and the wage difference between the two groups increased over time; and (4) both groups reported being &quot;fairly well&quot; satisfied with their high school preparation and achievements since  graduation.

The survey was designed to ascertain parents' involvement in their children's schooling based on parental knowledge, reasons for school choice, expectations and personal background characteristics, and perceptions of the school chosen. These data are useful in determining the extent to which parents interact with a school of choice, which is thought to have a significant impact on the academic and social performance of their children. The report is introduced by a discussion of the conceptualization of the survey instrument, based on the research literature, the rationale for selecting the research  methodology used, and an explanation of the researchers' approach to scale construction. The main analytic tools were factor analysis, followed by reliability analysis, to assess further the internal consistency of the resulting dimensions. The report also explains how the survey was administered, describes its parent population, and suggests how the instrument could be modified for future use.

This publication contains five case studies that demonstrate how teachers and schools have responded to the needs of their minority group students. The first case study, &quot;Bilingual Education in a Bilingual Community,&quot; describes a Spanish/English program that incorporates the parents' goal of a bilingual program in the context of quality education. The second study, &quot;One Full Curriculum Shared by Two Languages,&quot; describes a joint effort by an English-speaking teacher and a Cambodian teacher to provide a well-rounded program for Cambodian students, despite a lack of materials and Cambodian-speaking personnel. Study 3, &quot;Schooling a Transient  Population of Japanese,&quot; describes an effective bilingual program for small numbers of students at each grade level, and study 4, &quot;An Introduction to English Language and Culture Through Technology,&quot; describes a high school English-as-a-Second-Language class that uses word processing to teach literacy to Vietnamese students. Finally, the fifth case study, &quot;Good Bilingual Education Is Good Education: The Case of a Kindergarten Teacher,&quot; describes a kindergarten Cantonese bilingual classroom based on high expectations and research-based teaching strategies. The report concludes by discussing the impact and flexibility of TBE and the observed characteristics of the teachers involved in the program. Typically, these teachers: (1) have a strong sense of commitment and advocacy; (2) do work  that goes beyond teaching; (3) care a great deal about their students; (4) have a good understanding of students' backgrounds; (5) have high expectations; and (6) teach in a way that focuses on learning first, and on learning language second.

The program used a &quot;whole language&quot; approach to grammar and composition instruction and also included instruction in preemployment skills. Five evaluation criteria were developed based on student pre- and post-program performance on the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (CBTS) and on class attendance. The program failed to meet four of the five objectives. Results indicate that: (1) clients who attended 75 percent of the program failed to demonstrate a gain of at least one grade equivalent from pretest to posttest; (2) clients who  attended 75 percent of the program did not improve objective-level mastery by 30 percent from pretest to posttest; (3) 80 percent of the clients who attended 75 percent of the program failed to score 70 percent or higher on the posttest; and (4) 90 percent of the clients who entered the program did not attend at least 75 percent of the program. Clients who attended 75 percent of the program did appear to show greater improvement from pretest to posttest, satisfying the fifth objective, but lack of posttest data prevented statistical analysis.

The Chicago School Reform Act of 1988 created a radical shift in authority from the central bureaucracy to the LSCs, empowering the LSCs to set educational policy and govern schools. The councils hire and evaluate the principal, advise on important issues, including curriculum, textbook selection, and discipline, and approve a school improvement plan and budget. Meetings at eight elementary schools and four high schools were observed for the second half of the school year. The 12 schools are representative of the school system as a whole in terms of racial composition, size, and geographic location. The following summary findings are reported: (1) the average  attendance rate for LSC members was 70 percent and attendance varied greatly from one council to another; (2) the average LSC discussed six different topics in each meeting, including the school program, LSC organization, building security and safety, finance, personnel, and parent and community involvement; and (3) discussions about overcrowding, school improvement planning, principal selection and contract, and safety, security, and discipline generated the highest participation by LSC membes.

        "author":["Ascher, Carol"],
        "description":"Performance-based assessment has the potential to support a richer curriculum and more accurately assess the skills of low-income minority students than standardized tests. Performance-based assessment has the following advantages: (1) it allows a wide range of expression; (2) it permits assessment of learning in a natural context while students make active use of a skill; (3) it assesses a wide range of competencies; (4) it requires students to demonstrate mastery in a personal and integrated way; and (5) it has &quot;ecological validity,&quot; because students perform as they will have to in life. The following types of performance-based assessments are described: (1) station activities, which require students to proceed through a series of discrete tasks, either individually or in  teams, in a given amount of time; (2) domain projects, which require students to complete a set of exercises designed to explore an idea, concept, or practice central to a particular academic or artistic domain; (3) portfolios, which consist of several projects completed in a sequence to show progress with a subject; and (4) videotapes, which can show students performing or being interviewed. While performance-based assessment methods appear to be reliable, such assessments are expensive to score when compared to mechanically scored standardized tests. Moreover, there are indications that performance-based tests might result in lower scores for low-income and minority students unless there were accompanying changes in teaching methods. Finally, the pressure for mandated performance-based  testing could still result in narrowly focused teaching geared to the new assessment methods. A list of 13 references is appended. (FMW)",

        "description":"Schools have introduced numerous programs and activities, intended to recognize the achievements of ethnic groups, in the belief that a multicultural education prepares students for life in an ethnically diverse society and also results in cognitive and affective benefits. Multicultural activities have the following goals: (1) to remedy ethnocentrism in the traditional curriculum; (2) to build understanding among racial and ethnic groups, and appreciation of different cultures; (3) to defuse interracial tensions and conflicts; and (4) to make the curriculum relevant to the experiences, cultural traditions, and historical contributions of minority groups. Studies also indicate links between multicultural education and improved academic achievement for African American and Hispanic  American students. Most multicultural learning activities consist of discrete lessons organized around particular events. These activities may be confined to a particular classroom or can involve the entire school. Project Respecting Ethnic and Cultural Heritage (REACH) is a comprehensive, discipline-based multicultural program that infuses information on the history and culture of various groups into the middle school curriculum. Portland (Oregon) and Albuquerque (New Mexico) have also developed programs that integrate multicultural activities throughout the curriculum. The following considerations in developing interdisciplinary programs are outlined: (1) needs assessment; (2) goals; (3) curriculum development; and (4) staff development. A list of nine references and a list of four  resources are appended. (FMW)",

Thirteen of these schools were demonstration sites, receiving intensive support from 70001 for WAVE teacher training and program assistance for first-year implementation. The WAVE is a carefully designed, multicomponent program that addresses the nationally documented needs of young people in grades 9 through 12 whose circumstances dim their prospects for academic and personal success. The components of the WAVE include a 4-year sequential curriculum designed to promote positive peer group experiences and encourage student participation and involvement; teacher training and  development focusing on equipping teachers to work with the innovative and interactive curriculum and multicomponent program; and a motivational component, the WAVE Career Association, which is designed to provide students with opportunities to apply key concepts from the curriculum and to develop leadership skills. This report on first-year implementation of the program at the 13 demonstration sites comprises the following sections: (1) WAVE program environments; (2) findings about WAVE students, teachers, curriculum, and program activities; (3) conclusions; (4) recommendations; and (5) summaries of site visits.

        "description":"This study examines the individual and social costs associated with dropping out of high school in the North Central Region of the United States. Dropouts incur personal costs in the form of reduced earnings, higher chances of being unemployed, and higher likelihood of involvement with crime. Social costs appear in the form of lower total productivity of the labor force, lower tax collections, and higher needs for public services such as welfare, health, and employment services. Statistical data were analyzed from the 1980 U.S. Census and national dropout research. The following findings are reported: (1) graduates show higher earnings than dropouts; (2) dropouts show higher unemployment rates than graduates; (3) dropouts are three times more likely than graduates to live in  poverty; (4) dropouts are overrepresented in the populations served by public services; (5) dropouts report higher public assistance subsidies than do graduates; and (6) a higher proportion of dropouts than graduates reported serious trouble with the law. The paper concludes that enough is known about the individual and social costs of dropping out of school to justify additional public attention to the problem.

        "description":"This guide for Hispanic American parents offers practical advice on how to help their children succeed and how to improve their children's schools. Education is important because in today's service and technically oriented economy, education means the difference between a well-paying, stable job and a low-paying unstable job. In the next 10 years, Hispanic Americans will make up 15 percent of new job seekers and two-thirds of the new jobs will require a high school diploma while one-third of the new jobs will require a college degree. However, over one-third of Hispanic Americans drop out of high school and only about 12 percent earn a college degree. Even for those students who finish school, it is important to keep learning new skills because the world keeps changing. Labeling  a child as &quot;at risk&quot; of dropping out on the basis of his home background results in blaming the victim and does nothing to help the child. Parents and schools can work together to improve the educational experiences of all students. The following steps to parent participation are outlined in the form of pointers addressed directly to parents: (1) attend to your child's basic health and nutritional needs and help with homework; (2) participate in school events and parent-teacher conferences; (3) volunteer to work in the school as a teacher's aide, a community liaison, or a planner of special events; and (4) become an advocate for school improvement by joining or starting a parent group. Many schools already have some type of parent committee operating. Sometimes, however, Latino parents  may not feel comfortable in these groups or the group may meet at a time when it is impossible for them to attend. In that case, chances are good that other Latino parents feel the same way, and suggestions are offered for such parents to start a Latino subgroup or an entirely new group of Latino parents. A list of parent groups and lists of discussion questions are included. A list of 13 references and a brief description of ASPIRA are appended. (FMW)",

Eight witnesses, including college educators and students, presented information about the extent and causes of, and possible solutions to, the apparent increase in the number of incidents. Panelists varied slightly in their perception of which group or groups are the primary victims of campus bigotry, but all agreed that a serious problem existed. They differed in their interpretation of how bigotry is expressed, varying from open harassment of minority group members to insensitivity resulting in strained racial relations. Although the number of incidents and \"alerts\" (i.e., formal notifications of tensions or conflicts) reported to various public and  private agencies has increased significantly over the past five years, panelists were divided as to the reasons for the increase. The following causes of campus bigotry were cited: (1) deficiencies on college campuses that exacerbate existing tensions; (2) society's failure to keep up with change; (3) competition for limited resources; and (4) extremist speakers. Recommendations for improvement fell into the following categories: (1) on-campus and off-campus resources; (2) multicultural training; (3) federal support and involvement; and (4) the dilemma of balancing free speech with restrictions on inflammatory speech.

This report evaluates the effectiveness of the program in improving student self-esteem, appreciation of teachers, confidence to improve grades, and the determination to succeed in school. The report describes implementation activities of the program; assesses its strengths, weaknesses, and effectiveness; and  synthesizes recommendations of program staff and students for enhancing program effectiveness. The evaluation answers research questions involving the following areas and issues: (1) curriculum content of the program; (2) staff perception of factors limiting academic performance; (3) staff perception of staff training effectiveness; (4) student attendance rates; (5) perceived strengths among program characteristics; (6) perceived weaknesses among program characteristics; (7) program impact on student self-esteem and attitudes toward school; and (8) staff and student recommendations for program improvement.

        "description":"Three fundamental changes in state focus are needed to improve urban education and prepare many more students to participate in society and the world. First, state boards of education must act upon the belief that all children can learn. Urban students need rigorous, top-quality curricula and instruction delivered by highly trained and competent teachers. When states and schools believe that only a few urban students are capable of mastering a challenging curriculum and employ tracking and ability grouping, many urban students are given a watered-down curriculum in classrooms where the main goal is discipline and order. Second, state boards of education must view students as inseparable from their families and communities. State policies must hold urban schools accountable for  forming close working partnerships with families and others in the community. Many urban students will never succeed in even the best schools unless they receive assistance with nonacademic problems such as family conflicts, employment, health and others. It is not surprising that children who are hungary, neglected, or in poor health have trouble learning. More personal support and services, as well as better integration of school and community, are needed to help urban students and families to become better educated and better skilled. Third, state boards of education must aggressively pursue strategies that provide additional resources to urban schools, and many urban districts must spend additional money in order to improve. In many instances, property taxes do not provide adequate  funding for improvements. State boards should encourage shifts in resource allocation from property taxes to other state revenue sources to ensure adequate funding. Statistical data are presented in one graph.

Employees who had completed JTPA programs and were working for these employers were also surveyed (386 of 551 responded). Despite problems in data collection and lack of congruence between employer and employee responses, some conclusions were reached: (1) employers' attitudes toward the importance of wage subsidies declined during the 3 years surveys had been conducted; (2) employers who paid higher wages and offered benefits were more likely to retain employees; (3) wage subsidies were  helpful in encouraging employers to offer higher wages; (4) employers viewed productivity of JTPA program terminees and non-JTPA employees as about equal; and (5) the percentage of employers who say the benefits outweigh the costs of hiring dropped from 51 percent to 33 percent in the past 3 years.

Methods included telephone interviews with 46 state managing agencies for JTPA, 205 service delivery area administrators, and 209 Private Industry Council chairpersons. The study showed that everybody believes in collaboration and acknowledges it is necessary, but many policymakers have been unsuccessful in promoting policies that favor it; likewise, administrators admit that collaborating with other programs has been an elusive goal. The study found that some barriers could be removed and some inducements made to encourage collaboration. Recommendations include the  following: (1) the state must set clear and coherent employment policy aimed at increasing the number of jobs in the state and preparing its citizens for them; (2) a single state council should be used to develop policy across a broad range of human services; (3) state policy should require joint planning among human resources agencies at the local level; (4) the state Employment Service and the state JTPA should allow credit for job placement to be shared among agencies; and (5) the vocational education system must develop programs that better meet the needs of nontraditional students.

        "description":"Project POWER is a workplace literacy program conducted by Triton College. The project offers courses in English as a Second Language (ESL) and Adult Basic Education (ABE) to employers who are willing to pay their employees for half their class time and for 15 percent of the instructional costs. By the end of January 1990, the project had conducted 53 courses for 11 employers, enrolling 465 employees. Recommended practices were followed in planning and conducting the courses, including conducting a literacy skill audit for each company and incorporating company-specific materials in instruction. Students completed evaluation questionnaires at the end of each course and most of their responses were positive. Pre- and post-testing were conducted for almost all courses. The average  gain for ESL students was half a grade level. The ABE students improved an average two-thirds to 1.5 grade equivalent. These gains are consistent with the 48 hours of instruction provided. The evaluation showed that, overall, the project achieved its objectives. However, the &quot;literacy skills profile&quot; that was specified was not created, and it could not be determined whether the objective to increase performance to levels established in the profile was achieved. (ESL and literacy assessment summaries and evaluation forms are appended.) (KC)",

It uses as an example the People's Republic of China to demonstrate how economic motivations can best serve the cause of adult literacy and suggests applying these concepts to India. The paper is organized in three parts. In the first part, the general nature of human motivations and the process of building and sustaining motivations is discussed. This discussion is followed by an analysis of the logic and structure of using economic motivations in adult literacy for development. In the second part, the national effort to use economic motivations in literacy and development in China is described, and the effectiveness of this ongoing effort is evaluated. In the third part, the  possibilities of applying economic motivations for literacy promotion in India are suggested. (KC)",

        "description":"Anecdotal evidence from literacy educators sometimes suggests that many people can do well despite being illiterate; however, this perspective ignores the essential theory of literacy. This theory rests on the premise that the most essential difference between human beings and other creatures is the human ability to make \"symbolic transformations.\" Today the capacity to deal with symbolic transformations (writing) is almost universal. Literacy then can be justified in terms of its essential nature. So construed, literacy is self-justified: literacy for the sake of literacy, as a fulfillment of the human biosocial destiny, and therefore, as a human right. Literacy is \"potential added\" to newly literate people. The essential theory of literacy is linked with the concept of\"symbolic capital.\" This refers to the body of knowledge made possible by literacy that can be owned by individuals, groups, and cultures. An equitable distribution of societal knowledge capital is part of the distributive justice and of the moral social order being sought today. Implications of this theory are that: (1) literacy should be promoted as an essential human right; (2) programs of \"literacy advocacy\" should precede programs of \"literacy teaching\"; and (3) evaluation of the effects of literacy in the informal economy and evaluation of customer satisfaction are important.

        "description":"Accounts differ as to the state of adult literacy education in China. One scholar says that programs are contracting severely, whereas Chinese officials contend that programs are operating with more students and more efficiency. A true picture of literacy education in China depends on research and statistics that are being gathered. The overall tone of this emerging picture is optimistic. China today is conducting the world's largest and most promising experiment in using adult education for social change. However, some problems surface; for example, national aspirations for literacy promotion are now focusing only on the age group 15-40 and thereby making the illiteracy problem shrink to one-third its size. Lessons that can be learned from the Chinese experience include the  following: (1) political commitment to social reform and adult education is necessary; (2) it is possible to bring development to rural areas concurrently with urban areas; (3) policy should be disseminated among the people by catchy slogans and phrases; (4) adult education should be institutionalized; (5) culture is likely to be neglected in societies in which economic deprivations are most acutely felt; and (6) special efforts are needed to bring literacy education to women and minorities.

        "description":"The most important issue of the 1990s is developing visionary leaders who can transform industrial era establishments into \"learning communities of the future.\" Educational reform in the 1950s focused on mathematics and science, and the education reform movements of the early 1980s broadened the spectrum across the curriculum at all levels and for all areas of planning and policymaking. The education reform of the late 1980s differs from earlier efforts in that fundamental restructuring projects are in the early stages of evolution. Critical in future restructuring will be what happens in at least three areas: (1) linking academic and vocational tracks and university parallel and technical programs; (2) linking library and information services, which tend to be separate  functions, and positioning them to enhance mission priorities and restructuring; and (3) linking vocational tracks in schools and technical programs in colleges and institutes with other establishments. Especially critical is the restructuring of vocational, technical, and occupational education, particularly for culturally diverse and special needs populations and in inner-city and rural areas. Access for all potential learners to academic and vocational-technical occupational programs of high quality is essential for improved quality of life and national competitiveness. During the 1990s, the United States must develop the infrastructure to invent human resource development systems that can evolve into learning communities of the future for all people. (Author/KC)",

The business owners' testimony indicated the difficulty they have finding workers who can read, write, and think, and who are willing to be trained. It was also suggested that most of their workers lack a work ethic and that schools should spend more time educating students to find and keep a job and to get along in the real world. The educator's testimony noted the difficulties schools face in having a teacher-student ratio that is small enough to allow supervised work programs, as well as the problems teachers face with students who come from poorly functioning homes and uncaring  parents. Comments from Congressional representatives noted that the federal government wants to help educate and train workers and indicated that the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act contains provisions that could help, but schools and businesses do not always know how they can use the programs provided. Examples of Nevada programs helping to educate students and workers for jobs were presented. Appendixes contain various opening and prepared statements and other materials submitted for the record.

        "description":"A study was conducted to compare the self-directed learning readiness of National Fire Academy (NFA) fire executive development students to the theoretical norm and to other public managers. Procedures included testing 30 NFA fire executive development students with the Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS). The distribution of fire executives' SDLRS scores were compared to the theoretical norm and to a group of 76 public managers. This comparison was made statistically with the chi-square goodness of fit calculation. The findings indicated that the fire executives' distribution of SDLRS scores was statistically higher than the theoretical norm and public managers. Although the fire executives scored higher than the public managers, 30 percent of the fire executives had  only average scores on the SDLRS, which was judged to be unacceptable. This judgment was made because the literature indicated that professionals need a high degree of self-directed learning to be successful. Recommendations included the identification, implementation, and evaluation of a learning contract instructional methodology to be incorporated into the existing fire executive development course. (Includes 16 references and the SDLRS.) (Author/KC)",

        "description":"A study compared the test scores of National Fire Academy (NFA) students who received on-campus classroom instruction and students who received the same instruction delivered by satellite teleconference. Following a review of literature that indicated no significant difference in test scores between on-campus classroom students and teleconference students, a controlled study was set up. The subjects were males between 35 and 55 years of age who held chief officer positions in fire departments around the country. The control group consisted of 34 students attending an executive development course at the NFA, and the experimental group consisted of 35 students attending a teleconference site. The test instrument developed for this study was a criterion-referenced, multiple-choice,  10-item test, examined for reliability and validity. Both groups received identical lectures, one live and one taped. The satellite teleconference group had a mean score of 7.3, whereas the control group had a mean score of 9.6. It is concluded that although the on-campus group scored higher on the test, both groups did learn. The difference may be in student motivation to use the information; however, the study demonstrated that teleconferencing was less effective than classroom instruction. It is recommended that comprehensive instructional development technology should be included in the design and implementation of teleconferences in order to increase learning. (KC)",

The report then provides background and discussion of the bill, cost estimates, the viewpoint of the Veterans' Administration, and a section-by-section analysis of the bill. (KC)",

During the hearing, congressional representatives complained that too many veterans and reserves have to wait months to establish their educational benefits and to get their checks to pay for their schooling. The representatives asked the military officers for suggestions for remedying the situation, and suggestions were offered for improving the system. In addition, suggestions were made for increasing veterans' and reservists'  benefits as an enticement for enlistment and because of rapidly rising educational costs. (KC)",

Begun in October 1986, this program featured basic home nursing instruction and an orientation to the demands and rewards of caregiving. The Caregiver Education and Training (CET) Project included two components. Two integrated home nursing courses demonstrated basic nursing skills to families who cared for an ill, frail, impaired, or older family member in the home. A companion course focused on the psychosocial aspects of caregiving and provided information about community resources. During its 18-month duration, CET offered 65 classes to the community at  no charge. Some 342 individuals representing 221 families and 62 paraprofessionals/professionals participated. Their response was quite favorable. Pretests and posttests demonstrated the acquisition of significant caregiving knowledge and skills. A 60-minute videotape and two teaching guides for the two components of the program were developed. Appendixes include pretests, posttests, and questionnaires. (YLB)",

The purpose of the statement was to facilitate the spread of positive relations between labor and management based on mutual respect and trust. As a next step, the Forum has proposed a model compact for labor-management relations suggesting a new set of obligations and responsibilities that transcend and expand traditional collective bargaining relationships. The issues or practices that should be included in such a compact include: joint commitment to the economic success of the enterprise; joint commitment to the institutional integrity of the  union; commitment by top management to employment security and continuity; worker participation and empowerment; conflict resolution; responsibilities in transforming industrial relations; and public policy principles. For each issue or practice, the Forum has also developed a set of guidelines which is both practical and consistent with the principles adopted earlier by the Forum.

        "description":"This book is designed to provide an introductory understanding of challenges, goals, processes, and procedures for economic developers, particularly economic development volunteers, in rural areas and small towns. Chapter 1 defines economic development and basic terms. Chapter 2 describes major economic, social, and demographic trends that influence the development prospects of small communities and rural areas. Chapter 3 discusses 10 common denominators of success for development organizations and steps in getting started. Common problems are addressed in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 reviews the basics of site selection and describes a 12-step process. Chapter 6 discusses in detail a strategic planning process that is composed of a cycle of eight steps. Focus of Chapter 7 is on the  rationale behind targeting and on data sources and techniques to select target industries. Chapter 8 provides information on business retention, expansion, and creation programs. Chapter 9 describes a comprehensive approach to marketing as applied to economic development based on the strategic planning and targeting frameworks and an understanding of the site selection process presented in earlier chapters. Each chapter concludes with references to books, articles, and organizations that are particularly relevant to the topics covered. Twenty exhibits supplement the text, and a 107-item annotated bibliography lists relevant books, articles, government publications, and development organizations. The book is intended to be a useful reference book for local government officials, community  leaders, educators, and others involved in the community economic development field. (YLB)",

The project was based on the use of multiple strategies to figure out unknown words, the importance of breaking down multisyllabic words, and the necessity of the use of audio in word attack instruction. Three prototype modules with audio input and output capability were developed, featuring use of context, word parts, and spelling patterns or syllabication skills. A Macintosh computer, a MacRecorder sound system, and Telex headphones with microphone were selected. Analysis of pretests and posttests from 50 students at 2 adult literacy sites, as well as comments from participants in the development of courseware, showed  that students were enthusiastic about the use of computerized speech in instruction and made significant gains in word attack skills.

The objective of the project was to improve access to vocational education for adults, women seeking nontraditional employment, and minorities in the local area. The college provided classroom instruction and supervised work experience on the job with the corporate partners; the corporate partners provided capital equipment and staff to facilitate on-the-job training. Corporate partners were involved in the selection of trainees. Ninety-nine students enrolled in the four courses. More than 82% of them  completed the courses and 81.7% of the completers were placed in unsubsidized employment either with the corporate partners or with other firms. The placement rate was about 15 percent lower than original goals because of a downturn in the economy and corporate reorganizations.

        "description":"A project was developed to teach literacy to adult students over 40 years old, using job-related materials in a computer-assisted approach with volunteer tutors. The project used the Penn State Adult Literacy Courseware, consisting of six computer-based modules and an Apple IIGS microcomputer. Volunteer teachers already working with adult students at the test site were recruited for participation in the project and trained in using the courseware. Adult students reading at a sixth-grade level or below who were unemployed or underemployed were targeted for the program. Tutors helped students work on modules that met their needs and interests. Throughout the project and at the end, 13 students and 14 tutors were asked about their attitudes and impressions of the project. Evaluation  indicated that tutors and students showed positive attitudes and interest in the courseware. Many volunteer tutors were able to use the computers and courseware with their students by the end of the project, and students showed gains in reading and writing ability. Many student/tutor pairs were still working with the computers/courseware at the end of the project and planned to continue. The project proved, however, that learning to use computers takes time as well as support for tutors and students. (Sixteen appendices contain responses to the student attitude, student closeout, tutor attitude, and tutor closeout surveys; tutor guidelines; a 29-page program manual; a 35-page tutor's guide to the courseware; responses to the advisory board questionnaire; and guidelines for creating  courseware lessons.)

        "description":"A study measured the effectiveness of traditional classroom instruction versus computer-assisted instruction (CAI) in raising the competency levels of adults enrolled in adult basic education (ABE) classes one grade level for each 80 hours of instruction. Classes were conducted in Indianapolis and Richmond, Indiana, from November 1988 to April 1990. Target population for the study was economically disadvantaged adults, predominantly female, aged 17 to 67; 50 of 149 students completed the program and were compared for the study. Evaluation methodology included classroom observation, student surveys and interviews, reviews of instructional records and materials, joint site meetings, and interviews of project administrators. Testing was conducted upon entry, at 30-day intervals, and  upon exit. The overall average grade level gain for all study completers was 2.2 grades at Indianapolis and 1.96 at Richmond. The overall average grade gain for CAI students was 2.6 grades compared with an average of 1.84 grades for non-CAI students. Older students made greater progress and dropped out less frequently than younger students. According to the study, the major strength of CAI was that students could monitor their own progress and affirm their mastery of skills. The traditional classroom approach often brought back earlier negative experiences for students, although instructors in both classrooms were empathetic and supportive. The study concluded that CAI works well with this population, particularly when there is an appropriate range of software. (KC)",

        "description":"The Women in Machining (WIM) program is a Machine Action Project (MAP) initiative that was developed in response to a local skilled metalworking labor shortage, despite a virtual absence of women and people of color from area shops. The project identified post-war stereotypes and other barriers that must be addressed if women are to have an equal opportunity in machining and other skilled trades. Short-term barriers include sex bias in assessment, testing, and counseling; lack of career information; and math or technical anxiety. Support services are essential to eliminate ongoing barriers, such as lack of affordable child care; lack of information about local industry; sexual harassment and discrimination; family opposition; lack of transportation; and financial hardship. To get  WIM started, MAP has taken deliberate steps to develop contacts with various sectors of the community and to create materials necessary for active recruitment, including a survey of machine shops to identify machinists who are women and people of color; organization of a Committee on Women in Machining; and establishment of high support services. Program experience suggests recommendations for training providers, employers, labor unions, community organizations, policymakers, and women in the trade to recruit and support women in the workplace.

Responses to interview questions asked during site visits to shops in Hampden and Hampshire Counties (Massachusetts) were incorporated into the survey design and content. A total of 209 surveys from respondents in participating shops employing under 100 production workers or line personnel were analyzed. Findings showed that a majority of workers across all three trade areas indicated more or much more usage of high technology skills (computer data entry, operation of computer controlled machinery, computer programming) in the year 2000. Workers affirmed that changes in  technology will require greater math usage and greater usage and higher levels of reading skills on the job. The majority had attended at least one upgrading course and strongly agreed that they wanted to advance their skills. Most saw usage of problem-solving skills increasing. Recommendations for policy changes focused on the importance of basic skills; importance of technical skills; curriculum restructuring; worker participation in training design; equity and access issues; and development of apprenticeship models. Issues requiring further research were raised. (23 references; 17 tables; 5 graphs) (YLB)",

Using a team approach to coordinated health care, the guide involves the patient and family as key members of the care team along with the physician, nurse, dietitian, psychologist, social worker, and exercise physiologists. The guide offers training to provide medical, educational, and psychosocial support to help adolescents achieve optimal health and successful transitions to adult care. Selected by a team of pediatric endocrinologists in a Develop A CurriculUM (DACUM) workshop, the major duties focus on diabetes, but the resulting profile provides a general model for chronic illness. Results from a  task verification survey instrument sent to 100 randomly selected members of the American Diabetes Association indicate the professionals' perceived importance of tasks presented relative to training outcomes. Tasks teach how to: (1) maintain contact; (2) provide individualized care; (3) provide education; (4) improve patient's health; (5) ensure appropriate equipment; (6) provide psychological support; (7) address economic and social needs; (8) foster community awareness; (9) maintain professionalism; and (10) keep patient records.

In Phase 1 of the study, a literature review was undertaken, and interviews were conducted with human resource directors in 58 companies in the Pacific Northwest nominated as exemplary in their work with entry-level workers. Employers reported shortages in numbers of qualified applicants for entry-level positions and concern over basic skills deficiencies. Nine areas of promising practices were identified: employee involvement; child care; family and community concerns; recruiting; training; supervision; motivation; business-education partnerships; and handicapped and special needs employees. Phase 2 consisted of a written survey of entry-level workers in randomly  sampled companies in Hawaii and Oregon. It focused on their views regarding characteristics of today's work force, their perceived training needs, relevance of their high school training, ways to improve workplace quality, and their assessment of the relative importance of various worker benefits. Over 80 percent indicated they liked the place where they worked and got along with supervisors and peers. Recommendations to improve the workplace included improved pay and benefits; different management style; improved teamwork; and improved training. Recommendations were made regarding implementation of promising practices. (Ten references and preliminary findings are appended.) (YLB)",

Its purpose was to enhance job skills and secure retail sales jobs for high school juniors with moderate learning, speech, emotional, or intellectual disabilities. Project STARS was implemented at 7 school sites in Queens with 83 students and 7 coordinators. Written surveys collected information from 72 students and 6 coordinators in the fall semester and 73 students in the spring semester on Likert-type scales; coordinators were interviewed in the spring. Findings indicated that Project  STARS satisfactorily implemented three program areas: curriculum development, classroom instruction, and workshops. Fall semester students liked the prospect of employment, social support, and knowledge gained. Spring semester students were more pleased with interpersonal relations but less pleased about employment prospects. Fall students suggested more trips and hands-on experiences. Spring students wanted more involvement. More than 94 percent of students reported their level of knowledge and/or self-esteem was positively affected by instruction or workshops. More than 38 percent reported they acquired jobs. (YLB)",

This overview of practice in family and intergenerational literacy programs identifies trends, issues, and concerns and offers recommendations. The first chapter presents background information including definitions and purposes for family and intergenerational programs. It describes the sponsorship of programs and the motivations that justify program development. The next chapter describes research from the fields of adult and emergent literacy, cognitive science, early childhood education, and family systems theory. Chapter 3 details programs in five sectors: adult basic education, libraries, family English  literacy, preschool and elementary education, and corporate programs. The fourth chapter presents a typology for classification of family and intergenerational literacy programs based on the mode of program intervention and the target population that receives the services. Advantages and disadvantages of four program types are presented: (1) Direct Adults-Direct Children; (2) Indirect Adults-Indirect Children; (3) Direct Adults-Indirect Children; and (4) Indirect Adults-Direct Children. Examples of specific programs, critical research questions, and recommendations are provided.

        "author":["Robertson-Smith, Mary"],
        "description":"Articulation, the coordination of curricula at different levels of education in order to improve efficiency and effectiveness, has become increasingly important in secondary and postsecondary vocational-technical education. Among the types of articulation being practiced are time-shortened models, advanced skills models, and tech-prep models. Program articulation can be between individual secondary and postsecondary institutions, among groups of schools in a consortium, between two-year and four-year colleges, or between educational institutions and nonschool agencies that have training needs. Administrative policies and procedures regarding admissions, advanced placement credit, assessment, and transfer also need to be articulated. Five types of school-to-school articulation  models currently exist: (1) tech-prep programs, in which the last 2 years of secondary vocational training are articulated with the first 2 years of postsecondary education; (2) cooperative education; (3) proprietary schools; (4) retention of at-risk students; and (5) college-to-college articulation. Three forms of nonschool partnerships are business and industry arrangements with educational institutions for training for their workers; government agencies providing career development for public employees through colleges; and the awarding of credit for military training. Factors that inhibit successful articulation are institutional policies and procedures, negative attitudes and resistance, and poor communication. Successful arrangements can be achieved through local and state  leadership, involvement of key personnel, consensus on goals and purpose, formal written agreements, and positive human relations.

        "description":"To help vocational education administrators and practitioners, this paper presents a framework for vocational education program evaluation. Evaluation is defined as the act of rendering judgments to determine a program's value; two major types are formative and summative. Vocational education evaluation should take a broader and more comprehensive approach than a focus on student achievement. This approach requires use of valid and reliable information of three interrelated types: needs, processes, and outcomes. The needs for vocational education include students' interests, knowledge, attitudes, and skills; the knowledge, attitudes, and skills employers want in employees; and the educational, economic, and social needs of society. Sources of information about vocational  education program processes include: (1) organizational information; (2) program information; (3) support services and activities; (4) staff; (5) student demographic characteristics and educational achievement; and (6) community information. Also part of the evaluation framework are economic outcomes (labor force participation, employment and unemployment rates, training-related placement, type of employment, earnings, employee satisfaction with work, employer satisfaction with employees); educational outcomes (academic and higher-order thinking skills, knowledge of the world of work, occupational skills, school attendance and dropout rates, continuing education rates, satisfaction with education); and psychosocial outcomes (aspirations, attitudes, values, self-esteem, citizenship, and  leadership).

The strategies were identified through an analysis of career development abstracts included in the ERIC database between 1980 and 1990. The abstracts were reviewed as they relate to the National Guidelines areas and competencies for seven levels: elementary school, middle/junior high school, high school, and the adult settings of two-year community college, four-year college and university, business/industry, and community agency. A total of 631 abstracts were coded for level/setting, facilitator (teacher, school counselor,  community agency staff, business/industry staff, parents), delivery mode (large group, small group, individual assistance, computer/media-based instruction, other), and 1 or more of the 12 competencies in the 3 National Guidelines areas (self-knowledge, educational/occupational exploration, career planning). Frequency distributions of reviewed abstracts, comments, recommendations, and sample career development activities or resources are provided at each level. General recommendations for increased emphasis on specific competencies and areas at different levels are made. The document includes 34 references and matrices listing the abstracts reviewed by ERIC number, indicating the guidelines areas, competencies, facilitators, and delivery modes covered by the ERIC documents.

        "description":"In spring of 1990, pursuant to the federally funded School Health Education Project to Prevent the Spread of Human Immunodeficiency Virus, an annual survey was conducted of Illinois ninth graders (n=1,181) to assess their knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs concerning Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Findings from the 1990 survey are described and comparisons are made with findings from the 1989 survey, and also between Illinois ninth grader data and data collected for adults nationally by the National Center for Health Statistics. Data analysis and reported findings focus on variations according to student gender, ethnicity, and geographic region of the state in: (1) level of knowledge about AIDS; (2) attitudes toward AIDS; and (3) student awareness of information  sources and where to get tested for AIDS. These findings suggest that ninth graders are knowledgeable about the major means of transmitting the AIDS virus (sexual intercourse and the sharing of hypodermic needles) and about important prevention measures, but they had misconceptions about transmission of AIDS through blood transfer, along with unfounded and potentially destructive phobias about going to school with a student who has AIDS. Based on these findings, recommendations for Illinois educators are provided. References are included and instrumentation is appended, along with the survey methodology and response rate, geographic categories, and a summary of questionnaire response items. (TE)",

        "author":["Vitkus, John"],
        "description":"Vitkus and Horowitz (1987) found that lonely people demonstrated adequate social behavior when they were assigned to controlling interpersonal roles. Despite this successful performance, they evaluated themselves and their behavior negatively. Study 1 replicated these findings and extended them to naturalistic interactions. In a hypothetical problem-solving dyad involving paired college students (N=76), students were diagnosed as either lonely or nonlonely and then assigned respective roles of Person with the Problem or Springboard (listener/advisor). Analysis of videotaped sessions showed that all subjects were capable of adequate social performance, but adopting a passive social role interfered with expression of this behavior. Study 2 followed the procedures of Study 1 with  the difference that all subjects were assigned to the Springboard role (who listens to a partner describe the problem) and positive or neutral feedback was provided. Results showed that unambiguous positive feedback reduced the negativity of lonely students' self-evaluations. An interpersonal model of loneliness is proposed to explain these results. The model suggests that in typical interactions, lonely people adopt social roles that prevent them from expressing appropriate social behavior. In addition, without clear performance cues, lonely people fail to recognize occasions when they do perform adequately. Their resulting negative self-appraisals reaffirm their initial feelings of inadequacy, thereby sustaining their loneliness. Therapeutic implications of this model and limitations of  the present research are discussed. (TE)",

        "description":"After an introductory discussion and review of literature on divorce among Jewish families, this document presents and analyzes two case studies which show the adverse effect of divorce and child-custody battles on the children of Jewish families who subsequently plan a B'nai Mitzvah (Bar or Bat Mitzvah) ceremony--a joyous ritual of initiation into adulthood and religious life that traditionally calls for the participation of both parents. In the first study, a young girl's Bat Mitzvah is disrupted by a dispute between the mother and father over the seating of the father--either on the pulpit with the mother or with his second wife in the congregation. The outcome of this unresolved conflict is an emotional breakdown during the service by both father and daughter, which  irrevocably mars the occasion for the daughter. The second case study, of a son's bar mitzvah involving a divorced couple where the noncustodial father has moved far away and abandoned all support for the mother and son, shows a counterexample of a successful and healing accommodation, owing to the timely mediation of the rabbi, prior to the ceremony. A brief discussion follows, emphasizing the importance of the rabbi's role in recognizing and dealing with reactive unconscious guilt of divorced parents prior to the B'nai Mitzvah ceremonies. (TE)",

        "description":"This paper discusses issues pertaining to the recruitment and hiring of dual-career academic couples by universities and psychology departments. Studies have shown that both husbands and wives in dual psychologist couples are more productive in number of publications, paper presentations, and grants awarded than their single counterparts, yet many universities are reluctant to hire academic couples because of psychological resistance, small group dynamics, and self-esteem maintenance issues. University issues may include reactance, exploitative bargaining, and fear of precedence. Exploitative bargaining--offering part-time or adjunct appointment to a spouse (usually a wife)--is often an issue which can result in a dissatisfied spouse inducing her partner to leave. Universities  also fear that hiring a spouse will lead to an avalanche of requests for all spouses, both academic and nonacademic, to be hired by the university. Departmental issues include discrimination against couples by others in the department; fears of recruitment committees about the adequate differentiation of partners in publication credits, evaluation, and tenure review; and fear of the loss of both partners if one or the other accepts a new position. Small group dynamics at the departmental level include concern about couples forming power blocs or conversely the fears that disruptions in the marriage will adversely affect departmental politics. Finally, the old guard faculty is likely to have fears about disrupting the status quo. (TE)",

Methodologically, ABCs are higher for studies using: (1) self-report measures of behavior; (2) primarily non-students as subjects; or (3) attitude and behavior measures of corresponding levels of specificity. Substantively, ABCs tend to be higher when the attitude is formed by direct experience, the attitude is held with certainty, the subject is a low self-monitor, or the situation increases self-focused attention.

The practical reasoning process begins by identifying a common problem or question and then considering four areas in which to examine the problem: awareness of context, desired results, alternative approaches, and consequences of action.

Middle school units focus on the following self-development and caregiving concerns: developing self-awareness and self-acceptance; developing interpersonal relationships; exploring interaction of work and family; and promoting and developing caregiving skills. High school units focus on the following parenting concerns: (1) exploring the realities of being a parent; (2) developing a sense of self in parents and children; (3) promoting healthy parent-child relationships; (4) managing the interaction of work and family; and (5) creating supportive communities for parents and children.

This paper advocates the adoption of a peer resource model of education in which schools and classrooms are restructured so that youth--from early childhood through late adolescence--have ongoing, continuous opportunities to be resources to each other. The first part provides the following rationales for peer resource programming: (1) the importance of peer relationships in social development; (2) the importance of social support to positive outcomes; (3) the failure of adult society to provide social capital  for youth; (4) the value of giving every youth the opportunity to help; (5) the satisfaction of basic human psychological needs; (6) the opportunities to develop collaboration/conflict resolution skills; (7) the way such programs foster acceptance and respect for diversity; (8) improved academic achievement; and (9) reduction in alcohol and drug use. The second part lists critical ingredients of peer programs, while the conclusion calls for a paradigm shift to demystify professional expertise and empower people to help themselves and one other. Successfully implementing peer resource programs necessitate a change in role for teachers from &quot;bosses&quot; to group facilitators, and this is best achieved through the schoolwide adoption--among administrators, teachers, and students alike--of a peer  cooperation/collaboration model. Eighty references are included. (TE)",

Specific issues covered include: (1) whether such agencies must comply with federal laws and regulations governing confidentiality of patient records, and, if they must comply, how they must do so; (2) when such agencies may offer services to minors without parental consent; (3) when and how they must report child abuse and neglect; (4) how they can best screen employees and volunteers to ensure that no one on staff abuses or injures a client; and (5) whether they are in compliance with applicable quality of care standards. The report cites and discusses applicable federal and state regulations, provides illustrative examples, and  answers hypothetical questions pertaining to the agencies affected by these regulations. The report concludes with a legal checklist for agencies and an appended table summarizing state parental consent laws for the treatment of minors. (TE)",

For a woman who is a lesbian and also Jewish, this means feeling marginal in each of the communities she considers to be her primary support systems. Within the Jewish community, lesbianism is not acceptable, and within the lesbian community, there is often anti-Semitism. This paper begins by briefly discussing some historical and religious issues of relevance to the empowerment of women within Judaism and to coming out as a Jewish lesbian. It then explores the process of coming out as a Jewish lesbian within the framework of a four-stage model of the coming out process that is generally accepted as the theory for the development of a lesbian identity. From the perspective of this framework,  the acceptance of two marginal identities is examined. Implications for counselors working with Jewish lesbians are discussed. (Author/TE)",

        "description":"This transcript of a conference presentation describes a motivational model of alcohol use that shows the interrelationship between the various factors that affect drinking. First, a flow diagram is presented and described that shows how complex biological, psychological, and environmental variables contribute to a person's motivation for drinking, that is, to his or her expectations of affective change from drinking. The variables discussed include past experiences as they shape current expectations, current life situation, and cognitive mediating events such as beliefs, thoughts, and perceptions about the effects of drinking. The rest of the presentation describes the Motivational Structure Questionnaire for Alcoholics (MSQ-A) and discusses how it provides a clinical profile of  a patient that can then be used for systematic motivational counseling. Sample clinical profiles are presented in order to illustrate and discuss 10 of the 16 clinical indices revealed by the questionnaire: number of concerns, aversive motivation, lack of commitment, inappropriate commitment, ambivalence, composite emotional intensity, hopelessness, ineffectiveness, goal distance, and alcohol irrelevancy. Paper copies of the slides used in the presentation are included. (TE)",

The first section discusses how to introduce and market the course on campus, and anticipate students' and colleagues' questions about one's motivations for teaching the course, one's sexual preference, and one's expertise. The second part discusses how to deal with religion, values, and morality, by asserting the objective from the outset (to stop the spread of AIDS by whatever means possible), and how to deal with the likelihood that terminology used in the course will offend some students. Also discussed are the problems of teaching students from diverse cultures and value systems. The  third section addresses how to comment on current events and new potential cures, and how to address students' questions and concerns. The remaining sections discuss: how to resolve conflict among sources of information; how to find an appropriate level of knowledge and sophistication; topical coverage; pedagogical devices; audiovisual materials; and experiential exercises. The concluding sections discuss the distribution of activities across class periods and the problem of AIDS burnout. (TE)",

        "description":"This document comprises an interim evaluation report for the Portland Peers Project, a comprehensive drug education program that serves students in grades 6-8 in all Portland (Oregon) middle schools, for the 1989-90 academic year. It is noted that data were collected through an initial assessment survey, a parent questionnaire, a student peer helper scale, and a review of the literature on peer assistance programs. This interim report presents preliminary findings related to the project's assessment of drug use by middle school students, results of the peer helper scale, and findings from the parent survey. The report also describes demographics of the treatment and comparison groups of students. Results are presented and explained in five tables showing: (1) distribution of  peers project students by grade and gender; (2) distribution of peers project students and comparison group by ethnicity; (3) mean pretest, posttest, and change on peer helper scale by group; (4) mean, standard deviation, and change on peer helper subscales by group; and (5) parents' perceptions of the program. Findings are presented which show that the program established a coordinated peer support system in the middle schools during 1989-1990, and that the project achieved its expected effect of increasing middle school students' helping skills as measured by the Peer Helper Scale. The results of the initial assessment of drug use by middle school students were inconclusive. A 12-item bibliography is included and a summary of the initial assessment of student drug use is appended, along  with instrumentation. (TE)",

Psychological concerns specific to male clients for which conceptions of gender  may be especially salient are then discussed, and implications of conducting therapy from a gender aware perspective are explored.

It notes that the employment provisions of ADA require that the hiring and employment policies of employers with more than 25 employees be nondiscriminatory, and that employers provide reasonable accommodation to the known limitations of a qualified person with a disability. It is suggested that, in view of the widespread changes in hiring and employment practices likely to result from ADA, rehabilitation counselors may be called upon to play several roles in helping  employers to comply with this legislation, including: (1) understanding a job applicant's functional limitations; (2) determining the reasonable accommodations that may be used with a particular job applicant; (3) identifying incentive programs to help employers with the costs of providing accommodation; and (4) identifying a pool of potential job applicants with disabilities. Possible implications resulting from enactment of the ADA for employers, rehabilitation professionals, and persons with disabilities are suggested, and references are included. (TE)",

One way they can learn to use power bases is by modeling their supervisors in counseling practica. In this study, the effects of faculty supervisors' attitudes on counseling trainees' attitudes toward power bases were examined. Supervisors' and trainees' attitudes were measured using a questionnaire developed by Robyak (1981) for assessing referent, legitimate, and expert power base preferences. During a one-semester counseling practicum, pre/post measures of preference strength were obtained from 50 trainees in 8 supervisory groups. Analysis of variance procedures yielded no significant differences  between repeated measures or between groups. Observed trends consistent with desirable use of power bases indicated that trainees were not unduly influenced by their supervisors' preferences. Implications of these results for counselor training programs are discussed, and references are included. (Author/TE)",

        "description":"Developmentally disabled adults who are cared for at home by their older parents present a challenge because community-based social and health services are required to meet the needs of both the aging parents and the offspring. In this study, 11 local case managers were interviewed in depth, for 2 hours, about their work with parents of developmentally disabled adults. Findings from this pilot study affirmed parents' resistance to planning for permanency despite increased frailties. Augmenting resistance and impeding assistance is a scarcity of residential options. Like the parents, workers were ambivalent about disrupting interdependence. They wished to provide help with future plans before crises occur, and also to keep aging families together for as long as possible by  arranging needed services. Workers remarked that parents were intimidated by their youth and professional status, and that they feared them as threatening separation. Also reported was frustration over the mandate not to treat parents as clients, as well as excessive caseloads prohibiting more interaction with older families. Workers desired, instead, to assist parents when they first encountered age-related losses, and to learn more about aging services. Results of this pilot investigation suggest that geriatric specialists are needed to serve both aging developmentally disabled clients and their elderly caregivers. Sixteen references are included.

This study examined the relationship of specific verbal and nonverbal cues to perceived counselor attractiveness in a field setting, and explored the relation between perceived counselor attractiveness and session impact, the client's perception of the qualities of a therapeutic session, and their feelings about the session. Clients (N=25) at a university counseling center, each seeing a different counselor, rated their counselors in terms of behavioral cues associated with attractiveness and session impact. Clients completed the attractiveness scale from the Counselor Rating Form, three additional  items that assessed the similarity aspect of attractiveness, the expertness and trustworthiness scales from the Counselor Rating Form--Short Version, the Comparison Form to Measure the relative importance of six verbal and nonverbal cues in overall perceptions of the counselor, and the Session Evaluation Questionnaire to measure the impact of the counselor on the client in the session. The results indicated that counselor nonverbal behaviors were more salient to attractiveness ratings than were verbal behaviors. Perceived counselor attractiveness was not related to session impact, but expertness and trustworthiness were related. Similarity of the client to the counselor was associated with one aspect of session impact, session evaluation. (NB)",

In either the presence or absence of a confederate experimenter, 33 female and 34 male college students were asked to select a teacher and student from their high school and then to give impersonal or personal information about each target person. Impersonal information consisted of topics such as the person's socioeconomic status, area of residence, and educational standards. For personal information, subjects discussed their current evaluation of the person and how the target person had affected them. Then subjects rated their experience of emotion: happiness, sadness, and emotional intensity felt toward the target people and evoked by the descriptions.  In addition, 32 judges rated the expression of emotion conveyed in the verbal descriptions. The only effect found for reported emotion was a main effect for gender. Female subjects reported experiencing greater amounts of emotion than did male subjects. Judges' ratings showed that when subjects provided personal descriptions, males expressed the most emotion in the presence of a confederate experimenter and females expressed the most emotion when alone. The results of this study are interpreted in terms of differential male and female sensitivity to a non-interactive confederate experimenter. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Alcohol expectancies have been found to predict later onset of drinking among adolescents. This study examined whether the relationship between level of alcohol use and expectancies is paralleled with cigarette smoking, and attempted to identify the content of smoking expectancies. An instrument to measure the subjective expected utility of smoking was developed by administering an 80-item questionnaire to 382 undergraduate smokers and exsmokers. A principal components analysis yielded four interpretable factors: negative consequences, positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, and appetite/weight control. Fifty items with high loadings on these factors were retained to create the four scales of the Smoking Consequences Questionnaire. Coefficient alpha reliabilities,  calculated from a separate subject sample, averaged .94. As predicted, the scales were able to differentiate between daily smokers and less frequent smokers. Heavier smokers had more positive expectancies about the effects of smoking, and less negative expectancies. Females had more positive expectancies than males on the appetite/weight control scale. Female exsmokers reported much more positive expectancies than male exsmokers on the negative reinforcement scale, suggesting a possible risk factor for females who quit smoking. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Although suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents in the United States, little is known about the prevalence or characteristics of suicide attempts among adolescents. Data from 1,710 adolescents attending 9 high schools in 5 communities were examined to determine the prevalence of suicide attempts and the lethality and intent of these attempts. Each adolescent was interviewed with a form of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children which combined the Epidemiologic version (K-SADS-E) and the Present Episode version (K-SADS-P). Approximately 6.8% of the adolescents had attempted suicide in their lifetime. A significantly greater proportion of girls (9.8%) as compared to boys (3.5%) had attempted suicide. For both males and  females, there was a significantly higher rate of attempts among adolescents with a diagnosis of major depression, substance use disorder, or disruptive behavior disorder than among adolescents without such diagnoses. Of these attempts, 14% were rated as potentially lethal and 43% were considered intentional. An examination of the relationship between lifetime attempts and lifetime psychiatric disorders revealed that a large proportion of adolescents who attempted suicide had a history of a psychiatric disorder. The results also indicated that being female and being from a home with no male head of household were risk factors for a suicide attempt. (NB)",

        "description":"A major portion of the National Fire Academy (NFA) executive development curriculum includes group process and team building instruction. This material does not contain any information on the family of origin and its potential impact on the group process and team building capabilities of adults. This study examined whether there was a significant difference in group climate questionnaire scores between fire executives from functional and dysfunctional families of origin. A total of 70 Executive Fire Officer Program graduates participated in the study. Subjects were classified as functional (N=45) or dysfunctional (N=25), based on their scores on the Family of Origin Questionnaire. The mean scores for each of the seven items on the Group Climate Questionnaire were compared between  the functional and dysfunctional groups and the overall mean scores were also compared using an unpaired t-test. The results indicated that there were no statistically significant differences in six of the seven mean scores. The &quot;risk taking&quot; item had the only significant difference. The overall mean for the functional group was 4.911 while the dysfunctional group overall mean was 4.566; the difference was statistically significant. These findings suggest that the family of origin experience does influence group dynamics. Developmental activities need to include family of origin instructional methodologies to help groups become more effective. (Author/NB)",

On general self-esteem scores, Blacks rated themselves more positively than did Whites. Blacks also rated themselves more positively on specific self-beliefs, (e.g., social attractiveness), although the magnitude of differences in such cases was quite small. On control measures, Blacks perceived greater external control pertaining to both cultural events and personal efficacy, although they had slightly greater expectations about future academic success. Results about general and personal  self-efficacy of Blacks are somewhat inconsistent with earlier reports. Females tended to show less self-efficacy than males, but there were no interactions of race and sex. Even in the presence of significant effects for race and/or sex, mean differences tended to be relatively small. The findings suggest that, although differences exist between races and between sexes, they are rarely of large magnitude, and they tend to dissipate over time as adolescents leave school and become adults.

Data pertaining to beliefs, knowledge about AIDS, fear of and perceived vulnerability to AIDS, perceived efficacy to control exposure to AIDS, self-esteem and general locus of control, and past reactions to AIDS were collected from 124 Black respondents at a southeastern university and regressed on the two behavioral intention measures. Results showed that situational efficacy (to protect oneself from AIDS) was the best predictor of general intention, followed by reports of past behavioral  changes as a result of the AIDS epidemic and by knowledge. Proximal threat of AIDS was a negative predictor. For specific intentions, a specific belief about inconvenience in condom use was the best predictor, followed by past behavioral change, followed by knowledge. Normative beliefs, a belief that condoms would prevent disease, and distant threat of AIDS were also significant predictors. Predictions of general intentions, more so than those of specific intentions, followed predictions of the intention-behavior models that informed instrument development. (Author)",

Instruction is based on the concept of activity with a prospective focus on the formation of students' shared and personal literacy motives and goals. The social context program contains four phases: (1) planning; (2) assessment; (3) transition; and (4) maintenance. In the planning phase, common interest and needs of the social unit cluster are identified, students are accessed through their social unit, and small learning groups are formed. Three intermittent assessment phase sessions are conducted to identify student self-perceptions used to guide content of the  literacy instructional activities. The transition phase includes nonthreatening reading, writing, speaking, and listening activities to build peer support and transform students' negative resignations toward learning. The maintenance phase contains more structured literacy activities used to teach students self-directional mediational devices that promote independence in continued literacy improvement. (Two figures diagramming the social context model are included; 40 references are attached.) (Author/RS)",

        "description":"Because of extremely low salaries paid to teachers in the Brazilian public school system, the profession increasingly attracts only persons from the lower income levels who may not themselves be comfortable with the literacy skills they are supposed to teach. Working under extremely hard conditions, and being ill prepared for her profession, the teacher tends to blame various cultural lacks or deficits in her students to explain their failure to learn. The fallacy of this &quot;deficit hypothesis&quot; can be shown by examining textbooks used to teach reading and in classroom research. Reading textbooks place heavy demands on students' capacity to manipulate discrete elements of text, and no demands on making sense out of text. In one experiment, 40 eighth-grade students were divided  equally into experimental and control groups. The experimental group was given a passage and told to write a summary without being able to look at the passage while the control group was allowed to look at the passage. Results indicated that all of the experimental group used integrating, combinatory rules in writing the summary, while only one of the control group was able to use such rules. In another experiment, 53 eighth-graders were divided into two control groups and one experimental group. The control groups read one of two versions of a passage in which different lexical choices were made. The experimental group received both versions of the text. Results indicated that students who had access to only one version were incapable of perceiving the discourse value of the words in  question, whereas students who had to focus on whatever differences they could perceive between the two versions were able to perceive the discourse value of the same words. Findings of both experiments suggest that students showed a remarkable capacity to deal with text and written discourse. They also indicate the fallacy of all types of deficit theories which permit ethnocentric intrepretations that only disguise the true causes of student failure. (Fifty-five references are attached.)

        "description":"A study examined whether conclusions about constructive processes in reading based on analysis of group data were consistent with those based on an analysis of individual data. Subjects, selected from a larger sample of 45 first grade students who had participated in a longitudinal study on acquisition of linguistic procedures for printed words, were from a variety of ethnic and cultural backgrounds and were relatively homogeneous in socioeconomic indicators. The same data set of reading-related processing measures was analyzed in four different ways. In the first approach, the analysis was based on achievement groups, aggregated over children drawn from different classrooms, with variation among children within the group treated as error. In the second approach, the analysis was  based on instructional groups taught by the same teacher, with error estimated as in the first approach. Analysis in the third approach was based on the same children as the second approach but variation among children was treated as systematic variance and individual responses over stimulus trials were used to estimate error. Finally, in the fourth approach, separate analyses were performed for each child in the instructional groups in a design that used variation over stimulus trials to estimate error. Results depended on how the data were aggregated: the first two analyses indicated that there is one process in reading acquisition, while results of the last two analyses indicated that there is not one single process in learning to read. Rather, even when the instructional program was  held constant, variation in children's constructive processes resulted in the learners using instructional cues in more than one way. Differences in conclusions were attributed to the ecological fallacy in which inferences about one unit of analysis are based on analyses at another level.

Elementary education majors enrolled in the reading diagnosis and remediation course provide one-to-one tutoring. The sessions are referred to as a &quot;Reading Club&quot; rather than a reading clinic to avoid the medical/disabled connotations associated with a clinic. The club theme is carried out with contests and prizes. Enrichment is provided for those reading at or above grade level as well as for those reading below grade level. Although the Reading Club concept is utilized  to promote a positive atmosphere, the tutoring sessions are serious business. The results of the Reading Club are sometimes immediate. Students who indicated a negative attitude toward reading during their first visit often return the next week with enthusiasm about what they have read. Parents report that performance and attitudes at school have improved as well. Students look forward to attending the Reading Club meeting each week and tutors also enjoy teaching with the positive approach. (RS)",

Subjects were eight parents (all mothers) whose children had been enrolled the previous year in a kindergarten program that maintained a whole language curricular orientation. The children (four girls and four boys) were highly successful in kindergarten though none had been deemed exceptional in the progress they made in learning to read and write by the teacher, parent, or third-party observers who were part of the research team. Parents were interviewed during the two months immediately following the children's completion of kindergarten. The parents were asked a set of questions concerning their approach to literacy learning and their satisfaction with the kindergarten's  holistic curriculum. Interview results indicated several home-based literacy activities including the following: reading aloud; taking dictation from child; developing interest in words, through games, etc.; writing; and providing an informal and functional literate environment. Two conclusions were drawn from the study: (1) the home literacy activities described are similar to those described in that work and tend to validate the conclusions derived from previous work; and (2) the literacy activities in the home were highly congruent with those found in the whole language kindergarten.

        "description":"Studies from the interactive perspective regard reading and writing as processes which share a common knowledge base and have similar mental operations. First, according to this model, reading and writing are both interactive processes. Second, both readers and writers go through the same activities as planning, drafting, aligning, revising, monitoring, and checking outcomes. Also, readers and writers seem to share some mental operations by engaging in reflective thinking after they have finished with their respective texts. Research from the interactive perspective has shown that (1) the interactive model is more effective than two other models in teaching second and fifth graders; (2) writing affects both students' reading comprehension and critical thinking; and (3) combining  reading with writing contributes to a wider range of both quantity and quality of revisions to writing than does writing without reading. The interactive model suggests that writing should be introduced to the students as soon as reading begins. Although it has been found that reading activity and instruction can influence writing ability and that writing instruction can enhance reading ability, quite often no such transfer between reading and writing occurs. Researchers anticipate that the 1990s will see efforts made to explore the reading writing relationship from the interactive perspective, the communicative perspective, and the collaborative perspective. There is a scarcity of research on the effect reading and writing have upon the critical thinking of high school students.  (RS)",

        "description":"The practice of grouping children of similar ability for reading instruction is as much a part of the classroom as the chalkboard, yet for decades research into classroom practice has raised serious questions about ability grouping. A research project using the meta-analysis approach to analyze more than 50 research studies concluded that ability grouping does not enhance student achievement in the elementary school. Some teachers have used the traditional high, average, and low ability reading groups simply to be able to manage the classroom. A variety of alternative grouping procedures are widely practiced in classrooms for math, social studies, and science, but rarely for reading. It is almost as if reading is too important to tamper with, so teachers and administrators feel  constrained to stick to familiar, if less effective, practice. Teachers should vary their grouping arrangements as they move toward whole group instruction and away from the traditional three ability groups. The great need is for balance across classroom grouping arrangements, not a wholesale abandonment of small group instruction in favor of whole groups. The problem of ability grouping can be solved with a careful use of a variety of grouping strategies including whole group instruction, teacher-led and peer-led small group instruction and careful selection of individual learning activities.

At the beginning of the seminar, students indicated that they enjoyed reading, did leisure reading, and felt that lack of vocabulary, slow reading rate, and inability to concentrate were their major reading problems. They also described their primary study strategies as underlining and rereading. The first step in the reading/learning paradigm was to incorporate into the students' thinking about reading and learning the concept of three levels of learning (rote recall; drawing conclusions, evaluating, making judgments; and problem solving). The students were then given a series of exercises intended to help them better understand the significance of the concept. Students in  the one section of the seminar where the paradigm was used obtained the highest grade point average of all sections of the seminar. Students learned quickly that learning means more than just memorization.

Subjects were asked to read orally a passage of approximately 500 words taken from a social studies text one year above their grade placement. Results revealed that the correlation between reading rate and accuracy was positive and moderately high at both grade levels. Readers who had good word recognition tended to read at faster rates. The principal finding was that word  recognition accuracy, a key factor in determining independent, instructional, and frustration reading levels, was successfully used in predicting reading rates for grades three and five. Findings suggest that researchers can determine reading rates that correspond to levels of difficulty for all grade levels. (One table of data is included; 18 references are attached.) (KEH)",

A secondary goal was to evaluate the effect of teaching writing as a process upon the children's attitudes toward writing. The participants (37 parents, 15 second-graders, and 17 fourth-graders) responded to two attitude instruments (one for parents; one for children) as pre- and post-program measures. Two writing workshops for parents were offered in the evening while the children participated in writing workshops during the school day. Newsletters summarizing the main points of the workshops were sent home to reach those who could not attend. Both parents and children wrote original pieces which were published and  shared at a &quot;Celebrate Writing&quot; night. The pre- and post-surveys showed no significant changes in the parents' attitudes; it appeared they were knowledgeable and had positive attitudes toward the process approach from the start. There were changes noted for the children. The second-graders showed a significant gain in their willingness to revise; select their own topics; and write letters, journals, and stories. The fourth-graders reported revising more often and were more interested in writing stories and notes.

Ten major considerations can be identified: (1) spelling is a skill of writing; (2) spelling is best learned as a component of writing, and not as a result of studying isolated skills; (3) not all children will pick up spelling as a result of reading and writing--for most children, study of the meanings, uses, and structure of words is an essential part of the classroom language program; (4) words to be incorporated in a word study program must emerge from other aspects of the classroom program, but the essential feature should be their relevance to pupils' writing; (5) there is a relatively small core of high-frequency words that must be used properly and spelled  conventionally, if skills of spelling and written language are to progress; (6) beyond this small common core of words, there is a rich and diverse written language, unique to each individual; (7) there is much less uniformity and regularity in the spelling errors made by a class group, than in the words they use; (8) children need to be given a procedure to help them learn to spell specific words; (9) proofreading is another aspect of spelling that is not just picked up--children can learn to detect errors; and (10) as spelling is a skill of writing, its measurement and evaluation must begin with written language and must utilize test-based information as appropriate.

        "description":"During the past 40 years, several generations of American children have grown up with the Nation of Israel as a historical reality. Whether Jewish or Gentile, juvenile readers have absorbed a version of the story that recapitulates in modern dress the biblical story of the children of Hagar and Sarah, reinforced by American attitudes toward people of color and non-western cultures. Because children are strongly affected by what they read and hear, an examination of the image of the Arab in American children's fiction may illuminate attitudes which have prevented American Jews and non-Jews from seeing Palestinians as human beings. The image of Arabs as brutal terrorists pervades even those children's books that depict friendships between Arab and Israeli children. In many of these  novels, the apparent contradiction between images of Arabs as both potential friends and potential enemies is resolved, or skirted, by means of the distinction made between local villagers who have made peace with Israeli settlers and Arabs from over the border who make trouble. Beneath the often facile pleas for peace are the same assumptions that have blocked Arab-Israeli reconciliation for over 40 years: the assumption that the Israeli enterprise is the only one that matters in the Middle East, and that those Arabs who do not support it wholeheartedly are terrorists, monsters, or worse.

From this case study, it was discovered that only 16% of the initial group of preparatory students enrolled in, and passed a follow-up biology class in anatomy, physiology, or general biology. Examination of the preparatory group, using discriminant analysis ascertained that mathematics score was the principle discriminator between pass/fail groups. A step-wise multiple regression analysis of the variables explaining the preparatory grade showed that mathematics score, reading score, and type of high school degree explained 33% of  the variance. Of the students who did pass the preparatory course and enrolled in a follow-up biology class, their preparatory grade was a good predictor of their achievement (measured by follow-up course grade) as determined by multiple regression.

Background data, instructional emphasis ratings, SEA concept subscores and total scores were entered into multiple regression analyses.  All groups exhibited significant posttest gains (at the .001 level) and showed evidence of retention of the targeted concepts. Gains in scores in the major concept strands were positively related to the instructional emphasis given to those areas. The effectiveness of the field program was apparent in that specific concepts that were emphasized were learned and retained.

The investigation analyzed the effects of social class and grade level on the content of science textbooks from middle- and working-class school districts and from upper and lower grades. Content was examined on the basis of six variables: (1) orientation to cognitive flexibility; (2) orientation to abstract thinking; (3) orientation to communicative fluency; (4) orientation to autonomy; (5) orientation to goal-achieving; and (6) orientation to positive imagery. The results  indicated that while more science texts are available to children in middle-class districts than in working-class districts, availability of knowledge important for the development of a scientific role is, on the average, the same for both middle- and working-class districts. In addition, the data suggests that social class has a distinctive effect on orientation to cognitive flexibility. Comparisons are made, with research done on political science textbooks. (TW)",

        "description":"Recalling several recent catastrophic examples of unethical behavior among engineers, this paper examines some of the obvious and non-obvious consequences of academic dishonesty as it occurs in engineering courses. The results of several studies relating to the extent of cheating in engineering courses, as well as the reasons for cheating are presented. Instructor complacency, pressure to win, and student ignorance are reported to be the main reasons why cheating is widespread and increasing. The consequences of cheating are discussed in terms of harm done to the cheater, noncheating students, instructors, the engineering profession, and society in general. Cheating is shown to put cheaters at an advantage when it comes to grades, admission to graduate school, application for  scholarships, and job seeking. The performance of cheaters on the job is discussed, and the problems that occur when the company discovers that the engineer's job performance is far below what had been anticipated. This can hinder the efforts of colleges in placing students with companies that have had negative job performances from previous graduates of that institution. Specific suggestions to combat and prevent cheating in college engineering courses are included. (TW)",

These distribution patterns were determined by institution, state, agency, and field of science. In addition, the document provides an analysis of the extent to which patterns of distribution are accounted for by historical trends, direct congressional action, field of science, demographic and socioeconomic factors, and the use and distribution of peer reviewers. The principal findings include: (1) that although the percentage of federal research and development funds received by the top funded 100 universities and colleges has remained stable from 1967 to 1984, the composition of the top 100 has changed, with 19  institutions moving into the top 100; (2) the total federal research funding to universities and colleges appears to be concentrated in relatively few states and institutions (although this does not hold when examining individual fields of science); and (3) that federal research and development funding to universities and colleges by state positively correlates to certain demographic and socioeconomic factors.

This proposition has been advanced by leaders in the U.S. Department of Education as a criticism of high school history textbooks. The study reveals that six of the seven textbooks were very critical of political and economic life in the Soviet Union and of Soviet foreign policies. By contrast, five textbooks were much less critical of China, and two textbooks tended to have a rather positive view of Chinese society. The author recommends balanced treatments of different nations and their political/economic systems while recognizing  difficulties of overcoming cultural biases in teaching and writing history. Public statements about the &quot;bland neutrality&quot; of history textbook content by leaders of the U.S. Department of Education are criticized, because they seem to discourage critical thinking and encourage one-sided views of truth.

Some of the aspects of household demography that have important consequences for both consumer demand and public policy are changes in the number and average size of households; the proportion of households which are composed of families; whether families are maintained by married couples; and whether children are present and residing with one or both parents. Additionally, the number of married couple families has increased by 3 percent since 1980, versus an 18 percent increase for other types of families. Household size dropped from 2.76  persons in 1980 to an average of 2.69 persons in 1985. The decline in household size was less during the five years since 1980 than during either of the five-year periods between 1975-80 and 1970-75. The number of households maintained by young adults under 25 years old has declined by 17 percent since 1980. In 1985, about 60 percent of the black family groups that included children under 18 years old had only one parent present, compared with 21 percent for corresponding white family groups. Over 20 tables with detailed census data support the findings. An appendix is included which contains definitions and explanations of the terms and sources used in the report. (APG)",

The text of this report compares the mid-decade census estimates based on the March, 1985 \"Current Population Survey\" with the survey data from 1980, 1970, and 1960. The report concludes that many changes in marital status and living arrangements have occurred over the last few decades. Changes in marital status include postponement of the first marriage; a growing proportion of never-married persons; and the growth of the \"singles\" population due to divorce and separation. Changes in living arrangements include increasing numbers of children who live in single-parent situations, of young adults who  live with their parents, of persons who live alone, and of adults who reside in unmarried couple households. Highlights of the report are: during the 1980s, the proportion of never married women, aged 20 to 24, has been the largest ever recorded; there were 119 unmarried men aged 25 to 34 for every 100 women aged 25 to 34 in 1985; between 1970 and 1985 the divorce ratio rose from 47 to 128 divorced persons per 1,000 married persons with spouse present; and 23 percent of children under 18 lived with one parent in 1985, compared with 9 percent in 1960. In addition, 60 percent of men and 48 percent of women, aged 18 to 24, lived at home with their parents in 1985; most elderly men still lived with their wives, while elderly women were more likely to live alone than with their husbands in  1985. The rapid growth in unmarried couple household during the 1970s has slowed in recent years. Charts, tables, and appendix tables which pertain to the data are included in the document. (APG)",

Therefore, the educational systems in developing countries must continue to improve in quality, in efficiency, and in equality of opportunity if they are to continue serving as important instruments for improving the national economy. Yet, budgetary austerity tightens the public purse-strings, ever increasing school-age populations stretch these dwindling resources, and other social and economic factors present compelling competition for the same funds. The heavy subsidization of education implicit in traditional policy--especially of higher education at the expense of primary schooling--with its concomitant economic inefficiencies and inequities is no longer appropriate. Supported by empirical evidence, this book  examines the potential effects of policy alternatives in several areas of education financing and management: (1) The contribution of private financing and selective user changes, especially in higher education, and reallocation of public spending; (2) Selective student loan and scholarship programs in higher education; and (3) Decentralization and role of private and community schools. Implementation of these policies may be difficult because of conflicts with traditional educational and political philosophies, and established administrative institutions. Included are statistical tables, case studies, instances of reform, and a bibliography. (KWL)",

(1) The affluent and middle class white U.S. population does not have enough interest and commitment to the poor and undereducated population to pay the price it will take to educate the U.S. underclass. The people do not believe they have the resources to spend in this way, and politicians are unable to change their minds. (2) The nature of the problem of educating the U.S. underclass is much more complex and multifaceted than most citizens are willing to admit. Higher academic standards, better pay for teachers, and other governor-led, state-level educational reforms will help, but will be inadequate. (3) The problem is not  going to be solved by recruiting more and better minority group members to teaching. There are two reasons for this: the educational community does not have the means to recruit enough good minority teachers; and recruiting minority teachers is not sufficient to solve the problem. Rising academic standards, more verbal-based tests, five and six years of preparation, and low financial attraction discourage prospective minority teachers. (4) Schools and teaching are not strong enough to succeed with the task of educating the U.S. underclass in the near future. A five-part agenda for social studies educators is proposed which advocates the need to give to preservice and inservice social studies teachers the facts about poverty in the United States and to rekindle the commitment to equality  and justice for everyone; the need to teach that social problems hurt all; the need to teach about economic and racial subgroups in the United States and about multicultural understanding; the need to teach that solving tough problems takes time and commitment; and the need to adjust the perspectives and priorities of social studies educators.

        "description":"Social sciences in the community college are at a critical point in their history and development. Except for a few statistical aberrations, enrollment in the social sciences and humanities is declining significantly. The idea of marketing a segment of a college's or university's offerings, particularly when it is not tied to a particular problem program seems parochial and provincial at best and chauvinistic at worst. It has been assumed that the social sciences specifically and the humanities generally should be able to stand on their own. However, the attitudes toward learning today in general are at best ambivalent, and resistance to the idea that the humanities and social sciences are fundamental is stronger than it has ever been. Various marketing principles can be applied  to these curriculum areas with the short-term objective of improving the image of liberal arts by being proactive and by establishing credibility. (BZ)",

        "description":"The purpose of this report is to examine the population of artists in terms of age, sex, and earnings and to compare the results from 1970 and 1976. An artist in this report includes people in the following categories: actors, architects, dancers, designers, musicians and composers, painters and sculptors, photographers, and radio and television announcers. Highlights of the analysis report that the number of artists increased 50% from 1970 to 1976, from 600,000 to 900,000, but that median earnings remained the same at $7,900. The lack of increase in earnings is explained by the 50% increase in artists, while positions for artists increased by only 23%. The number of women in artistic occupations increased by 80% while males in artistic occupations increased by half that amount.  In 1970 artists' personal earnings contributed 62% of their household earnings, by 1976 the contribution had fallen to 44%. Women were more dependent on other household members than men were and accounted for only a quarter of the total household income in 1970 and 1976. These data suggest that while artists' personal earnings are relatively low, artists tend to be members of households which compare closely with total household earnings of all professionals. Although artists' median personal earnings did not increase between 1970 and 1976, the total household earnings rose by 40% during this period. The artists' population is composed of relatively young people and is predominantly male. From 1970 to 1976 the population became younger and the proportion of women artists increased. The  mid-decade observation period was marked by a recession in which the rate of artistic unemployment increased more than all professional workers. The difference reflects the increased proportion of young people, women, and blacks in artistic occupations, because unemployment rates are generally higher for these groups. Over 40 tables and figures display and support the findings. (APG)",

        "description":"The importance of restructuring the discipline of geography and enhancing its role in the precollege curriculum as part of a global approach to education is emphasized in this paper. International education is seen as an essential part of high school and college education in an increasingly interdependent world. The oil crisis, the world economic recession, and the Iranian hostage crisis have made the U.S. public aware of the complex world situation and have increased the need to understand the complexities of global interdependence. A revitalization of regional geography or area studies with a global emphasis and a problems approach is suggested. In order to show how geography developed as a discipline and illustrate its placement in the curriculum of the United States and  Europe, its history is traced from the eighteenth century to the present. Traditionally, geography has held a higher status in the curriculum in Europe than in the United States. By the time a global perspective was introduced into the United States curriculum, theoretical goegraphy prevailed at the university level, and geography was never introduced as a required and integral part of high school education as it was in Europe.

Data were obtained from a group-administered questionnaire including forced-choice, expectancy, and semantic-differential formats. Multiple analysis of variance indicated that health motivation decreased appreciably and in linear fashion with age and that perceived vulnerability was nonlinearly and complexly related to age. Most health-related cognitions remained largely stable and did not change appreciably during childhood or  adolescence. Gender had some effect, particularly upon perceived vulnerability. Socioeconomic level had few clearcut and consistent effects. This report details study methodology and procedures, results in each of the categories, and implications including the need for health educators to re-examine their assumptions about socioeconomic, sex, and age effects of students' health attitudes and behaviors.

The &quot;Checklist Inventory for Assessing Emergency Care Preparedness in the Schools&quot; was used to identify strengths and  weaknesses of the district's 30 public schools. Findings indicated that less than half of the sampled schools had developed policies for sudden or chronic illness. Eighteen percent of the schools had not designated personnel to render first aid in the absence of school nurses or clinic aides. Less than 10 percent of schools required all their personnel to be trained in first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In 96 percent of the schools, a room and appropriate equipment were found for emergency care. Findings indicated that 93 percent of the schools had an adequate mechanism to notify parents or guardians about emergency care. Most schools (82 percent) also had an effective emergency pupil transportation policy. Most (93 percent) also maintained an accessible student emergency record  file. (CB)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to derive a reliable system for classifying the 1,425 responses of over 800 teacher education candidates to a survey regarding adjectives used to describe teacher characteristics. Previous research had indicated five major themes underlying the adjectives teacher candidates think their students will use in describing them: empathic; stimulating; easy to work with; hard working; and expertise. A sixth category was used for words that did not fit into any of the major categories. The 90 most frequently cited adjectives, accounting for 92.5 percent of the responses, were sorted into categories by 17 sorters and results were analyzed for agreement between sorters. Factor analysis showed agreement rates of 89 percent for empathic, 55 percent for  expertise, 75 percent for easy to work with, 67 percent for hard working, and 73 percent for stimulating. It is concluded that, while there is some overlap among the sets, low agreement in such areas as &quot;expertise&quot; suggests that caution should be exercised in using these results. (CB)",

Orientations to teaching of students in undergraduate teacher preparation programs at Michigan State University (MSU) and experienced classroom teachers are described. Two central questions were addressed: (1) How do the opinions and beliefs of these education majors compare with those of experienced teachers? (2) What is the relationship between the years of classroom experience and the teachers' opinions and beliefs about teaching? Responses to three instruments surveying background and beliefs about teaching were obtained from four groups: (1) &quot;entry&quot;--391 undergraduate students; (2) &quot;exit&quot;--332 students enrolled in final teacher preparation courses; (3)&quot;experienced&quot;--382 full-time classroom teachers from a large urban school district in Michigan; and (4) &quot;alumni&quot;--90 former MSU teacher education majors from across the United States, now employed as full-time teachers. Comparative data on the responses of the four groups to the survey instruments are presented in tables, and responses of the four groups to 61 &quot;beliefs&quot; statements are appended. Findings indicate that knowledge of a teacher's level of experience is not always enough to predict how that teacher will respond to beliefs statements, and that the effect of the &quot;teaching culture&quot; in shaping one's educational beliefs is quite pervasive.

Thirteen of these student teachers received training and supervision in data-based instruction which involved teaching the student teachers to identify important learning problems, design and implement effective instructional interventions, and make valid assessments of short-term academic gains. Pretests measuring reading and  mathematics abilities and off-task behavior of pupils were administered during the first week and after the eighth week of student teaching.

A description is given of the environmental conditions of the University of Rochester (New York) which most influence the character of its education school: (1) the institution is private and financially secure; (2) it has a tradition of &quot;corporate&quot; or top-down governance; (3) it deliberately maintains a small size (for a university) in order to foster interdependence among its units; and (4) it pursues distinctiveness through selective focus rather than breadth of offerings. The &quot;arts and sciences&quot; character of the university has a significant influence on its Graduate School of Education and Human Development  (GSEHD). In the second section of this paper, a discussion is presented of the arenas in which this university orientation has the greatest impact on GSEHD: (1) the mission or special emphasis of GSEHD; (2) the character and composition of its faculty; (3) shifts in program emphasis; and (4) shifts in its research and development activities.

The respondents were asked to group the most and the least important of the 11 teaching skills, as well as to select a single most important skill. The findings strongly suggest that educators do not perceive the 11 skills as equally important for hiring, or for successful teaching by new teachers. The respondents agreed strongly that a cluster of three skills relating to evaluation of student progress and to professionalism was less important than the other eight skills in the context of beginning  teachers. The raters' consensus was less strong on the choice of a cluster of most important teaching skills, although there was agreement that a teacher's relationship with students was of primary importance.

        "description":"In discussing quality indicators of teacher education programs, three components of teacher education are addressed: the program's content, the faculty, and products of inquiry. Three different rationales are presented for selecting and ordering content for teacher education curricula. These rationales, phrased as \"decision-rules\" are: in order to be considered viable content for a teacher preparation program, the concept, principle, or process must be: (1) related to student growth as revealed by empirical evidence; or (2) identified as a necessary curricular component by expert opinion based on experience; or (3) logically explained by a theory from social science and/or philosophy. Examples of content-maps resulting from the execution of each of these rules are presented to  illustrate the nature of content resulting from each decision-rule. A discussion is presented on quality indicators of teacher education professors, citing the influence of prior teaching experience and the nature of doctoral preparation as important influences on the professor's subsequent performance in teaching, research, and service. A brief discussion is presented on a recent study undertaken to investigate inquiry productivity in teacher education among colleges and universities in the United States. The assessment of productivity was based on contributions to annual meetings of teacher associations and to leading journals of teacher education. References are included. (JD)",

Program participants were screened with the California Achievement Tests. A 65-item needs assessment questionnaire was administered to teachers and administrators in each of the programs. The items, representing 13 categories of functions, were rated  on the degree to which they should exist, as well as the degree to which they actually existed. Results were used to generate a priority needs index for each of the items and were also intended to be used in program planning. Functions which consistently received high priority rankings included professional development; parent and community involvement; program goals and objectives; recognition and reward of excellence; coordination with other school programs; program goals and objectives; instructional materials, methods, and approaches; leadership; and expectations of students. The questionnaires and results are appended. (GDC)",

The literature on the effectiveness of several missing data procedures (MDP) is summarized. The most widely used MDPs are: (1) listwise deletion; (2) pairwise deletion; (3) variable mean; (4) correlational methods. No MDP should be used without considering the characteristics of the data at hand, even though the literature may support one MDP. An application of these MDPs was demonstrated using college placement data taken from a published article on predicting success in foreign language training. The data included 12 variables (10 predictors and 2 criteria) for 279 college students. Descriptive statistics were produced by listwise and pairwise deletions, and missing  predictor values were imputed. Missing data indicator variables were created to indicate the presence or absence of values on each of the original variables. The matrix of correlations between the indicator variables and the original variables appears in Table 3. The primary analysis involved the use of stepwise regression equations based on three alternative MDPs. The conclusion is made that regardless of the MDP selected, it is important to first determine the properties of the missing values, and second to decide which MDP is most appropriate. (BAE)",

The results were compared, as well as the computer costs. Also, the results from six different lengths of anchor items were compared. The different equating methods yielded very similar results. They would be essentially equally satisfactory in this situation in which the tests were made parallel in difficulty and content item by item, and the groups of  examinees were population cohorts separated by only two years. Computer costs for the linear method were the least--one-tenth the costs of the most expensive, the concurrent IRT method. An anchor of 10 items provided equating as effective as 30 items using the concurrent IRT method. (Author/GDC)",

The new scales were substantially revised from two earlier racial attitude scales: the Social Distance Scale and the Social Situations Scale. Factor analyses revealed two factors for the Social Scale: non-intimate social relations and more intimate partnerships or social relations. Test reliability was .89 and .71. The Social Scenarios Scale, containing 12 situational items, yielded three factors: pejorative remarks, intimacy, and job or  housing injustice. Test reliability ranged from .54 to .75.

Grade point averages were obtained on 278 disabled students; 236 had enough complete data to be included in the study. Disabled students earned lower mean GRE scores than their nonhandicapped counterparts but, except for visually impaired students, they earned overall graduate grade point averages very close to those of nonhandicapped students. Differences in the GRE performance of blind students compared to students with other visual disabilities raised questions for further research. The predictive validity of the GRE scores obtained in nonstandard administrations was estimated with empirical Bayes procedures. The differences between  actual and predicted grade point averages were more negative for disabled students. The correlations between predicted and actual scores were more modest than results for nonhandicapped students. In addition a distinctive pattern was observed for disabled students: higher predicted five-year averages (FYA) scores were accompanied by increased overprediction. However, considerable caution was recommended in interpreting the results of the study because of the lack of information on nonhandicapped students in the same departments as disabled students.

Three separate simulations, all using the unidimensional three-parameter logistic item response model, were conducted to study the impact of the following variables on preequating: (1) mean differences in ability; (2) multidimensionality in the data; and (3) a combination of mean differences in ability and multidimensionality. One of the Scholastic Aptitude Test mathematical forms (3ASA3) which provided the least acceptable preequating was selected to define true item and person parameters for these simulations. A random sample of 2,744 examinees was used. The LOGIST computer program was chosen to estimate item parameters for the 60 items in 3ASA3 and the 24 items in the equating section  fn. Results showed that differences in mean true ability can cause differences in the precision with which a particular estimation procedure estimates parameters. The introduction of a particular kind of multidimensionality in the data can have a large impact on estimation precision when the IRT model is unidimensional. The combination of a slight decrease in mean ability and a particular type of multidimensionality in the data also has a large impact on estimation precision when the IRT model is unidimensional, although the impact is lessened somewhat.

        "description":"This study of the validity of the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) General Test used data from predictive validity studies that were conducted by the GRE Validity Study Service (VSS) in 79 graduate departments. The performance criterion was first-year grades in graduate school. Observed validities were computed, and for each graduate department validities were also estimated for groups at two other stages of selection--applicants for admission to the department, and all GRE takers. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) General Test's validities were equal across studies; and (2) General Test's validities had equal ratios across studies, i.e., the level of validities might vary from institution to institution, but the ratios would be constant. These hypotheses were applied for VSS  groups, applicant groups, and all GRE takers, and implied validities were calculated. When the implied validities were compared to the observed validities, it was found that the assumption of equal validity did not account well for differences in the level of observed validity of the GRE General Test. The equal ratio hypothesis accounted for the observed validities rather well, but departmental discipline was not significantly related to the degree of fit of observed to implied validities. At all levels of selection, the study yielded applicant validities that were predominantly positive. This lends support to the presumption that the General Test's validity is transportable, i.e., institutions that do not use the General Test can, if they adopt it, expect it to prove valid. Appendices  include: (1) use of test theory to present the effects of self selection; (2) use of a supplementary variable when data are missing for an explicit selector; (3) generalizing the assumption that the validities are proportional across institutions; and (4) calculating validities in the restricted group.

The computer's capacity to collect and record response protocols facilitates detailed process analysis. Such analyses contribute to increased understanding of how individuals differ in their ability to profit from instruction and learn most efficiently. The cognitive engagement processes students use are critical in the computer environment as well as in a variety of other learning environments. The cognitive engagement processes used by more or less successful learners in one computer environment were investigated in a group of 48 California junior high school students using a computer problem-solving game called Wumpus. Results indicated  that protocols of more and less successful students were distinguishable by the spontaneous use of self-regulated learning processes. Successful students were able to shift levels of cognitive engagement in response to computer stimuli and feedback. Implications for the measurement of self-regulatory processes in computer learning environments were discussed. Two other research projects, the Systems Thinking and Curriculum Innovation (STACI) project and the Structural Thinking Experimental Learning Laboratory with Animation (STELLA), are also described.

        "description":"A nominal response model-based computerized adaptive testing procedure (nominal CAT) was implemented using simulated data. Ability estimates from the nominal CAT were compared to those from a CAT based upon the three-parameter logistic model (3PL CAT). Furthermore, estimates from both CAT procedures were compared with the known true abilities used to generate the simulated data. Results showed that the nominal CAT's ability estimates were highly correlated with those of the 3PL CAT as well as with the true abilities. Furthermore, the nominal CAT had a significantly higher association with negative true thetas than did the 3PL CAT, and it also had significantly lower standard errors of estimate than did the 3PL CAT. However, the nominal model-based CAT had difficulty estimating  positive thetas and had a poor convergence rate. In contrast, the 3PL CAT had a high convergence rate and its performance was not affected by whether the true abilities were positive or negative. Potential reasons for the nominal CAT's high nonconvergence rate as well as implications for computerized adaptive testing were discussed. (Author)",

Repeated measures analyses of variance indicated the Battelle Cognitive Total was significantly lower than the Binet Composite and Kaufman Mental Processing Composite. Similar analyses for global scores measuring similar constructs (memory, nonverbal reasoning and  achievement) indicated no significant differences among the tests. Gender differences were indicated on the Sequential Processing Scale and Mental Processing Composite of the Kaufman and the Short-Term Memory Scale of the Binet.

        "description":"The decline in standardized test scores during the 1960s and 1970s is well documented and is seen in both aptitude and achievement test scores. This paper describes and analyzes the test score trends over the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s for five aptitude tests: (1) the Scholastic Aptitude Test; (2) the American College Test; (3) the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test; (4) the Graduate Record Examinations; and (5) the Graduate Management Admission Test. Test score means are standardized and represented graphically. This standard score transformation placed each test on the same score scale and allowed for comparisons of trends between tests, using the Pearson product-moment correlation. Variables correlated were annual test score means and number of years. Analyses were  conducted between the initial data point and 1980, and between 1980 and 1984. The second analyses were intended to test two hypotheses: (1) that the score decline has &quot;bottomed out&quot;; and (2) that a statistically significant change in test scores occurred in the more recent time frame. The decline in aptitude test scores through the 1960s and 1970s is evident for most tests. Lowest score points occurred throughout the mid-1970s to 1981. Most of the aptitude test scores increased during the 1980s, with a common turning point in the school year 1981-1982. (BAE)",

        "description":"This study examines the effect of one social milieu factor (Israeli kibbutz versus urban lifestyle) on Israeli adolescents' future orientation. Responses of 114 kibbutz and 112 urban adolescents to an open-ended Future Orientation Questionnaire are grouped into nine life domains: school and matriculation, military service, higher education, work and career, marriage and family, self, others, collective issues, and community service. Analysis shows that, overall, kibbutz adolescents express fewer concerns for the future (lower salience), and their image of the future is less detailed and elaborate (lower specificity). These tendencies are especially manifested in domains pertaining to transition to adulthood (military service, higher education) and adulthood (work and career,  marriage and family) roles. Results are interpreted in terms of a negative relationship between the appraisal of environmental responsiveness to prospective needs and future orientation. Integration of these results with earlier findings indicating a positive relationship between social conditions and future orientation suggest that the relationship between the appraisal of environmental responsiveness and future orientation has an inverted U-shape. A four-page bibliography is attached. (Author/JAZ)",

These methods are applied when the minority group sample size is too small to obtain stable estimates of item parameters. This study analyzed the data which included ten black slang items imbedded within a standardized vocabulary test. In order to determine the best methodology, three statistics were calculated: a point biserial correlation between an a priori bias index and the detected bias index associated with each method, intercorrelations among the bias measures of three procedures, and the percentage of agreement between the a  priori bias index and bias index based on each method. Results showed that (1) the chi-square technique is slightly more accurate than the pseudo-IRT(Z) method in detecting bias; (2) Angoff's revised transformed item difficulty (TID) method is considerably worse; and (3) the chi-square procedure is highly correlated with the pseudo-IRT(Z) method. Appendices include item bias indices for all items and all methods, item information for computing the item bias index of Angoff's revised TID method for white and black groups, estimates of item parameters based on the three-parameter logistic model for Linn-Harnisch's method, and principal component analysis of the test item.

        "description":"Needs assessment is an activity undertaken for planning purposes. It is important to define the limits of the study and design it on a scale appropriate to the entire planning process. This paper suggests that a needs assessment be structured into two phases. In the pre-assessment phase, a conceptual framework and well-defined exploratory activities delineate the focus and scope of the assessment. The second phase is the formal assessment, in which the data-gathering tasks are limited to areas of concern highlighted by the pre-assessment. The pre-assessment phase is typically conducted by the needs assessor and small numbers of key informants. The formal assessment phase extends to a sampling of the larger population of clients, namely service receivers, service providers, and  stakeholders. Three strategies for dealing with problems of scope are described: identifying critical issues, defining limits through analyses of existing data, and conceptualizing the problem using a \"matrix assessment.\" The strategies can be used separately or in combination. Examples from educational and other settings are used to show the application of the strategies in different content areas. (Author/JAZ)",

Data were collected from college records and surveys completed by 316 university freshmen at the beginning of and 10 weeks into the 1984 fall semester and at the beginning of the 1985 spring semester. Logistic regression analysis in conjunction with LISREL was used to analyze the data. Within LISREL, an initial model was specified using paths described in Tinto's model of college student attrition. Tinto's model consists of six key constructs linked causally: background characteristics, initial commitments, academic and social integration, later commitment, and persistence.  Results reinforced Tinto's conjecture that background effects do influence persistence directly. Initial levels of institutional and goal commitments strongly influenced later levels of the same variables. For both males and females, academic and social integration positively influenced persistence. For females, academic integration, social integration and later institutional commitment were significant predictors of persistence. For males, only academic integration and social integration significantly and directly influenced persistence. (JAZ)",

        "description":"The higher education community needs measures of the value added to student development by the college experience. The American College Testing Program (ACT) provides a quick, easy method for estimating the extent of student growth in general education. An institution can test seniors with the ACT College Outcome Measures Project (COMP) exam, then subtract from the senior score an estimated freshman score obtained from a &quot;concordance table&quot; that is based on the known relationship (r = .70) between freshman ACT Assessment Composite score and freshman COMP total score. Studies using scores for 4,200 seniors and 2,100 freshmen tested during a two-year period at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK) indicate that this method is not sufficiently reliable or valid to serve as  the basis for making precise judgments about the relative quality of general education programs at various institutions, as at least one state coordinating agency for higher education has attempted to do. These studies show that estimates of student score gain on the COMP exam may be derived from systematically biased samples if not all students have ACT Assessment scores, and can be in error by as much as 60 percent. Moreover, estimated score gain bears a negative relationship to a number of institutional variables generally associated with good practice in higher education. Appendices contain contingent proportions for students with and without ACT scores on selected variables (1984-85 and 1985-86 UTK senior samples) and mean gain scores for selected variables (same periods and same  sample).

These issues revolve around the following questions: (1) What career-related curriculum should be incorporated into the new basics? (2) What contributions can vocational and career education make to reducing the dropout rate? (3) How can articulated secondary-postsecondary programs support high-quality occupational training? and (4) How can literacy programs increase the literacy rate among adult Americans? Effective and innovative programs that are currently addressing those questions are discussed. These issues are representative of various educational levels and grow out of the following three major trends: (1) a changing workplace and its effects on occupational and  educational requirement; (2) the growing concern for reaching disconnected youth and adults; and (3) the current emphasis on educational excellence. This report attempts to clarify the context surrounding each of the four issues, to describe emerging and promising educational approaches, and to suggest future directions needed to strengthen research, development, dissemination, and implementation.

Four critical issues brought up by that increased demand are: (1) computers in counseling; (2) students at risk; (3) pre-college guidance; and (4) career guidance. These are discussed in detail in this report. A review of research on the use of computer-assisted and computer-supported guidance shows the positive reactions of students and the ambivalent feelings of counselors. Three types of programs that have demonstrated effectiveness in dealing with at-risk pupils are discussed. Pre-college guidance is a short-changed area, despite the evidence that counseling interventions make a difference in who has  access to college, who attends, and who stays in and does well. Areas in which guidance programs must be strengthened are discussed. The history of career development theory and practice, its roots and future are summarized. The major focuses of guidance and counseling in the near future are pinpointed. A list of references is attached. (PS)",

This report discusses how to teach grammar and select literature in order to achieve those goals. Research and issues in grammar teaching are reviewed. Grammar learning is enhanced in active language environments that use techniques such as role-playing and sentence combining, while attending to grammar concerns primarily within the writing process. The following types of \"literature\" should be included in the curriculum: (1) a wide range of works for all ages: (2) popular literature; (3) great classical and contemporary literature; (4) nonprint media  such as television, film, and drama; (5) students' personal experience; and (6) information about literature (authors' lives, particular works, literary movements, figures of speech, metric patterns, etc.). The latter, though emphasized in the past, should be approached more as a tool than as an end in itself and should be subordinate to higher order thinking skills and students' responses to characters and events in a work. Since nonprint media provide students' most frequent vicarious experience, the English teacher has an important stake in guiding their understanding of the imaginative worlds presented there.

        "description":"Two issues that bear directly on the proficiency of teachers are teacher selection and teacher supervision. A theme common to both issues is that the key to attracting and retaining capable teachers lies in a transformation of teachers' work environment--replacing the bureaucratic model of schooling with the professional model. That transformation can be effected with the help of competent selection and supervision practices. The first part of this report summarizes pioneering studies that have examined the teacher selection process in school districts. It also explores support systems for beginning teachers and the role of school organizational structures in encouraging capable young teachers to remain in the profession. The second part of the report discusses collegial  observation and feedback as a means of bringing quality instructional leadership to schools. Instructional leadership can be a collective activity, drawing on the strengths and expertise of more persons than just the principal. The report examines why such observation and feedback is difficult. It also considers some of the benefits of and approaches to collegial observation and feedback. A reference list is included.

(2) The relationship between regular and special education -- this must be restructured to achieve shared responsibilities between general and special practitioners and more effective use of the resource room and consultant models.

The goal of foreign language teaching is now the effective use of the language in real-life communication settings. The second development is the introduction of the microcomputer to the language classroom. The following aspects of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) are discussed: (1) accessibility; (2) guidelines for CALL software development and review; (3) adoption of a systems analysis view of the instructional  process; and (4) evaluation of CALL results. The third development is content-based language instruction--the simultaneous teaching of English and subject matter areas such as history or social studies to nonnative speakers of English.

Increased demand for accountability from the state and federal government and  decreased fiscal resources have also initiated an examination of traditional means and measures of efficiency and effectiveness. Meeting these needs for a new type of student body with new demands in the face of new technology has required leaders of institutions to reassess mission and role as well as instructional and learning environments. Attention has been focused on issues of faculty development, part-time faculty, faculty evaluation and freedoms, and faculty role in governance. The report includes a four-page list of references.

Trends are toward tightening criteria for attendance. Colleges in some states will be forced to make clearer distinctions among the student groups they serve and for whom they expect to receive public funds. Minimal criteria will be established and placement will be mandated. The second issue is effecting student flow. Colleges will probably become more vigorous in separating students, courses, and programs into more defensible categories for purposes of funding. Current classifications such as college credit, occupational, remedial, adult, and community services are inadequate. The third concern is preserving a comprehensive  curriculum. College internal organization will move toward alignment on the basis of curricular content as modified by students' intent and goals. The fourth issue is maintaining an appropriate teaching staff. Faculty employment and evaluation criteria will remain essentially unchanged. The university graduate divisions and the occupational and business communities will continue as the primary source of new instructors. Pay scales will continue to reflect college credits earned and years of experience. Teaching will move slowly toward becoming a cooperative endeavor. A list of references is included. (PS)",

        "description":"In order to improve teacher education and the quality of teaching in classrooms, it is necessary to know what characterizes a competent teacher, what the best curriculum is for developing competent beginning teachers, and how teacher competence can be measured. This report summarizes research on those topics and suggests the following: (1) Because competence depends on so many factors, developing and determining teacher competence is a complex matter. (2) The teacher training curriculum should be structured so that teacher candidates develop their own frameworks for decision making based on, among other things, research knowledge, subject matter knowledge, practical knowledge, ethics, conceptions of teaching, and the information they have about the particular teaching context and  the particular children. (3) Standardized tests of teachers' knowledge, pupil achievement scores and teacher evaluations have not proved effective means of measuring competence. The report concludes with seven suggestions which would lay a groundwork for defining, developing, and determining competence in teachers. A reference list is included. (PS)",

The first section discusses the mastery of basic skills, defined by minimum levels of competence. Factors such as accountability, social policy, instructional implications, and psychometric issues are brought to bear on the subject. The second section examines problems more complex than those involved with assessing basic skills. Identifying and defining higher order skills, designing a sound curriculum, and deciding whether available instruments are adequate for assessing higher order skills are among the goals which must be achieved to adequately teach and test higher order skills. The third section points out some concerns related to testing  teachers before they begin to practice their profession. Two major trends, using the National Teacher Examinations from the Educational Testing Service and using state programs to develop teacher certification tests, are presented. A state-of-the-art survey, detailed in section four, describes computer-assisted educational testing as it is used for writing test items, constructing tests, administering tests, scoring and analyzing results, and record keeping.

Current studies on dropping out attempt to locate the responsibility for high dropout rates in policies or practices that schools initiate and have the power to change. Findings of these studies are discussed. Hispanic students have not profited from their education, nor have they been well served by the schools. Their academic achievement and educational attainment are among the lowest of any group. Precipitating factors, such as poverty and poor English, are discussed and suggestions are made for increasing the relevance of public education for Hispanics. Difficulties in attracting and retaining a high quality urban teaching  force are discussed. Three requirements for improving the situation are: designing appropriate preservice education programs for urban teachers, improving recruitment practices, and structuring work conditions to ensure the retention and continued development of competent professionals. Examples of each are covered. Teachers will improve the quality of their own work lives by learning to be more responsive to the needs of their urban students. References are included. (PS)",

JOBSTART was targeted to disadvantaged high school dropouts, and provided them with basic educational and occupational skills training, combined with support services and assistance in finding an unsubsidized job. The program was carried out at 16 sites and funded in part through the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA). This report evaluates the program and its effectiveness. It contains the following: (1) an introduction; (2) a description of how the JOBSTART demonstration was incorporated into the JTPA system; (3) an overview of the JOBSTART sites; (4) JTPA  policies at the local level and implementation of JOBSTART; (5) information on recruitment and enrollment; and (6) an appendix consisting of profiles of the 16 sites. A list of references is included. It was found that the following operational challenges still face JOBSTART: (1) overcoming the difficulties associated with recruiting young high school dropouts in order to meet the enrollment targets; (2) ensuring that the youths remain in training for the intended duration; (3) successfully placing them in jobs; and (4) moving youths through the educational component in a timely manner and meeting the entry requirements of skills training courses.

It explored the following issues: (1) academic growth between the sophomore and senior years; (2) the courses the students take while in high school; and (3) the relationship of schooling and student characteristics to academic growth. Findings indicated that Hispanics' average growth did not differ significantly from that of other students. However, average Hispanic achievement was substantially below that of non-Hispanic Whites at both sophomore and senior levels. Far fewer Hispanic seniors than non-Hispanic seniors described themselves as enrolled in an academic program. Over half of all Hispanics except Cubans were enrolled in vocational programs.  Hispanics earned fewer credits in the new basics by their senior year than did non-Hispanic Whites. More Hispanics than non-Hispanics drop out of school: approximately 21 percent as compared with 16 percent of Blacks and 12 percent of non-Hispanic Whites. Public policy toward Hispanics should aim at the following: (1) enhancing student achievement in the elementary and intermediate years; (2) reducing the high school dropout rate; and (3) increasing participation of Hispanics in academic programs.

It contains recommendations to the Secretary of Labor and to the Congress. Results indicate that most local programs have some youth competency system, but these are locally determined and can vary substantially. Competency areas differ, attainment criteria differ, and data for a competency standard are lacking. Therefore States need performance standards that are adjusted to account for  differences in competency systems. Incentive awards could discourage, not encourage, provision of the training many youths need. If a competency standard is established, GAO believes it should measure local programs' success in increasing the employability of youth--which requires data on the extent to which all youth in competency training attained competencies.

It found that although the overall ratio of blacks employed at SSA headquarters increased from 1982 to 1985, underrepresentation of blacks--especially black men--remains an issue in the SSA components and job series GAO reviewed. While black women are fully represented in most job series through the grade 12 level, they are underrepresented at grades 13 to 15. Black men are generally underrepresented at most grade levels. Some elements of SSA's and its components' affirmative action plans have not been implemented. Some of the planned efforts cannot be satisfactorily monitored or evaluated  because SSA does not compile and analyze Commission-required applicant flow data. Therefore, SSA's components cannot evaluate their affirmative action efforts to identify possible employment barriers to underrepresented minority groups, and SSA cannot develop and implement effective strategies to reduce or eliminate obstacles which may hamper minorities' advancement opportunities. The report details GAO findings, conclusions and recommendations. Also included are SSA comments on the report. Several tables and charts illustrate findings. (PS)",

The following was determined: (1) how chapter 1 children were selected; (2) whether they met Federal, State, and local selection requirements; and (3) how compliance with these requirements was assured. Results indicate that all 51 State agencies used standardized test scores to some extent to choose participants. GAO found few errors in the choice of students to receive chapter 1 reading services. In the 11 districts relying mainly on test scores, nearly all placement decisions met standards based on the district's applicable criterion or reasonable professional judgments by school  officials. In the six districts using additional selection factors, few indefensible placements were found. State agencies monitored compliance with chapter 1 requirements chiefly by reviewing districts' applications for funds and making site visits of limited frequency and duration. During the school year 1983-84, 21 State agencies reduced site visits because of cuts in administrative funds.

Specifically, do returns to migration vary across places of destination, and does this variation reflect labor supply and demand differentials and/or other characteristics of places of destination? Analysis of the impact of selected characteristics of destinations on the socioeconomic attainment of migrants, using data for 1970 and changes between 1970 and 1976, reveals that substantial variation exists between Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSA) with respect to annual earnings returns to occupational and educational attainment, and occupational attainment returns to educational attainment. The level of these  returns not only declined across the board between 1970 and 1976, but between-SMSA variations increased as well. Analysis also indicates that SMSA differences in socioeconomic returns to migrants, particularly among the college educated, were more responsive to factors reflecting changing economic conditions than to those of nonmigrants in 1970, but changes in socioeconomic returns occurring during the 1970-76 period were not related to these factors for a smaller number of SMSA's.

Disadvantaged business entrepreneurs (DBEs), defined as minority- and women-owned firms and minority/women entrepreneurs, have not participated as fully as possible in the equity ownership opportunities offered by joint development projects. This manual attempts to encourage participation by introducing DBEs to the benefits and risks of commercial real estate development and the  specific requirements of joint development projects. A self-teaching guide, it describes the unique characteristics of joint development projects, explaining in detail the underlying process, with special attention paid to participant roles and policies. It provides a basic introduction to financial planning so DBEs can evaluate their financial readiness to pursue equity ownership opportunities in joint development projects. The manual provides an analytical framework in which to apply the technical tools commonly used in analyzing a transit-related real estate investment opportunity.

        "description":"South Carolina's first major dropout prevention initiative began two decades ago when leaders became more interested in the industrial development of the State. A 1966 study found that black youths were experiencing a dropout rate of 72%, while that of white youth was 48%. Statewide efforts taken in the early 1970's to alleviate this problem were fairly successful, but the dropout issue was subsequently almost forgotten until very recently. Today, the State suffers from one of the fourth lowest graduation rates in the nation, and black students' dropout rate remains unacceptably high. But dropout data are difficult to formulate and ascertain, and there is a shortage of information on the characteristics of the typical 1980's dropout since no detailed demographic profile has been  published since 1973. Recently there has been a resurgence of interest in collecting data and formulating policies, including the establishment of a major statewide effort, the Department of Education's Dropout Prevention Task Force. Various strategies have been adopted for targeting specific groups of youth who may eventually drop out, including school-business alliances. Nonetheless, there remains the need for routine assessment of the circumstances of high risk students to determine if they are potential dropouts. Also, problems may increase in the wake of recent efforts to raise graduation standards. This report includes seven statistical tables and an appendix presenting a form for identifying high risk students. (KH)",

        "description":"Many of the arguments behind efforts to reform this nations's immigration laws allege that immigrants, especially illegal immigrants, take jobs away from native workers, depress wages, and receive public services valued in excess of their tax contributions. To provide a basis for appraising these economic arguments, this paper presents a model for simulating the economic effects of immigration. The model is a theoretical framework, useful for understanding how the various economic responses triggered by immigration relate to one another. Simulation of the model shows that the effects of an increase in annual flow of immigrants are highly sensitive to the substitutability between labor and capital and among different kinds of labor; to the responsiveness of wage changes to  unemployment; to the presence or absence of wage rigidity; and to the skill mix of immigrants. Effects are also sensitive to regional behavior, specifically to the response of interregional migration and interregional trade to wage and price differentials. The report contains an overview of the model, simulation of the model, and an agenda for future work on the model. Included are a list of references and related titles. An appendix lists the variables, the equations with the coefficients used for the reference simulation, and the alterations for each of the other simulations. (LBW)",

Two hundred twenty-nine Haitian, Korean, and Vietnamese speaking pupils were served at two sites in Queens, New York, and one in the Bronx, New York. Project students attended courses in English as a Second Language (ESL) at each site and, in addition, Vietnamese students at Theodore Roosevelt High School and Korean students at William C.

It includes information on office staff, and on each elementary and secondary school, school for the handicapped, children's center, and adult and occupational education school. These statistics show that the Hispanic count has continually risen from 18.6 percent in 1966 to its current high point of 55.7 percent. Black student percentages rose from 21.4 percent in 1966 to 25.3 percent in 1973, and have, since that year, slowly declined to the current low of 18.2 percent. White student enrollment has steadily declined from 56.1 percent in 1966 to its current 17.7 percent. Asian, Filipino, and Pacific Islander students have slowly increased from 3.8  percent in 1966 to 8.1 percent in 1986. Students of American Indian or Alaskan Native heritage have remained at approximately the same count: in 1966 they were 0.1 percent and in 1986 they were 0.3 percent. The 1986 combined minority population of the district was 82.3 percent. In the appendix, Table A offers a two-page overview of LAUSD ethnic enrollment from 1966 to 1984. Appendix Table B reports data for 1985 and 1986. Appendix Table C compiles all 1986 grand total sections into a single display. (PS)",

        "description":"This report presents the results of an evaluation of state workfare programs created since 1981, when Congress authorized work program options that let State Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) agencies experiment with new approaches. The report, divided into seven chapters, focuses on program characteristics, participants, how the programs prepare participants for work, the extent of provision and effectiveness of support services, the programs' results to date, problems with assessing their effectiveness, and implications of the findings for Federal policy. The major finding reported is that the variety of work program options has given states the flexibility to tailor their programs to local need, but that multiple legislative authorizations have resulted in a  patchwork of administrative responsibilities and lack of overall program direction. Further, the disparate levels of Federal matching funds across programs limit states' ability to match work program options with participants' needs. Program authorizations could be consolidated and funding levels made consistent across programs without reducing state flexibility. To serve more participants, programs spread their limited funds thinly, but the study found that only a minority of adult AFDC recipients were served in 1985, excluding many with young children or severe barriers to employment. Evaluations of the work programs have shown modest positive effects on the employment and earnings of participants, but wages were often insufficient to boost participants off welfare. Appendices include  the study instrument, a breakdown of program characteristics by state, and a description of work program activities.

        "description":"Black adolescents have learned a well-defined fear of \"acting white\": a fear of excelling in academic arenas which traditionally have been defined as the prerogative of white Americans. The focus of this analysis is the resulting conflict experienced by academically successful and unsuccessful black students in one predominantly black high school in Washington, D.C. The basic premise is that black students experience inordinate ambivalence and affective dissonance around the issue of academic excellence in the school context. This paper contains four sections. The first briefly reviews the theoretical and ethnographic literature on how the black ecological structure affects the school performance of black students, highlighting the fictive kinship system in the black community.  The second section reviews existing research literature and autobiographical data on black students' success, noting the existence of a fictive kinship system in the black community and in academic success (including the notion of \"acting white\"). The third part considers ethnographic evidence from recent fieldwork, presenting preliminary findings from that research setting. The final section discusses the implications of the analysis, focusing on the \"burden of acting white\" and academic success among black adolescents. A six-page reference list is appended. (LHW)",

(2) Teachers and principals must be able to choose the kind of schooling they wish to practice. (3) A permanent system-wide Parent and Citizen Planning Council should be established, and its members should conduct parent/professional surveys,  operate a city-wide Parent Information Center, and perform other similar functions. (4) School-based management is preferred, and every school should have a School Parent Council elected by the parents whose children attend that school. (5) Parents should be involved in the selection and retention of all school staff. (6) When possible, schools should have full-time, paid parent coordinators or liaisons. (7) Parents should have access to technical assistance to aid them in their school involvement. (8) Parents should have access at all times to each individual school.

It is also shaped by the people who control the education--the teachers, administrators, and governing officials--and by the goals they design. This module explores these variations as they have affected the elementary schooling of black girls and women in the South since 1865. It is the first of four modules designed to help educators learn more about the double bias that has faced southern black women in American schools since the Civil War. The following topics are discussed: (1) education during reconstruction; (2) the decline of public support for black education from 1877 to 1900; (3) women's life and  teaching in late 19th century black classrooms; (4) interest in designing an appropriate black education, 1900-30; (5) early 20th century school life; and (6) school experience in the mid-20th century. Sidebars include excerpts from the diary of a New England teacher; excerpts from other texts showing the role of women in the 19th century; an interview with an urban black girl at the turn of the century; a description of rural school life, 1914-15; questions for discussion; activities for enrichment; and a bibliography.

The project sought to raise the reading, mathematics and language performance levels of low achieving students at schools with high concentrations of children from low income families. Achievement was assessed by score gains reported from the April 1984 and April 1985 administrations of the Stanford Achievement Test. Evaluation efforts also included monitoring the status of project operations through site visits, and a survey of Chapter 1 personnel and parents. Results showed that overall district public school reading and mathematics achievement gains were not substantial, but the project was generally successful. The reading gain was slightly higher  than the mathematics gain. In both reading and mathematics, secondary grade level gains were greater than elementary grade level gains. Female reading achievement gains were higher than male gains at both the elementary and secondary levels. Mathematics gains were higher for females at the elementary levels and for males at the secondary levels. The report includes the following: (1) a description of the project; (2) a description of the evaluation; (3) a discussion of results; (4) conclusions and recommendations; and (5) appendices. These constitute the greater part of the report and provide lists of Chapter 1 schools, student selection criteria, descriptions of supplementary program models, individual school achievement test results, and copies of the surveys used.

A Report Prepared by the Staff of the Subcommittee on Elementary, Secondary, and Vocational Education of the Committee on Education and Labor, U.S. House of Representatives, One Hundredth Congress.",
        "description":"This report presents and discusses the results of a congressional study undertaken to assess the validity of a statement in the Department of Education's document, &quot;Summary and Background Information for the Fiscal Year 1988 Budget,&quot; which asserted that many children who are neither poor nor low achievers receive Chapter 1 services. The findings are based on the following: other objective studies on the issue; a reconsideration of the Sustaining Effects Study (SES) on which the Department of Education document is partly based; a telephone survey of 11 states regarding current targeting practices under Chapter 1, &quot;Poverty, Achievement and the Distribution of Compensatory Education Services.&quot; Major findings are: (1) children currently served by Chapter 1 are the lowest-achieving;  (2) the SES data is old and of questionable quality; (3) most students who fall below the 25th percentile do participate in Chapter 1, and there are valid reasons why some low-achieving students are not served by Chapter 1; (4) if needy children are not served, it is primarily because Chapter 1 resources are inadequate to serve all eligible children; and (5) while Chapter 1 services are well-targeted to the poorest schools within districts throughout the country, the law requires student selection at the local level to be based on educational need, not poverty.

        "description":"This hearing examined the impact of the Administration's 1987 budget proposal on child nutrition programs, which were cut significantly. A spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture testified that the proposed budget was designed to preserve benefits for those truly in need, to provide for the national defense, to maintain taxes at the current level, and to meet the deficit target called for by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law. As part of the budget, commodities and reimbursement for school lunch programs would be eliminated for students from families with an income of 185 percent greater than the poverty level. Other testimony and reports covered the following effects of the proposed budget among others: (1) a decrease in the number of pupils served by the School Lunch Program;  (2) restructuring of assistance to schools; (3) a significant increase in the entitlement commodities received by schools with students who cannot afford to pay for lunch; (4)problems for subsidized students in schools with a high number of paying students; (5) distribution of commodities and related storage problems; (6) increased unemployment among food service workers; and (7) elimination of funding for the state level Nutrition Education and Training Program.

Educational efforts are, therefore, now being focused on programs in elementary schools with the hope that benefits of the programs will be sustained at higher levels. Students presently attending secondary school take exit examinations in basic skills, but failure in these exams may encourage dropping out. Six suggestions are offered: (1) commitment to reform as an ongoing process; (2) mobilization of diverse agencies to work with students; (3) creation of alternative education programs; (4) development of comprehensive employability  training; (5) initiation of clearly defined curriculum sequences which prepare students for employment or further study; and (6) special encouragement for black youths to complete high school and to enroll in post-secondary training or study.

        "description":"A descriptive study documented entry-level licensed vocational nurse (LVN) tasks representing educational competencies as perceived by vocational nursing educators, LVNs, and nurse supervisors. Data were gathered from three samples by mailed survey and analyzed using nonparametric descriptive statistics. The respondents included 83 educators, 148 employed LVNs, and 170 supervisors. Three interrelated roles were identified: provider of care, communicator, and a member within nursing. The role of provider of care was subdivided into four steps of the nursing process: assessing, planning, implementing, and evaluating. The other two roles were inherent in the tasks of the role as a provider of care. Data analysis demonstrated a difference in the perceptions of vocational nursing  educators, LVNs, and nursing supervisors on entry-level expectations for vocational nurses. Nursing educators were teaching more than was expected by nursing supervisors in the first year of vocational nursing practice. Entry-level LVNs reported their actual performance to be at a higher level than was expected by nursing supervisors or taught by nursing educators. In general, study results showed supervisors can differentiate a level of nursing practice consistent with most of the Texas Association of Vocational Nurse Educators' educational competencies for entry-level LVN practice. The LVN was expected to develop a professional level of nursing practice at the staff nurse level. (YLB)",

        "description":"Work values, or the qualities and rewards that one desires from work, are considered to be important determinants of career decision making and exploration during adolescence. A study was conducted to investigate age-based continuities and discontinuities in the structure of work values in a cross-sectional sample of 679 students in grades 7-12. It was hypothesized that the structure of work values would not be continuous across the grade levels, and that the discontinuities would reflect a normative pattern of increased differentiation. Work values were measured with the Work Aspect Preference Scale (WAPS). Confirmatory factor analysis was the primary data analytic strategy. The purpose of the analysis was to test for factor invariance of the WAPS scales across gender and grade  levels. The model depicting configural factor invariance across grade levels was rejected, and in general, the structure was found to be more differentiated in the higher grade levels than in the lower grade levels. Females also tended to evidence greater differentiation than males. The findings suggest that the development of work values during adolescence is characterized by the progression toward greater differentiation. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"In preparation for the mandatory administration of the New Jersey High School Proficiency Test (HSPT) that was to begin with ninth graders in 1986, a pilot program was conducted with ninth graders who had done poorly on the HSPT during its second, nonmandatory administration in 1985. Approximately 125 students were selected (25 in each of five school districts in the state) for a summer intervention and basic skill strengthening program, coupled with paid employment. The students in the six-week programs were trained in reading, mathematics, and writing, including essay and multiple-choice writing. After six weeks, the students who completed the program (about 80) were tested. The data indicate that the overall program made a positive difference for the students and should be  continued. However, only reading and mathematics test scores were positive overall, while scores varied across programs and were actually negative in some parts for some programs. Therefore, the following recommendations were made for improving programs: (1) more time for schools to plan programs, (2) more attention to work placement of students, (3) more parental involvement, (4) more broad-based recruitment of teachers, (5) more intensive training of teachers, (6) closer monitoring of the programs, and (7) scoring of tests at the state level to facilitate quicker turnaround of the data.

An evaluation of these programs was conducted to develop a statewide recordkeeping system, to describe the nature of the client population, to describe the nature of the services offered, and to summarize the effects on clients' lives. Follow-up surveys sampled program participants after six months, and on-site observations were made. The study found that the target population of needy women was being served and that clients received primarily an intensive pre-employment course as the core service at  most centers. The course also helped women develop an informal support group as they made friends within the class. From the data gathered, it was concluded that the services provided by the centers were viewed as effective and appropriate by both clients and outside observers. The study also found that many participants found employment or enrolled in vocational training. Twenty-four percent of the clients remained unemployed after the program. Recommendations were made to continue and improve the programs. (Extensive appendixes contain intake and follow-up forms and field notes describing the classes.) (KC)",

        "description":"Seventy-five Australian higher education institutions were surveyed to determine their policies and practices with regard to students with Technical and Further Education (TAFE) qualifications who might apply for transfer from TAFE to higher education. Forty-four of the 49 questionnaires returned were considered usable. It was found that many higher education institutions were more prepared to grant admission to selected courses to qualified TAFE students if the qualifications were in a course analogous to that which the students wished to study at the higher education level. While the practice of granting credit was said to be possible, it was not at all common. The two principal difficulties with transfer reported were (1) a lack of consistent and public policy on transfer to  higher education institutions and the subsequent difficulty for TAFE-qualified students to make qualified judgments about the standing of their qualifications and (2) a shortage of real information on the success of TAFE-qualified students who have transferred to higher education. (Appendixes include a description of the Education Counselling and Credit Transfer Information Service; the project questionnaires; a description of a feasibility study on the establishment of counseling and credit transfer information services; and information on the TAFE transfer policies of the South Australian Institute of Technology, the South Australian College of Advanced Education, and Mitchell College of Advanced Education.)

        "description":"A study examined the range of full-time courses for youths between the ages of 15 and 19 that are offered under Australia's Technical and Further Education (TAFE) system. Two reports resulted from the study. The first report reviewed the TAFE transition education program and formulated 20 recommendations concerning development of the Participation and Equity Program (PEP). This, the second report, focuses on forming the basis of a course structure for development at the local level of initiatives relevant to local vocational needs and circumstances and the personal needs of individuals. The first study's recommendations are summarized in the first chapter. The second chapter attempts to explain why less than half of Australian youths complete secondary schooling by examining  factors influencing completion of secondary schooling and participation in postsecondary education (father's occupation, school system, achievement at age 14, family wealth, ethnic background, rurality, gender). The third chapter introduces an extensive framework for considering curricula in terms of the purpose of education, values within education, and the agents and representation of curriculum. Thirteen recommendations are made in the fourth chapter, which deals with the social reconstruction of transition education. Particular attention is paid to orientations toward curriculum values, social milieu, teachers, subject matter, literacy and numeracy, and the demands that transition education places on teachers. (Appendixes include detailed data from the 1983 and 1985 studies of the  Victorian TAFE PEP population and more detailed information on the different curriculum options examined during the study.)

        "description":"Professional socialization is the process by which individuals acquire the specialized knowledge, skills, attitudes, values, norms, and interests needed to perform their professional roles acceptably. The following interacting domains of potential professional self-growth can be defined as outcomes of the socialization process: self-image, role concept, attitudes, values, and personality. An examination of professional literature on the issue of professional socialization in nursing that was written between 1956 and 1985 revealed that there has been no unified framework in which to study socialization. The sociological model advocated in the 1960s has not been empirically supported in nursing. Although it is difficult to generalize results since most of the studies pertaining to  nursing were limited to one or two schools, the evidence suggests that changes toward professional growth do occur in some domains as a result of the educational process. Of the 24 change studies reported in the literature, 21 were conducted in baccalaureate degree programs and 3 in diploma programs. None were conducted in associate degree programs. Thus, little is known about the effect of the educational environment in associate degree programs on the professional socialization of the nurses graduating from them. Despite the considerable changes in society, the nursing profession, and nursing education that have occurred in the last 10 years, most socialization research was done over 10 years ago. More research is also needed on the factors that contribute to the similarities and  differences among the types of socialization outcomes resulting from different types of educational programs.

        "description":"The four articles in this journal issue examine the pros and cons of the proposition that credit card rates are too high. In \"How Congress and Consumers Will Crack the Credit Card Market,\" Congressman Charles E. Schumer argues that banks can get away with their excessive rates because of consumer misinformation and the unfair competitive edge held by the larger banks that set the tone for the high rates. He therefore recommends the passage of legislation that would require credit card companies to make a full disclosure of their charges before the consumer obtains a card (rather than after as is currently allowed). In \"Bank Credit Cards: An Important Financial Option,\" Jerry D. Craft makes the case that bank card rates are service rates rather than interest rates and that credit  cards have high administrative costs, are affected by fraud, and are actually one of the most competitive products in the United States. Elgie Holstein, in an article entitled \"Bank Credit Cards: Defying Economic Gravity,\" contends that although bank credit cards are the single most profitable area of banking today, credit card price controls would hurt consumers. Holstein suggests a \"floating\" ceiling on credit card interest rates as a compromise. In \"Retail Credit Card Rates: Reality vs. Rhetoric,\" Tracy Mullin distinguishes between retail and bank credit card plans, argues that revenues from retail credit cards are reasonable, and reaffirms Holstein's view that interest rate caps would not help consumers.

Its intention is to provide information for postsecondary institutions on adult learning disabilities and strategies to address them effectively. When students are initially referred to the SEL unit, they undergo an intake and assessment screening procedure. After a review of test results, an individualized educational prescription (IEP) is generated for each SEL student. The two emphases of the IEP are student self-concept and  effective learning strategies. Since commencement of the unit's operation, the staff has provided information on identification of learning disabilities, use of learning disabilities strategies in conventional classrooms, and the needs and fears of learning disabled adults.

Data were from the 1980 sophomore and senior cohorts of the High School and Beyond national longitudinal database. Descriptive findings regarding full-time vocational and comprehensive high schools suggested that vocational teachers often have an associate degree or less and more work experience than academic instructors; students in vocational high schools are from lower socioeconomic status/ability quartiles, are disproportionately male, and are more likely to concentrate in a vocational specialty; and comprehensive high school graduates are more likely to attend postsecondary schools. Individual-level findings of  multivariate analysis indicated that verbal and mathematics scores are significantly lower among students attending area vocational schools; no reliable effect was found for school type when wages were examined; dropout rates were substantially the same; and attendance at a vocational school or area vocational school does not affect rates of postsecondary participation. Institutional aggregate results revealed slight differences: seniors in vocational schools have higher average verbal scores, dropout rates are lower in smaller schools, and no differences were found in program-related placement, mathematics scores, levels of postsecondary attendance, absenteeism, and dropout rates. Data is displayed in 33 tables. References are included. (YLB)",

Chapter 3 reviews the procedural ground rules of JTPA. Six key elements of the act are highlighted: new federalism  relationships, the role of the governor and state job training coordinating council, LEOs and the private industry council (PIC), funding and planning, decision making on clients and services, performance standards, and liability issues.

Of major consequence to this move toward welfare reform are misconceptions about welfare recipients. While some can work, fewer than 10 percent of all recipients would be subject to any work requirement, and while many remain on welfare for extended periods, one-half of all recipients receive benefits for two or fewer years. The general consensus is that the greatest benefits are achieved by focusing attention on welfare recipients and their children who have been on welfare for extended periods. Costs are significantly greater and longer periods are required to serve long-term recipients, but the greatest cost savings accrue to the welfare system when this group is served. Traditional mandatory  Workfare approaches by welfare-to-work programs are giving way to more innovative approaches that seek to serve limited numbers of persons and to minimize mandatory participation requirements. Limitations on numbers served are due to cost considerations and the recent recognition that supportive services (child and health care and transportation) as well as job placement are needed to keep welfare recipients on the job.

Segmenting of the consumer market and zeroing in on the target market are then discussed. Market research is proposed as a method to learn more about potential customers. A two-step approach is suggested: review of social science research and assessment of specific needs. Recruitment shortfalls are then considered as a mismatch between the needs and attitudes of applicants and  program services provided. Other topics include keeping down the cost to the client and distribution issues. After a general discussion of promotion, four specific types are addressed.

Graduates were more responsive to work-related variables; seniors were more affected by education-related variables. The responsiveness to each variable often differed significantly across the subsegments defined by educational expectations. Findings permitted prediction of the enlistment probability of each individual in the sample, given his  personal characteristics. These predicted probabilities showed that large relative differences can be discerned in the enlistment probabilities of young men with diverse characteristics. Findings were recommended to aid recruiters in evaluating the likely payoff from different segments and subsegments of their recruiting markets. The findings suggested that changes in the economic environment will influence different subsegments of the recruiting market differently and that in most segments the decision to enlist is not related to family income. Implications were reported for the design of aggregate data models for analyzing and forecasting enlistments and for expanded use of microlevel enlistment models. (YLB)",

        "description":"Enlistment intentions, educational expectations, and sociodemographic factors were examined in the context of their pairwise relationship to the enlistment decision. A model was developed relating enlistments to stated intentions and other variables. This model was then statistically estimated from a sample from the National Longitudinal Survey. Logistic regression was used to predict enlistments from information on intentions and backgrounds. Findings indicated that enlistees in the armed forces experienced an increase in educational expectations not reflected in the general population. A considerable shift was found among enlistees with respect to original enlistment intentions. Enlistment intentions or propensity was the strongest explanatory factor in predicting enlistment.  Such factors as educational intentions, race, gender, and test score also contributed substantially (and independently of propensity) to explaining enlistment behavior. A positive change in propensity over time had a positive effect on enlistment probability above and beyond the effect of propensity measured at a single point in time. The effect of Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) scores on the probability of enlistment was positive, but the size of this effect diminished as AFQT increased. A desire for training beyond high school but outside of college was a good predictor of enlistment probability. (This report includes 36 figures illustrating study findings.) (YLB)",

Following an introductory chapter, chapter 2 discusses research design, sample, and data sources. (The sample contained 1,287 Work Incentive Program applicants and 1,897 recipients.) Chapter 3 discusses the nature of ESP activities and extent of enrollee participation. It analyzes cumulative participation patterns, presents a detailed assessment of program success in reaching its targeted caseload, describes activities in which enrollees participated, considers participation of important subgroups within the target population, and examines participation patterns over time. Chapter 4 describes short- and longer-term  impacts. It shows modest gains in employment for the experimental group in the short run and employment impacts for the full sample almost entirely from stronger gains for applicants, not recipients. Applicants in particular show longer-term program effects that continue the story of the full sample's short-term gains. Chapter 5 analyzes ESP costs and benefits. It indicates that ESP enrollees, and applicants in particular, had increased earnings that exceeded their increased tax payments as well as their losses in welfare and in payments from other transfer programs. Benefits to the government budget are also shown. Supplementary tables are appended. (YLB)",

Overall findings indicate that the state has succeeded in its principal objective: providing a substantial number of welfare recipients with productive, long-term work experience. Part One of the report contains two chapters: an introduction and Chapter 2, discussing the nature of the CWEP jobs for both the AFDCs (family heads) and AFDC-Us (Unemployed Parent category) as well as participants' and their supervisors' views of the value of work and participants' attitudes about the work-for-benefits requirement. The balance of  the report is divided into two more parts. Part Two presents the findings of the CWEP study for women, and Part Three contains the evaluation of CWEP for men. The first chapter of each part (Chapters 3 and 7) describes the research design, sample, and data sources; the second (Chapters 4 and 8) considers the different participation patterns; and the third (Chapters 5 and 9) analyzes impacts. The fourth chapter (Chapters 6 and 10) discusses the benefits of the program relative to its costs for each group. Supplementary tables are appended. (YLB)",

        "description":"The undergraduate course in agricultural ethics has been under development at Texas A&M University for four years. The course that has evolved is the result of discussion between the philosophy and agriculture departments. The course attempts to incorporate basic economic principles that affect agriculture as well as to tie these principles to various philosophical approaches. Basic writing and thinking skills also must be taught to some of the students. Four groups of students usually take the course: agricultural economics majors, agronomy majors, other agriculture majors, and liberal arts students. The course is an elective and students are usually registered voluntarily. The course starts with a reading of John Steinbeck's \"The Grapes of Wrath\" as a lead-in to discussion of  structural changes in agriculture from the family farm to large commercial farming and of the use and misuses of land. Other readings in both economics and philosophy are required. Classes are conducted by the Socratic discussion method, and the teacher attempts to respect all students' points of view, while challenging superficial answers. Students are required to keep journals, answer short essay questions, and write a paper analyzing an additional reading. Although the course does not reach the original goals of high-level philosophical discussion, it does provide an introductory philosophical discussion and served a neglected area in the agriculture curriculum.

        "description":"Although the practice of agriculture is a universal component of all human societies, the purposes and goals that a society hopes to achieve through agriculture have varied. If the crisis facing agriculture today is to be resolved, a clear sense of agriculture's purpose and goals within American society must be achieved. It must be recognized that the goals for agriculture that have been taken for granted may not always be mutually compatible or mutually shared by all Americans. Although agriculture today is discussed in terms of production and efficiency, in Thomas Jefferson's day agriculture was regarded differently. The farmer's duty--the goal of agriculture in Jefferson's view--was to embody the twin virtues of self-reliance and community. Today, however, agriculture does not  promote such goals. How can agriculture be changed to incorporate a sense of responsibility for long-term survival into the choices that people make as consumers, producers, and citizens? The first step is to abandon the modern conceit that agriculture has no moral purpose beyond the economic goals of productivity and efficiency. It must be understood that society cannot serve material goals unless it also serves the goals of community and moral responsibility that make society possible. An understanding of agriculture can be a crucial component in the moral and spiritual regeneration of individuals and society. (KC)",

A needs assessment (mail survey and structured personal interview) was conducted throughout Manitoba to identify and document the scope of human service workers' on-the-job problems in providing services to older adults from the four principal ethnic groups in Manitoba: Ukrainian, French, German, and Native Canadian. The study findings were categorized into three areas or blocks: basic knowledge of the aging process, cultural gerontology (problem solving/helping skills), and work environment. Four cultural task committees were involved in generating the project's instructional modules. The following materials  resulted from the project: 21 print, 12 interactive video, and 9 computer-assisted instruction learning modules; a user's guide; a handbook of selected case studies; the project final report; and the ESWTP authoring system. The three instructional blocks focus on (1) the personal development of the human services worker from the standpoint of beliefs and feelings about death and dying; (2) development of an understanding of older adults' personal beliefs, attitudes, and perspectives as a prerequisite for developing worker empathy for older adults; and (3) development of skills to deal with issues and seek solutions to problems in a manner consistent with different cultural backgrounds.

It identified barriers that prevent employers from hiring disabled people and steps public and private sectors could take to increase their employment. Employers gave their disabled employees high marks as hard working, reliable, and productive employees. The cost of employing disabled people was not a significant barrier. Most employers appeared willing to consider the employment of more disabled people if they are qualified. Survey evidence indicated that employment of disabled people is unlikely to increase significantly without new stimulation. Most employers believed that their company was doing enough to employ disabled people, that a shortage of  qualified disabled job applicants was a major barrier, and that the hiring of the disabled had a lower priority than the hiring of minority groups and the elderly. They said that a majority of employees who became disabled returned to work. Employers were supportive of rehabilitation of employees who became disabled and felt their companies were doing enough to rehabilitate them. Most managers supported proposed initiatives and policy changes to increase employment of disabled people and the concept that civil rights laws should apply. (The questionnaire is appended.) (YLB)",

Results showed that girls and community service project participants gained more positive attitudes than did boys or child care volunteers. Ninety percent of the participants indicated the likelihood of continued volunteer work; nearly all volunteers reported gains in skills and knowledge. Adults involved in the program saw adolescents  becoming more confident of their abilities, learning to make decisions and work with children, and gaining in other ways that varied according to participants' individual needs and experiences.

Information, ideas, and resources can be pooled, and duplication and harmful competition can be avoided. Four factors that are important for successful relationships are reciprocity in giving and receiving resources, system openness, trust and commitment, and flexible structure. Administrators who can identify bargaining power in their resources and who can recognize needed resources contributed by outsiders, who are willing to serve on outside committees, who have skills in human relations, and who are attentive to the details of planning and organization contribute to  collaborative relationships. Several authors have suggested the following strategies for developing productive collaborative relationships: (1) identify and clearly state specific purposes for desiring a collaborative relationship; (2) develop objective criteria for selecting partners; (3) locate possible partners; (4) negotiate specific written agreements; (5) consider all ideas so that final decisions will be fully supported; (6) determine communication mechanisms and use them frequently; (7) establish monitoring and evaluation procedures to correct problems; and (8) familiarize the staff of the participating organizations with the agreements. Some of the common types of collaborative arrangements in adult education are with business and industry, professional groups, and community  economic development programs. (KC)",

        "author":["Naylor, Michele"],
        "description":"Vocational education has suffered enrollment problems simply because there are fewer students today than a few years ago. Other factors that have hurt vocational enrollments include recent efforts to increase the number of academic credits required for graduation, and in the case of area vocational-technical schools, negative attitudes toward vocational education on the part of sending school personnel. As a result, vocational educators must either reassess their existing marketing and recruitment strategies or develop such programs. Educational marketing and recruitment campaigns must not, however, be developed without a strong concern for the ethicality of all strategies used. Perhaps the easiest way to define ethical recruitment is to begin by examining what is unethical. Some  college tactics that either approach or go beyond ethical bounds include gimmickry, deception, payment for enrollees, no-need scholarships, early deadlines, and overadmission. The key to successful recruiting is to strike a balance between vocational education's special service orientation and the need to address the problem of declining enrollments in an effective manner. Based on recruitment strategies found in Pennsylvania and Florida vocational education programs, the following principles of sound marketing are recommended: (1) research the market; (2) be visible; (3) be thorough; (4) be aggressive; (5) meet the competition head on; and (6) practice the fundamentals of good marketing.

        "description":"Parents have a major influence on their children's attitudes toward work and life. Handicapped youth, who have more difficulty than other youth in making the transition from school to work and adult life, have a special need for parental guidance. Parents can play key roles in transition, especially in the areas of career exploration, job search and survival, independent living skills, and collaboration with educators and other service providers. Parents can share some career exploration activities, such as identifying famous people who have achieved success despite their disabilities, learning about work site modification, and taking the adolescent to various businesses and pointing out the different jobs and their duties. In the area of job search and survival, parents can  demonstrate the techniques of finding job leads, assist in the preparation of a resume, practice interviewing, and help develop good work habits. Parents can identify those independent living skills already gained as well as those that need to be developed in the areas of transportation, housing and home management, financial management, decision making, and interpersonal skills. Finally, parents can collaborate with educators in developing the student's Individualized Education Program and monitoring their child's progress in following it. In all of these transition areas, parents are important role models. Their children form opinions about the value of work, different careers, and self-worth from what they observe their parents saying and doing. The example parents present their  children may be their most important role in the transition process. (KC)",

        "description":"Students drop out of school because of a variety of family, economic, and racial factors that can be categorized as either alienation, lack of motivation, or disadvantage. The key to reducing the dropout rate is helping youth to overcome their sense of disconnection. Students with low motivation to attend school have shown improvement in school attendance and retention after participating in career education. However, casual vocational exploration is not enough; major concentration in a vocational program is more helpful in student retention. The vocational experiences that are most closely related to reducing the dropout rate include the following: (1) more systematic and intense efforts to identify and help potential dropouts before or at entry into vocational programs; (2)  program activities to enhance school climate and reduce absenteeism, class-cutting, and drug and alcohol abuse; (3) activities to enhance parents' support; (4) more career exploration prior to high school; (5) improvement of transitions through a vocational program to direct dropout-prone students to job-specific skill training courses; (6) linking work-study experiences with students' programs and objectives; (7) alignment of work-study programs to students' overall school plans and goals; and (8) activities to increase dropout-prone students' participation in vocational programs and to enhance linkages between these programs and other school experiences.

        "description":"Although the benefits of articulation between secondary and postsecondary vocational programs are clear, progress in articulation between proprietary schools and secondary and/or postsecondary programs has been slow. The fundamental barrier to articulation between proprietary schools and postsecondary vocational education programs is faculty reluctance to be associated with a school that aims to make a profit. Besides faculty reluctance, the following present major barriers to articulation: communication breakdown, lack of enthusiasm, inability to sell the concept at the top level, leadership, staff elitism, and reluctance to change curriculum. Strategies for overcoming these barriers include arranging regularly scheduled meetings in the various schools, publishing a newsletter  on the articulation effort, establishing an inservice meeting to disseminate information about the articulation effort, focusing on &quot;students first,&quot; bringing in consultants, involving top personnel in planning, having representatives from both institutions on committees, and redesigning curricula at both schools. Three types of articulation are (1) private occupational schools that accept secondary vocational program graduates into their educational offerings, (2) cooperation between two or more proprietary schools, and (3) arrangements whereby graduates of proprietary schools are accepted into and continue their education at a community college or four-year school. This last type, transfer of credit, is the most common and is used in a variety of places. (KC)",

        "description":"Three types of lay theories about the social world form a developmental sequence. Earlier developing theories are reorganized at the next level into a more inclusive, encompassing view of the world in order to make better predictions. The absolute thinker sees the world as fixed and unchanging, reasons with absolute rules, and has a narrow world view. Relativistic reasoning involves the awareness that everything is relative, a point of view; knowledge is subjective; and contradiction is inherent in reality. The problem with this world view lies in the inability to make decisions and have relationships. Typically, not before middle age, the individual develops an integrated world view that operates according to dialectical, or systems, principles. Contradiction and change are  basic features, each event brings about its opposite, and reciprocity is a basic assumption. Integrated thinking is believed to characterize highly mature thought that is very adaptive because it attempts to go beyond the self, take other perspectives into consideration, and find cooperative solutions. An implication for the education of adults, especially middle-aged and older adults, is that retraining adults in the social sciences or developing think tanks with older adults would be worthwhile in dealing with complex social issues.

They were compared on demographic and personal-social variables during high school and educational and occupational attainment 13 years after high school with students who had the same mental ability but appropriate grades and with students who had the same grades but appropriate mental ability. During high school, underachievers as a group were essentially identical to students who got the same grades, not to those who had the same mental ability, with respect to a variety of demographic and personal-social factors. Similarly, in the 13 years following  high school, underachievers pursued further schooling and took jobs consistent with their grades, not with their abilities. In fact, underachievers had a substantially lower likelihood of completing four years of college and a greater likelihood of divorce than did non-underachieving students matched either for grades or ability. Some underachievers ultimately did catch up to their abilities--those who, as high school students, had high educational and occupational expectancies, who had high self-esteem and perceived competence, who participated in activities (especially females), and whose parents were well educated. But not all such underachievers caught up. For example, serious underachievers of medium and high mental ability did not catch up. They attained very little relative to  other groups. Students from less educated families were less likely to achieve levels commensurate with their ability than students from better educated families. (Author/KC)",

The field of organizational psychology can learn about decision making in large democratic organizations from innovative peace  groups such as &quot;Beyond War,&quot; which makes decisions in large groups spread out over the country which simultaneously communicate via video. Organizational psychology can learn about motivation through common vision from peace groups where many workers are extremely motivated by the organization's mission, even in the absence of pay. Also, studies of organizations (such as peace groups) that are anomalous in terms of existing theory have led to innovative and broader theories of organizational effectiveness.

KIDCOPE, a brief coping checklist comprised of 10 items, was developed which covered problem-solving, distraction, social support, social withdrawal, cognitive restructuring, self-criticism, blaming others, emotional expression, wishful thinking, and resignation. Four samples of &quot;normal&quot; adolescents (total N=364) and one clinical sample of adolescent suicide  attempters (N=25) participated in reliability and validity studies. The results revealed that the highest correlations were obtained when subjects rated the same personal stressors 3 days apart, lower correlations were obtained when ratings were 1 week apart, and lowest correlations were obtained over 10 weeks with different stressors. These findings suggest that coping is a process measure with only minimal consistency within individuals over time.

The subjects' affective and attributional reactions were assessed by their responses to a series of 11-point scales. The results indicated that the positive affective outcome resulted in more responsibility being attributed to the victim  while a negative physical outcome resulted in more control being attributed to the harasser. A negative physical outcome resulted in the most unpleasant affective reactions experienced by subjects and the greatest willingness to report such incidents to others. (Author/NB)",

Women's studies have sought a particular ethic, valuing the moral equality of those who seek education and of those who offer it. Women's studies have sought to alter institutions so that they embody such an ethic and to change the consciousness of both individuals and institutions. It is necessary for those involved in women's studies to maintain the power they have gained and, at the same time, to retain the perspectives of the outsider. Women's studies outside the United States can offer new approaches to child care, to women's collective action, and to doing research about women. There are several questions that women's studies must now confront. These include determining what women's  studies are looking at and doing, and examining the causes, nature, and extent of sex differences. Two major attitudes toward sex differences exist. The first is the minimalist attitude which realizes that sex differences exist but goes on to claim that historical forces have largely determined these dissimilarities. The second is the maximalist attitude which proposes that deep, transcultural forces create many sex differences and that the link between biological \"sex\" and social \"gender\" is profound. Both of these positions require further study. Because women's studies still meet opposition, another future task of women's studies is to overcome that opposition. (NB)",

These analyses are presented to illustrate the use of a database to aid state level decision-makers in identifying the prevalence and distribution of students at-risk. In the first section, &quot;Who are the Children At-Risk in Today's Schools?,&quot; risk indicators are categorized as background, performance, or behavior characteristics. The second section, &quot;How Prevalent are the At-Risk Youth in the Northwest?,&quot; displays prevalence on a state-by-state basis and gives regional summaries against which individual states may be compared. Patterns of at-risk students in  school districts of varying size, rurality, and poverty levels within states are illustrated. Two outcomes of risk, dropping out of school and unemployment, are discussed and family background, school achievement, and social behavior are examined as symptoms of risk. The report concludes with a discussion of the stages of database development, other potential uses, and a sampler of policy implications of the information produced from the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory database. References, 13 tables, and 2 figures are included. A detailed summary of the contents of the database is appended (NB)",

        "description":"The declining rate of college-bound high school students and the growing high school dropout rate of minorities both nationally and locally are trends that need to be immediately addressed and reversed. In an effort to reverse the trends, children need academic encouragement in elementary and middle school, and need at an early age to envision going to college after high school as an expectation for themselves. The young students and their parents must be provided higher education information and experiences at transitional points in the students' school life when it is still possible for them to select appropriate and prescribed courses to maximize preparation for high school success, college admission, retention, and graduation. To meet this need, the Baltimore City (Maryland)  Schools' Office of Guidance Services initiated an Early Guidance Model for middle/junior high school students. A committee of middle/junior high school counselors studied the issue and developed the model as a supportive network of experiences and information intended to raise student aspiration levels and improve student potential for a satisfying future. This report lists activities implemented by one school for College Awareness Day along with 17 college awareness strategies school counselors can use to help young students learn about college options.

        "description":"To be a marginal student is to experience a strained, difficult relationship with the school environment. It is crucial to understand marginality and to analyze its extent in today's schools. The more intractable problems of school learning are most effectively addressed at an early stage when the relationship between individual and school environment first becomes problematic. The reality of marginality is that nationwide one in four students drops out of school before graduation and nearly one in two students does not graduate in certain locations and among certain ethnic groups. The achievement of minority students still lags significantly behind that of white students, despite a decade of gains. Up to 40 percent of all junior high students and 60 percent of senior high  students probably have trouble with academic reading materials. As many as two-thirds of the 17-year-olds still in school run the risk of becoming marginal due to inadequate writing skills. About one-third of all pupils achieve below grade level. One in 10 secondary students gets suspended from school. Nearly all high school students experiment with alcohol, more than one-half experiment with marijuana, and about 40 percent try other drugs. Understanding the perspective from the margins is important because it defines the problems of dropouts, low achievement, misbehavior, school avoidance, and drug use in a way that makes clear what changes in school might reduce these problems.

Chapter 1 defines the various forms of smokeless tobacco that are used in the United States and examines data pertaining to trends in prevalence and patterns of use. Methodological considerations are discussed and research needs are identified. Chapter 2 presents results of a systematic review of the world's medical literature describing experimental and human evidence pertinent to the evaluation of smokeless tobacco as a potential cause of cancer. Consensus summaries of the literature are presented in each of five categories: (1) epidemiological studies and case reports of oral cancer in relation to smokeless tobacco use; (2)  epidemiological studies of other cancers in relation to smokeless tobacco; (3) chemical constituents, including carcinogens of smokeless tobacco; (4) metabolism of constituents of smokeless tobacco; and (5) experimental studies involving exposing laboratory animals to smokeless tobacco or its constituents. Chapter 3 addresses the health effects of smokeless tobacco use on the oral tissues through a systematic review of the relevant scientific literature of animal and human studies. Chapter 4 examines the consequences of exposure to nicotine from smokeless tobacco. The report concludes that the oral use of smokeless tobacco represents a significant health risk, can cause cancer and a number of noncancerous oral conditions, and can lead to nicotine addiction and dependence.

In 1969 there were only a dozen adult day care centers in the United States, today there are over 1,400 centers. In 1979, the National Institute on Adult Daycare (NIAD) was established as a National Council on the Aging (NCOA) professional unit to provide a focal point for adult day care at the national level. NIAD conducted a nationwide survey of adult day care centers (N=847) in 1985. Preliminary results showed that 85% of respondents ranked the provision of an alternative to premature or inappropriate institutionalization  as one of the top three objectives of adult day care. Other highly ranked objectives were maximization of functional capacity and provision of respite for caregivers. The majority of centers (74%) reported being private, nonprofit agencies. While many centers reported having at least one license, only 15 states have standards for licensure. Other findings focus on center locations, referral sources, number and characteristics of participants served, exclusions from participation, services provided, costs of adult day care, changes to participants, and level of participant functional impairment.

Several hundred undergraduates at Ohio State University and Marshall University (Ohio) participated in six experiments examining persuasion and the use of unintelligible messages. Subjects in individual cubicles of a university language laboratory were told they would hear talks delivered at a United Nations conference. Subjects listened to a taped message in English and in an unintelligible version. In Experiment VI subjects heard an unintelligible version and a no-message version. An equal number of students heard the tape in reverse order. Subjects responded to standard attitude dependent measures: semantic differentials, attitude scales, and cognitive response  measures. Manipulations of message length, number of repetitions, and source credibility were added as an additional between-subjects factor in some experiments. Major findings revealed were that: (1) most subjects agreed with and listed cognitive responses to unintelligible communications; (2) persuasion processes with unintelligible communications were similar to persuasion processes using intelligible messages; (3) an unintelligible communication evinced more cognitive responses and more favorable ratings than a nonmessage control; (4) the unintelligible messages produced increased cognitive elaboration as a function of total number of thoughts generated; and (5) student high in Need for Cognition were more persuaded by unintelligible messages than were students low in Need for  Cognition. These results challenge the message-comprehension assumption. (NB)",

In this study the Offer Self Image Questionnaire (OSIQ) was administered to 84 16- to 18-year-old males and females to test the relationship of ratings and experience of four types of social stressors (Developmental Transitions, Induced Transitions, Daily Hassles, and Circumscribed Events) to self-image. Differences found in the stressfulness ratings of the four stressors were relatively parallel  for both genders, and no significant correlations between ratings and experiences were found. Only the Daily Hassles score correlated with the self-image scales for both genders. Comparisons of subjects with clinical range scores and those with normal range scores on the OSIQ indicated that for both genders, the two groups differed significantly only on the Daily Hassles score. The results suggest that gender differences are less influential than previously reported and that day-to-day stress is most influential in overall adjustment.

This study considered several types of social stressors and compared their effects on levels of antisocial and delinquent behavior. Male and female adolescents (N=84) were surveyed for socioeconomic status, family systemic functioning, and four types of social stress (Induced Transitions, Daily Hassles, Developmental Transitions, and Circumscribed Life Events) in relation to level of antisocial and delinquent behavior to determine the individual and cumulative effect of these psychosocial predictors. Univariate analyses indicated that perceived and desired family cohesion and Daily Hassles, Circumscribed Life Events, and Developmental  Transitions correlated significantly with reported delinquent behavior. Multivariate analyses indicated that socioeconomic status was of little use in understanding such behavior, at least among the general population, and that family cohesion and two types of stress, Developmental Transitions and Daily Hassles were the most useful indicators. These findings suggest that the ability of family members to support one another and to harness that support to solve daily problems is important in decreasing delinquency risk. Also, skill development, such as social skills training, may be indicated in order to improve ability to cope with daily hassles. (KS)",

Because observations of the behavior of individuals at the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial (VVM) suggests that people visit the memorial to complete their unfinished business, the tendency of individuals to seek closure was evaluated at the VVM. Questionnaires designed to evaluate the emotional effects of a visit to the VVM and the healing expected to result from the visit were completed by 39 adult (22 female, 17 male) visitors to the VVM. The results revealed that the strongest emotion experienced was sadness, and  that males reported more fear and guilt than did females. Males also spent more time at the VVM than did females. Most subjects described their visit as a healing experience.

Research has shown violence to be more likely in less stable populations, in persons with poor driving records and histories of severe accidents, and in those who are undereducated and unsuccessful in life. Violent individuals, compared to nonviolent persons, have been found to be more likely to reside in the southern United States and to adhere to a cultural group that advocates physical punishment. These violent individuals often have a history of parental deprivation, post childhood enuresis, cruelty to others as children, hurt self-esteem, and alcohol or sedation abuse. Psychologically abusive parents tend to be depressed, to  project their self-hatred to the child, and to have a role reversal with the child. Some forms of child abuse involve infanticide, rejection, sexual abuse, restriction, oppression, and slavery. Parents who sexually abuse their daughters often feel depreciatory to women and are sexually rigid and punitive. Psychologically the abusive parent has phobic ideation, marked ambivalence, unresolved oral aggression, and sado-masochistic conflicts with a breakthrough of sadistic pre-genital material. The quality of the entire parental relationship is more significant than the actual physical abuse, with abandonment being the most serious abuse to the child. Clearly all forms of child abuse are a family affair. (Author/NB)",

A study was conducted to examine affective, cognitive, and behavioral characteristics of individuals arrested for alcohol-related offenses. Self-report demographic questionnaires and psychological inventories were completed by 32 males who had a history of arrest for DUI or public intoxication and by 32 matched comparison subjects. The results indicated that alcohol-specific variables such as social and escapist reasons for  drinking and severity of problems associated with consumption were superior to measures of emotional distress and sensation seeking in predicting group membership. The two groups were not found to differ significantly on measures of depression, anxiety, or self-esteem. Moreover, self-reported average alcohol intake did not signficantly distinguish between arrest and comparison groups. These findings suggest that alcohol offenders may be distinguished from nonoffenders less by their patterns of alcohol consumption or psychological distress than by maladaptive beliefs about the appropriate use of alcohol. These offenders might benefit from cognitive behavioral therapies. (NB)",

It specifically examined the effects that raising the minimum drinking age has had on traffic accidents, beverage alcohol consumption, driving after drinking, and related concerns for youths younger than the minimum age. A review of 49 documents which evaluated laws raising the legal drinking age revealed that raising the legal drinking age had a direct effect on reducing alcohol-related traffic accidents among youths affected by the laws. Evidence suggests that raising the drinking age results in a decline in both alcohol consumption and driving after drinking for the age group affected  by the law. The evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions about the effects of raising the drinking age on youths 16 to 17 years old, border crossings, and other related matters. Literature reviews of earlier evaluations of the effects of lowering the drinking age, however, do give evidence that traffic-accident outcomes increased as a result of changes in the law.

An analogue experiment of juror behavior was used to examine the effect of amount of damages requested on amount awarded. College student subjects (N=158) read two detailed case summaries of real personal injury cases, with each summary containing one of four amounts requested for damages by the injured person's attorney. The results showed a significant effect of amount requested on amount awarded. The more money  requested for damages by the plaintiff's attorney, the more the subjects awarded. The effect was consistent across cases and across injured persons of different sexes and ethnic groups. (Author/NB)",

In response to this, an effort was made to create an alternative, more supportive, organizational structure featuring participative management in the Louisiana State Youth Opportunities Unlimited (LSYOU) program. Program teachers, tutors, and counselors underwent inservicing in a counseling curriculum (Quest Skills for Living). All class sizes were limited to 13 with a tutor and teacher in each class, students and staff were involved in nonacademic activities, and student input and autonomy were maximized in the program. The program was designed to facilitate the acquiring of coping skills. The Profile of Schools (POS) survey and local questionnaires were administered to  test whether students perceived the program as exhibiting an alternative organizational structure. Students identified as potential dropouts were assigned to treatment and control groups and administered the POS as a pretest and posttest. Results showed that the LSYOU program was perceived as having organizational characteristics of the participative management style and that the program significantly positively impacted certain academic and affective skills. It is hypothesized that this increase in skills will reduce alienation among this at-risk group, thus reducing their chances of dropping out of school. (ABL)",

        "description":"Although the importance of an experiential component in differing approaches to psychotherapy has been acknowledged, confusion over the concepts of \"experience\" and \"emotion\" has resulted in a focus on emotion rather than experience. The fundamental change event in psychotherapy is a kind of experiential learning or reorganization, and while theoretical knowing is abstract and intellectual, experiential knowledge is stored in sensorimotor schemas and includes visual images, auditory images, kinesthetic sensations, and bodily and visceral events. Behavior in everyday life situations is largely a matter of experiential knowledge. Experiential reorganizations can occur at the experiential/perceptual level and when they do, one \"knows how\" to do something. This kind of learning takes  place in therapy. A conceptual understanding alone is not likely to guide behavior; conceptual understanding must make a change at the experiential level. There are various ways to create experiential learning in psychotherapy. It can be hypothesized that cognitive, affective, and behavioral methods all work therapeutically to the extent that they facilitate experiential learning and experiential reorganization. Experiential knowledge may represent a tacit level of knowing, with conscious, verbally articulated cognition being based on and derived from representations already tacitly encoded at the experiential level. This view supports the opinion that therapy operates on \"the unconscious.\" (NB)",

The evidence also suggests that while the expressed attitudes of psychologists are supportive of the freeze, the attending demonstrative behaviors are not present. To facilitate overcoming this behavioral impasse and to emphasize that one psychologist can make a difference, a blueprint to action was developed at the individual, family, local, community, national, and international levels and in the areas of education, research, practice, and organizations. A broad array of options is presented ranging widely in time commitment and level of influence. Options are available at several levels: (1) individual (reflection, prayer, and  voting); (2) family (nonviolence, conversation, and books); (3) local community (civic participation, school interest, and establishment of nuclear free zone); (4) national (letter writing and peace initiatives); (5) international (cultural exchange and letter writing); (6) education (support local peace center, teach conflict resolution, and encourage students to write visions of peace papers); (7) research (role of mutual ignorance, mental health aspects of war, and conflict resolution); (8) practice (deal with clients' fears); and (9) organizations (join groups such as Psychologists for Social Responsibility).

This study was designed to investigate the hypothesis that information processing would be greater for mood-topic congruence than non mood-topic congruence. Undergraduate students (N=216) were induced with either a dysphoric, neutral, or elated mood condition and given either a strong or weak counterattitudinal appeal supporting senior comprehensive examinations. Depending on condition, subjects were informed that the examinatiions would be implemented either within 6 months (high personal relevance) or within 10 years (low personal relevance). A 2 x 2 x 2 Analysis of Variance and the Ryan-Einot-Gabriel-Welsch-Q  individual comparisons method were used for group and cell comparisons. The results showed that dysphoric subjects elicited more favorable attitudes under the strong argument condition than did subjects within the elated condition. Dysphoric subjects therefore engaged in more effortful processing than did elated subjects. Personal relevance appeared to have no significant effect in either affective condition. In the neutral mood condition with high personal relevance, more favorable attitudes toward the message occurred within the strong argument condition than within the weak argument condition. Little significant message scrutiny occurred in the low relevance conditions. Overall results suggest that mood-topic congruence elicits more diligent processing of a counterattitudinal appeal.

To examine this possibility, 120 rescue and hospital personnel responded to a survey of their emotional reactions and coping behaviors 3 months after a devastating tornado. Twenty-eight subjects had been involved in on-the-scene rescue; 92 worked in the hospital emergency department. Workers provided information on demographic characteristics, role during the disaster, initial thoughts and reactions, specific symptoms of adjustment difficulty following the tornado, support networks, and coping strategies after the tornado. Workers reported many of the symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), most frequently reporting repetitive intrusive  thoughts. Workers at the tornado scene reported a mean of 6.59 PTSD symptoms and those at the hospital endorsed a mean of 7.33 symptoms. Most workers perceived neutral to supportive reactions from families, co-workers, and neighbors. Items endorsed on the Coping Inventory revealed reliance on cognitive coping strategies where the event was placed in perspective and cognitive mastery sought. Seeking social support was used more frequently than altering activities or finding new interests. The results clearly suggest a need for support services for hospital and rescue workers involved in disaster relief. (Author/NB)",

Past research suggests that it is not coping with demand that is stressful for Type As, but rather the perception that the job or life event is less than completely controllable that leads to distress. To further explore this issue, Type A behavior, life change, psychological impairment, and symptom reports were measured on two occasions 6 months apart in 183 male public school principals. Subjects, categorized as Type A or Type B by the Jenkins Activity Survey, completed questionnaires that assessed the experience and appraisal of life change and psychological and physical impairment. The results indicated that  events which Type As perceived as moderately controllable, particularly those also perceived as negative, were associated prospectively with psychological distress and physical symptoms. Type Bs reported greater physical and psychological symptomatology if 6 months prior they had reported elevated levels of life change that they appraised as negative and uncontrollable. The results provide a field analog of laboratory demonstrations of the challenge induced stressful response style of the Type A. (Author/NB)",

This study investigated the effect of Cohn's group process on the self-concepts of ninth grade students. Four themes, or teaching units, were chosen for inclusion based on the appropriateness of the theme to the age group and the proven effectiveness of the theme to bring about positive change in self-concept. These themes were study skills, career education, values clarification, and transactional analysis. It was hypothesized that the theme-centered group process would facilitate implementation of the instructional material thereby creating an intervention that would improve self-concept. Ninth grade students were  assigned to either an experimental (N=24) or a control (N=22) group. All subjects were given the Piers-Harris Children's Self Concept Scale at the beginning of the school year, at the end of the group process (mid-year), and at the end of the school year. An analysis of covariance revealed no significant difference in scores between the control and experimental groups. It is recommended that other themes, such as decision making and human relations training, and other student variables, such as grade point averages and attitudes about school, be investigated in order to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of Cohn's process.

High and moderate risk students met with Counseling Center personnel weekly to learn study skills and academic survival techniques.

Subjects, two special education middle school students with low scores on standardized reading comprehension and vocabulary tests, were taught to interpret pictures that were topically related to reading passages. Findings showed that, after ten three-day sequences of pre-picture reading, picture study, and post-picture reading, subjects' reading comprehension improved significantly on several measures. More specifically, results indicated that teaching the students to examine details and interpret relationships inherent in topic-related pictures (1) improved their ability to answer  questions about explicit and implicit information relevant to both pictures and stories, and (2) increased the amount and accessibility of the students' prior knowledge, produced by the systematic study of the pictures. It was speculated that these findings resulted from reader-related variables, such as task focus, schema adequacy and accessibility, and ability to integrate and synthesize information, as well as from picture-related variables, such as imageability and gestalt features.
