Following two introductory sections defining relevant constructs, 17 case studies of innovative programs and procedures are presented to help manpower program planners and administrators think about individualization in new ways. Case study programs include: Individualized Manpower Training System (IMTS), Training and Technology (TAT), Arizona Job Colleges (AJC), Life Skills Education Model, Comprehensive Manpower Office (COMO), Vocational Exploration  Groups (VEG), and Job-Related Education and Vestibule Training. Other case studies deal with procedures of: Job Agent classification, Cleff Job-Man Matching System, self-help work units, systems approach, telephone company training, Training Decision Paradigm, individualized instruction in education, behavioral assessment, behavioral training, and personalized salvage of failing trainess. Implications for policy and action of prime sponsors is explored in relation to manpower service delivery.

Each of the working papers on these topics demonstrates the rapid transformation of traditional forms and the blurring of distinctions for organizing and perceiving reality. Working paper one, \"Feminism and Nursing: How the Ethos Defines A System\" explores traditional female and family roles as well as emerging role structures evolving from economic, political, and social changes. As the \"insideness\" of the family changes, more and more demands are placed on health care services. The second paper, \"Higher Education:  Trends and Tenors\", focuses on the nation's nurse preparatory programs in colleges/junior colleges/universities, which comprise 65 percent of all nursing programs. Trends for diversification include: cooperative education, non-academic experience, competency-based degree programs, sub-baccalaureate programs, universities without walls, diversified graduate degrees, and more interinstitutional planning and action. The concluding paper, \"The Immediate Environment of Nursing: The Changing Health Care System\", examines structure-oriented and process-oriented approaches to health care within a systems theory, and changing roles of health professionals and hospitals.

The introduction discusses the definition and need for continuing education in consumer and homemaking education, and opportunities for program development. The detailed guidelines for program planning cover: determination of needs, determination of program objectives and content, program development and operation, and program evaluation.  Several programs are described which are utilizing new approaches in: postsecondary vocational-technical schools; pre-school parent education, public housing, community or neighborhood, and community learning centers; mobile instructional units; and in private homes. Selected references and sources of information to aid in program development are provided. The appendixes contain: a list of suggested cooperating agencies, organizations, and institutions; sample forms of contractual agreements between school district and housing authority and between school district and sponsor; a funding pattern involving three agencies; and a motorized mobile instructional unit and bid specifications.

Job banks receive job orders, organize, edit, and display; job-matching systems perform similar functions but in addition attempt to screen and match jobs and job applicants. The first section of the document focuses on a comparison of the characteristics, strengths and weaknesses, and current status of the two concepts. Activity and cost data for several job banks and job-matching systems are surveyed, with supporting data, with reference to placement speed, speed of placement by occupational groups, wage distribution of employment service placements, job bank and the unemployment rate, and cost analysis and cost  comparisons. A detailed discussion of critical issues pertaining to computer-assisted placement as a component within the USTES is followed by a survey of the current state of the art, relating to technology, funding, the absence of an adequate descriptor system, psychological reactions to computerization, and problems relating to programing. The document concludes with a discussion of five recommendations. (SA)",

Lesson plans designed to achieve a unit's objectives are presented in brief outlines which sometimes suggest teaching methods and student activities and sometimes offer only a list of concepts or facts to be developed. Some units include a list of resources and supplementary projects; in others, the resources, such as filmstrips, are incorporated into the lesson plans. In some units, no resources are mentioned. Learning  activities range from role playing, guest speakers, and panel discussions to chanting verses, composing slogans, and making visual aids to emphasize positive thinking; lecture, discussion, and paper-and-pencil exercises are most often prescribed, however. Personality traits of friendliness, neatness, and loyalty are stressed. The document includes copious supplementary materials ranging from elementary to moderately sophisticated, such as visual aids and self-tests, and hand-outs which include fact sheets and personal inventories and checklists. Vocabulary and spelling lists and pre- and post-tests are appended. (AJ)",

Emphasis must be placed on: (1) the rationale for career education in the classroom; (2) the use of career implications of subject matter as motivational devices; (3) implications of expanding the parameters of the teaching/learning process; and (4) implications of career education for the philosophy of teaching. To successfully prepare students for future careers, the two major objectives are: (1) to increase relationships between education and work and the ability of individuals to understand and capitalize on these relationships; and (2) to increase the personal meaning and meaningfulness of work in the total lifestyle of each individual. Both of  these objectives call for the integration of the classroom and the community and for the development of educational strategies for reducing student alienation. Career education urges student accomplishment and brings relevance to the classroom experience. The working relationship between the teacher, student and resource persons who supplement the classroom material are of utmost importance. The development of the students' self-concepts and the teacher's interest in students' career aspirations are vital for effective teaching. (Author/JB)",

Chapter 1 provides the rationale and objectives of the study. Chapter 2 discusses labor markets, human capital, and underemployment. Chapter 3 details a comprehensive definition of underemployment--a definition which focuses on the degree of skill utilization in work rather than on unemployment. Chapter 4 seeks to identify and discuss some probable causes of underemployment as defined in  the previous chapter. Chapter 5 examines alternative means of estimating the level and character of underemployment as defined in the study. Chapter 6 provides general, empirically-oriented recommendations, and some additional suggestions which are education policy-oriented, for policy action aimed at reducing the underemployment of human resources. An overview of Project TALENT, a nine-page bibliography, and a description of the Pennsylvania State University's Institute for Research on Human Resources and a list of its publications conclude the document.

The proportion for Army enrollees was much lower than for Navy or Air Force enrollees. Almost half of all advanced cadets were undecided about staying on active duty for more than one tour of duty, with Army enrollees the least likely and Air Force enrollees the most likely to remain. &quot;Military career opportunities&quot; and the chance for &quot;travel, adventure, and new experiences&quot; were the most commonly cited reasons for entering ROTC. Navy cadets also indorsed the &quot;opportunity for further academic education.&quot; A majority of Army and Air Force scholarship holders, and less than half the Navy  scholarship enrollees, indicated they would have entered ROTC without a scholarship. Over 60% in all services indicated they would have entered ROTC without a subsistance allowance, but the 1972 and 1973 surveys showed an increase in the proportion of respondents who would not have joined the program without the allowance. Data are tabulated throughout the text and in an appendix, which also contains survey instruments. (Author/MDW)",

The need for a complete and total description of negative patterns is called for, and it is suggested that the description include a negative conversion rule, a formal description of abstract syntax, and an in depth discussion of inherently negative verbs into two classes on the basis of the behavior of the negative in their complements.

Following a discussion of the pedagogical implications and inadequacies of audiolingual theory, the author analyzes the nature of this teaching methodology, first proposed by John Carroll as the cognitive code-learning theory. The educational theory developed by David P. Ausubel in this domain is suggested to provide the natural psychological foundations for the cognitive code-learning focus for foreign languages.

Secondly, the author proposes that Chinese locative suffixes, by way of their colligation with nouns, similar to a Russian noun with case inflections, should be accepted as another criterion for identifying Chinese nouns. The author also believes that the capability of nouns to function as locatives is a linguistic universal, as well as a linguistic particular for Chinese.  (Author/VM)",

        "description":"This conference sought to bring to the attention of a broad audience of educators the problems facing Spanish-speakers in this country. The speakers, including Congressman Herman Badillo of New York, all agreed that not enough was being done to assist the person of Spanish background in adapting to a new and foreign culture, and presented specific examples of problems which arise in this clash between two cultures. The conference concluded that much more had to be done to aid the Spanish-speaking person, especially in the field of bilingual education. The appendixes, which amount to almost half the report, provide a roster of participants, a list of Puerto Rican Studies Programs in the Delaware Valley, a statewide design for bilingual education, and a selected bibliography.

These interrelated dynamic problems result from the way the educational system is organized and operated. The system's common ways of dealing with such problems often aggravate, not resolve, the conditions. A preliminary industrial dynamics analysis of the educational system suggests that redirected research programs focus on lifelong individual self-teaching, and charges that cover costs may in time eliminate these current educational problems. Such changes may also encourage greater individual development and prevent educational obsolescence. (Author)",

The first evaluation to be made is the annual operating expense of those activities supporting the primary activities of the university. For organizational purposes, support expenses are grouped into functionally related cost centers such as fringe benefits, equipment use charges, building use charges, operation and maintenance, library, departmental administration, instruction administration, research administration, general  and administrative, and student services. If an institution is to survive fiscally, the organized research component must contribute its fair share to those university expenses that are of an indirect nature. And if the institution is to retain a capable research faculty, the faculty must be informed and willing to support that recovery. (Author/HS)",

Thus, they have been pushing for changes on college campuses across the country that include the following: (1) to end nepotism policies because of the differential impact on wives; (2) to establish appropriate grievance procedures; (3) to revise tenure rules to include part-time work; (4) to establish child care centers; (5) to analyze fringe benefits; (6) to establish maternity leave policies that are fair; (7) to establish part-time work that is paid  at a rate commensurate with full-time work, prorated; (8) to have open admissions for women in coeducational institutions; (9) to abolish student rules for one sex; and (10) to encourage women to return to school.

The number of institutions offering, planning to offer, or considering the possibility of offering the D.A. degree has decreased from 87 in 1971 to 60 in 1972. This is probably due to the following factors: the oversupply of doctoral graduates, the uncertainty of the times in graduate education, the restrictions on new doctoral programs imposed by many state boards for higher education, and the financial problems that currently face many institutions of higher  education. It is felt by those who are favorable toward the D.A. degree that such a degree should become the standard degree for college teaching in the U.S. This is so because it is projected that by the late 1970's approximately half of all college students will be enrolled in 2-year colleges, and the research oriented Ph.D. degree is not designed to prepare teachers for such institutions.

This publication is about economical ways to provide better housing for students. It advocates humanizing existing dormitories by changing the standard double rooms into suites of bedrooms sharing a living room. For colleges needing new residences it recommends building suites or apartment-type accommodations since colleges that have used these approaches report warm response from their students. The book also touches on alternatives to  traditional methods for obtaining new residences through management techniques, leasing buildings or forming co-ops.

        "description":"In December 1971 a committee was appointed at the City University of New York (CUNY) to recommend meaningful changes in policy to meet the problem of discrimination and to advance the status of women at CUNY. Public hearings were held in February and April of 1972, and faculty, students and staff were invited to testify regarding prejudicial practices at the various colleges. The testimony pointed to the existence at CUNY of some general attitudes about women and their proper roles in academia and the larger society. Precisely how these attitudes affect the status of women at CUNY was made abundantly clear by witness after witness. Thus, in order to understand why the status of women employed at CUNY is so uniformly low, this condensed report of the public hearings testimony  begins with a consideration of the image of women. It then moves on to consider the status of women at CUNY, specifically with regard to recruitment, promotions, salaries, policy-making, parenthood, grievances and complaints, and the academic curriculum. A third and final section deals with the CUNY affirmative action program and its application and relevance. (HS)",

The women's colleges can and must deliberately set out to provide a different kind of experience from what young women would find elsewhere. Female students should be encouraged, especially at women's colleges, to enter academic fields other than those traditionally reserved for them. In addition, women's colleges should be acutely aware of hiring practices for women in chief administrative positions. If female students never see a female college president, they might never believe that they could achieve such a position. In addition, women's colleges should make special provisions that would enable older women and women with children to continue their  educations. The unique program that a women's college can offer is that of a female environment that deliberately sets out to create a climate that helps women discover and examine their role in society--a campus that is responsive to all women, and brings together on the campus women of varying ages, varying races, and varying backgrounds.

The seminar saw education today as overly preoccupied with the task of transmitting knowledge, with covering fields of knowledge, and with surveys. What the seminar proposed instead as the pressing task was to involve the student in intellectuality, in evaluating experience, and in connecting theory and practice. The seminar sought to foster experiments in literature and writing, history, and the social and behavioral sciences. The experiments proposed  are experiments in the new ways of teaching these subjects, but they are also experiments in the driving power of education: how to get students interested in motivating themselves.

Students retested after 1 semester of remediation showed significant improvement, as compared to a control group who did not take a remedial math course. First semester grades revealed that two-fifths of the remedial students received non-pass grades. Failure rate for students going from Math 56 (remedial trigonometry) to Math 1 (beginning calculus) showed a non-pass rate of 77%. A control group of low ability students going directly into Math 1 had a non-pass rate of 81%. Results of questionnaires administered to students revealed general satisfaction with course, but only half of the students in Math 56  felt they knew material upon completion of the course. Math laboratories received strong support while tutoring was viewed as less helpful. Instructors indicated that most students were motivated but did not progress as rapidly as students in regular classes. Need for improving tutoring and laboratories was mentioned. (Author/HS)",

The prime recommendation of the Task Force is that a quasi-public organization be immediately established to catalyze and focus the private and public environmental education effort in the Commonwealth. Specifically, a public trust organization named  Trust for Environmental Education (TRUST-EE) is recommended. As of publication date of this report, the legal processes of establishing TRUST-EE had already begun.

Many Federal programs have begun to alleviate the problem of the health manpower shortage, especially since 1963 when the Health Professions Educational Assistance (HPEA) Program was enacted in Congress. In 1967, the Bureau of Health Manpower was formed by HEW to coordinate the health manpower training programs that were multiplying and expanding rapidly. In 1970, the Bureau adopted the name of the Bureau of Health Manpower Education and proceeded to carry out its main objective of improving the training  and increasing the supply of health workers. To this end, the Bureau has set up a number of scholarship and loan programs in the areas of dentistry, veterinary medicine, nursing, and medicine. In addition, recruiting programs have been initiated to identify and recruit potential health care workers into the health education system. (HS)",

In 1971 the Coordinating Council for Higher Education in California appointed a Select Committee on the Master Plan for Higher Education to provide a review of the nature and application of the 1960 Master Plan and of the conditions forecast for the 1970's in order to advise the Coordinating Council whether the current Master Plan should be maintained intact, revised, or replaced. It also required a review of the present strengths  and weaknesses of higher education in California. Three subcommittees were appointed by the Select Committee. The first of these considered the benefits and the costs of higher education in California; the second considered the higher education system from the student's viewpoint and compared the available educational opportunities with student needs, aspirations, and interests; and the third explored the probable impact of newer trends, including new methods of instruction, and of more recently emerging demands on the educational system.

Despite constraints on interpretation, it was concluded that in this particular situation students acquired a knowledge of vocabulary, principles and concepts at least as well by mastery learning as by lecture-discussion methods. In addition, even in a class of more than 200, in contrast to lecture procedures, the mastery learning procedures provided for vastly increased one-to-one interaction between the student and instructor. More than 90% of the student respondents to an opinion survey felt that mastery learning should continue to be offered as an option for this course. Mastery learning students liked  the clarity of goals, the chance to work at their own speed in their own time, and the attainment of course credits by means of unit tests with immediate reinforcement. In contrast to lecture students, many mastery learning students expressed self-change in terms of their own learning processes rather than in terms of course content. (Author/HS)",

        "description":"The voluminous research of the last 10 years on college students and on the function of higher education has emphasized the importance of personal and social growth of students in addition to their intellectual and vocational development. The State University of New York at Buffalo, since 1964, has increased efforts to support and initiate policies and programs that contribute constructively to the personal, social and intellectual growth of students and to modify or eliminate those that obstruct it. In order for this effort to be most effective, it is necessary to understand: (1) the personal, social, and intellectual needs, interests, values, and goals of the students; (2) the experiences that contribute to satisfaction and development of those phenomena in constructive ways;  and (3) the most effective means of providing opportunities for those experiences to occur. Thus, the Student Perception Survey (SPS) was devised to elicit student perceptions of the following categories: academic, personal, social, vocational, and administrative. The subjects reported on in this document were students about to enter SUNY-Buffalo as Freshmen in the fall of 1971. The form of the SPS is a series of incomplete sentences that explore the students' perceptions of: (1) their impending college experience; (2) relationships with family and friends; and (3) themselves.

The sample reported that personal, interpersonal, and intellectual outcomes of college were valuable to them. Noticeably less value was accorded to vocational development than to the other outcomes. College experiences that made the  biggest contributions to outcomes that were of value were: courses and other academic activities; meeting people; informal impromptu discussions; and personal reading.

The overlapping areas of concern deal with noncredited learning, the organizational structure or the new institutions and programs, the new technologies that will greatly enhance the possibilities for S/T-P learning, the variation in present S/T-P programs, institutional accreditation, equity, personnel,  and relationships with the lower system. To summarize these problems and possibilities, 6 possible systems are sketched: the Extended Campus System, the Extended Credit System, the Variegated Extended Credit System, the Learner-Centered System, the Diminished Campus, and the Empty Campus.

These companies make available to students, for a fee, term papers and, in some cases, even master's theses. Of the 441 institutions that completed and returned the HEP questionnaire, only 125 (28%) said that commercial theme writing services did in fact advertise to their students. Public and private universities and public 4-year colleges have been hardest hit by the theme writing services, with private 4-year colleges and public and private 2-year institutions being less  vulnerable. In those few cases where penalties for use of the services were imposed, they were more likely to take the form of a failing grade in the course or an administrative reprimand than of suspension or expulsion. Of the 125 institutions, 48 reported that they had taken no action designed to dissuade or discourage from using the services, and in no case were civil proceedings instituted against either the student or the company. The states of New York, California, and Massachusetts have initiated action to close down such firms, and other states are expected to take such action. (HS)",

        "description":"In the process of teacher evaluation, much needs to be taken into account other than a teacher's activities and behaviors inside the classroom. Also to be considered are the teacher's fixed goals for a particular class, his attitude toward his students, his peers' attitudes toward him, and an instructor's professional activities. Who should conduct the evaluation of teachers is something to be taken very seriously. Some possibilities are an independent evaluation agency, interested students, faculty and administrators in a college, or perhaps a committee composed of junior and senior members of a department. Who does it depends on what purpose the evaluation is to serve. Information derived from an initial evaluation should be used as feedback for the instructor in order that he  might understand what others view as his faults. Then, a follow-up evaluation should be conducted to answer the following questions: (1) Did the instructor make an attempt to improve what he or she was doing? (2) Are the instructor's values with regard to things like professional research, writing and community service compatible with the institution's values? (3) Do colleagues perceive the instructor as a valuable member of the faculty? and (4) Have students reported that what they learned from the course, in class and out, helped them in decisions about what to major in, post-graduate study or on the job? The answers to these questions should help to determine whether the faculty member should be promoted or given tenure. (HS)",

In a study of graduate education in the State as a whole, it was found that: (1) the need for Ph.D. graduates from South Dakota colleges and universities is not present, and there is only limited need for its master's graduates; (2) improved quality of graduate education calls for fewer graduate programs and strengthening those remaining; and (3) graduate programs of  quality are expensive and will require large amounts of state funds if they are to be continued and improved.

State and national college proficiency examination programs were inaugurated during the past decade, continuing education programs expanded, and colleges without walls or open universities established. Increased emphasis on the external degree is a logical outgrowth of these developments. In spring 1971, the Chancellor of the Massachusetts Board of Higher Education appointed two study teams to (1) study the feasibility of an external degree  program as a means of providing an alternate form of higher education in Massachusetts; and (2) develop recommendations concerning a possible administrative and organizational structure for the proposed external degree program. This document presents the results of the second study, and the conclusions and recommendations are based on information about the Massachusetts higher education system obtained from reports and memoranda, from analysis of legislation, from personal interviews with leaders of government and higher education, and from information about plans for the implementation of external degree programs elsewhere in the country.

Of the 106 men and 90 women that responded to the questionnaire, a majority of students reported there had been a change in their thinking on the issue of civil rights since their college experience, especially in the areas of increased awareness, increased knowledge, or greater concern regarding this problem. A majority of students indicated that their attitude regarding the way in Vietnam had changed since they entered college, with 75% stating unequivocally that they were against U.S. involvement in Vietnam and that  we should withdraw our troops. The problem of poverty seemed to be more of an enigma to students than the problems of civil rights or Vietnam; there were fewer specific positions taken and fewer solutions proposed than for either of the 2 previous questions. More than twice as many students said that they had changed their thoughts on the issue of selective service, with 74% against the draft as it existed at that time or beginning to question its advisability. A sizeable number of students indicated that their views on the issue of East-West differences had changed during their college years, and most students spoke specifically of Russia and the United States in their responses, rather than in the more vague terms of East and West.

At the same time the demonstrations were taking place, the university was conducting interviews with members of the junior class on their perceptions of the university experience. Although none of the interview questions dealt directly with the demonstrations, many students made comment on them and their reactions to the events surrounding the unrest.

Taken collectively, these articles provide valuable insight into, and vital information about, the problems facing both academicians and public officials as they prepare for the future of postsecondary education across the nation. That future is beset with obstacles, and the hurdling of them is complicated by the emergence of new publics to be served and simultaneous demands for new forms of service. It is hoped that this volume will help in the search for perspective and in the sorting of alternatives aimed at greater diversity and accountability in higher education, both in its traditional and its new forms.

        "description":"The present study is a preliminary effort to delineate areas in which male and female clients in a university counseling center are viewed and/or treated differently. Ratings of 565 female and 645 male clients at the University of Maryland Counseling Center were made by 13 Ph.D. level counselors (9 male and 4 female) on 16 evaluation questions. Five of the 16 items showed significant differences between ratings of male and female clients. The main difference seemed to be that females were more often judged to have social-emotional problems and males were more often seen as having vocational-educational problems. No large differences were apparent between male and female counselors in their client ratings, but clients of both sexes seemed more likely not to show up for their first  interview with a female counselor than for the first interview with a male counselor. The opposite tended to be true, however, of client no-show behavior for other than the first interview. The results of this study are discussed in terms of sexual stereotypes and future directions for research. (Author/HS)",

The methodology used for analyzing the internship program was carried out primarily through the use of 2 questionnaires. One was used for the interns and the other for information-gathering from the agencies in which interns had been placed. Both intern and agency reported feeling that the program is worthwhile. The agency considers the program valuable because: (1) information for decisionmaking can be gathered cheaply; (2) technical staff, not otherwise available to the agency, is provided; and (3) a link between the agency and the academic community is formed. The student intern finds the worth of the program in:  (1) the personal satisfaction of working in agencies that deal with the betterment of a community; (2) the remuneration that the intern receives; (3) the increased knowledge acquired in one particular area of study; and (4) the increased capability of investigating all other study areas. It was felt that improvement and increased numbers of staff are needed in the field and the WICHE offices in order to maximize the success of the program. (Author/HS)",

Chapter 2 is devoted to applications of the Rationale for Organization to existing and proposed organizational structures for advanced education. Chapter 3 presents and analyzes 6 alternative structures for organization. The final chapter presents a recommended alternative for coordination and governance of the advanced education system. The recommended model includes a system coordinating structure  consisting of an educational policies commission having an executive arm in the form of a department of advanced education. Institutional governance is provided through boards of governors for each institution. The model also provides for a judiciary function to be performed by both the policy commission and by an external agency, and for an advisory function to be performed by the professional staff of the department and by an Academic Advisory Committee.

The study is based on enrollment projections as made by present enrollment trends, and utilizes the techniques of Output Budgeting, part of what is known as Planning-Programming-Budgeting Systems (PPBS) in the U.S. Any approach to attributing costs to particular courses is unavoidably complicated. In practice, virtually every resource used by the university contributes to more than one course and nearly all costs are, in one way or another, joint costs. Academic staff teach and pursue research; technical staff service teaching and research laboratories;  classrooms, laboratories and items of equipment are used by students on different courses; materials are purchased on behalf of schools of studies and it is difficult to find the course for which they are ultimately used. Nevertheless, this study tried to discover how each of these components contributes to the expense of producing each student in each discipline.

In the Oakland Project, job-holding students were candidates for the Ph.D. degree in political science and contemplated teaching careers. City jobs provided useful vantage points for student study; at the same time, students rendered modest assistance to the city. The project provided a valuable learning experience that the students are using in their scholarship and teaching. A critical point affecting the utility of the city job experience, both for the  student and the city, appeared to be the provision by the city of trained employees to whom the students could have ready access, and who had time to provide guidance and to help channel and absorb student output.

The methods discussed vary from those that would attempt to change what the teacher does to those that would change primarily what the student does. Which particular way one chooses to improve instruction undoubtedly depends on one's underlying philosophy of education. At one extreme, there are those who believe that the teacher's role is to help pass on a body of knowledge to students. While students are expected to put forth effort, a good deal of the responsibility for what students learn rests generally with the teacher, and improving teaching often means finding ways to improve such things as the organization of the course and the teacher's classroom performance. At the other extreme, there are  those who believe that the responsibility for learning rests with the student, and that the teacher functions as a manager, a facilitator of learning who directs and motivates students when necessary. Improvement in this latter instance means helping the teacher to both develop and implement whatever techniques will cause students to learn more. In sum, the strategies for improving college teaching presented in this report, like the various roles for the teacher, cover a wide spectrum. (Author/HS)",

The college: (1) intends to encourage and reward a professional kind of cooperation among faculty that in turn will produce a spirit that will allow strengths and special talents to be shared, and weaknesses and special handicaps remedied, by mature confrontation and mutual help; (2) is agreed that the single most crucial factor regarding  the ultimate effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the educational programs will be the relative vitality of faculty seminars; (3) expects all faculty members to lead seminars outside their areas of primary expertise; (4) expects all faculty members to alternate between the 2 major instructional modes,-coordinated studies and contracted studies; and (5) will decide on faculty reappointment and nonreappointment after consideration of records of achievement, or the lack of such records.

        "description":"This paper reports on an investigation of the evaluation of teaching and research at Stanford University in the School of Humanities and Sciences. It was found that professional colleagues had far more influence on organizational rewards and penalties than did administrative superiors. Evaluations of research had far more influence than did evaluations of teaching. Since the faculty expended considerable effort on teaching, many wanted a better balance between effort and reward. For teaching, students were influential evaluators, since teaching performances were more visible to them. For research, colleagues in other institutions were influential evaluators, since the visibility of published research made the boundaries of the University permeable. Overall, for both teaching and  research, department colleagues and department heads were the most influential evaluators. Faculty members' satisfaction with the evaluation process was positively associated with the perceived dependence of their discipline on theory. Greater dependence on theory in a discipline was associated with more perceived agreement among evaluators, and more agreement among evaluators was positively related to satisfaction with the evaluation system.

It is a descriptive analysis of the information obtained from responses to a questionnaire that solicited the cooperation of a nationwide sample of scholars in the gathering of data on the status of women's studies in general and within specific disciplines, their opinions on the need for women's studies programs, and the structural forms such programs should take. Most of the respondents set forth arguments in favor of a women's studies program. The major arguments for such a course of action were the neglect of such studies in the past by existing disciplines and the need to fill the resulting gaps in knowledge and correct inaccurate and stereotyped images of women through  teaching and new research in women's studies. Most of the respondents had some experience with women's studies: 43 had organized or in some other way participated in a women's studies program, and 87 had taught courses on women within their disciplines.

This paper argues that planning is the only method by which colleges and universities can reasonably expect to come to terms with the financial, social, and political crises of our times. Pioneering efforts over the past generation to develop the budget as a principal planning tool must be fused with a comprehensive method for overall planning. This paper further describes the characteristics of an adequate plan and the essential steps in carrying it out. Finally it is suggested that the failure of college and university administrators to plan will only mean that someone else will do the planning for them. This could mean reliance on federal support, a dependency that could well have consequences  that no one in higher education would welcome. (Author)",

A recent report indicates that there are more than 250,000 students seeking to continue their educations following completion of their junior college curricula, and 4-year colleges do not have the facilities to accommodate these additional students. Upper-level colleges and universities (institutions offering junior and senior year baccalaureate programs as well as programs leading to master's and doctoral degrees) are seen as one solution. This paper presents a brief history and reviews the advantages associated with upper-level colleges, describes how several of the institutions are capitalizing on the opportunities  available for innovation, discusses how they are coping with the problems they are confronting, and offers some recommendations concerning the creation of upper-level colleges.

The third model is based on a nationwide network of relatively independent neighborhood learning centers, and the fourth model is an elaboration of existing efforts to provide postgraduate professional education by television lessons. Each model is broken into four component systems: a learner access system, a distribution system, a production-procurement-storage  system, and a credentialling system.

Student women at UCLA are discouraged from majoring in academic areas and from entering graduate school because of the outdated but popular myth that education is wasted on women. Women on the nonacademic staff at the university are also affected by prejudice in various forms. The skills women are urged to acquire, such as typing and shorthand, are remunerated at a rate far lower than that paid for the skills in which men are trained. Indeed, even unskilled men are generally paid more than secretaries. Furthermore, the dearth of on-the-job training programs at UCLA severely limits mobility, trapping many competent women in positions  that society has programmed them to seek and accept but which are unworthy of their abilities. Women who persist and earn graduate degrees are rarely accepted into teaching positions at UCLA and most often content themselves with positions in less prestigious universities and colleges. (HS)",

Most decisionmakers, particularly those at the state and federal levels, have difficulty in relating the financial information provided them to the issues and problem areas they must address. Therefore, the purpose of the Higher Education Finance Manual (HEFM) is to develop formats and procedures for organizing and displaying financial data, maintained in fund accounting terms, to serve the common planning and management needs at the institutional, state, and federal levels. This overview paper is intended to outline the reasons for and methodology employed in the HEFM project and to present that information that is  felt to address the common information needs of planning and management at all levels.

The next section provides a listing by institution of scheduled minimum and maximum salaries and numbers of increments for those institutions not withholding permission for the publishing of these data. The last section provides examples of  some schedules containing provisions for recognizing several components of faculty merit. The unit of information in this report is the institution, rather than the individual faculty member. Thus, when information is interpreted to apply to faculty personnel, it should be weighted toward conditions in the large institutions. (Author/CK)",

Historically, the lower division English courses in universities and senior colleges have been patterned so as to form a required two-academic-year, general-education sequence. Numerous reasons can be cited for the recent, current, and probable future flux and uncertainty about the direction of community college English. University and senior college English faculties have  been caught up in the general redefinition of the purposes of higher education and in the changes being effected in collegiate curricular patterns during the past few years. Another reason for the flux is the academic recognition and respectability being accorded the various media systems and symbol systems used by contemporary Americans. Essential mosaic patterns for the English programs could consist of the following elements: (1) The program could be titled something like \"American Symbolic Culture\"; (2) A mosaic pattern should include a selection of course modules which would support the varied backgrounds of students; (3) The program should allow a maximum of elective choice for the student; (4) The program should provide a means for a student's writing proficiency to be certified;  and (5) The program should provide flexible timing arrangements.

The Library Education Division of the ALA established the distribution of courses to be taken by technical assistant students in three areas: (1) general education courses; (2) library technical specialty courses; and (3) courses related library  technical skills. Louis Shores in &quot;Library Technician: A Professional Opportunity&quot; allocates 64 semester hours as follows: 40 hours general education, 12 hours library education (Library Use, Library Organization, Technical Processes, Public Service Operations, Graphics, and Business Methods), and 12 hours for electives. A check of some 40 California public junior colleges' catalogs showed that the most common courses were library fundamentals, public service, technical processes, and reference work. It is felt that junior colleges should respond to the changing needs for education of prospective and practicing para-professionals. (DB)",

        "description":"To examine the factors that operate in the hiring of faculty by community colleges, an experiment was conducted at the peak of the 1971 job rush by three graduating job seekers who were interested in the developmental student and the community college concept. One job seeker was a BS candidate from a predominantly black college; one was a MA candidate from a well-known university; and one was a Ph.D. candidate from a well-known university. Only the Ph.D. had attended a two-year college; all had experience in working with disadvantaged black children and/or college students. No information as to sex, race, or age was offered, and no personal contacts were made. The candidate for the BS degree, who may have been taken as black, received the greatest amount of encouragement and was  the only applicant offered the possibility of an interview. The MA applicant received more encouragement than did the Ph.D. As a result of this study, it is concluded that blacks are being sought by community college administrators, perhaps for administrative positions rather than teaching. Thus it appears that the decision to encourage or discourage applicants was made on the basis of expressed characteristic (educational background) and implied characteristic (race). Three tables provide analyses of replies received by the applicants. (DB)",

        "description":"A study was undertaken in the 1972 Fall semester to evaluate the learning center at Santa Ana College. Questionnaires were administered, on an individual basis with the exception of the faculty, to students, learning assistants, instructors, and counselors regarding their involvement with and opinions about the center. A total of 112 students, 12 learning assistants, 13 counselors, and 43 faculty participated in the study. Results showed that all groups had positive feelings about the learning center, but feel that its services should be increased, including tutoring in more subjects, and that it should be open during evening hours. Recommendations made, based on the study, are: (1) Place the administration of the learning center under instructional services, with a budget for  staff, supplies, and equipment; (2) Appoint a full-time director for the learning center; (3) Provide full-time clerical assistance for the center; (4) Increase efforts to inform students of the learning center and to encourage their use of it; (5) Increase efforts to inform instructors of the learning center and encourage them to participate in its activities; (6) Increase the number of disciplines in which tutoring is available; (7) Increase the group review sessions; (8) Schedule evening hours for the learning center; (9) Expand the services of the center to provide a place where students can use supplementary instructional materials in independent study; (10) Provide adequate space that is conducive to learning; and (11) Continue to perform follow-up studies.

The report is intended to be useful to other developing colleges. The faculty development project, mostly funded under the Title III Higher Education Act of 1965, consisted of summer and extended study leaves, faculty travel to professional meetings, interinstitutional visits by faculty members of the two institutions, and consultation by visiting scholars and specialists. The report concentrates on the 1969-70 program. In an effort to organize the report around concerns common to developing colleges in general, visiting scholars' recommendations are grouped under the topics of purpose, faculty development,  student-faculty relations, and instructional methods. Recommendations included an emphasis on education rather than training and more active participation by the learner, which requires a new and more active role for the professor. Appendix A provides a list of institutional coordinators, visiting scholars, and faculty participants. Appendix B is an annotated bibliography about teaching in the junior college. (KM)",

A community renewal college would serve as a change agent for the betterment of life conditions at the local level. Such a college would unite and improve the community by bringing its residents together and teaching them the attitudes, skills, and knowledge they need to better themselves and society. Community colleges have tried to mitigate the elitism of 4-year colleges, but even they have emphasized degree-oriented curricula. In a community renewal college, students would learn to want to learn, not to get a degree but to gain the necessary tools for a productive life. Three types of learning locales in addition to the central campus would be provided: (1) learning sites all over  the community; (2) adjunct centers; and (3) extension centers. Individual learning rates and styles could be accommodated in evaluation and in flexible entry and exit periods for courses. To make this concept effective, all of the college must become more involved in all of the community and vice versa. Community services programs help to accomplish this goal. College administrators must learn to see community problems as shared problems of the campus and must reorder many priorities and rethink many assumptions. At present, however, implementation of the community renewal college concept is hampered by the rules of State education and accreditation agencies. (KM)",

        "description":"In the past, people who taught in community colleges had been prepared in one of three ways: (1) a degree and experience in the secondary school; (2) master's degrees in typical academic programs; and (3) for vocational-technical programs, experience in a certain occupation and a little training in pedagogy. Forms of teacher preparation today are roughly the same. Few community college teacher preparation programs offer an adequate core of planned experiences, and too little attention is paid to the literature in post-secondary education. Internships, particularly paid ones, in junior/community college teaching, valuable training experiences, have suffered from the cutbacks prevalent today. But inservice programs and other teacher developmental programs are increasing.  Credentialing is usually left to either universities or State boards of education and is often haphazard. The master's remains the most common degree for community college teaching personnel. The Doctor of Arts in Teaching has recently been introduced as an alternative to the ordinary doctorate. No radical change in teacher preparation or credentialing is anticipated. But it is hoped that greater selectivity and consideration of personality factors will mark future teacher preparation programs. Teacher preparation courses will probably improve, due to more literature on the subject and better dissemination of same. Inservice programs will last only if participants find them effective. It is hoped teacher selection and preparation may someday emphasize development of the whole person as  the best way to prepare good teachers. (KM)",

Known as Phase II, the year's activities consisted of developing procedures and instruments, evaluating microform equipment, preparing and packaging microform materials, and testing the effects of selected variables that are potentially critical to student acceptance and learning. Phase I (see ED 040 708) sought to (1) identify common courses and programs in community colleges nationally, (2) develop a bibliography for each area, and (3) provide a plan for conducting  the study, itself. In Phase II, the examined variables were (1) mode, (2) access, (3) content, (4) format, and (5) image polarity. Experimental students evidenced little resistance to microforms--either roll film or microfiche. It was found that microfiche acceptance is not differentially affected by the above five factors. Data confirmed that students who used learning resource materials in microform learned as well as students who utilized traditional hardcopy materials. (Author/CK)",

Perceptions of administrators in public two-year colleges as to the major reasons for attrition of this group are examined. A pre-coded questionnaire was developed to gather information concerning programs of compensatory education in two-year colleges. It was sent to the chief administrative officer of all two-year institutions participating in an annual research program. One item of the survey instrument listed ten reasons commonly cited in the literature for the attrition of academically disadvantaged minority group students. The chief administrative officer listed the three most important. These were inadequate finances, inadequate emotional stability, and inadequate motivation. A large  percentage of respondents indicated that there was a lack of institutional support of such students and inadequate institutional finance for such programs in their institutions. It is concluded that if public two-year colleges are to adequately perform their role in providing educational opportunity for those who thus far have had little chance for higher education, greater effort in terms of energy, financial resources, and support and training of an adequate administrative and teaching staff is essential.

The College and University Environment Scale was selected for the study, because it seemed to come closest to measuring the dimensions of college &quot;climate&quot; believed to be potentially vulnerable to the new admissions policy, i.e., Scholarship and Campus Morale. College environment is the general style of campus life and institutional context which, hypothetically, colors on-campus experiences. A sample of 300 students was taken for the pre-open admissions evaluation. The College and University Environment Scales (C.U.E.S.) were the instruments used. The 100-item C.U.E.S. questionnaire yields scores on five scales of 20  items each. These scales are Practicality, Community, Awareness, Propriety and Scholarship. Results are reported in terms of difference between faculty and students on individual items as well as scales, and changes between pre- and post open-admissions student and faculty responses. Student-faculty differences center on faculty checking on work completion and quality of teaching and faculty-student relationships. Pre- and post-open admissions changes center on quality of teaching and student-faculty relationships, campus morale, and awareness for student and faculty. Further study is needed before adequate conclusions can be drawn from the findings. (CK)",

Libraries have responded to this need by the formation of networks which are nothing more nor less than a formalized tool for interlibrary cooperation. This study of five regional reference networks in the State of Ohio has emerged as an outcome of the cooperation of state and local library personnel. The purpose was to analyze five of the Regional Reference and Information Networks in Ohio from a comparative viewpoint. The networks selected are: Appalachia Improved Reference Services (AIRS), Cleveland Area Interlibrary Network (CAIN), Miami Valley Library Organization (MILO)  Information Exchange Project, Southwestern Ohio Rural Libraries (SWORL), and Western Erie Library Development (WELD). The study sought to compare the finance, organization and scope of the networks and to evaluate the networks using three key criteria: service to the patron, time taken to provide the service, and cost of that service.

After submission of the report a research staff refined the data and analysis, and placed the figures for all universities on a comparable basis. The analysis is presented in two major sections: the first deals with the projected facilities requirements, and the associated capital commitment; and the second deals with the implications of this planning on future operating budgets. The prime objective of this report is to estimate the total capital dollar commitment that the Government of Ontario will be required to undertake to provide minimum library facilities for the 1976  projected enrollment levels determined from a range of current planning factors. The conclusions and data of the report are not intended for use in the allocation of resources at either the system or university level, but only as guidelines to the financial implications of future decision-making.

        "description":"During 1970 it became increasingly clear that with limited funds from the National Library of Medicine (NLM), some mechanism would have to be found to control the ever-increasing interlibrary loan (ILL) workload of the Kentucky-Ohio-Michigan Regional Medical Library (KOMRML). It was obvious that NLM could not completely support the document delivery or ILL program and that the KOMRML participating libraries were unable to do so. Some of the cost would have to be borne by the institutions using the system; large borrowers in particular. At the same time, it was necessary to insure access to documents for the medium and small user institutions. To arrange an equitable distribution of funded ILL requests for each institution it was decided to use an augmented quota as a control. The  data contained in this study covers the original attempt to learn whether lending took place, by whom and to what extent, plus three six-month periods of data regarding which institutions among the original group lent how much to which other institutions. (Other documents regarding KOMRML are available as ED 035 422 through 035 424, ED 044 147 through 044 151, ED 048 889, 055 622, 060858 and 065153.) (Author/SJ)",

Federally funded under the Higher Education Act (Title II B), the project began July, 1971, and continued formal activities through October, 1972. The overall goal of the project was that of providing for more effective programs of public library services directed toward presently unserved community groups. OLN sought to provide educational programs which would increase the ability of librarians to plan and launch successful and effective programs to actively extend library services to more citizens than presently were being served. This outreach educational program also served as a training ground for the development of a cadre of public library leaders --  librarians not only committed to outreach service but also skilled in program planning and in working with groups. Project activities provided multiple opportunities for outreach-committed librarians to \"network\" with each other; that is, to share ideas and resources within each state and across state lines. This document contains an administrative report by the OLN project director and a report of the evaluation team. (Author/SJ)",

We show that only the first of these is capable of transforming a non-smooth program into a smooth one, since strict application of the recursive procedure method requires the use of a so-called \"null procedure\" which is in fact  also a restricted form of the \"go to.\" (Author)",

An algorithm has been developed which considers every sentence in the input text and rejects sentences which are not suitable for inclusion in the abstract. All sentences which are not rejected are included in the set of sentences which are candidates for inclusion in the abstract. The quality of the abstracts can be evaluated by means of a two-step evaluation procedure. The first step determines the conformity of the abstracts to the defined criteria for an acceptable abstract. The second step provides an objective evaluation criterion for abstract quality based on a comparison of the abstract with its parent document. Based on the results  of this evaluation, several techniques have been developed to improve the quality of the abstracts. These procedures modify the form, arrangement, and content of the sentences selected for the abstract. The revision, deletion, or creation of sentences is performed according to a number of generalized rules which are based on the structural characteristics of the sentences. This modification produces abstracts in which the flow of ideas is improved and which represent a more nearly coherent whole. (Author/SJ)",

The development and field testing of three alternative delivery forms of the training, a course form, an institute form, and a learning team form are recounted. Field testing indicated the training program to be effective in imparting basic skills, knowledge, and attitudes to function in the EIC role. The course and institute forms of the training were found to be fully operational, self-contained, transportable  training packages. Additional developmental work to bring the learning team form to operational readiness is suggested. (Author)",

One of the tasks of the USOE/Michigan State University Regional Center is the collection and dissemination of the information about instructional and professional materials related to special education. The states served are Indiana, Ohio and Michigan. The major direct information dissemination device to the target population is the Question/Answer Service. A descriptive study of the service details the general nature of information needs of special education-related users. The results are reported by occupational classification, geographic distribution, instructional materials, professional materials, and form of entry to the service. A study of  three months usage of a computer-assisted information system in special education gives this picture of a typical user: Teacher from the Lower Peninsula of Michigan who used a copy of the Question/Answer checklist to submit a question about instructional materials in communication skills for the educable mentally handicapped, specifically in the elementary grades.

This is surprising considering that &quot;information&quot; is now widely appreciated as a valuable commodity - to be developed and exploited like natural resources. Indeed today research scientists, engineering designed R and D managers, etc. all spend a great deal of their time searching for and communicating information. This document is an introduction to the art of gleaning information from what is called &quot;the literature&quot;. To succeed, an engineer must not only be fed with new information on his own specialized subject (which he can do by visiting his library regularly and keeping tabs on the literature) but he must be  able to carry out investigations into fields in which he may have no background knowledge, or previous experience. Therefore, this article is geared mainly to guide investigators when they are using &quot;the literature&quot; and searching for published material in a field which is completely new to them.

The comparisons made of the two sets of rules point out many contrasts and similarities. But even more significant is that, while reading the comparisons, one is constantly reminded of the importance of having good guidelines to follow in describing and recording the materials for a catalog. The catalog is, in reality, &quot;the key to the library's collection,&quot; because it is the only efficient means of access to the materials. Any catalog compiled according to a code that does not permit or provide for appropriate entries under titles, or under names (or forms of names) of persons or corporate bodies under which some catalog user  might reasonably look, is not fulfilling its role as &quot;the key to the library's collection&quot; as adequately as it should. Therefore, it can be said that the code of cataloging rules used in compiling the records which constitute a catalog strongly influences a library's effectiveness in assisting the user to determine the availability of desired materials and their location.

        "description":"In January 1972, the New England Library Information Network (NELINET) conducted a survey of serials lists and the need for further union list coverage in the New England region. The survey was an outgrowth of a meeting of librarians concerned with serials access in the region held at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in December, 1971. On the basis of questions asked at that meeting NELINET developed three separate questionnaire forms (reproduced in Appendix A) which were subsequently sent out to 229 academic libraries, the six state libraries, and three of the larger public libraries in New England. The first form was directed to the serials librarian and contained questions about multiple-copy serials lists, local or union, which included holdings information from his or her  library. The second was directed to the ILL librarian and concerned the use of such lists and the need for additional coverage. The last questionnaire was to be filled out by the editor or coordinator of a union list. This report is a summary of the responses obtained from the survey. (Author)",

The BALLOTS system is being implemented in a series of 11 modules. This paper describes the first module, BALLOTS-MARC, or simply the MARC module, and various aspects of system hardware and software as they pertain to this module. The MARC module supports the production of purchase orders, catalog card sets, spine labels, and several types of file slips and management reports. An on-line MARC file stored on disk is updated from the weekly Library of Congress MARC tapes. Several indexes are maintained in the file in  order to support extensive on-line interactive file searching. One way of describing BALLOTS is to explain how the system looks to the user and how it is used in normal day-to-day library operations. A typical book cycle will be traced in the examples that follow. (Other documents on BALLOTS are available as ED 038 153, 044 049, 049 786, and 060 883.) (Author)",

        "description":"The vast majority of science librarians and chemists in the United States do not have a sufficient command of the Russian language to effectively utilize Russian scientific literature in the original. Nevertheless, it is both desirable and necessary that the scientific community keep aware of developments in the Soviet Union. To meet this need, a considerable amount of material which deals with Soviet science has been made available in English. Not only is a large portion of the Russian scientific literature translated into English, but researchers may also consult many English-language articles, monographs, and reference works which treat Soviet science. The first part of this paper is a bibliographic essay on the more significant sources of English-language information which  either provide answers to many reference questions concerning Soviet science or outline procedures for keeping aware of and obtaining Soviet scientific literature in English. This is a reference guide to materials which will allow the librarian or scientist with no knowledge of the Russian language to maintain a fair degree of awareness of Soviet science without consulting material in Russian.

After an investigation of the hierarchy of library objectives, it is concluded that the one objective which satisfies a set of specified criteria is to maximize the expected future exposure of university community members to documents given current and anticipated future expenditures. A measure of performance utilizing the concept of item-use-days is developed to evaluate the degree of attainment of this objective. Finally, the difficulties encountered in constructing an effectiveness measure to make year-to-year or interlibrary comparisons are explored. The Planning-Programming-Budgeting System is presented as a rational framework for the management of university  libraries. Library activities are classified according to four different dimensions. A typical program structure is enumerated utilizing these dimensions. Benefit-cost analysis is discussed as a means for determining an effective allocation of the library's resources. It is shown that resources are allocated and utilized in the most effective manner when the marginal benefit-to-cost ratios for all elements of all programs are equal. Guidance is also offered for the development of a statistical information system to support the decision-making and planning process. (Author/NH)",

Children at three different grade levels communicated referents within related and unrelated word pairs. The word pairs used were from Cohen and Klein (1968). From their list of 30 related pairs, half were randomly sampled and served as the related pairs. The other half were used to compose unrelated pairs; to form these pairs, each similar nonreferent was replaced by a word dissimilar to the referent. The procedure consisted of asking children to communicate sinle word clues for each referent in the 30 word pairs. Clues with each word pair were then given to adult listeners who tried to identify the intended referent in each pair.  Accuracy scores for each subject were based on the number of correct listener identifications. Twenty children in the 2nd, 4th, and 6th grades served as subjects. Half of the children at each grade level were randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups. The data from both groups indicated high accuracy at all ages on unrelated pairs and significant age improvement from second to sixth grade on related pairs. These results provide support for a comparison explanation of age differences in communication. Two additional studies were performed to evaluate two alternatives to the comparison explanation. Results from the three studies demonstrate younger children's communication difficulty in providing effective discriminative messages when required by the task. (Author/DB)",

Results of the study showed that low need for achievement boys were getting inadequate support and too much control; low need for achievement girls were receiving support but no goals  or standards were being set and there were inadequate controls; high need for achievement boys showed no significant differences in the reported amounts of any types of interaction; and high need for achievement girls reported significantly more positive interaction than negative control, but none of the other comparisons were significant. The important factors in the socialization of need for achievement appear to be expectations and demands for achievement and independence made at an appropriate age, around age 5 in this sample, coupled with positive interaction or support and a moderate amount of control.

        "description":"The present study used a set of bimodal (auditory-visual) conflict designed specifically for the preschool child. The basic component was a match-to-sample sequence designed to reduce the often-found contaminating factors in studies with young children: failure to understand or remember instructions, inability to perform the indicator response, or disinterest or avoidance. The Ss were 99 children, mostly from low-income neighborhoods. All major ethnic groups were represented. Two age groups separated by a 4-mo. interval were selected to facilitate identification of developmental changes. The visual stimuli were photographs of people, animals, and common objects. The task, in all series, was to match basic categories such as &quot;trucks&quot; or &quot;horses&quot;. For the Auditory (A) series (and  Bimodal Conflict, BC), the sample was a tape-recorded sound (cat meowing) or a label (&quot;dog&quot;). Procedures were designed to give the advantage of both primacy and recency to visual matches. First, a shaping procedure was used to teach the match-to-sample set in the visual mode. After five training items, the practice series was presented: four V items, eight A items and then four V trials. Results of the initial BC test showed a marked age difference in modality choice. The majority of the older children (59%) selected V matches, while very few of the younger children (13%) chose to match the V stimuli. It is clear that the primacy and recency of the V trials in the training-practice series did not discourage A responding in younger Ss. It is further suggested that the developmental  difference was a function of the 5-year-old's more malleable task set. Implications are given. (CK)",

The two instruments used were the Metropolitan Readiness Tests (MRT) and the Wizard of Oz Preschool Preliminary Screening Program. The children tested on both measures were members of a self-contained kindergarten class. MRT testing was done in small groups by the teacher and the screening by the author and two trained volunteers. The children were screened individually for motor, visual, auditory and language competencies. Those falling below recommended scores were referred for further evaluation. The computerized comparison of the raw scores on the two instruments showed a correlation coefficient of 0.9075, with a 0.005 level of significance (N=23) using  Pearson's Product Moment. Numerous recent studies have shown the MRT to be a valid predictor of future learning success or failure. Thus, the Preliminary Screening is also a valid test.

        "description":"The challenges facing education today, in particular the educational programs for children aged 3 to 6, are found to be many and varied, with the failures in urban settings pointing up the need for different and responsive learning environments. In the development of alternatives to current conditions in the schools today, the following are investigated: (1) some sources of our American tradition for the education of the young; (2) the most current investigations into the development of the intellect; and (3) what we are learning about how children really learn. The child from three to six years of age is said to need (1) independence, (2) order and sense, (3) to communicate, (4) coordinated movement, (5) to abstract, (6) to calculate, (7) repetition, (8) gregariousness, (9)  concentration, (10) to satisfy curiosity, and (11) the development of a creative imagination. The need for allowing children to acquire the basic learning skills at an earlier age so that they can then engage in the &quot;humanizing&quot; elements of their education is stressed. The basic skills are considered to be the cognitive skills--Perceptual/Motor Development, Language Development, Concept Formation, and Problem Solving. The second major basic learning area is the affective domain, which leads to the development of social responsibility, commitment, and success identity for children. A design for a learning environment for children ages 3 to 6 years is presented. The program initiated by the Hartford (Connecticut) Public School System to meet the educational needs of young learners in that  community is described. (DB)",

The mothers were asked to discuss any problems they have encountered connected with their caretaker functions; remedies, if any, to these problems; and suggestions of topics that should be included in a training program for family day care mothers. Six of the ten day care mothers felt that the most important topic to be covered in a training program would be appropriate activities for various aged children. Also, most felt that it would be important to include in a training  program ways of relating with the natural parents. Most felt that it would be extremely useful for child development professionals to discuss child-related topics in a training program. Finally, most of the mothers felt the need for information on filling out income tax forms.

        "description":"This paper is the first in a series on family day care produced as part of a project to design and test an informal continuing education program with family day care mothers. The initial impetus for discussion of day care problems in Tompkins County, New York, grew out of the concern of professionals from counseling agencies. Investigation and discussions revealed that there was no central agency that could provide information about day care. Finally, a Gathering Place was established to help implement the concept of centralized support services. It served several purposes. It provided a central place for at-cost sales of arts, crafts and snack supplies to cooperative nursery schools, day care centers, play schools and family day care mothers. A major goal of the Day Care Service  is to develop a comprehensive network of good day care services for children of working parents. The service has moved a long way. Twenty-five percent of the children in Tompkins County are in organized day care facilities as opposed to ten percent in the nation. It is being called on to share its ideas and accomplishments with many other areas of the state. The approaches used by the Day Care Service to involve the day care mothers and to develop their self-image were as follows: to involve them in the planning for training programs and workshops at the Gathering Place and to encourage and work with them in developing an autonomous organization that provides an opportunity for day care mothers to share common problems.

A description is given of how a specialist from a certain discipline functions in the many varied programs aimed at prevention. The specialty is nutrition. Each presentation discussed has opportunities for delivery of nutrition services aimed at helping the child and his family develop to their fullest potential. On the Crisis Team, the nutritionist who is also trained in family therapy techniques is able to help parents understand and cope with special feeding problems. In the Hospital Child Life Program a nutritionist can be an asset to the staff trying to work with the child on a special diet. In the training of child development  consultants, the nutritionist has a role as educator and consultant. The Vista Larga Therapeutic School Project has extensive nutrition services built into its program. It is pointed out that while severe nutritional problems exist in this country, the much more common nutritional problems are much less severe. The nutrition evaluation process consists of parent interviews, feeding history, analysis of dietary intake, feeding skill evaluation, and occasionally biochemical analysis for 17 different body nutrients. Preventative plans and recommendations cover such areas as nutrition and dental health, weight control, food and meal patterning in relation to behavioral characteristics, and techniques for developing proper eating habits. A community nutrition workshop aimed at feeding problems  of children is planned. (CK)",

Five of the minimum conditions that must be met in organizing a parent participation program are: (1) the teachers involved must have classroom programs that are attractive to parents and children and flexible and varied enough to allow others to share in the instructional role; (2) provisions must be made for many different kinds of participation by parents and volunteers in ways that fulfill important  needs of both adults and children; (3) provide training and consultation for participants to foster understanding of children's behavior and learning, various knowledge areas, and the ways in which schools and classrooms function; (4) provide leadership and organization to insure that the planning and administrative functions necessary to coordinate the resources are carried out; and (5) obtain administrative support from the local building principal and central office personnel to facilitate operation and integration of the program into the overall school program. Parent participation grew in the three years of the program beyond the Project 88 classrooms, and it is felt that increased involvement will continue. (DB)",

It was predicted that rule and feedback training would again facilitate conservation performance; that exposure to conservation-related problems would facilitate performance on them without impeding mastery of the conservation problem, per se; and that performance would be directly related to age. It was expected that older  children would benefit from mere exposure to the problems, but that younger children would not. The subjects were 80 children (40 kindergarten children with mean age of about 64 months, and 40 first graders with a mean age of 77 months). The criterion for participation was failing to respond acceptably to a pretest of liquid quantity conservation. An equal number of boys and girls were randomly assigned within age groups to four experimental conditions. Pretests and posttests were administered on three liquid quantity measures. All children received 18 training trials following posttests. Analyses of variance were performed on posttest data. Results of the study showed that 70% of the children who received conservation and conservation-related problems with rule and feedback training  mastered the conservation of liquid and quantity task; 60% of kindergarteners and 80% of first graders mastered the problem.

        "description":"The influence on child language of the role of the child, and his conversational partners, was studied at the University of Washington Developmental Psychology Laboratory Preschool. Seven lessons were recorded, three child-led sessions and four adult-led sessions. The group composition varied daily but six children to be studied were included in almost every group. Language samples of three types were obtained: child in group led by adult; child in group led by child; and child as teacher. For three children, samples of all three types were obtained; for three additional children, samples of the first two types were obtained. Several measures were computed for all language samples, including rate and mean length of utterance. Utterances were also classified according to sentence  type: declarative, interrogative, imperative, etc. The pattern of results is consistent: children produce more utterances, longer sentences, and ask proportionately more questions when they are teachers than when they are members of a group being taught by an adult. There is some tendency for the same changes to occur when a child is in a group taught by a child as opposed to being taught by an adult, but the magnitude of the shift is smaller. It is concluded that the results suggest that the \"teaching experience\" is a valuable one for preschool children. Three figures illustrate utterances per minute, mean length of utterance, and percent of questions of the six children. A bibliography is provided. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"In considering the apparent failure of the two major compensatory education programs, Project Head Start and Title I, there are so many uncontrolled variables interacting simultaneously that it is virtually impossible to define the specific etiological factors engendering the results obtained. The Federal programs are difficult to evaluate because their goals are broad, they involve millions of children, and they are administered by Federal agencies far away from individual projects. Other problems are created through such variables as program effects or maturation (our lack of knowledge about preschool learning and disadvantaged learners), interactions of various socializing agencies, and technology. Reliability of measurement devices is especially doubtful at the preschool  level. Our lack of knowledge in the affective domain is even greater. The major weaknesses of the compensatory evaluation are: (1) lack of comparable groups and control groups; (2) no planned variation in programs; (3) lack of random selection and/or assignment of Ss to treatment and control groups; (4) lack of clear-cut criteria for inclusion in the program; (5) lack of clearly specified objectives; and (6) non-comparable data. Future intervention programs should adhere to the tenets of experimental research. Residential centers are recommended to remove disadvantaged children from impoverished environments in infancy.

        "description":"The general problem addressed in this thesis concerns formative evaluation relevant to curriculum development. The research strategy was that of an aptitude-treatment interaction (ATI) study. Aptitude was defined in terms of the individual's ability to learn specific concepts associated with a unit of length measurement. The treatments were designed to differ only in their emphasis on a unit of area measurement. The specific question asked was: In what manner does the ability of children to learn concepts associated with a unit of length affect the extent to which they attain concepts associated with area and a unit of area for each of the two given treatments? In order to determine this ability, 90 second and third graders were subjected to a teach-test procedure. This procedure  consisted of a pretest, a brief instructional treatment and a posttest, all of which tested or taught about a unit of length. The results of the two tests were used to determine the aptitude levels. No significant interactions were found between the aptitudes and treatments on any of the measures. There were significant main effects due to aptitude and to treatment for achievement and retention measures. Other findings relevant to curriculum development reported in this study are: (1) It is feasible to teach these area concepts to second and third graders, and (2) Second and third graders are capable of handling conflicting situations involving units of area.

Subjects were 160 sibling pairs randomly selected from appropriate subpopulations of two-child families: half the younger siblings were kindergartners, half second graders; half the older siblings were two years older, half four years older. The four possible sex combinations were equally represented. For half the pairs, the younger sibling carried out an initial object-sorting task alone. For the remainder, the older sibling helped the younger on sorting, and their behavior was recorded. Measures of the younger siblings'  categorization abilities on a second object-sorting task were taken. Results showed that the assistance of the older sibling had a significant effect on the younger sibling's later categorization for six of the eight object-sorting variables. Children with siblings four years older made larger groups and left fewer ungrouped items than children with siblings two years older. Children with siblings of the same sex used fewer relational categories (according to the Wallach and Kogan criteria) than children with opposite sex siblings. Significant correlations were found between siblings' behaviors and the younger siblings' later categorization. (Author/KM)",

        "description":"This review of early childhood research examines what has been accomplished in the field and what questions now need to be answered. Project Head Start has had the effect of helping developmental psychology to become more comprehensive and less ethnocentric than previously. Developmental psychologists are now studying infants and toddlers and the preschool child's total functioning. Educational researchers are currently reacting to the apparent failure of public preschool programs to improve the later school achievement of disadvantaged children. The trend will probably be toward a wider range of options concerning types of early education. Developmental research in early education, involving studies of how and when particular skills and content can best be learned, is necessary  to create an effective instructional program. Little research has been done on the developmental characteristics of 3- and 4-year-olds, and few instructional programs have recognized the important role fantasy and spontaneous play have in a child's cognitive development. The scope of research in early childhood education needs to be broadened and put in a more comprehensive developmental framework, although approaches are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Involvement with collecting and analyzing data has widened the distance between the researcher and the researched, and researchers should use the current period of limited funding to rethink and reorder priorities. Researchers might investigate the child and his family, the classroom and the teaching, the teacher's role, and  institutional setting, and research and the researcher. (KM)",

The first goal should be to develop a questioning, open attitude and an inquiring mind. The R's are respect for self and respect for others. Educators and our society have failed particularly on the latter point. The three S's are a sense of competence, a sense of responsibility for one's own conduct, and a sense of commitment. Family factors, especially parenting, have a profound influence on acquisition of the QRS. Parental openness, support, respect, and sharing help children attain these goals. Educators should encourage parents and families to believe in their worth. Teachers encourage or discourage the QRS  through the type of classes they conduct, their attitudes toward administrators and other school personnel, the way they treat students, their attitudes toward the ways of representing ethnic groups, and their commitment to pupil-teacher planning and participation in local affairs. Achievement of the QRS can be measured through various inventories and observation records of attitudes and behaviors. (KM)",

The paper reports on recent research showing that the development of the central nervous system in very young children (including the period of gestation) is realized at a sub-optimal level if the child, particularly before age 3, should suffer from nutritional deficiencies, especially animal protein and vitamins. The paper poses these questions: (1) Is malnutrition during the early years of life a decisive limiting factor in the development of education among economically and socially disadvantaged segments of society in developing and industrialized countries alike?  (2) Are 2/3 to 3/4 of the children in developing countries probably not suffering from malnutrition (fully half to an extreme degree) during their first years of life? (3) Are overall food (particularly protein) shortages not far less the cause of present inadequate child feeding in disadvantaged communities than lack of awareness, by those who feed the children, of the consequences and implications of defective child nutrition? Sections on planning a research program and possibilities for immediate corrective action follow discussion of the issue. (Author/KM)",

Although the children, from 4 to 7 years old, were able to discriminate between the intensities of the odors, they were neither attracted nor repelled by them as much as the adults. In other words, the range of hedonic values associated with odors was found to be much smaller for children than for adults. This indicates that one must not depend on \"bad\" odors to keep children away from harmful substances. In particular, the finding that children are more tolerant of unpleasant odors than are adults suggests an even greater need for keeping potentially harmful substances out of the reach of children than would be necessary  if children's preferences could be predicted on the basis of adult judgments.

A survey was administered to all 4,650 Institute employees in April, 1970, and enjoyed a 35% rate of response. The compiled data supports the conclusion that a number of employees could use a day care program for their children. Enrollment in the pilot program and establishment of a waiting list puts the present demand at about 50 employees. In a cost-sharing pilot program, M.I.T. employees enroll their children in the nearby KLH Child Development Center at fees based on individual family incomes instead of the full KLH fee. On the average, the Institute subsidizes two-thirds of each fee. The  program cost for 15 children totals $28,000, of which the Institute contributes $20,000. The success of the program to date and increasing demand for day care services suggest an expansion of the program to a total of 25 subsidized places at the KLH Child Development Center, at an additional annual expense to M.I.T. of $6,000 to $9,000. The Institute should also assist citizen groups in starting new day care programs. Appendix A is a copy of the survey form, and Appendix B is a suggested letter for ineligible respondents.

        "description":"As part of the national Head Start Planned Variation Study, this study used a relatively small sample in an intensive evaluation of program implementation in one field community using the Tucson Early Education Model (TEEM). A modified Solomon four-group research design formed the organization framework. Evaluation of six TEEM classrooms and two locally implemented Comparison classrooms included a child data battery, classroom observation, situational tasks, Director's ratings, and demographic information. The child data battery, which emphasized both the cognitive and socio-affective domains, was given in the fall of 1971 to approximately half the TEEM children and to one of the Comparison classes. Spring testing included all groups. Analysis indicated that Comparison groups  were not optimally matched to TEEM children; Comparison children were slightly older and performed better on pre-test. The difference in levels of inappropriate behavior during teacher absence between TEEM and Comparison classrooms was significant. Analysis of classroom observation indicated that TEEM classrooms had more child-initiated learning sequences combined with lower teacher initiated learning sequences. Due to limited sample size in this study, wide-ranging generalizations are not justified. But the utility of classroom observation techniques for assessing process goals within the open classroom framework was indicated. (Author/KM)",

        "description":"The needs of children have not been major forces in shaping child development research; the pressures of such influences as war, violence and poverty on their lives have received little attention. Changes in the child development sciences have been linked primarily to changes within the discipline. Educational research has been no more relevant to social need than scientific research. Technological effort in the behavioral sciences has not produced much of a foundation for solution of children's educational needs. Solid curriculum elements have come from basic as much as from applied research. Current trends toward anti-scientism and the cut-off of funds for child development research will further limit our ability to meet children's needs. Lack of research and training funds now  will affect children decades in the future. The research most needed is in the area of psychosocial development. Little research has been conducted concerning the social variables affecting cognition. It is suggested that the variables of tasks, influence source, influence procedure, social setting of the classroom, cultural and familial context, non-social environment and individual differences be studied. Studies of how social cognition develops are also needed. It is predicted that the lines of demarcation between studies of cognitive and social development will soon disappear, in itself a step toward better meeting children's needs.

The rationale and specifications for the project were discussed in terms of basic technology, society and work, and career guidance. The major goals were that the curriculum (1) provide students with concepts about the institutions and dynamics of our society; (2) prepare students in skills and knowledge which have been found to be useful in a wide variety of occupations; and (3) enable students to acquire information about the world of work, occupations, and themselves. It was decided that the curriculum should be  individualized, student manageable, and relevant; that it must provide for integration with existing programs; that it should provide articulation with post-high school experiences, include planned work experiences, take into account community resources, and contain motivational elements; and that it must provide a role for the teacher as a consultant and diagnostician. Information included in the appendices cover curriculum development design; objectives in basic technology, in career guidance, and related to society and the world of work; characteristics of rural students and the rural setting, and working guidelines for the project.

The study was conducted at New Mexico State University (NMSU) using 2 sample groups. Sample A consisted of 560 Anglos and 101 Mexican Americans tested by the NMSU Counseling Center during a 2-year period (1968 to 1970), and sample B consisted of 337 Anglos and 51 Mexican Americans admitted to the graduate school at NMSU during a 3-year period (1967-1970). The 3 hypotheses developed for testing were (1) that there is a significant difference between MAT scores of Anglos and Mexican Americans, (2) that there is a significant difference between earned Grade Point Averages (GPA) of Mexican Americans and Anglos in the first semester of  graduate school, and (3) that the correlation of MAT scores and first semester GPAs in graduate school will be significantly different for Mexican Americans and Anglos. The results of the study provided the basis for accepting the first and third hypotheses and for not accepting the second hypothesis. It was strongly indicated that students of Mexican American extraction obtain significantly lower scores on the MAT than do their fellow Anglos, but this fact does not seem to be a detrimental factor which influences performance in class at the graduate level. It was concluded that the MAT does not have much value as a predictive instrument for either group. (PS)",

Initial analysis of data on the various technical and nontechnical factors indicated significant differences between the 2 groups in periodontal, decayed teeth, filled teeth, and frequency of visits to the dentist of both mother and child.

The experimental design used was to (1) identify and randomly select one-half of the 4-year-old Chicano children enrolled in a model city nursery school, (2) conduct 3 interviews with the children during a 4-week period, and (3) analyze the audio-taped interviews and their transcription for linguistic data. The 3 interviews with 14 students consisted of (1) a general conversational interview session with each student  to \"get to know\" each other, (2) a \"picture description\" test in which they were asked questions about the picture, and (3) a general type conversation in which it was attempted to elicit a spontaneous type of conversation. These interviews were conducted to one side of the center of the classroom. The results indicated that certain well-defined linguistic problems exist in the use of English by Chicano children, that, because of ethnocentric tendencies by most language researchers and teachers, Chicano children suffer unnecessarily in the classroom because of their language difficulties, that their language and culture must be honored, and that their education should proceed from \"where they are\" to \"where their abilities will take them.\" (NQ)",

        "description":"The social implications of the changes in agricultural structures in rural America (i.e., the family farm structure in which labor, capital, and management are provided by the family; the corporate-integratee structure in which the capital is obtained through a formal contract with an agribusiness organization and the integratee furnishes the land, labor, and facilities; and the corporate-farmhand structure in which big corporations own the land and hire the labor) are examined. The community involvement of workers in the family farm structure is compared to that of workers in the corporate-integratee and the corporate-farmhand structures. In a county with a large number of contract poultry producers and only one major town, a random sample of 24 family farm units, consisting of  48 workers, and 28 owner-managers and 85 workers, which comprised the sample for the corporate-integratee and the corporate farmhand workers was used to measure dimensions of alienation and community involvement. Findings indicated that (1) the corporate farmhand workers were less involved in community activities than the corporate-integratee or the family farm workers; (2) the world perceptions held by the corporate-farmhand workers were more similar to those held by alienated persons; and (3) little difference existed between corporate-integratee and family farm workers with regard to community involvement.

Most of the pupils come from Spanish-speaking homes with low socioeconomic-educational background; however, a certain proportion of the San Marcos pupils are Anglos. Program objectives include preventing educational retardation in the Mexican American child by teaching him in Spanish while competence in English is being developed to the point where it is sufficient to carry the educational burden, endowing him with literacy in 2 languages, and instilling in him knowledge of and pride in his heritage. Objectives for the Anglo child include broadening his outlook and developing in him an appreciation of multicultural contributions to our society. The  evaluation design includes use of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (Spanish and English version), the Metropolitan Achievement Tests, and the Spanish Serie Interamericana Reading Tests, as well as local tests of behavioral objectives stated in the curriculum guides. The test results are presented in tabular form. Teacher and teacher-aide evaluation measures include pretests and posttests for preservice and inservice training, verbal interaction analyses, and rating forms completed by coordinators, principals, and teachers.

        "description":"A cluster of social psychological variables--academic motivation, self-concept, and significant others influence--as they intervene between other independent variables and the child's status projections, were examined in this study. Data came from an extensive questionnaire survey, conducted in 1969, of 1,412 lower social strata mother-child pairs. Residential-racial subgroupings surveyed were (1) rural Appalachian white students and their mothers from Kentucky, Tennessee, and North Carolina; (2) rural Black students and their mothers from Alabama, Mississippi, and South Carolina; and (3) urban Black students and their mothers from Alabama, Kentucky, and Virginia. It was concluded that occupational and educational status projections appeared to have different paths of influence  and that occupational status projections tended to be relatively independent of criteria determining life chances while educational projections were considerably more influenced by socioeconomic, ability, and self-evaluative factors. Implications of the study were that any attempt to treat occupational and educational status projections together as part of any constellation concept such as ambition can be questioned and that the more definitive antecedents of the child's educational status projection, coupled with greater explained variance and more anticipatory deflection in educational expectations, possibly indicate less idealism in educational projections than in occupational projections.

Variables considered were main breadwinner's occupation, race, family structure, birth order, goal blockage, significant other influence, self-image, and anticipatory occupational goal deflection (AOGD). Data were collected from a 3-wave panel of 134 East Texas rural male youths over a 6-year period. Group-administered questionnaires were given to the subjects in 1966, when the subjects were in the 10th grade; again in 1968; and in 1972, when personal interviews were used on the original respondents, who were by this time 4 years beyond expected high school completion. Major findings included that race was seen to be a statistically significant variable in  the data from all 3 years; that the 1972 model explained 12% of the variance; and that the explanatory power of the model seems to increase over time. It was suggested that AOGD is related to realism in the status attainment process and that further research from that perspective might prove fruitful. (PS)",

Two all-black villages in East Texas were selected for the study area. The original sample numbered 52 females, and only black female interviewers were used. It was concluded that of the 3 orientations toward race relations the only one which showed significant change over the 2-year period of study was the blacks' perception of prejudice directed at them by local whites. The change was progressive, culminating in a markedly lower perception of prejudice by 1972. In contrast, the other racial orientations seemed extremely stable over the longer range. The respondents maintained a lack of  consensus in their desires, but were generally less inclined toward interaction with whites the less formal the context of social interaction. The blacks continued to be generally optimistic in their evaluations of the possibility for racial integration.

Data were collected from 3 nonmetropolitan, multicounty centers, located in 3 distinct geographic regions of Mississippi. The 3 major analytical and data collecting concepts used were actions or programs; associations, organizations, and groups; and actors, community participants or leaders, following the interactional conception of community. The communities were described in terms of demographic characteristics, problems facing the community, and development programs. The 2 dimensions of community participation considered were the scope and extent of participation in development programs. It was determined that the most important agency for coordinating  development programs in all 3 communities was the local Chamber of Commerce and that good communities are made possible by the willingness of people and their leaders to face challenges and create for themselves what they need. It was suggested that factors like leadership structure, strategy of program development, style of action, and relationships between community organizations need to be taken into account in explaining the success of development programs in some communities and failure in others.

Sources used in this case study include Cuban primary and secondary materials and government publications, recent social science research studies by students of the Cuban revolution, and personal observations made by the author during a 3-week visit to Cuba in December 1970. Section 1 of the paper examines the extent and nature of prerevolutionary rural education programs and their functionality in an unevenly developed plantation economy powerfully influenced by the United States. Section 2 describes and evaluates major innovative efforts after 1959 to harness  rural education to national goals for ideological, political, and economic development. Section 3 examines current planning efforts to remedy past failures and draw up a new strategy for rural education that will place it at the very center of efforts to create the new socialist society. It is concluded that Cuba's effort to find a way out of poverty, underdevelopment, and dependency can best be realized through the involvement of all youth in work-study programs that are functionally linked with production.

The school staff planned and implemented a program in cross-cultural studies in order to reduce the friction between the members of the nearby Indian Reserve and the surrounding non-Indian community. The program was designed to expose children and parents to the various Indian cultures in order that the non-Indians would be more understanding and that the Indians would better appreciate their own unique heritage. Some specific objectives of the program were (1) to improve the Indian child's self-concept, (2) to create an appreciation of the various cultures  inherent in the school population, (3) to develop a more accurate and unbiased approach to Canadian history, and (4) to create a vehicle for greater interaction between the school and the community.

Part A of this report dealt with the techniques and results of in-depth interviews of 9 native families in Canada. Each family engaged in a sorting process to determine categories which were of immediate interest and concern to the family. It was found that education, heritage and culture, and family were the most common categories to the families. Part B of this report was an experimental-demonstration project directed at locating areas of weakness in the basic cognitive skills of a group of underachieving native children, evolving a remediation program, applying it, and testing its efficacy. Approximately 40 children from 5 different  Grade 3 and 3-4 classes in the Ermineskin school at Hobbema were selected on the basis of the previous year's school work. Representing the lowest academic group in their grade, the children were divided into 2 groups, one having a maximum treatment and the other a minimum treatment. The significant improvement in auditory and visual memory in the group receiving maximum remediation when compared with the minimum remediation group indicated that learning strategies are not immutable but can be modified by appropriate remedial programs to enhance cognitive competence.

The pilot version of this instrument, the Primary Self-Concept Scale (PSCS), was designed to measure 5 aspects of self-concept which were felt to be relevant to school success: behavior, intellectual, physical appearance, peer relationships, and emotional state. After factor analysis, however, the factors identified were (1) aggressiveness/cooperation, (2) intellectual self, (3) peer ostracism/acceptance, (4) helpfulness, (5) physiological self, and (6) adult acceptance/rejection. The 2 additional factors measured in this study were emotional self and success/nonsuccess. Both the preliminary and the revised PSCS were administered to  650 primary school pupils in New Mexico. Emanating from the PSCS was the third revision, the Primary Self-Concept Inventory (PSCS). Studies concerning the further development and refinement of the PSCI should include subjects from a variety of age levels, ethnic groups, and socioeconomic levels. Further research should also entail the development of remediational procedures closely related to performance on the PSCI. (HBS)",

Unfortunately, the majority of college faculty make but few changes, and it is suggested that more change and innovation come from the public schools. Expressions of revolt against the traditional curriculum have not brought about significant change. So, the major problem continues to be the perpetuation of a rigid curriculum; consequently, school people are viewed with suspicion. Further, strong disagreement exists over specifics in Mexican American culture and Spanish language elements which may serve as a basis for curriculum change. And this is blurred by the lack of clear or at least acceptable descriptions of characteristics that have  application on a larger and universal scale. General guidelines are suggested for curriculum changes for the education of Mexican American groups. (Author/NQ)",

        "description":"The objective of this study was to determine the effects of examiner variables such as language, ethnicity, and sex in the measurement of the self-concept of Spanish-speaking migrant pupils. The sample consisted of 169 Spanish-speaking migrant pupils, aged 10 to 12, in a Migratory Children's 1971 Summer Program. These subjects came from 5 Connecticut centers and 1 New York center. The subjects at each center were divided into 4 groups. In each center, a different pair of Puerto Rican and Anglo examiners of the same sex administered the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory using an audio-visual presentation procedure consisting of overhead transparencies and corresponding audio tapes in separate Spanish and English versions. Each examiner tested one group in Spanish and one in  English. The Oral Vocabulary subtest of the Inter-American Test of General Ability, Level II in both Spanish and English forms, was used as a language screening device so that only the subjects who had a sufficient level of comprehension in the language in which they were tested would be included in the analysis of examiner effects. The results indicated the importance of the cultural-linguistic factors; consequently, it was suggested that care should be taken to provide contextual consonance and that caution must be exercised when using the commonly available self-report instruments to insure that the language difficulty level is commensurate with the proficiency level of the pupils.

To empirically test propositions related to the objective and attitudinal effects of poverty and racial discrimination, scales designed to measure socioeconomic status, participation in community and national-level institutions and activities, job satisfaction potential, attitudes toward deviant behavior, and internal-external  control were established. Data pertaining to objective access and attitudes were obtained by administering a 30-minute questionnaire to an adult member of each household (257 respondents) in an agriculturally based community of less than 1,000 population in eastern Arkansas. The findings indicated that the complexities of social life as measured by the scales cannot be viewed simply as a function of the racial dichotomy of the rural South. Although the racial division is an important one, discriminant function analyses showed that commonalities among groups of comparable income levels, educational attainment, and age are often greater than among groups of common racial identity.

This research was designed specifically to investigate the relationship of power perception to the socio-cultural variables of locality, race, age, education, and income. A random sample of households in 2 Louisiana communities was taken and 243 male heads of households were interviewed. The 2 study communities were selected by judgment as representative of Anglo-Protestant North Louisiana and French-Catholic South Louisiana sub-cultures, respectively. Of all the independent variables included in the analysis, statistically significant differences were found only by race. It was found that blacks tended to name individuals who may be influential within the  black community, but are only peripheral to the larger community power structure. It was also found that some of the upper status-level respondents were somewhat reluctant to acknowledge power actors, possibly because they feel autonomous to the power actors. The reasons for finding no differences between education and income levels are undoubtedly questions with complex answers that need further study. (HBC)",

Data concerning the number of people treated, descriptions of the medical services available, and a narrative report are included for each project. The county projects described are those for Broward, Collier, Dade, Highlands, Hendry, Glades, Lee, Manatee, Martin, Orange, Palm Beach, Polk, Putnam, Flagler, Saint Lucie, Sarasota, and Seminole. Additional topics discussed include Florida's migrant project history, the migrant situation, the Migrant Health Referral System, nutrition services to the migrant health project, and general sanitation exhibits--the Sanitary Code of  Florida, House Bill No. 269, and the Camp Inspection Form. Future plans include increasing the slide and film library and reaching more migrants with the message of the importance of good health practices. It is concluded that although Polk and Manatee counties were separated from the project during the fall of 1968, there was an increase in the number of services rendered in all categories and an increase in the number of migrants seen or brought into contact with public health workers.

        "author":["Aoki, Tetsuo"],
        "description":"The paper describes a curriculum development project at the Hobbema Reserves, Alberta, Canada, whose locus is conceived as situated at the interface of the dominant society and the minority, native Indian society. The project's 2 objectives are (1) to produce and develop instructional materials and plans for the local Reserves school and (2) to engage the total community in involved activity in the project work. The project looks to &quot;devolution,&quot; defined as a process of power reallocation in such a way that the identifiable group situated outside the headquarters feels free to act without the constraints of some hierarchy, rather than &quot;deconcentration,&quot; defined as a process of allocating authority for specific functions within an hierarchical structure to an identifiable group  situated outside headquarters, as a viable operative value in bringing about &quot;decentralized&quot; control over curricular content. At issue is the character of the relationship between the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (Canada) and the Reserves people. The paper highlights operational principles adopted, some of the concrete activities undertaken, and American Indian perceptions of project activities as they moved through the several phases of developmental work over the initial 10 months. It concludes with the note that the curriculum development work is viewed as a significant step towards the larger issue of local autonomy over educational matters. (Author/FF)",

The author introudced into the evaluations the Hiskey-Nebraska Test of Learning Aptitude. This instrument, developed for use with deaf children, requires no verbal instructions or verbal responses. Use of this nonlanguage individual test when combined with family participation resulted in significantly different scores and much more satisfactory evaluations and placements than had previously used instruments and evaluation techniques. The current emphasis has been  placed on the validation of the Hiskey-Nebraska Test of Learning Aptitude for use with bilingual minority group children.

Other poverty problems are discussed in the areas of water resources, sewerage, housing, medical services, welfare, education and schools, and transportation. The problems, proposals for improvement, and additional comments are listed for each of the problem areas.

Its major goal was widening the migrants' experiences so that they might have more control over their own destiny. The 4 major phases to the Sodus Program's operation included the day care center for infants; the Summer Migrant School, which handles children of ages 4 1/2 to 14; the Youth Center, which provided recreation for children through young adults; and a consumer education class, which offered a 12-lesson sewing course for adults. The Summer Migrant School offered programs in music, art, and physical education; health; reading; special education, through the Board of Cooperative Education; and an opportunity for migrant children to attend a day camp  offering nature hikes, arts, crafts, games, and group singing--provided and funded by the Seven Lakes Girl Scout Council, Inc. The administration and results of the Wide Range Achievement Test and of a Migrant Children Needs Assessment Survey were additional topics of concern. The findings of the needs survey, which was distributed to summer session teachers and to teachers at the schools where the children have their home base, indicated that teachers of both areas of the country who dealt with the same children felt that although the cognitive domain dealing with the intellectual processes was important, it was more important to emphasize the affective domain of the learners during a summer school program.

Data were collected on 104 6th grade students from 3 schools on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. Three semantic differential instruments and 2 newly developed instruments to measure self-image were used. Factors were extracted until approximately 50% of the variance of the items in each set was accounted for. Computer plots of the relationship between factor scores and self-image levels were presented. Results for the semantic differential instruments were tabulated. The results suggested that Indian students' ratings  of self were more self-critical following exposure to the educational experience and that the educational experience had grossly similar effects across ethnic lines. Major recommendations included that subsequent studies should focus on how materials affect children at a particular self-image level within a given ethnic group, that materials prepared for one ethnic group not be used for other ethnic groups, that materials not be assumed to have the same import for all students in that ethnic group, and that a given educational experience be viewed as an initial activity.

Nine steps in the sequential strategy are outlined and elaborated upon. These cover establishing an environmental education advisory committee, obtaining funds, hiring and formalizing responsibilities of a coordinator, defining program goals, setting up operational objectives, determining strategy for curriculum development and implementation, providing an inservice teacher education program, assisting schools in  developing their school sites, and constructing measurement instruments to evaluate effectiveness of the program. Since the strategy is designed to be integrated into the existing curriculum, the environmental encounter and school site development approach are emphasized. Two encounters are exemplified as well as numerous goals and sub-goals for developing appropriate attitudes and skills. This is to encourage the student to be knowledgeable concerning the bio-physical environment and associated problems, aware of how and skilled in helping to solve these problems, and motivated to work toward their solution.

The purpose of the conference was to bring together a broad spectrum of public and private agencies, councils, and organizations to exchange ideas and information about the quality of the environment and environmental education in Tennessee. Specifically, the participants sought to: (1) identify concerns about the environmental crisis, (2) explore existing endeavors and resources, (3) establish priorities, goals, and objectives for environmental education, and (4) suggest mechanisms for implementing a state plan for environmental education. Their recommendations are summarized under 14 categories:  state plan, legislation, leadership, coordination, communication, teacher education, community education, information exchange, survey of resources, in-service education, curriculum development, evaluation, environmental centers, and other areas. This document, therefore, is a compilation of their pertinent, and often conflicting, comments and recommendations. As a report, it is not construed to be a master plan for environmental education. Rather, its contents are to be utilized in the final preparation of the state plan by a special task force.(BL)",

Sections of twelve textbooks ranging from grade levels four through twelve as well as six pairs of contrived passages were analyzed using these methods. Results showed that this type of analysis can be used to describe the nature of the presentation in mathematics text passages, that through these methods data are provided on variables which  statistically differentiate among textbooks, and that there were no significant differences between groups of raters using this technique to analyze the textbooks.

        "description":"Research reported here focuses on the effects of community status upon citizen participation and conflict in school politics. One objective was to test Minar's studies which showed higher levels of participation in lower status districts due to the differential possession by higher and lower status school districts of resources of conflict management skills in their respective populaces. A second objective was to investigate factors which operate to minimize and/or contribute to conflict. A sample of eight districts were selected. The theoretical framework drew upon Minar's work, employed Easton's model of the political processes, and investigated Gamson's study of the structural effects upon the incidence and intensity of conflict. Key findings show that: 1) the overall conflict  ranking proved to be highly correlated with the referendum dissent ranking; 2) the rankings on the structural variables proved to be unreliable predictors of overall conflict; 3) leadership by the school authorities and political culture of the blue and white collar districts accounted for most of the variation in conflict levels. The present study shows that low conflict, and vice versa, is due both to differences in cultural ethos and to the level of management resources. An obvious implication of the findings is that school authorities might find training designed to raise their \"political consciousness\" useful. (Author/SJM)",

The study was designed to facilitate the collection of data comparable to studies conducted by Piaget in Switzerland and Jahoda in Scotland. An interview-examination with standardized administration procedures was developed and tasks from the studies of Piaget and Jahoda were pilot tested to determine their suitability. A sample of 204 children between the ages of six and thirteen were randomly selected from the state of  Georgia. The variance between observed and theoretically expected distributions, and the effects of age, socioeconomic status, and instruction on the development of decentration concepts, are discussed.

Machiavellianism is defined as a high need to control others, regardless of the attending ethical considerations. Intrinsically religious persons are motivated to practice their beliefs in everyday life; extrinsically religious persons use religion as a utilitarian method for self-gain. Sixty-six subjects were classified as High or Low Machs on the basis of the Christie et al.  Machiavellianism Scale and as Intrinsically or Extrinsically Religious on the Allport and Ross Religiosity Scale. The experimental group of 53 wrote essays advocating two years mandatory military service prior to college enrollment; they believed these were to be read by persons who were undecided on the issue. Pretesting had indicated that no subjects supported this proposition. It was believed that writing the counterattitudinal essay would induce greater cognitive dissonance, and hence attitudinal change, in Low Machs and Intrinsically Religious subjects. Posttesting revealed that Low Machs displayed greater attitude change than did High Machs; however, the religiosity hypothesis was not confirmed. (KW)",

American schools see themselves as agents of the society, charged with transmitting the values and behaviors considered central to the maintenance of society. Critics of this functional view of socialization suggest schools should be instruments of radical change. However, these critics fail to examine the structural feasibility of their proposed innovations. Implementation of any radical educational change necessitates societal structural conditions responsive to such change. Presently education is dominated by the existing power structure. If one wishes the schools to move beyond socialization for this status quo to \"reflective socialization\" (a blend of critical reflection about and internalization  of societal values and norms), one must combine social projects aimed at societal change with educational reconstruction. Social projects are short-term collective undertakings aimed at seeking critical social knowledge and reducing the alienating conditions of society. The goal of educational reconstruction is education beyond socialization, characterized by: 1) commitment to transforming inauthentic social reality; 2) a global orientation; 3) development of students' imaginative and creative capacities; 4) loosening of society's conventional norms of behavior; 5) new patterns of participative decision making; 6) education outside of schools; and 7) self-actualization.

Methodological problems encountered are reviewed. The model requires explicit project or program objectives, individual staff behavioral objectives, client change-objectives, specification on inputs, and description and verification of outputs for staff and client changes. Verification procedures include a work situation description and analysis, in-process reports and meetings, and an end of service report and review by field personnel with staff verification. A process and analytical outline is presented and discussed. An appendix is also included--Initial Analytical Possibilities for M.  I. &amp; E. System outputs. (FDI)",

The first part of the booklet deals with the museum's present image, available educational services, and possible future services. The major portion of the report is comprised of materials prepared by the writer as a direct outgrowth of the study and consists of: 1) a museum tour guide; 2) a community news release; 3) a  pamphlet of samples of materials on display at the museum; 4) a suggested Greenbelt proposal; 5) a discussion of how the museum and institute can be of educational assistance to Mesa College; 6) a paper written for dissemination to the community on the need to support the museum; and 7) an evaluation of what services should/could be offered to the community by the museum and institute.

It focused particularly upon the acquisition of such attitudes by Black and Mexican-American children, minority groups currently involved in deep social and political conflicts. The data were obtained with a written questionnaire administered to 946 fifth and eighth graders in Fresno, California. The main categories of predictor variables included were: demographic, personality, attitudes about interpersonal relationships, cognitive biases, political involvement, and political sophistication. The main dependent variables were attitudes toward political conflict, civil liberties, interest groups, political partisanship, racial and ethnic  groups, and attachment to the nation and political authority. From partial results of this report, it appears that a majority of the children have acquired coherent attitudes concerning political conflict and power by the onset of adolescence. (FDI)",

        "description":"Ideas on the necessity for evaluating alternative programs and on developing evaluation programs are examined in this position paper. Many alternative schools, opposed to measurement of their program from a philosophical and defensive standpoint, view evaluation in a negative light because the purpose is not understood. However, evaluation can be an integral part of an ongoing formative evaluation process; establish credibility for an innovative program; identify workable educational strategies; and set the stage for student evaluation. Problems and issues in alternative education are varied. One of the problems mentioned is that the stereotype of a good evaluation is one where no negative information is brought forth -- whereas, in contrast, a good evaluation provides direction  for program improvement. Another problem is that an inadequacy of evaluation instruments and evaluators exists. Other issues and problems relate to stringent demands, the role of behavioral objectives, and evaluation by external sources. In summary, evaluation needs to be an integral part of the planning process with the staff and the central administration establishing goals and objectives which can be evaluated. (SJM)",

Through questionnaires, and follow-up interviews of 78 subjects, research data were gathered on the political efficacy and trust; image of the government, president, and policeman; and trust and efficacy reactions to three levels of government. These areas of investigation were selected on the basis of their theoretical significance relative to children's developing political orientations. Findings indicate that the subjects were found to: hold generally low levels of political  efficacy and trust; negatively evaluate the government and the president, but positively evaluate the policeman; perceive the local government as more facilitative of political efficacy than the Federal or state governments; and perceive the Federal government as more trustworthy than state or local governments.

First, the methodology of National Assessment can be used as a model for developing objectives, and for devising exercises to measure attainment of social studies objectives. Social studies curricula now depend highly upon standardized tests which compare each student with the average performance of all students, emphasize the average range, and require each respondent to answer all items. In contrast, National Assessment instruments are criterion-referenced, measuring the performance of groups of students, are geared to the ability of the high, average, and low student, and employ a  sampling matrix. Secondly, the materials and exercises are available to researchers and have application to other areas in the social studies. Lastly, National Assessment data at their disposal, social studies researchers can interpret, apply and extend the findings in numerous ways.

Three major parts emphasize the necessity for cooperation among educators, artists, administrators, and parents. Part one explains the principles, objectives, and philosophy of the programs and, further, offers some effects and evaluation of the theatre arts programs. Outstanding examples of selected programs are described in Part II. Although the emphasis is on music programs,  other topics dealt with are drama, dance, pantomime, poetry, and puppetry. In Part III, practical suggestions are provided for implementing and using performing arts programs in the school.

        "description":"This study compares the effects of the traditional sixth grade social studies curriculum for Oregon pupils with that of Man: A Course of Study (MACOS). Students were pre- and post-tested. Data were analyzed statistically by the use of the F test on equality of variance and t-tests for pooled variance and distinct variances to test two null hypotheses. As measured by the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, sixth grade students using a traditional social studies curriculum of Latin America will not differ significantly in creativity nor in the achievement of social studies skills as measured by the &quot;Sequential Tests of Education Progress (STEP): Social Studies&quot; from those students using the social studies curriculum MACOS. No significance at the .10 level was found when the t-test  for distinct variances was applied, thus verifying the null hypotheses. A pattern, however, emerged from the data that indicated the MACOS materials may produce greater verbal creativity. (Author)",

The report briefly sketches the political and romantic Student Left during the decade of the sixties; delineates the characteristics of non-campus-based youthful radicalism as exemplified by the action and thought of the Young Communist League between 1922 and 1943; explores the nature of the student movements which emerged during the immediately ensuing period; and specifies resemblances and differences between the past and present in order to better anticipate the future. While much of the data of the study are derived from conventional bibliographical sources, the main historical sections are based on an  intensive analysis of all named issues of youth-oriented radical periodicals or newspapers. Findings for both past and present youth groups indicate they were preoccupied with social issues of peace, poverty, civil liberties, and racial discrimination, and with campus issues of corporative control of the university, academic freedom, economic issues, and academic offerings. The greatest divergence between the two groups lies in the recent intrusion of &quot;generation gap,&quot;&quot;the counter culture,&quot; and &quot;student power&quot; into radical politics.

Methods applied range from the initial clearing away of prevalent misconceptions and the clarification of concepts, through psychological experimentation and the study of clinical work on the brain, to actual field work in educational institutions and the arts. The underlying assumption was that work in the arts, like much human activity, involves the processing of symbols. First, a grounded organization  of symbol systems and functions was developed. Then questions and hypotheses concerning the abilities required for the implications of this for the arts were framed and investigated. Throughout the study, however, any question or evidence that promised to further the objective was considered. Rather than offering art educators recommendations and conclusions, the report offers materials that may be of use in their thinking and practice. (Author)",

        "description":"In an effort to put new vigor into the learning situation, an experiential approach to the teaching of social sciences in higher education is offered in this paper. The paper describes how the experiential approach is being used in an academic sociology course at Stanford which is adaptable to a wide variety of social sciences courses. Differing from the traditional directive method, the experiential approach involves several interrelated factors. First, educational philosophy stresses student motivation, peer learning, equal emphasis upon both intellectual and affective content, and shared decision making. Second, there is a body of intellectual social science content. Third, a complex battery of instructional techniques including experience teams, field activities, simulation  games, experiential exercises, readings, lectures, and other media are employed. Emerging out of past experience with this type of course, practical suggestions for running a course include introducing the approach slowly with a backup of practice and planning, forming a cadre of interested people, trying a weekend retreat, finding enough space and time, providing a flexible structure, clarifying goals, understanding the professor's role, and expecting students to go through various stages in their attitudes toward the course.

Three thousand four hundred randomly selected public school teachers in Kansas participated in the study. A mail questionnaire was used to collect data on 14 variables: sex motivation factors, six matched incentive factors, primary life interests, and satisfaction. Primary crossbreak variables for analysis purposes were sex and teaching level. Interrelationships were investigated using multiple regression and discriminant analysis techniques. The findings indicated that the female elementary and secondary teachers who  scored higher on satisfaction were more job oriented, had a job in which there was a higher potential for personal challenge and development, less work pressure, and more incentives relating to physical surroundings, and where the tolerance for work pressure was higher. Male elementary teachers who scored higher on satisfaction were more job oriented. Three additional variables--work role, voluntarism, ideal incentives--were added to build a quasi-theory of satisfaction. A 31-item bibliography and appendixes are included. (Author/MJM)",

Four hundred and twenty-six questionnaires were sent to all college teachers of education holding the rank of assistant professor or higher at eight institutions of higher learning. Four schools were in the Big Eight Conference, and the remaining four were located within the same states. Of the 264 returned questionnaires, 192 were found to be useable. Results indicated that subjects tended to specialize in their role performance. The researcher tended to achieve the highest level of job satisfaction while the  administrator tended to be the most highly rewarded in terms of salary. The research, although it was not of a longitudinal nature, indicated that the youngest incumbents stressed the research role, the 50-59 year-old age group was more politically oriented and the 40-49 and 60-69 age group appeared to lack clear preference of type.

The primary source of data was three recorded teaching episodes, 15 minutes in length, which were collected prior to the beginning of the Minicourse program, at the end of the program, and at the end of a 6-month period following the program. Results indicated that teachers' behavior  changed in directions intended by the Minicourse program and that the qualitative changes were well beyond the level required for statistical significance. Appendixes of related program materials and tables are included. (MJM)",

To determine causes for a decrease in connectedness in the teacher training experience, 10 clinical interviews with 10 ex-student teachers were conducted in 1971-72, the first two academic periods following teacher training. Open-ended interviews were guided by five questions. Results indicated five explanations for the loss of connectedness: excessive overall workload, the shock effect of shattering illusions about the profession of teaching, unrelated academic work at the University, competition, and relationship of master teacher to student teacher. Recommendations indicate a need for periodic attitude-testing before, during, and after teacher training  and several years into the teaching experience in order to investigate the shifts in trust which were hypothesized by the ex-student teachers.

Constructive questions were formulated from interpretation of the data collected. The question of whether university course work should precede public school observation and participation was discussed. It was accepted that both should occur concurrently. It was also accepted that an undergraduate should begin professional participation no earlier than second semester of the sophomore year, and perhaps not until the junior year. The schools or districts involved in this participation should be chosen carefully to insure a maximum benefit for the undergraduate and the public school. The attitudes of the teachers toward the preservice  students should also be studied. The question of the establishment of clinical professorships suggested a balanced program for public school and university staffs. A general methods class would be taught in the university; a subject oriented methods class would be taught in the public schools; a student teaching experience would involve both staffs. The conclusion of the report focused on the need for a mutual effort by university and public school staff to identify and assist one another in the solution of problems in secondary school teacher education.

The variable &quot;religion&quot; was defined operationally in terms of a wide range of value patterns which might qualify as authentic value orientations in contemporary American society. A field study proceeded by administering two paper-pencil instruments to a sample of 207 teachers from random school districts in rural southwest Arkansas: (1) Inventory of Religious and Ethical Ways and (2) the Classroom Problems Inventory. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-tailed nonparametric statistic for independent samples was applied to the data. Findings indicated that teachers with traditional classroom attitudes toward religious issues differed  significantly from teachers with non-traditional attitudes in their rankings of several value patterns. These differences reflected a trend for teachers to manifest a classroom point of view consistent with their personal beliefs. It was consequently suggested that teacher education give greater attention to curricular experiences which assist the prospective teacher to become aware of his value orientation. Such self-clarification in the affective domain of educational objectives may be helpful in handling controversial issues in the public school classroom. Two tables of statistical data were presented. (Author)",

The grade level of each student was determined, and students were placed in the primary (K-3) or elementary (4-6) groups. Further data were collected from measurement tests. Results indicated that students in experimental groups tended to improve their performance in each category to a significantly greater extent than students in the control group.

Six hypotheses were developed and a t-test was applied to each. Results showed that the EPPS scores differed very little for both elementary and secondary education majors over the 4-year period. However, the freshman year mean scores for achievement were significantly higher for secondary education majors, and the mean scores for dominance were higher for the elementary education group. The scores for all male subjects were  compared with the University norm. The only significant difference appeared for the characteristic of aggression. The males in education scored higher. There was no significant difference for female education majors when they were compared with general female college norms.

Because of this, a proposal has been made by the United States Office of Education to develop its own standards for deciding which colleges and universities should receive federal funds. Therefore, institutions of higher education would be subjected to both nongovernmental accreditation and a federal system of eligibility determination. In dealing with this problem, the organization of the present system of accreditation was discussed emphasizing the need for a unified, national system of accrediting all higher education institutions, proprietary and specialized. An example of the recognition of this need was the report of the merger between the National Commission on Accrediting and the Federation  of Regional Accrediting Commissions of Higher Education. A merger of this type then called for a look at the standards and criteria used in accreditation. The role of the total educational community was stressed because of the increasing involvement of state legislatures. The pressures on the organization of accreditation by the federal and state governments and collective bargaining groups left the colleges and universities in the middle. Nongovernmental accreditation can survive only through the unity of the accrediting community. (BRB)",

In some cases, trainees have taught actual secondary students in the microteaching situation. In other cases, the trainees have played the role of students in a peer-teaching mode of microteaching. This study compared the real and peer-teaching modes of microteaching in relation to subsequent teaching success. It was hypothesized that teacher trainees who taught actual secondary school students in microteaching would be rated higher on &quot;teacher-pupil rapport&quot; and &quot;pupil participation and attention&quot; than the peer-teaching group. Ratings were made on the Stanford Teacher Competence Appraisal Guide by 2,306 secondary school students in northwest Missouri and southwest Iowa schools.  No significant differences between mean ratings of the two groups were obtained on any of the 13 items listed on the Appraisal Guide. It was concluded that peer teaching is a viable alternative microteaching procedure for teacher-trainees with the same cultural background.

Sixty-three graduate and 63 undergraduate students were pre- and posttested using the \"What Is Your Philosophy of Education\" test. Validity and reliability for this instrument have not been established. Data was gathered and responses were noted for each of the four philosophical views: idealist, realist, pragmatist, and Aristotelian. For the total statistical analysis, the number of students subscribing to each philosophy was artifically obtained. Results indicated that Pragmatism exerts the major  philosophical influence on students of education on the graduate and undergraduate levels. Further findings, recommendations, and implications are suggested. A four item bibliography is included. (MJM)",

Under the plan, children attended the Syphax School for grades 1 and 2; the Amidon School for grades 3 and 4; the Bowen School for grades 5 and 6. Children from various socioeconomic strata were thus grouped together for the first time. The Tri-School Plan hoped to increase community harmony, encourage and promote parental involvement, and upgrade the quality of education. The Plan was evaluated by the Stanford Achievement Tests (SAT) and the Ohio Social Acceptance Scale (OSAS), in-depth interviews of the three school principals and nine teachers, and questionnaires completed by 50 percent of the parents involved. The  results of the SAT for grades 1, 3, and 5 were presented in three tables showing significant achievement scores in arithmetic and paragraph meaning. The results of the OSAS were presented statistically for grades 3 and 5; social relations in grade 5 were positive. Principal, teacher, and parent reactions were favorable to the Plan. Recommendations were made for special classes for emotionally disturbed children, new curricula, teacher consultation on instructional aids for the classroom, and more communication among the three schools. The appendixes contained the principal and teacher interview schedules, and the parent questionnaires. (BRB)",

Ten teachers from McKinley Junior High School, Flint, Michigan, were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of five teachers who had assigned the greatest number of satisfactory citizenship grades; the second group contained five teachers who had assigned the greatest number of unsatisfactory citizenship grades. Each teacher's level of conceptual differentiation was assessed by the semi-projective This I Believe test (TIB). Subjects grouped under  System 1 had concrete belief systems and subjects grouped under Others had abstract belief systems. Statistical analysis revealed a positive correlation between academic and citizenship grade assignment and teachers' belief systems. However, there was a higher correlation between academic and citizenship grades assigned by System 1 teachers than by Others. Analysis revealed that Hypothesis 1 was directionally significant at the .05 level but the relationship was not as strong as the others tested. Six tables of statistical data were included. (BRB)",

These effects focus on the urgency of examining and revising the teacher education programs offered in the teachers' colleges. Implications for further teacher education programs are made, focusing on  the development of the New Law for Teacher Education which is expected to be passed in 1972-73.

All courses relating to these segments were presented along with course load schedules for average and exceptional students. A high school diploma was not a requirement for entrance into the  program. Tutoring and counseling services were initiated for the students and the Teach-Test-Reteach (T-T-Rt) method of teaching was applied. The requirements of teacher selection focused on the ability of the teacher to communicate with the participants.

These objectives were achieved through a junior year internship program, a tutorial program, and an Upward Bound Program. A month to month development of each program was given. The program description focused on the internship program which  operated in two schools, the Burton Grove School and the Glen Arden School. The interns were assigned to self-contained classrooms at Burton Grove and to teams at Glen Arden. All students received course credit for the internship and the curriculum was adjusted to enable students to graduate within 4 years. The budget was included in the report along with procedures for evaluation of the program. Appendixes with background information on the Program form the major part of the document. (BRB)",

The outline of admission and selective retention requirements called for a decision by the student regarding his continuation in the program. This decision was based on self-evaluation and evaluation by a designated faculty panel. The first decision came during the freshman year; the second came  in the sophomore year; the third preceded the student teaching program. The student, therefore, had the opportunity to evaluate his needs and successes throughout the program. This evaluation technique was also applied to the transfer students and the selective retention program. The questions posed in the final section of the proposal dealt with the supply and demand of teachers and effects of this on teacher training. Suggestions for evaluation of the proposal were made.

One hundred and thirty elementary education majors with comparable grade point averages were randomly assigned to five sections of an education methods course. Two sections used the independent study module and the remaining sections used group instruction. A student attitude inventory showed no significant differences among instructors who were scheduled for both treatment groups. Statistical analysis of both treatment groups  showed a) a higher cognitive achievement level for group-instructed students, b) no significant difference in teaching performance for either group, c) no significant difference in attitudes of students toward instructors, and d) no significant difference in attitudes of students toward the course.

The data presented came from responses to a questionnaire given to 244 teachers in 15 elementary schools. This study showed that elementary school teachers had little respect for evaluations of their teaching by other teachers. The teachers had a low estimation of the value of professional knowledge, skill, and training. There was also a lack of visibility of teachers' work to each other. An increase in the visibility of work, brought about by team teaching and open schools, increased the perceived soundness of evaluations of that work. The visibility of teaching per se had an independent impact on the importance of evaluations and the desired influence of evaluations. Team teaching was also associated with  greater collegial control. Among teachers who were members of teams, a higher level of visibility of teacher's work was associated with an increase in the desired influence of and importance accorded evaluation by colleagues. It was suggested that the increased use of open schools and teams may lead to a more professional organization of teaching. Fourteen tables of statistical data are presented.

        "description":"This study involved an investigation of the use of Pearson r, tetrachoric r, phi, phi/phi maximum, and Kendall Tau-B coefficients as measures of association for the incomplete principal components analysis of simulated Likert scale attitudinal data, based on a known factor pattern and possessing different types of severe departures from normality. The results suggested that in addition to being based on few assumptions, Tau-B was most robust, with respect to distributional distortion, with large or small samples, and this coefficient was followed by the Pearson r. The measures based on 2 x 2 tables--tetrachoric r, phi, and phi/phi maximum--tended to be less robust and were seen to be adversely affected by uneven marginal splits, a condition generally present with Likert scale  data.

The basic focus of the first section of the report, Cost Analysis, is to provide answers to the fundamental question of how much these two CAI methods cost compared with some measure of non-CAI &quot;baseline&quot; educational costs. The second section, Educational Analysis, describes the baseline educational analysis that will be implemented during 1972-73. Attention is given to achievement and attitude measurement, the experimental design, and plans for data collection. In the third section, Technical Analysis, the progress of the two systems to-date is summarized, as based on site visits to both the University of  Illinois and MITRE, in relation to system development, decisions that will be important in the determination of the nature of the final system, and the adequacy of the method for collecting system performance data. An extensive bibliography, with brief annotations, lists recent writings related to the subject of computer-based education in general and those technically related to the research, development, and evaluation concerns of the project. The two appendices to the report are: A. Survey of Instructor Activities and Attitudes, and B. Attitudes toward Reading Questionnaires--Grade 2 and Grades 4 and 6.

The final section of the questionnaire was designed to do two things. The first purpose was to determine the level of confidence in, and support of, the total educational program for Beverly Hills schools. The second was to rank budget allocations. Basic questions in the questionnaire include: (1) Which are the best information sources concerning Beverly Hills Schools? (2) In what areas is more information needed?  (3) In what areas should the schools expend resources? (4) Where, between home and school, does the primary responsibility lie for the student's development in other than academic areas? and (5) What is the level of confidence in the schools?

The objectives were developed and revised mainly by curriculum supervisors. Frequent references are made to two publications, &quot;Milwaukee Public Schools Bilingual Elementary Program K-4,&quot; and &quot;Performance Objectives for Bilingual Education Offerings at the Secondary Level,&quot; which define the totality of the behavioral objectives and contain the test item pools of expected pupil behaviors. Of the several objectives in each subject content area, supervisory and/or teaching staff members selected two to be evaluated for each component in 1971-1972. Some behavioral objectives were analyzed in terms of percent of pupil achievement  by language dominance. Tests of significance have been included for comparisons of pre/post scores and comparison of Bilingual Program groups with other groups. The report of pupil outcomes is divided into three sections: kindergarten, primary, and secondary. Each section is subdivided into curriculum areas. Under each curriculum area, there are statements of goals, objectives measured, classroom procedure, evaluation procedure, findings, and conclusion. A summary concludes each section. (Author/CK)",

        "description":"A criterion-referenced instrument, Inventory of Cognitive Skills and Visual-Motor Functioning, was devised to evaluate a prekindergarten program for economically disadvantaged 4-year-olds. The Inventory, administered to each child at the beginning and end of the preschool experience, provided specific information in: (1) knowledge of body parts, colors, shapes, and numbers; (2) information from pictures; (3) story comprehension; (4) picture comprehension; (5) concept knowledge; (6) following directions consisting of multiple parts; (7) copying shapes; (8) gross motor coordination; and (9) rating of responses during assessment. The assessment resulted in more precise classroom planning and better knowledge of the developmental level of the age group. An important part of  criterion-referenced assessment is task analysis, or breaking down skills into their component parts. The Boehm Test of Basic Concepts illustrates the task analysis approach. Fifty concepts are tested to determine which present difficulty for individual pupils. With the test, teachers or specialists can identify individual strengths and limitations and group patterns, all of which can be used in classroom planning. Instructional procedures need to carry the task analysis further by tapping the many levels of concept learning and application, from concrete to abstract. (KM)",

The 628 districts were divided into 14 groups, which were compared on: (1) human resources--such as pupil/teacher ratio and percent of teachers with master's degree; (2) school financial resources--such as local revenue per pupil and State school aid per pupil; (3) student background; (4) school/student performance--Attitude measures, basic skills measures, and dropout rate; and (5) school or district size. Qualifying information regarding the use of the data is given, and statistical terms are defined. It was found that on certain assessment measures in the categories of school  resources, student background, and dropout rate, groups of school districts classified according to enrollment size do perform differently. But differences were found to be slight on most measures. No discernible pattern occurred in the basic skills measures. An appendix lists the school districts in the size groupings used for the study. (For related documents, see EM 002 327-330.) (KM)",

        "description":"A study of student attitudes toward drug abuse and the drug abuser was conducted, using a modified version of Marcus's &quot;Alcoholism Questionnaire.&quot; One hundred twenty-two college students participated. Mean factor scores (MFS) were developed for the nine factors tested. Marcus's &quot;safe operating criterion&quot; (ignore MFS differences that are less than 0.50 and pay particular attention to those greater than 1.00) was used in analyzing results. MFS for this group were compared with those of 2 other groups--120 heroin addicts in a methadone treatment program and 35 college students. The MFS differences between the student and addict groups were below 0.50 on four factors and between 0.50 and 1.00 on the remaining five. On these five factors, it appears that students are more likely to  beleive that addicts do and can be helped to recover and are more likely to see addiction as an illness. Addicts are more willing than students to believe that periodic excessive drug users can be addicts. The results of this survey were compared with the results of a similar survey of student attitudes toward alcoholism and the alcoholic. The MFS differences were below 0.50 on 7 factors and below 1.00 on the other two. It was concluded that students are ambivalent in their views of drug abuse and alcoholism; they say that both are illnesses but are undecided about the issues of control and character defect. Therefore it was concluded that we are failing in our education of youth in these areas. A bibliography is provided. (For related documents, see TM 002 332, 333.) (KM)",

        "description":"The three parts of this study concern the application of diagnostic testing to measure the effectiveness of classification training, the development of a systematic approach to applying the results, and a long-term study of employee retention of classification information. The measurement instrument selected for diagnostic testing of employees of a Veterans Administration Hospital was a brief &quot;True-False&quot; test, developed in 1968, with 20 items and called a Prototype Diagnostic Test. An alternate test, developed in 1972, with 20 items and called a Classification Questionnaire, was used after completion of refresher training, and the results were compared with the diagnostic test score; thus it was possible to quantify the effectiveness of the refresher training. The test results  were also used to evaluate Divisions and Services of the hospital. The long-range study of how long the average employee retained a satisfactory amount of classification information without refresher training utilized a random sample of 137 nursing assistants over a period of four years, after which they were tested with basically the same information. Statistical analysis of the results showed that the average score of the population fell from 86% to 80%. It is concluded that use of a diagnostic test covering basic classification information is an effective way to determine classification training needs, provide a basis for measuring the effectiveness of classification training, identify employees for remedial training, and provide for comparative evaluation of the program.

An attempt is made to estimate the effectiveness of particular reading programs for low-scoring, middle-scoring, and high-scoring pupils for the purpose of identifying exemplary programs. In addition, a rank ordering of the various programs relative to one another and to &quot;regular&quot; Grade 3 programs in the state is made. The Primary II Reading Test of the Metropolitan Achievement Tests was used for pretesting and posttesting. Site visits were also made to all of the schools in the study to collect information. Two different statistical methods were used to analyze the data: (1) analysis of change scores; and (2) one based on within-school regression lines. The major conclusion  reached as a result of the study findings is that Title I reading programs in Grade 3 in Michigan vary considerably as to effectiveness from one program to another. The three appendixes to the report provide a listing of participants, data collection form, and supporting tables in Appendix A; Appendix B presents 12 tables and 9 figures; and Appendix C contains program data on 16 schools relating to 6 program areas.

        "description":"To determine if the ethnocentric perceptions of students would be influenced by participation in a 3-week social studies unit on \"The Contributions of Minority Ethnic Groups to American Civilization,\" a study was made utilizing 114 students in five 12th grade social studies classes (three experimental and two control). The investigation attempted to gain insight into the processes of attitudinal change and to obtain information on the influence of sex, intelligence, and socioeconomic background on attitudinal change. Ten hypotheses were tested. A modified form of the California E Scale was given to all groups prior to the beginning of the study unit, and again three days following the completion of the unit. In addition, the experimental groups completed the Otis Quick-Scoring  Mental Ability Tests, Gamma Test: Form C, 1939, and a personal information form. The statistical technique employed was the significance of the differences between means obtained from the same group upon two occasions (t-test). Results of the study were: (1) factual information favorable to minority ethnic groups lowered the expressed ethnocentric attitudes of the experimental groups; (2) both the high and low ethnocentric groups became more tolerant in the expression of their feelings toward members of minority ethnic groups; (3) the male population showed no attitudinal change, but the female population showed highly significant reduction in ethnocentrism; (4) expressed prejudicial attitudes toward minority groups were substantially reduced; and (5) the treatment induced an expressed  significant reduction in ethnocentrism in the high socioeconomic group, but there was no significant attitudinal shift in the low socioeconomic group. Recommendations for future research are made. (DB)",

A functionally significant correlation with any of the three criteria would support a rationale for greatly increased work in that area. Functionally significant correlations for all three criteria would support a unified theory of human potential. Subjects were 100 OCS candidates at Fort Benning, Ga. The p.05 level of significance for the multiple R was used as  the criterion for selecting the terminal step in the multiple regression program. The Pearson and Biserial correlations among the pairs of criteria are: (1) peer ratings with M 16 scores--r=.21; (2) peer ratings with course completion--r=.23; and (3) M 16 scores with course completion--r=.06. The data obtained support a unified theory of human potential and have wide implications for intelligence testing, personality theory, and prediction of performance. (Author/KM)",

Three forms of the SAS were developed under the name Situational Attitude Inventory. Forms A and B corresponded to the originals; they tested attitudes toward whites and blacks, respectively, in varying social situations. Form C was developed to test the validity of the social situations for differentiation among alternative referents, which included welfare, age, ethnicity, and physical characteristics. The SAS was administered to a random sample of new freshman and transfer students at Michigan State University in September, 1970. Data were analyzed using factor analysis and multiple t-tests  of individual items and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) of scales constructed by the method of reciprocal averages (RAVE). Factor analysis demonstrated independence of SAS situations. Multiple t-test data showed that white 1970 new students had more negative attitudes toward blacks than whites. Profile analysis revealed that students reacted to the scales differentially, depending on the form of the instrument completed; aspects of the social situations affected their responses as well as the particular descriptive characteristics assigned to the actor(s). There is a &quot;saving&quot; of at least 89 statistical tests using this method of analysis over the previous one, as well as having a more widely understood estimate of reliability. (KM)",

Observers were assigned randomly to three experimental groups and given different expectancy rationales about the outcomes of the studies for which they would be collecting data. All groups were told they would be observing a family under a father-present and father-absent condition. One group was led to expect an increase, another a decrease, and a third no change in the rate of deviant behavior for the boys in the family as conditions changed from father-present to father-absent. None of the groups were told they would be observing identical videotape recordings of family interaction permitting comparison of observation data across groups. Results  indicated that the expectations of experimental outcomes differed significantly for the three groups. However, observers were totally unbiased in their reports of deviant behavior in group comparisons. Failure to obtain evidence for observer bias in spite of the demonstrated manipulation of observer expectations was attributed to the precautions taken to assure high levels of observer accuracy throughout the study.

        "description":"The basic design for the national evaluation of the Follow Through program is presented, and some of the related issues of analysis are considered. The design, as it now stands, presents many difficulties for analysis. These analysis issues are seen to include the following: (1) What should be the unit of analysis?; (2) How is the effect of a Follow Through approach when compared with its control estimated?; and (3) How is the relative effectiveness of the various approaches estimated? Several different strategies that have been suggested for use in quasi-experiments in attempts to control variables that are confronted with treatments are discussed. The potential confounding variables are classified into two categories: (1) systematic differences in the dependent variable  dimensions that are present in the units of analysis at the outset of program participation; and (2) systematic differences that occur in the dependent variable dimensions during program participation which are not a function of program participation. The appropriate method for attempting to control confounding variables in the evaluation of Follow Through appears to be a combination of strategies employing both matching and estimated true score ANCOVE.

Six levels of unobtrusiveness are (1) Complete Unobtrusiveness, (2) Hidden Mechanical Intervention, (3) Hidden Observer, (4) Impinging Mechanical Intervention Not Recognized as Experimental, (5) Impinging Observer, and (6) Unobtrusive Measures within an Experimental Setting. Each of these levels is discussed. Distinguishing levels of obtrusiveness has merit only to the extent it allows identification of potential sources of reactivity. The two main advantages of unobtrusive measures are that they avoid many of the potential artifacts of lab experiments and that they increase the range of testable variables. The extent, by unobtrusive measures are: subject awareness, experimental arrangements, and limited method  variance. The disadvantages of unobtrusive measures are decreased internal validity, inability to test many hypotheses, high dross or low saturation, which may be associated with a high cost of experimentation, possible invasion of privacy, and introduction of observer errors. Cooperation and competition could be studied in numerous ways by unobtrusive measures; examples are given as illustrations of these ways. (DB)",

        "description":"The 3 major questions about evaluating guidance are: (1) Why should we evaluate? (2) What are we evaluating? (3) How do we evaluate? School guidance counselors must first define their goals in order to evaluate their performance and results. This is part of the counselor's accountability to himself and to others. And by communicating their objectives, the counselor can influence the evaluation others make of his work. The success of a guidance program is difficult to evaluate because defining and measuring behavior objectives are not adequate for evaluation. One can raise scores on a criterion measure without affecting the actual success of the program being evaluated. Longitudinal evaluation studies are difficult, and few have been conducted. Many variables and a considerable  time-lag are involved in identifying wise decisions. And the tendency to generalize from results can be overdone. In real decision-making, students do not simply choose from alternatives; they can often create their own options. We can't define wisdom merely in terms of outcomes. Students make decisions after they have examined competing values and formed their own value systems. Without directing the content of an individual's choice, we can help him in the process of choosing. The major methods of evaluation are really inadequate because they fail to take account of human differences and their interactions with environmental circumstances. But we must, through evaluation, provide students with a model of decision-making behavior. (KM)",

Designed by the writer two decades ago, this instrument purposes to assess attitudes of teachers toward pupils as one important factor in teacher personality. The present study attempts to cross-validate predictive validity results obtained by the writer in an investigation he made in 1967. The two studies comprise a sample of approximately 200 Furman University teacher education students, most of whom had taken the MTAI (1) as beginning trainees, (2) as graduates, and (3) as experienced teachers. Correlating these MTAI scores with ratings made later by principal, pupils, and an outside observer provided predictive validity coefficients, in the 1967  study, of .27 and .20 for beginning trainees and inexperienced graduates, respectively. Modifying the original scoring key for more adequate use with beginners and inexperienced graduates resulted in raising these coefficients to .55 and .57. The present study resulted in coefficients of .42 (beginniners) and .58 (graduates) with use of the original key and .47 and .55, respectively, with the modified key. It is concluded that the MTAI does have predictive validity and would seem useful in conjunction with other predictive measures. Use of the modified scoring key seems desirable with beginning trainees, and, with somewhat less certainty, with inexperienced graduates. (Author)",

The study was conducted to ascertain need for revision of testing programs and curricular materials used with disadvantaged students. Criterion used in validation was reading achievement in the Sullivan Programmed Readers which, because of rote type of learning involved, was taken as a measure of an associative learning ability task. A test of general IQ, the California Test of Mental Maturity (CTMM), and three tests of associative learning ability were used to predict achievement in the program for three different populations of second-grade children:  middle-SES-White (N = 22), Low-SES-White (N = 25) and low-SES-Negro (N = 25). Groups were equated on means of CTMM, age, sex ratio, and pretest of reading placement. Results from multiple regression analysis found the middle-SES-White variable unable to make a significant contribution to the regression equation using IQ to predict reading achievement. Direct correlations made between IQ and the tests of associative learning ability also support the conclusion that differences of consequence are not present between SES or racial groups on this relationship.

Since criterion-referenced testing is viewed from a decision-theoretic point of view, approaches to reliability and validity estimation consistent with this philosophy are suggested. Also, to improve the decision-making accuracy of criterion-referenced tests, a Bayesian procedure for estimating true mastery scores has been proposed. This Bayesian procedure uses information about other members of a student's group (collateral information), but the resulting is still criterion-referenced rather than norm-referenced in that the student is compared to a standard  rather than to other students. In theory, the Bayesian procedure increases the \"effective length\" of the test by improving the reliability, the validity, and more importantly, the decision-making accuracy of the criterion-referenced test scores.

They pose fundamental questions which have been debated through the years. Spokesmen for both of these camps make their points convincingly, and are confident that their approaches will ultimately lead to the liberation of black people in the United States. Unlike earlier black nationalist movements and leaders, especially the American Colonization Society and the Universal Negro Improvement Association, contemporary black nationalist groups and individuals reject  emigration and concentrate on black liberation within the United States. Most of the spokesmen appear to be convinced that this goal can be achieved without the establishment of a separate nation-state within what is now the United States, but several demand partition. All of them agree, however, that some form of black autonomy (separation) is an essential first step in the movement for black liberation. It might lead to greater political awareness among blacks, and thereby promote greater solidarity. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The basic problematic issue confronting us in the study of black American writers and literature is that of determining whether we can identify the factors which conduce to the development of given social role conceptions, since the latter determines intellectual and artistic orientations to reality. In general, the problem is that of ascertaining the extent to which these roles are the consequences of common socialization or of concrete social relations. Once we have identified a writer's social role, we expect a convergence in stylistic orientation between his and that of other writers who possess similar role conceptions. Analysis proceeds by empirical inquiry into the variety of structural contexts within which writers are located from one historical period to another; and  identification of the process by which the writer's social role is an outcome of given types of structural and historical locations. In general, the issue is that of the greater degree of instability of the literary artist's role, which is the consequence of its weak institutionalization in modern American society. By treating the issue of intellectual and social role this way, the sociology of knowledge achieves sharper differentiation of the occupationally problematic mandates in which these roles consist, and clear perception of the variety of references to which such roles are oriented.

As part of a preschool project for culturally deprived children in Ypsilanti, a community on the fringe of metropolitan Detroit, Michigan, the Parental Attitude Research Instrument was administered to a group of middle-class white mothers and a group of lower-lower class Negro mothers. A comparison of the two groups revealed that the sub-scales in two factors had the highest significant differences in means between classes. The first, Approval of Maternal Control, replicated previous work. The second, Maternal Anxiety, was unique to  this study. While Brofenbrenner's &quot;drift down&quot; theory and Kohn's &quot;occupational orientation&quot; theory seem applicable to the findings, the authors believe that the oppressive conditions of poverty found among this Negro culturally deprived sample may be an equally potent explanation for differences in the two factors. This study gives indications that the findings of attitudinal investigations involving a white working class employed population cannot automatically be transposed to a deprived Negro population. Unique factors appear to be operating in these lower-lower class families which do not appear elsewhere. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"How does a psychotic mother affect the emotional development of her child? Studies have found that mental illness in the family and intra-family conflict are important concomitants of neurosis, but most studies have failed to link the child's experiences with a mentally ill mother clearly with later development of a similar mental illness. Our own studies of released mental patients led us to an examination of their &quot;parenting&quot; roles, and from there into the question of the genetic transmission of schizophrenia. We began to study the genetic theory of mental illness, specifically, the transmission of schizophrenia. The study's comparison samples were distributed as follows: 57 children of welfare recipients, 24 children of convicts, 50 children of matched controls, and 51  children of random normals. Since the genetic theories of the transmission of schizophrenia are of concern in this report, our analysis centers on children of schizophrenic mothers. Children of welfare recipients are used to control for stigma and &quot;official&quot; poverty, children of matched socio-economic status control for &quot;normal&quot; urban poverty, and children of the randomly selected sample to tell us what &quot;average&quot; urban children were experiencing during the 15 years from 1956 to 1971.

        "description":"The major instrument employed in the evaluation of the functioning of the bilingual mini-school was an observation schema developed by the evaluators over a two year period. The major purpose of the observation scale was to develop a dynamic feedback system or process. Second, it was felt that it was important to obtain a direct measure of the processes going on in the classroom. In such a way it appeared possible to evaluate pupil learning, teacher and pupil behavior and interaction, methods and techniques employed, and the utilization of paraprofessional time. It was hoped that observations of the teachers associated with the school would occur bi-weekly, where the observers would be in the classroom for an entire instructional period, and that the observations would be  representatively placed. In summarizing the results of the evaluation for the 1971-72 academic year, the program has proved successful in many aspects of its functioning, while at the same time not meeting many of the specific objectives of the program. The area which proved most successful was classroom process and progress, which is the most crucial aspect of the program. Pupils learned, were motivated, and demonstrated concrete academic progress. On the other hand the program itself may have been overambitious in stating some of its objectives outside of the framework of the instructional component. (Author/JM)",

The primary objective of the program is to reduce the adult-pupil ratio to better meet the needs of each child. To this end, an educational assistant, working five and a half hours per day, was to be assigned to each kindergarten class, and to first and second grade classes on the basis of one assistant for each 28 children for 60 percent of the children in each grade. Sufficient teachers were to be assigned to reduce the teacher-pupil  ratio (not class size). The added adults were to make possible a greater degree of small group and/or individual instruction. The educational assistants were to assist teachers in developing improved attitudes, skills, and habits in accordance with specific objectives. This entailed aiding the teacher in instructional, supervisory, monitorial, clerical, and administrative duties. The educational assistants were also to be residents of the community in which they worked, and thus were to provide a vital link between the homes, schools, and communities served by the program.

The general objective of the program is to establish rapport between the school and the parents, anticipating that better communication will prevent problem students from dropping out of school. Family assistants contact parents of students referred to them by school personnel. They communicate to the parents the nature of the problem, kinds of assistance available from the school, and what they may do to help their children. They also arrange appointments with professional school staff when indicated. The selection and screening of the staff is conducted by the individual  high school administrations. The family assistants are recruited from the target neighborhoods and serve 20 schools throughout the city. They work four and one half hours a day, and when home visits are not possible in the daytime, evening or weekend visits are arranged and made. There are 85 family assistants included in this study. The major conclusion of this study which also included over 1,000 student subjects, 180 parents, 48 high school professional staff, and two supervisors, is that the School-Home Contact Program has been associated with lower absenteeism, tardiness, and school dropping out.

Programming is individualized and accomplished manually through the  use of course cards to limit and balance registration. Reports issued at the end of each phase indicate student progress according to a &quot;mastery,&quot;&quot;pass,&quot;&quot;incomplete,&quot; or &quot;no credit&quot; code.

Students who presented behavior problems were most often referred. Of those students referred, about three quarters received services. Students who  received services demonstrated significant academic improvement. The attendance records of students, already relatively high on the pre-measure, showed no significant improvement. While students who received services improved their attitudes towards school, the learning process, and their teachers, they did not change their attitudes towards their school-mates. Teachers judged that the referred students' classroom behavior had also improved. Although students, teachers, and principals all valued the services, the services were less successful in influencing the learning environment of the schools. (Author/JM)",

The basic skills are still important, of course, particularly for the younger students. A wide range of student  decision-making includes a choice of adviser, teachers, classes, activities, and educational goals. Many individual and small-group activities occur rather than large groups of children doing the same thing at the same time. Students have the opportunity to interact with students of various ages and backgrounds for different activties. Outside resources such as art centers, businesses, and factories are used extensively, particularly by the older students. The design of the Open School includes three types of areas: quiet, semi-quiet, and active. There is a large resource area serving as a library. Strong involvement of parents is encouraged.

Called the Directed Learning Program (DLP) it comprises at present 2342 students who are from five to 12 years of age. DLP uses the concept of non-graded, multi-aged units (within a range of one to three years) of children grouped together in 26 &quot;Learning Families.&quot; In most cases, there are four units to a family. Each family is guided by a learning director and has an average of four educational aides working with all the classrooms in the family as needed. Each home-based unit has its own teacher. The aim of the Directed Learning Program is to  individualize education by tailoring it to the needs of each child. It was assessed in regard to whether DLP students made significant gains in reading and math during the school year; the quality of the DLP reading curriculum and mathematics curriculum; and the attitudes of the community toward DLP. In order to find out how the DLP students performed in reading and math, the Metropolitan Achievement tests were used. These were administered before and after the school year. Also, questionnaires were given to a random 25 percent sample of students to measure self-concept and attitudes toward school. (Author/JM)",

A random sample of 200 seventh and eighth grade pupils drawn from two of five public junior high schools in a midwestern community served as the selection pool for this study. From this pool, all students living in one parent families were selected (N=50), and paired on the basis of sex, age in years, socioeconomic status, and race with control \"mates\" from two parent families. Both subject and control groups responded on scales which assessed overt and covert acceptance/rejection of teachers. These were included within a questionnaire containing a number  of items pertaining to their school. The students responded to items ranking: (1) the extent to which they \"got along\" with their teachers; (2) how interested they felt their teachers were in their doing well in class; (3) whether they felt their teachers were consistently fair or unfair with them; and, (4) whether they felt teachers used grades as a mechanism for revenge. The findings of the study showed a divergence between the overt/covert attitudes of children from one and two parent family structures; the incidence of one parent families is great enough to warrant further research for the development of theory.

The major emphasis of the program was to return suspended pupils as soon as possible within a ten-day period to the regular school instruction. The stated objectives of the program were as follows: (1) to provide continuing instruction of a special nature with the hope of improving skills in reading, mathematics, and social living, as well as in other subject matter areas; (2) to work with the family of each student in order to create a partnership of involved concern;  and, (3) to manifest such interest in each student that a return to school with the hope of success is possible on a part-time or full-time basis. The evaluation design had two principal components: (1) a description of the project's implementation in each of the instructional settings in terms of the objectives specified above; and (2) determination of the effectiveness of the project in the attainment of those objectives outlined both generally and specifically in the project proposal.

        "description":"This study reports on attitudes and opinions about matters of concern to young Puerto Rican men in a small city in New England. There is considerable variability of expressed attitudes within the population, and the goal of this study is to discover situational correlates of this variability. Through participant observation and by review of ethnography of Puerto Ricans, four themes were determined to be topics of interest and continual conversation to young Puerto Rican men in Milltown. These themes are: getting money, displaying masculinity through sexual behavior, dealing with conflict and discrimination, and adjusting unstable plans for residence. All men of working age place a very high priority on finding a job. Reported attitudes on these four themes varied considerably.  Observational data and the literature on immigrants suggest that length of residence and place of initial immigration are probably important factors determining variability. But these factors do not account for the data reported here in any simple or straightforward manner. Short-term residents appear to be more assimilated and more satisfied with Milltown than are long-term residents. Length of residence coupled with economic factors produce attitudinal contrasts among those men who have immigrated directly to Milltown. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The study presented here was designed to further the understanding of black student performance in biracial, academic settings. The purpose of the research was to assess the association between black students' perceptions of prejudice among white instructors and grade deflection (discrepancy between grade expected and grade received) in the respective courses. The first hypothesis was that there is a positive relationship between perceived instructor prejudice and incidence of grade deflection. Another hypothesis asserted that perceived prejudice is also positively related to grade deflection distance. The setting for the research was a Southern integrated university in one of the 20 largest cities in the U.S. Approximately 10 percent of the student body of just over 20,000 is  black. During the Spring of 1971, all black students enrolled in sociology and anthropology courses completed questionnaires which provided the data for analyses. One hundred and ninety black students were asked their perceptions of racial prejudice among their respective instructors during the previous calendar year. Significant relationships were found between perceived instructor prejudice and both incidence of grade deflection and grade deflection distance. The controlled introduction of additional variables did not significantly alter the relationship. (Author/JM)",

The number of pupils who have participated in these projects has fluctuated somewhat. The greatest percentage of the State enrollment participating in projects was in 1968-69. Since that time, the percentage has decreased significantly. This was due in part to the fact that school districts were complying more with the regulations of the ESEA Title I legislation by serving only those pupils exhibiting the greatest need for special attention. The data collection instrument which provided the information for  this report was the &quot;Annual Information Report of Programs Funded Through ESEA, Title I Regular,&quot; Examination of the reporting instrument used by local districts revealed that the districts were moving in the direction of defining pupil objectives. For purposes of reporting data on the 1971-72 ESEA Title I funded programs in Texas, a sample of districts was used. The sampling framework was based on the average daily attendance of school districts. (Author/JM)",

All activities suggested are structured so as also to meet the requirements of Federal support programs.  The activities outlined for immediate and future implementation together constitute a comprehensive five-year plan by which maximum impact can be achieved cost-effectively in a minimum amount of time. Problems underlying each suggested activity have been identified, tentative time schedules have been suggested, and resources--both internal and external to the District--have been recommended for the planning and implementation phases of each activity.

        "description":"A literature survey is undertaken for the purpose of identifying and examining cultural differences between black and white Americans, with a major focus upon the black lower-class Northern urban-dweller. Major emphasis is placed upon the institutions of the Negro family and religion, as being moderator variables which help to account for various aspects of the black culture and which are in part a reflection of the culture. Some of the areas of culture difference emphasized are the problem of identity and many of the values associated with work and the Protestant Ethic and puritanism: the value of work as an end in itself, the importance of time, attitude toward authority, lack of competitiveness, ability to defer gratification, and lack of motivation to increase education and  income, The second part of the paper examines the literature relevant to social class distribution and the role of skin color and other criteria of social class membership. Value difference between members of the various Negro social classes are also looked at. The paper stresses the importance of empirical verification of the findings reported in the presence of a highly dynamic change process taking place within the black community. Investigating the problem of whether the problems of the Negro are of a class or of a race type requires multi-variable approaches. (Author/JM)",

This is undertaken longitudinally and regionally. A final section discusses some of the problems endemic to carrying out research in the black community in the light of the changed orientations following in the wake of the black power movement. Throughout the paper, emphasis is laid upon the difficulty of drawing valid conclusions about the movement as a result of the rapid change of the black community. The time required to collect and analyze data is  often too long to permit the publication of valid findings. Indicative of this problem is the report itself. There is here virtually no discussion of the Black Panther organization and its effect on the black power movement. This gap, of course, reflects the lack of published data descriptive of this group. Such studies undoubtedly are in progress, but without them, no statement of the black poser movement can be considered as being totally up-to-date. (Author/JM)",

The present field guide may be useful to persons undertaking such studies. No research program or methodology proceeds without a general meta-theory. We therefore describe some general attributes of the present theoretical framework and some general relations between this framework and the procedures and tests made in the study of subjective culture. The present field guide presents the essential points of the theoretical framework and a  discussion of the methodological issues, together with explicit statements and examples of the way subjective culture data might be collected in different cultural settings. It is hoped that the treatment of the methodological issues is sufficiently detailed, here, to allow other investigators to do similar work with cultural groups, or in settings which are easily available to them. The main examples of this field guide were taken from a study of black and white interaction in job settings. The appendices include the questionnaire employed in a study of black and white subjective culture. (Author/JM)",

A \"level of abstraction\" theory, which predicts importance effects, holds that values, norms, roles, and facilities (specific means for reaching goals) form a level of abstraction hierarchy, from most to least important in producing conflict. A second hypothesis was that the race of a stimulus person would be important only in the determination of relatively intimate behavioral intentions. Complex stimulus persons differing in all combinations of race (black-white) and same-opposite values (highly abstract), norms, role beliefs, and facilities  beliefs (least abstract) were constructed. Hypothesis one was partially supported; a clear level of abstraction effect was found but facilities beliefs controlled more variance than expected. This operated in addition to a proportion-of-agreement affect. Hypothesis two was not supported; a race main effect was observed only for superordination-subordination scores; in addition, race interacted with values, norms, and roles to determine evaluation scores. Results were discussed in terms of the perception of goal interdependence versus contrience. (Author/JM)",

The research presented in this document provides what appears to be such a paradigm. It involves the presentation of intercultural conflict to subjects, under standardized conditions. The responses that the subjects make can be analyzed to determine the effects of different kinds of training on modifications of such responses. This study has several foci: (1) to explore the importance of level of abstraction of disagreement on interpersonal attraction; (2) to examine the importance of the sequence of agreements and disagreements; and, (3) to explore a paradigm which can be used in comparisons of intercultural  training. The elements of subjective culture may be organized according to their level of abstraction: At the highest level there are values and at the lowest level there are specific beliefs about the means for reaching specific goals. Intermediate between these two levels are other elements of subjective culture such as norms and roles. One reason for the possibly greater importance of the more abstract of the disagreements is that when there is a disagreement at a high level of abstraction, it automatically implies disagreement at all other levels.

All subjects were paid volunteers, recruited from business or social service agencies in the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area. The multi-trait, multimethod validation strategy was employed to evaluate two methods of measuring: (1) the valence (evaluation) of job and job-seeking outcomes and behaviors (previously elicited from similar samples), and (2) the perceived probability of obtaining five direct outcomes of each of five job-seeking behaviors.  It was expected that, because of discrimination and lack of work-relevant skills, the black samples (especially the black hardcore unemployed) would see work and the job-seeking environment as essentially unpredictable situations, where effort is not related to reward. This effect was predicted to hold for the white hardcore as well, but to a lesser degree. The white working class was expected to see work and job seeking as highly predictable environments, where effort is strongly related to reward. (Author/JM)",

The middle-class black population was of insufficient size to include, however. Value preferences were factor analyzed separately for the two sets of groups. Five composites of values were found to be shared by these two sets of groups. These were interpreted as: (1) the good life; (2) pleasant working companions; (3) balance and adjustment; (4) artistic creativity; and, (5) religiousness. The two sets of groups were then considered together and their mean preferences for these value composites compared. When the ten groups of subjects were  combined according to criteria of either race, sex, or class, class was found to differentiate groups more than race or sex on all but the religiousness composite. Middle-class groups showed significantly higher preferences for the first three composite values, and black groups showed significantly higher preference for the fifth. The fourth (artistic creativity) did not show significant differentiation. Discriminant function analysis showed that when the optimal combination of the value composites is considered, the greatest differentiation of the groups on the discriminant function is obtained when groups are combined on the basis of class.

        "description":"Operation Hospitality was a program started 4 years ago to bus children from all black inner city parochial schools to all white parochial schools, largely suburban. The first phase of an overall evaluation of the program involved the attitudes of the participating student populations. The second aspect of evaluation which was planned involved an evaluation of teacher attitudes in the participating schools. This was interrupted in the light of a more immediate expressed need. Several messages were coming from principals and pastors in the black sending-schools indicating their black communities did not want the busing to continue. As a result of these concerns it was decided to study parents' attitudes, both those participating and those not participating in the program to  determine how they felt about it and its values to black children. The total sample was 93 parents with children in Operation Hospitality and 56 parents with no children in Operation Hospitality. The data was collected using personal interviews. The interviewers were all black; four women and one man who lived in the inner city or taught in inner-city parochial schools. Experienced research analysts read the interviews and described the significant patterns of attitudes and feelings and sought answers to the research questions. (Author/JM)",

Subjects were 158 educationally disadvantaged boys from the Harrisburg Middle School. The &quot;Vocational Development Inventory,&quot;&quot;Picture Interest Inventory&quot; and the &quot;Pennsylvania Occupational Questionnaire&quot; were used as pre- and postmeasures. The VLT program also included GWWCG. Since significant differences did not occur between the VLT and GWWCG groups, this study did not support the additional expense of visual literacy techniques which required the purchase of cameras. Both the VLT and GWWCG groups made significant gains compared to the traditional program. These  significant gains indicate the importance of structured, well planned field trips which require pupils to answer key questions in writing, as well as of other appropriate learning experiences. Such field trips were made with definite purposes in mind. These purposes had been made clear to the pupils. Also the written follow-up exercises provided learning reinforcement which apparently contributed to a significant gain in occupational awareness for educationally disadvantaged pupils. (Author/JW)",

        "description":"Two century-long goals in education have been pursued in this country: (a) growth in the average number of years of schooling completed, and (b) a reduction in the historic rate of school failure in the elementary and secondary schools. While in the past the two goals were closely compatible, it will not necessarily be true in the future. The two goals now imply strategies at two separate locations in the education system, neither of which need any longer enhance the other. If goal (a) is to be accomplished, then most of the future expansion that takes place in the average number of years of school completed must take place among persons who have already completed high school. If goal (b) is to be accomplished, there must be a reduction in the educational disadvantages which  separate children of different social backgrounds early in their school experience. While goal (a) focuses on those who have already completed high school, goal (b) continues to focus on those who have not, and in all likelihood will not. It is of course possible to simply transfer goal (b) to higher education, whether or not it is attained at the elementary and secondary levels. However, as they are now defined, meeting both of these goals will mean, at least temporarily, an increase in funds devoted to each of the two parts of the education system. (Author/JM)",

Almost all were black and this report focuses on them alone. On the assumption that many health needs among adolescents in Harlem are not being met, and that innovations in providing care will be required to meet those needs, the three major objectives in this study were: (1) to assess the physical and emotional health status of adolescents in Harlem; (2) to determine their utilization of available health care services and their needs for medical care; and, (3) to make recommendations for more effective provision of health services.  Personal interviews were conducted in the adolescents' homes by specially trained survey interviewers who were matched to their respondents for both sex and ethnicity. The interviews dealt at length with adolescents' current health status--physical and emotional; utilization of medical and dental services; personal health practices; and attitudes toward health and toward the medical care they had received. All young people who were interviewed were offered a free comprehensive medical examination.

        "description":"This study traces the origin and development of the Cardozo Model School Division, an area of Washington, D.C. having 17,000 poor children. Why did this particular reform shift in aims and alter shape between 1963 and 1972? Three factors played a major role in determining the direction reforms took. First, the particular reform perceptions of policy-makers; second, how each participant conceptualized goals, strategies, and consequences of reform; and third, the policy-making power of each participant to convert ideas into operation. While the push for change came from outside the system, the Superintendent controlled policy-making. His views on the school's role, poverty, and the goals of reform shaped the initial direction the Division took. The subsequent character of the  reform seemed to be a reflection, in part, of similarities in Model School Division administrators. But explaining the direction traveled solely in organizational terms would be simplistic. Reformers, for example, lacked common goals and strategies for changing schools; moreover, they did not consider the organizational consequences that would flow from their particular agendas for change. They felt that reform could be achieved easily and quickly. Thus, this institutional study of one effort at reform traces the interaction between reformers and school officials, to explain why a reform became what it was. (Author/JM)",

The models developed covered the following: (1) language aspects of culture; (2) motivational patterns rooted in culture; (3) culture impacted learning style; (4) time orientation; (5) patterns of family relationships; (6) cultural sexual aspects; (7) folkloria; and, (8) special rites and customs. Each model was based upon a systems approach flow chart and specified student need, objectives,  media, and criterion measures. The Director submitted these eight models to eight representatives of different cultures for rating. The models were scored by their raters for \"applicability,\"\"implementability,\" and \"cultural acceptability.\" Kendall's coefficient of concordance was then applied to discover the degree to which the raters were in agreement with respect to the terms Excellent, Good, Fair, and Poor, as applied to the models. For the models in total and for the factor \"implementability,\" there was agreement in the worth of the models at a five percent level of significance.

The legislative and administrative statements of program goals have been studied. Staff members of the administering agencies have been conferred with frequently. Reports from those agencies' information systems and recent national evaluations of the programs discussed have been read. Even so, serious deficiencies in data, coupled with noncomparable program objectives, prevent the achievement of the kind of comparative cost-benefit analysis which was hoped for. Benefit data was seldom accessible, and programs often account for costs quite differently. A framework for comparison of programs with similar objects was developed. This report does  make some recommendations, relating both to broad national policy for Federal youth programs and to specific research needs. No two programs serve quite the same population, nor do they emphasize quite the same objectives. Some grouping by objectives was necessary to permit even limited comparisons. The categories used here are skill training, work support and experience, and recreation. A total of twelve programs are reviewed and evaluated. (Author/JM)",

The fact that more and more of these students are attending high schools and colleges will accelerate these demands. The demands are not only to reinforce their own ethnic heritage, but also to educate the dominant majority in the realities of a true history; that is, through economic development and land expansion, the United States inherited a diverse citizenry whose potentials and contributions still require recognition. All institutions, particularly institutions of higher education, can either re-examine traditional white elitist beliefs and create real and equal opportunity, or risk that violence which increasingly has  become the dominant instrument of social change. In meeting the instructional needs of Chicanos, both in the public schools and institutions of higher learning, standards must be reassessed regarding achievement and IQ test, admission and academic requirements, and teaching competencies for both pre- and in-service teachers. What is needed is not fewer standards but better standards. Teachers--particularly culturally deficient teachers--need training to work with linguistically and culturally distinct students.

Speaking a week before the first meeting of the 1970 conference, he reviewed a series of preliminary forum reports which contain a number of constructive recommendations, as well as a trenchant, critical analysis of present programs and institutions affecting children. Among the issues overlooked by these reports is the insurance of the immediate implementation of the conference's recommendations. The delegates are urged to insist that a representative group from the conference be formed to call on the President personally while the conference is still in  session, and seek his public support for implementation. They should get an agreement from this administration for immediate funding of an action committee, with an office in Washington and staff picked by this conference, to speak up for implementation of its findings; to get a Children's Advocacy Center created now, with money, before leaving town. They should let this be the first White House Conference ever to focus on creating a legislative strategy for implementing its findings. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The purpose of this report is to draw on the American experience as a guide to policies, research, and experimentation in other countries who belong to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. This review of compensatory education in the United States tries to give some impression of the changing social conditions that were related to such a movement, of the variety of ideas and theories that lay behind the development of particular educational approaches, and of the range of programmes and projects that has been set up. The projects described represent only a small fraction of the schemes tried out, but they are in general either those that are most well known, or those which have embodied innovation of particular interest. We distinguished three broad  strategies of change. We looked first at changes within the school, particularly the development of new curricula, and the extension of formal schooling to include younger age groups. Secondly, we examined change in the relationship between the school and its setting; and thirdly, we outlined projects that had adopted a very different conception of the relationship between school and community than that traditionally held. The aim of this type of programme was to integrate schools racially or socially where the communities themselves were not integrated. Within these three broad strategies, we have traced the developing pattern of ideas. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Black workers have been moving up the occupational scale in recent years, away from the labor and service occupations and toward white-collar, craftsmen, and operative jobs. In 1960, two in every five black workers were in white-collar, craftsmen, or operative occupations. By 1970, more than half were in such jobs. These occupations are less subject to unemployment and they are better paid. The change in the occupational distribution of black workers has had the effect of reducing their unemployment rate by three tenths of a percentage point and increasing earnings more than ten dollars a week. The charts presented in this document separate the black labor force into three occupational groups for analysis: The highest paid occupations, which include professional, technical, and  managerial workers, whose usual earnings (median) for black men working full time were over 150 dollars a week in 1970; the middle pay levels, including clerical and sales workers, craftsmen and foremen whose usual earnings (median of black men working full time) were 100 to 150 dollars a week; and the lower paid occupations whose usual earnings (median of black men working full time) were 100 dollars a week or less. The charts suggest that lack of education has often been a barrier to employment in the higher paid occupations, whether required for performance of a job or not. (Author/JM)",

After large  group sessions, participants divided into nine discussion groups; each met throughout the day with the same consultants who served as resource persons and interaction facilitators. After each large group presentation, that general session keynote speaker met with a small discussion group, in order to continue the dialogue-question session that concluded some large group sessions. Consultant small group resources personnel summarized the small group sessions, and completed an evaluation form for each session.

Additional data was obtained via questionnaire from 1,059 graduates that were non-attendants. These samples were subdivided into the following groups: attendants at black and white colleges; vocational school trainees; non-college attendants; and non-respondents. Comparisons among groups were made on the variables of academic potential; educational aspiration and need; status in and size of graduating class; residence; and reasons for taking postsecondary training or enrolling in college. Performances on ACT subtests and composite were below the national average, with the highest and lowest performances in  natural science and social sciences. Highest and lowest high school Grade Point Averages were in social science and mathematics. Large numbers participated in advanced and honors courses and extra-curricular activities in high school. Level of aspiration was high. Most needed financial assistance to defray college expenses. Ninety percent graded in top half of their class; fifty-eight percent were from rural areas and small cities. If scores are submitted, non-blacks do not state race. White colleges do drain black potential. Many black seniors are unrealistic in aspiration and choice of educational major. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"In the fall of 1971, the Lynchburg, Virginia public schools began the implementation of a plan to eliminate all traces of racial segregation in the school system. All pupils in the ninth and tenth grades in the city were enrolled in one of the two high schools, and those in the eleventh and twelfth were enrolled in the other. Pupils were assigned to junior high and elementary schools in such a way that racial balance would result, and busing was employed to this end. It was not until the fall of 1971 that full integration was instituted. A major objective of the research presented in this report is to describe the racial attitudes of Lynchburg school children just as racial balance in the schools is being instituted. A representative sample was studied in February and March,  1972. Children in kindergarten and primary grades were interviewed with a picture test. Children of ages 12, 14, 16 and 18 years were tested with semantic differential and social distance scales. As age increased, black respondents moved toward a more favorable rating of their race and a less favorable rating of whites. The findings suggested a modification of the normative theory of racial prejudice by supporting the presence of multiple rankings of racial-ethnic groupings, depending on who is doing the ranking.

Working within a community-based child health care agency in Washington, D.C., the Parent Participation Reading Clinic offered an innovative model for providing remedial educational assistance to low-income educationally handicapped children through involvement of the child's parents or older sibling as a &quot;home-instructor&quot; in the teaching process. Thirty-eight elementary school children (19 experimental and 19 match control) participated in the study over an eight month period. As a group, the experimental children who participated in  the program showed significant gains over the matched control group on eight month re-evaluation on the California Test of Basic Skills, vocabulary and comprehension reading sub-tests. The results indicated no significant positive effects among experimental subjects for increasing IQ scores as measured on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. Significant results were found for the within group reassessment of the Wide Range Achievement Test (reading) and Dolch Word List Test. The general findings of this study are interpreted as supportive of further development of this alternative compensatory education model. (Author/JM)",

Specifically, the present phase of this ongoing investigation focused upon Marines assigned to five correctional facilities in North Carolina and Southern California. A 10-member team of behavioral science consultants tested two pilot 48-hour courses with 111 subjects at Camp Lejeune and Camp Pendleton. In 1972, two more sessions having 12 4-hour learning modules were tested, as well as 11 learning modules for an administrators' course. Pre-and post-testing of attitudinal modification with four evaluation instruments utilized analysis of variance by Osgood's semantic differential technique. The  statistically insignificant results indicate that assessment of learning experiences should focus on the measurement of behavioral consequences rather than the subjects' value changes. Suggestions are given for extending research, inservice education, and pilot projects in the areas of military justice. A wide range of tables presents the data. (AG)",

The project began by collecting data on the sample as they entered Grade 10 in 1966 and has continued by re-interviewing the sample at the end of Grade 11 (1968), Grade 12 (1969), and one year after graduation (1970). Data from the most recent interview was examined to determine which factors influenced a young man to select the alternative of military science instead of finding a job or continuing his education. From the data, it appears that even prior to entrance into Grade 10 many young men are keyed to the choice of advanced education after high school. Such a choice is  highly predictable from aptitude and family background. The same is not true for work or military choice; these choices were adopted only in the later years of high school and then somewhat reluctantly. There were almost no background characteristics distinguishing enlistees from those who took jobs. In addition to discussing the plans, attitudes, and behavior of young men from 1969-70, the monograph also contains an examination of some of the issues surrounding the debate over an all-volunteer armed forces and an indication of the feasibility of attracting volunteers to such a force using various incentives.

Investigated and included in the content are such topics as: (1) The Nature of Change, (2) Historical Perspectives, (3) Private Arrangements, (4) Public Policies, and (5) New Directions. Findings and implications include: (1) A recognition by the Federal Government that the sine qua non for a conducive environment for stimulating productivity changes is a high level of continuing employment for the  economy, and (2) There is little prospect for success on the part of either private or public manpower policy directed to facilitating the adjustment of workers affected by productivity changes except against a background of a high employment economy.

The following fields are discussed separately: (1) agriculture, (2) home economics, (3) business and office education, (4) distributive education, (5) trade and industrial education, and (6) technical education. These conclusions were reached: (1) Vocational and technical education, as essential parts of a modern public  curriculum, should enroll from 500 to 1,300 secondary and out-of-school youth and adults in a vocational education center, (2) Vocational education programs deserve the support of business, industry, and the public, (3) Suburban and rural communities should join together to provide a sufficient student base and tax base for vocational education, and (4) Residential programs are preferable for sparsely populated areas, as opposed to a comprehensive program pattern for large cities.

It was felt that the need for Negro police officers was more than symbolic, and recommended fair representation in the agency that regulates their everyday life. Minority officers can provide a special competence in dealing with minority groups, as well as in helping to reduce stereotyping and prejudice of both blacks and whites. A brief questionnaire was sent to each county sheriff and major city police department throughout the state, inquiring about their employment practices, number of white and black officers, and percentage of crime committed by Negroes in their jurisdictions. Survey results, tabulated and correlated, indicated a definite pattern  to the likelihood of Negro police officers being employed according to the environment and size of a jurisdiction, its degree of urbanization. As expected, rural jurisdictions had made the least progress in integration. Some county sheriffs showed hostility toward the study. It was recommended that the proportion of Negroes employed in Texas law enforcement be increased, particularly in the rural areas where the need is greatest, through active recruitment efforts. Suggestions for modification of recruitment techniques and for reassessment of duty assignments are given. (MF)",

This study concerns identification of the kinds of readily available data which may be used to predict student success in Pennsylvania area vocational-technical schools and to differentiate among the vocational-technical curriculums. Such data should be useful in helping students to decide whether or not to attend a vocational school and what course options would be most appropriate. A literature review showed no universality of methods, although it appeared that the use of a multiple set of predictors was preferable to single predictor variables. The purpose of this investigation was to analyze existing information about a sample of vocational  school students in order to determine whether there were data readily available to school counselors which would be useful in planning study at the State vocational-technical schools. Only information already available in the junior high schools was used. Findings from analysis of the data caused the researchers to question the advisability of using the data studied for State selection methods. Further research is suggested to investigate both these and other data, if school planning is to make use of the study findings. Findings are appended in 28 tables. (MF)",

Human services work, helping others, is particularly suited to many older persons. This type of work calls for education and training for those who had worked in different areas. College programs should be developed for older workers engaged in second careers, with credits granted for life experience, work experience, and previous learning in order to sharply decrease the length of time required for a degree. Entry points into education or careers should not be limited to prescribed age groups but should be open to those of all ages. Unlike the traditional picture, the growing pattern will be for persons to be engaged in a variety of  activities throughout their lifetimes. School and work should be seen as operating in tandem and not sequentially. Of course, efforts to combine work and study are not new. What is new is the concern for adults as well as for youth, the use of various equivalency devices, and the particular interest in human services jobs.

Innovative training concepts for Social Health Technicians employed by Gouverneur Clinic include the importance of the subprofessional in a flexible service delivery system, an emphasis upon basic education as well as specific skills training, and the assignment of responsible community service work as opposed to routine liaison work with professionals. The Public Service Careers Program of the Human Resources Administration was constructed from the NHOP model, as well as the parallel position of Case  Work Assistant within New York City's Department of Hospitals. The Mobilization for Youth's contribution to the &quot;new careers&quot; concept is indicated by the interest of voluntary hospitals in establishing similar training programs and new occupations within their institutions with the guidance of the NHOP staff.

Data on nursing attrition rates imply that institutional factors need to be identified, studied, and remedied to decrease student withdrawals and prevent scholastic failure.

        "description":"Developed as part of a project designed to provide a synthesis of the literature and practice relating to the career education of disadvantaged students, this review is intended to inform teachers about research and techniques for motivating disadvantaged students. Section I discusses the nature of motivation and describes the basic human needs that motivate individuals, including psychological needs, love needs, safety needs, esteem needs, self-actualization needs, and the desire to know and understand. Section II offers an overview of research relating to such basic motivation constructs as self concept, locus of control of reinforcement, aspirations, and self-actualization. Motivating techniques such as the use of rewards and successes, feedback and reinforcement, setting  goals, and creative thinking are explored and evaluated in Section III. Some conclusions drawn from this review were: (1) A major portion of the motivation research is directed toward ascertaining the global self-concept of the disadvantaged student; (2) Changing the locus of control of reinforcement from external to internal appears to be a primary objective of career educators; and (3) The development of sub-goals to achieve a long-range aspiration is more effective than are long-range goals.

Community data to support the rationale for vocational education in the school system provided a base for a needs assessment survey of individual business firms and students to show the need for specific vocational education offerings. On the basis of these surveys, three pilot programs were initiated to demonstrate to the community what type of teaching and curriculum were being planned through the project. Curriculums judged best for the Manchester area were produced and a long-range plan for  the total program implementation was prepared, calling for gradual incorporation of vocational courses in existing schools and the planning of a separate vocational school.

During its third year of operation, several developments significant for LEAA took place and are summarized in this report.

The aims of the study were to: (1) assess the educational advantages and disadvantages of both the metric and the customary systems of units, (2) determine the current usage of metric measures in U.S. schools and trends in that usage, (3) find the ways in which education would have to change as the U.S. accommodates to increased worldwide use of the metric system, under either a laissez-faire or a planned  approach, and estimate the costs of the changes, and (4) make recommendations of ways in which to take best advantage of these changes. Methods of achieving curriculum changes needed in view of increasing metric usage are discussed.

These dimensions will be: (1) sectors and subsectors, (2) educational programs, (3) regions where feasible, (4) locales and school types, and (5) students. As the second of two papers prepared to delineate MISOE's design, these planning considerations are detailed separately for the secondary school sector, the post-secondary programs, and various adult vocational education and manpower programs.  Separate weighting procedures may be required for economic and noneconomic data, due to their distinct roles in MISOE. Although the multidimensional distribution of students demands stratification control, the program size limits the amount of control possible.

Intended to provide a rational process of resource allocation for vocational education as a competitive social service agency, MISOE contains both a static and a dynamic component. Static MISOE, composed of an interrelated census and sample data system which includes the stipulation of program costs and performance objectives for each local education agency in the state, is intended to be the basis for accountability for all of Massachusetts' vocational education programs. Various cost effectiveness analyses will be carried out for static  MISOE, which will be integrated with existing Department of Education and Regional Board of Community College information systems. In the summer of 1973, dynamic MISOE, consisting of dynamic simulation and mathematical programing, will be developed. MISOE will be implemented statewide by Massachusetts' Division of Occupational Education during the 1973 school year, with the assistance of five local education agencies.

There is an enormous distance, however, between the perception of a social problem and the formulation of a policy or program. In this paper, social problems are examined from a different perspective than that of the USOE with the intent of helping further revisions of the models and in framing more reasonable expectations concerning the consequences of their implementation. Three problems that constitute the policy and programmatic context for the models are: (1) the perceived failure of the schools to provide people with marketable skills, (2) failure to transmit or develop habits, dispositions, or attitudes that make a good employee, and  (3) alienation from the social employment system. Not every issue connected with these problems can be influenced by policy nor are all these problems educational or have their source in the educational system. Section I of the paper provides a discussion of the policy context while Sections II and III examine the ways in which the models deal with: (1) attitude toward work, jobs, and employment, (2) issues of tracking and comprehensiveness, (3) value of introducing time as a variable, and (4) the process of career development.

Information retrieval and analysis for MISOE necessitates: (1) translation of inquiries into analytic hypotheses, (2) the selection of pertinent MISOE subsystems, data types and levels, analytical operations, and models, (3) performing the analyses and interpreting their results, and (4) reporting the results to the inquiry  source. Discussions of general analysis requirements and considerations precede the detailing of specific analytical models and algorithms for MISOE, such as multiple linear regression and factor analysis.

Several court cases which have dealt with this problem under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 have also been analyzed. Some conclusions were: (1) National unions appear to exercise a great deal of constitutional control over local union practice as far as qualifications for admission as a journeyman are concerned, (2) The union constitutions, both national and local, provide very  little information on qualifications for apprenticeships, (3) Local unions have more autonomy in establishing their apprenticeship requirements than they do in establishing the qualifications for journeyman membership, and (4) The Federal Courts have set aside admission and apprenticeship requirements which have been discriminatory and have decreed that all such requirements must be objective in character and nondiscriminatory.

Data-gathering instruments and existing data from the colleges and institutes were examined to determine existing commonalities and central issues. On the basis of this examination, a followup instrument was developed and pilot tested with a sample of 210 former students, which included non-degree, degree, diploma, and certificate students. Data from the pilot study were analyzed, and as a result of the analysis, modifications were made in several questions. It was concluded that the revised  instrument accurately reflects the concerns of North Carolina's community colleges and technical institutes and will provide data both for institutional self study and for central long-range planning.

Conducted under the direction of the California State Department of Human Resources Development (HRD), this incentive-based system utilizes job agents who are rewarded according to improvements in client's earnings brought about by their services. Further, incentive pay points are received by the job agent at the time clients are placed and again one year after placement. The number of pay points will depend on the extent to which the job agent exceeds the original goals established for the client. In addition to the incentive feature, the system also provides management with the means for making  inferential judgements of what attributes successful job agents possess. The methodology used to develop the incentive pay system can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of a variety of manpower programs. (Author/SN)",

A significant result of this study was that 73 percent of the civilian graduates were working in related occupations 3 to 6 years following graduation. The correlations of the test scores and  training related variables to the criterion variable (occupational persistence) were low, and the relatively small amount of variance in the criterion did not imply precise relationships. However, this study seems to indicate that it may be possible to describe certain characteristics of industrial cooperative students and their training that are related to occupational persistence.

The author discusses the taxonomy of the markets and the predicted differential impact of experience. Internal labor markets are classified according to the assumption that structure is related to mobility. In manorial structure, vertical stratification and ports of entry imply that a worker is likely to remain with the firm. In guild structures, which are usually highly unionized, horizontal movement between firms is expected to be high. The open market is unstructured and competitive. Manorial firms provide training specific to the firm. Guild structures usually employ skilled craftsmen whose skills are related to the industry rather than  the firm. The unstructured market is characterized by the absence of skills and investment in the employee. Data used in this study were derived from the Social Security Administration work history file. Equations and graphs were constructed to display the results of the study. (MF)",

The methodology used to estimate the size and composition of the supply population for public employment programs--how many persons would have preferred public employment had that option been available to them--is outlined. The availability of jobs in a given public employment program, as well as the potential labor supply, is considered. The supply of applicants is positively related to wage differences but negatively related to differences in hours. Changes in public policy both in and out of the manpower area may also influence the supply of applicants. The methodology  employed in this research is sufficiently flexible for adoption to various program characteristics. (MF)",

A quality adjustment, applicable to all labor markets, was incorporated into the model in estimating the supply of volunteers. It was assumed that the greater the excess supply of volunteers, the greater the average quality of recruits. The adjusted supply curve took into account variations in the average quality of those who enlisted in the Air Force as a correction for unobserved variations in the excess supply. The increasing elasticity of supply with regard to the military-civilian earning ratio indicates that the universal military pay increases enacted by Congress will provide for an adequate supply of Air Force volunteers. Direct estimation of a supply curve on  the observed values for employment by excluding a quality adjustment, when in fact excess supply exists, leads to an underestimation of the true elasticity of supply. Five tables present the data. (Author/AG)",

Twenty-four of the 46 students enrolled in the college, 11 to work toward completion of a high school diploma, and 13 in an occupational field.

Funded under Part C of the Vocational Education Act of 1969, this innovative in-home program was intended for unskilled, socioeconomically disadvantaged adults unable to participate in formal, centrally located training programs. Of the 25 lessons originally planned, the 12 initial lessons are presented in this report, including learning activities,  resource lists, behavioral objectives, and content outlines. Positive feedback from program participants, an appended program evaluation performed by an independent researcher by means of interviews using a survey instrument, and a comparison of participant scores with scores achieved by those in a state manpower training program revealed the program's success. A detailed program rationale precedes the 12 lessons and a discussion of the program's results. (AG)",

Those in education are faced with deciding whether technology shall serve man or man will be forced to be a cog in the machine. In determining the function of education, the decision will be a value judgement involving one of these two choices: (1) Continuing to plan educational programs to meet short term occupational and economic goals, or (2) Changing the curriculum and focusing on long term goals based on a vision of man and his purpose. In the field of education, specifically industrial arts, great store is placed on working relationships with industry and suppliers. The focus of attention in industrial arts has not been on man as an individual but on man as part of the industrial process,  together with the crafts and materials essential to the economic and technical process. There are those in the field of education, including industrial arts, who see an urgent need to reexamine the present posture and move toward a greater concern for man. The challenge for education is to aid man in understanding technology, if he is to control it. As a first step, all levels of education must forego the occupational-professional orientation of teaching and reemphasize education in the truest sense of the term. (Author/SB)",

The general concept of an internal labor market refers to the process of pricing and allocation of manpower resources with an employing organization and rests upon the hypothesis that these processes within an organization are very different from the external market processes. The three markets analyzed differed in several respects which might be expected to influence internal market characteristics. One market consisted of a single department of a steel company, another the managerial-professional-technical positions in a large insurance company, and the third the manufacturing labor force in a  computer and office equipment manufacturer. Application of a Markov model provided empirical characterizations of these markets useful for manpower allocation processes of employing organizations. However, the range of internal labor market characteristics observed among firms raises doubts about the utility of a single conceptual model of this market. (MF)",

A residential community is one aspect of the innovative, experimental approach to be utilized in Model IV. Both the career education program and living in the created community are envisioned as providing the rural disadvantaged with learning experiences that have relevancy to improving their employability. Guiding the research and program development activities in Model IV is a working constitutive definition which views career education as the aggregate of processes by which an individual acquires and develops the goals (values), abilities  (knowledge, attitudes, skills, and behaviors), and motivation to: (1) contribute to the growth of himself, his societies, and his life style, and (2) make prudent use of his individual, his societies' and his life-style systems' resources and energies. From this definition, it is easier to translate the constructs into operations than it is with other definitions of career education. (SB)",

Career education has the potential for unifying the curriculum, better meeting individual and societal needs, and dealing with some of these social, psychological, and economic issues. For the past several years, a group of researchers and graduate students at the University of Minnesota have been conceptualizing a K-12 career development  curriculum to facilitate self-development. In the curriculum, which is based on the life stages of Super's career development theory and the developmental tasks associated with those stages, career development is viewed as a process, a part of human development that occurs whether we do anything about it or not. Career education is seen as the teaching and counseling interventions which facilitate that development. Major dimensions of the curriculum and a listing of developmental tasks for various grade levels are included. (SB)",

In addition, a survey of existing facilities was conducted and recommendations for building modifications were made by the surveyors. It was concluded that there was a definite need for vocational-technical education. Job opportunities warrant the teaching of more skills which would require additional classroom space and an additional building, for which there are not sufficient funds at this time. It was recommended that a general  cooperative education program be introduced for the 1972-73 school year, with the funding coming from the state and local level. Sample questionnaires are appended.

        "description":"Summarized in this publication are the statistical highlights, conclusions, and implications of a study designed to analyze the shifts in Mississippi's occupational and industrial employment structures, and their interrelationship during the period from 1950 to 1960. Using data obtained from the United States Bureau of the Census 1952 and 1961 reports on employed personnel, occupational changes were analyzed in terms of the two components: industry effect, and occupational mix effect. Influences of the components were investigated in terms of their forms, quantities, and directions both in gaining and losing occupations. Findings revealed that the total occupational change involved increases in professional, managerial sales, craftsmen, operatives, and service workers at the  expense of farm laborers. This seems to indicate that the Mississippi economy demands new and changing skills and therefore its work force must be continuously trained to keep pace with the transitional economy such as is present in the U.S. if it is to achieve its social and economic goals.

Job satisfaction of persons occupying different positions on incorporated farms in Wisconsin was studied to determine the effects of the farm variables on the individuals. A high degree of job satisfaction was found for the three occupational groups studied, although hired workers showed a lower level of satisfaction than owner-managers and hired managers. Job satisfaction was found to be influenced as much or more by goals and attainments outside the occupational area as by the work situation. Satisfaction of the hired workers and managers was affected more by variables than that of the owner-manager. Measures of job satisfaction in two  dimensions, the self-fulfilling aspects of the job and the relationships within and control of the work, are detailed in narrative and tables. (MF)",

A major responsibility of the deputyship is carrying out the promotion and implementation of the career education concept. However, this does not imply that career education and vocational education are considered synonymous in the Office of Education, for they are not. Vocational education is one necessary component. In carrying out the promotion and implementation activities, several trends will be noted concerning vocational education, including: (1) determination of  acceptable levels of performance, (2) development of procedures for determining costs, (3) assumption of placement responsibilities, and (4) more realistic and scientific long range planning. Lay advisory committees play a role in the accountability process, particularly program evaluation, but their effectiveness needs to be strengthened. (SB)",

Social pressures and expectations have been, until recently, such that women simply have not opted for jobs traditionally viewed as solely the male domain. According to a 1970 Bureau of Census tabulation, out of more than 250 distinct occupations, half of all women workers were employed in only 21 of these occupations, and approximately 25 percent of all employed women were in five occupations (secretary, elementary school teacher, bookkeeper, waitress, and household worker), which are relatively low-paying and dead-end jobs. Yet, statistics  on women workers reveal that more women are working and that the need for technical training and employment opportunities for women will expand in keeping with the changing nature of the labor force. Due to stereotyped attitudes, many women fail to take advantage of the technical education opportunities available to them. A major effort is needed to direct women into non-stereotyped educational and employment opportunities. (Author/SB)",

The numerous recommendations fall into three categories: (1) a general overview of the county's education program, emphasizing career and vocational education as priorities for meeting educational needs, (2) suggestions for specific division of administrative responsibilities, and (3) outlines of administrative tasks for each administrative position. An appended interim evaluation report presents, in condensed form, the conclusions reached by outside consultants after interviews with local and state staff members. These conclusions are  that six career education areas need administrative reorganization: (1) non-instructional support personnel, (2) research and evaluation support, (3) guidance area, (4) developmental task forces and program supervisors under the Director of Instructional Programs, (5) the Director of Vocational Education and Cooperative Education, and (6) program implementation, through Area Directors and principals.

        "description":"As a joint endeavor by the Departments of Defense, Transportation, and Health, Education, and Welfare to demonstrate military resources and techniques which are utilized in combat, the Military Assistance to Safety and Traffic (MAST) program was pilot-tested in 1970 at five military bases. Undertaken to explore the feasibility of utilizing military helicopters and military paramedical personnel in responding to civilian medical emergencies, particularly highway accidents, MAST was essentially an operational test where military resources of known capability were meshed with local Emergency Medical Service systems, without the provision of additional resources and without administrative difficulties. Program effectiveness and community acceptance varied for each site. Numerous  photographs illustrate the text, which includes extensive recommendations and conclusions. The following topics are focused upon: (1) a medical evaluation of the program, (2) background and actual experiences of the program, (3) the civilian viewpoint, (4) military aspects, (5) helicopter considerations, (6) cost considerations, (7) legal aspects, and (8) future activity.

The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), and the Langmuir Oral Direction Test (ODT), were administered to subjects on different days. An analysis of test findings revealed that two of the poverty samples, the Manpower and Vocational Training, were found to be homogeneous. They resembled the WAIS normative sample on means, standard deviations, and correlations, whereas the other group, the Neighborhood Youth Corps, differed significantly. Possible explanations for these discrepancies may be chronological age,  sex, or race Evaluations of these factors were not conducted. The study does show conclusively however, that poverty status alone does not guarantee below-average scores on intelligence tests. (SN)",

The environmental constructs were based on responses dealing with vocational decision making by students and the influence of their family members. A major construct was the environmental press to succeed, modified by the burden of low self-esteem influenced by the family background.

Questionnaires were mailed to possible employers in government and industry to obtain information about their monitoring systems for discharge products and their requirements for technicians, especially as to detailed educational level and vocational training. Responses, a disappointing less than 40 percent of those queried, indicated that varying majorities of the respondents considered physics, chemistry, and mathematics courses to be necessary for environmental technicians, with basic engineering, electronics, and other probable courses mentioned by  less than half. The data appeared to reflect an uncertainty about pending government regulations for pollution control; these regulations would help to determine the educational level required for environmental technicians and the job market for them. As the costs of developing and implementing a technician-training program in a community college would be considerable, it was concluded that it would be premature to institute such a program at this time.

In this monograph linear programed models are distinguished from dynamic educational simulation. When least cost is not the chief consideration and when restraints on decision making are unknown, dynamic simulation constitutes a better approach. Implementation of dynamic educational simulation is advocated on a case by case basis, with the aid of experienced consultants. Although asked to deal specifically with design issues arising while planning MISOE so that necessary levels and rates  could be obtained, the lack of examples of existing simulation models makes this activity premature. Creager assumes that there is no direct, formal relationship between static and dynamic analyses in MISOE. This document is related to VT 018 600 and VT 018 606, both developed by Creager, as well as VT 018 602 and VT 018 809.

To help develop the knowledge and skills needed to prepare effective proposals, a workshop for vocational administrators and faculty was conducted at West Chester State College, Pennsylvania to inform participants about funding sources, what is involved in applying for them, and how to express this application in writing. Of the 19 participants, six sought and were granted the college credit offered by the Workshop. In summary, it was felt that although participants were enthusiastic the workshop did not achieve most of its objectives, partly because of the  extensive flooding in Pennsylvania at that time, which curtailed sessions. While participants did learn something about proposals, most of them brought no ideas for projects and did not develop skills in proposal writing. Recommendations were made that changes in preplanning would be needed, before future workshops of this nature would be effective. (MF)",

        "description":"To help strengthen programs for developing and introducing methods and materials in the teaching of the disadvantaged and the handicapped as well as disseminating occupational information to teachers attempting to work with these groups, Tufts University conducted two team teaching seminars during the fall and spring semesters of the 1971-72 academic school year for university students and a group of inner city teachers. Methods within the courses included visitation to disadvantaged projects and special programs for the handicapped, presenting an unstructured atmostphere, and utilizing the team teaching technique. It was determined that the subject matter for a methods course was so complex that the first course barely met the need for teaching the primary methods included, and  not enough time was available for visiting, evaluating projects, and teaching in the field. Analysis of the second phase has emphasized that methods, materials, occupational decision making, and the development of a sense of development in these youth are important. The combination of inner city teachers and regular university students proved to be very valuable as were the curriculum-related field trips to schools and agencies of the disadvantaged. (SB)",

The Administration and the Congress believe that a sustained, systematic investment in research, development, testing, and diffusion will substantially improve education. The NIE aims at solving or alleviating American educational problems, advancing the practice of education, strengthening the scientific and technological foundations of education, and building an effective educational research and development system. The unevenness of research-based educational development will be stabilized, and failure factors minimized, by a task force on career education, which is  responsible for monitoring existing programs and planning new ones. The NIE will focus on reducing youth unemployment and helping adults redirect their career patterns. Major NIE efforts are on four model programs intended to develop career exploration and awareness: (1) the school-based model, (2) the employer-based model, (3) the home-based model, and (4) the rural residential model. Future emphasis will be placed on quality evaluation of career education products, post-secondary education, financing career education, integration of services and curriculums, labor market research, and greater partnership between employers and the education system.

The objectives were to: (1) develop instructional materials and procedures using a programmed instructional process; (2) train several groups of administrators, counselors, and teachers who are involved in on-going manpower programs to use an IMT System in basic remedial education; (3) develop prototype materials for a mechanical occupational cluster, which will integrate the prevocational and occupational plan with basic remedial education in a total IMT System; and (4) conduct a continuous monitoring of the staff training program during development, assess its  impact, and provide observational analysis factors which appear to be related to the success of program implementation. The products and materials prepared during the project were either completely developed or modified to fit in the IMT System. The IMT System staff were provided individualized staff training courses in the use of basic remedial guides in establishing individualized basic remedial instruction in Learning Resource Centers; in developing a diagnostic profile for each trainee; in developing an individual training plan for each one; and in evaluating the progress of the trainees. The products prepared were printed materials (5 guides and 1 programmed lesson) and tape-slide modules. The findings of the project clearly demonstrate that it is possible to train staff to establish  and operate an IMT System within a short time by use of individualized instruction. (Author/DB)",

The program described is in the content area of mathematics of life insurance. The students for whom the materials were developed are adults in insurance and related professions who are engaged in full-time work activities at the same time they are continuing their education. The design and evaluation of the program took into account cognitive, affective, and operational variables. The program is the Chartered Life Underwriter Diploma Program (C.L.U. Diploma Program) of the American College, which consists of 10 semester-length courses each of which culminates in an examination. Two data bases were used--one from biographical data and  one from test data. As a result of context and input evaluations, it was decided to develop an individualized learning experience with the following key structural elements: specifically stated behavioral objectives, criterion referenced test items, guidance information and learning activities designed to elicit performance of objectives. The new mathematics of life insurance modular learning experience is designed to supplement existing study aids from the American College. The program consists of seven booklets, one for each of the seven assignments in the mathematics of life insurance section of C.L.U. Course 1, and one specially indexed audio tape. The test used for evaluation of the program consisted of two forms of an examination prepared by the program developers, and the  California Multiple Aptitude Test in Numerical Reasoning. (DB)",

The sample of farmers reported are representative of a class of low-income farmers who were supposedly left out of the benefits of the Green Revolution; and (2) it attempts to generate a nexus of opinion between the &quot;development economist&quot; and the &quot;communication specialist.&quot; The study data presented show that both &quot;communication&quot; and &quot;economic&quot; variables are necessary for two main aspects of diffusion: (1) changing farmers' cognitions of new varieties of seed, and (2) influencing innovativeness. It  was also found in this study that any program designed to diffuse agricultural innovations must first concentrate on creating awareness among smallholders in general; and (3) the smallholders live in such a situation that cognitive changes in knowledge must accompany economically desirable innovations in order to have a rapid pattern of adoption. For guides in designing future programs, the following are suggested: (1) Channels of communication between research outlets and farmers should be strengthened so that smallholders are kept informed of available innovations; and (2) Since interpersonal contacts are especially needed to reach the smallest farmers, extension efforts should be enhanced.

Two ethnically different communities were chosen in the most southern state of Brazil: Garibaldi, of descendants from Italian immigrants, and Candelaria, of descendants from German immigrants. The data were gathered through application of a questionnaire to stratified random samples, representing 4.2% of the farm owners in Candelaria and 7% in Garibaldi. The central assumption of the study was that the larger farm owners occupy the highest socioeconomic positions in the agrarian society and, therefore, have the best opportunities for economic development as indicated by correlates such as income (economic variable), education and mass media (social variables) and  alienation (psychological variable). The study findings show that the economic and social development of rural communities, irrespective of ethnic origins, appears to depend on structural variables, such as the land tenure system. In terms of strategies for development, it is suggested that the inequalities that seem to exist in land ownership be corrected. Tables provide the study data, and a bibliography is included.

The two communities compared were in the Southern United States. Twenty-one actions in each community were classified into five major interest fields: agriculture and land use, industry and business, health, services and welfare, and education. Associations were classified as to either coordinating or limited interest, according to their participation in several interest fields. Associational interlock was defined for the purpose of the present study as the degree to which the coordinating associations in a locality in  the community field jointly participate in community activities. Results of the study showed that Community A, which could be characterized as following a somewhat autonomous action style, lacked coordination and integration of its community structure in relative terms as reflected in its leadership structure, as well as in associational structure. Community B was characterized by a highly coordinative leadership and associational structures and a unified community field. It had a larger number of coordination associations more intensively participating in activities in several interest fields, a highly interlocking associational structure, and a central coordinating association with great influence on community activities.

The four study groups were composed of the following: Group I--88 cases, felons who completed VR services successfully; Group II--88 cases, felons who failed to complete VR services; Group III--112 cases, felons who completed certain  vocational training programs successfully through the Adult Correctional Facilities; and Group IV--126 cases, felons who needed but received no vocational services. Most of the parolees were white, single males; their mental level was usually average or above; they had usually completed at least one year of high school prior to imprisonment; they were usually imprisoned for a crime such as burglary, larceny, robbery, or auto theft; normally they had no known history of drug abuse or mental illness; and generally they were first offenders. Major findings of the study were: (1) of the Group I parolees, 76% succeeded on parole; (2) of the Group II parolees, 32% succeeded on parole; (3) of the Group III parolees, 58% succeeded; and (4) of the Group IV parolees, 47% succeeded. Study Items used  and Data Form for the study are included. (DB)",

EMLC studies are designed to determine if behavior modification techniques are feasible and provide viable alternatives to aversive control. In the Token Economy (Ecology) Project, inmates are rewarded for socially acceptable behavior on the institution farm, in the basic education component, and in the experimental cellblock. The Contingency Management study, the basic education component, uses a system of contingency contracting covering units of programmed instruction prescribed for each subject on the basis of his pretest score on the Tests of Adult Basic Education. Baseline data for individuals and the group were  collected during this report period. Phase I of Correctional Officer Training was completed; it involved completion of self-instructional booklets. Followup studies for 1969 and 1971 are under way. The Lab is also involved in preparing and disseminating a number of measurement and training instruments and publications and technical consultation, conferences, seminars, workshops and other professional activities.

The study grew out of an effort to locate part of a group used in a 1947-57 longitudinal study. A subsample of 320 was chosen from the 2,344 respondents already located. The tracking methods studied were mail, long-distance telephone calls, community visits and public records. First-class letters resulted in the receipt of return postcards from slightly less than half the subjects. Long-distance telephone calls were successful for about 80 percent of the sample in each community. Community visit tracks were carried out only for those persons not located by telephone. These were initiated at post offices, residence neighborhoods, schools, and the last known employers. This method was more costly  than others but led to the location of almost all the rest of the subjects. The use of public records was successful for just 19 percent of the marriage license tracks, 8 percent of the real estate transfers, and 4 percent of the will registrations. All persons located through public records were also located with other tracks. The various techniques led to current addresses for all but two of the persons tracked. (Author/KM)",

The overall objective was to determine if an attitude scale could be used to differentiate between non-corporate timberland owners with definite plans for recreational development and those without such plans. An attitude scale was constructed from a collection of statements sorted by 50 judges along a six-point positive-negative continuum. Data were collected in interviews with 100 landowners. Results showed that: (1) owners had favorable attitudes toward recreation, but the recreation plans of approximately 1/5 of them involved vacation home subdivisions rather than recreation opportunities for the general  public; (2) about half had no plans for development of recreation opportunities; (3) 2/3 of the remaining 30 percent appeared to be willing to consider development of income-producing recreation facilities; (4) knowledge of the concept of multiple use was not related to plans for recreational development; (5) current policies of allowing visitors were not related to recreation plans; and (6) landowners with plans for recreational development were statistically more frequent foreign travelers than landowners with no such plans.

Many of the change agent failures can be traced to their lack of credibility. They are not trusted or respected because farmers have learned that many are not technically competent. Good agricultural extension agents should be able to: (1) test and adapt new technology; (2) diagnose the farmer's production problems; and (3) teach the farmer how to correct problems and increase yields. In 1964, the International Rice Research Institute launched a series of rice production training programs to develop these competencies. Teams of rice workers from 24 nations have been prepared to adapt these approaches for training hundreds and thousands of  their colleagues, who in turn teach farmers. These programs, which emphasize intensive on-the-paddy experience, have been successful because they are based on the precept &quot;you can't teach what you don't know.&quot; A program to produce livestock production specialists is underway. Over the past two years, two crop production specialist training programs have been completed. Several obstacles must be overcome if this type of training is to spread: (1) the need is not readily admitted or recognized by decision makers or potential trainees; (2) returned trainees have difficulty organizing programs to train others; (3) more research must be conducted and decisions made about the training process.

Three major areas are discussed: (1) the definition of development; (2) the major approaches to the study of development--equilibrium models (behaviorists, psychodynamicists and diffusionists) and conflict models (structuralists--non-Marxist and Marxist); and (3) problems in analyzing relevant variables--confusion of structuralism with determinism,  conceptualization, and the representativeness and validity of data.

A 7-county development Federation in South-central Montana was studied. A pre-structured interview schedule containing 93 questions was administered to 102 leaders. Individuals most active in the Federation were later interviewed more intensively. Hypotheses of leader influence are discussed. Attitudinal variables were recoded and combined until three response sets were identified, forming the leader sub-groups: (1) the satisfied traditional, (2) the anti-government pessimist, and (3) the development-oriented activist. Leaders typically exhibited characteristics of one or more types. Twenty-nine percent  were combinations of the satisfied traditional and the development activist. Twenty percent were \"pure\" satisfied traditionals. Fifteen percent were \"pure\" development activists. Power scores were computed for degree and type of influence exerted; higher power scores were held by satisfied traditionals and development activists. It was concluded that: (1) a pluralistic leadership structure with a variety of attitudes prevailed; (2) leadership structure was dominated by satisfied traditional tendencies, which will have to be modified for development to take place: and (3) no evidence was found that the federative arrangement was functioning effectively.

Study of the effects of longevity revealed that the  near-retirement group (36-40 year interval) seems to have more priorities in common with the youngest group (1-4 year interval) than with the middle-aged group (16-20 and 28-32 year interval). Resources considered to be most inadequate were those associated with improving specific ministerial skills. Significant differences were recorded in learning priorities in each age category from synod to synod. Suggestions for further study are made. Appendices provide contents of the questionnaire and data summaries. (KM)",

These individuals are difficult to reach through the press, radio, or TV; don't become involved in Extension programs or farm organizations; and are often highly suspicious of Government and Government programs. The recommendations concern: (1) tailoring the message for rural  low-income and ethnic groups; (2) selecting and using mass media; (3) selecting and using other means of communications, including person-to-person, community forums and organizations, direct mail, etc.; and (3) making information a part of day-to-day regulatory program operations.

The definition of \"development\" utilized in this paper is \"a process or set of processes characterized by (a) the consequence of general sustained economic growth, and (b) sets of natural, human, technological, cultural, financial, and organizational conditions.\" Two questions will help expedite the utility of this definition: (1) Development for whom?--who is paying the costs and who is receiving the benefits?; and (2) What  is the simultaneous or sequential mix, balance, or combination of conditions which is associated with the structural change or changes which have occurred? Some advantages of the definition are described, including the noteworthy one that the discipline of sociology may receive the greatest benefit or advantage from usage of the definition. (DB)",

Although there is a wide variety of meanings attached to the term &quot;program&quot; in adult education, it has been stated by Thomas (1964) that all programs consist of two factors: (1) the relationship between participant and agent (usually oral); and (2) a variety of relationships with a variety of factors in the environment, all chosen and planned by these two parties. Four overlapping factors suggested by Verner (1964) as the basis for designing the learning experience, provide a simple model which could be elaborated to suit various situations and levels of  planning: (1) determination of needs; (2) identification of educational goals; (3) arrangement of learning tasks; and (4) measurement of achievement. Each of these steps is discussed. The cited program in Rhodesia, in the rather isolated Gokwe district, is based on cotton production. The foundation of the program is close liaison between specialists, extension staff, and the Cooperative Officer, and consists of the following essentials: a program that is technically sound and economically attractive; close cooperation of Extension and Cooperative functions; locally adapted recommendations, simplified to the essentials; emphasis on staff training (technical and team work); annual programs of main events; and monthly work program prepared one month in advance from the farmer/field worker  level upwards.

Data were collected by mail questionnaire, personnel records, and statistical reports from the employees. Of the questionnaires, 355 usable ones were returned. The major dependent variable was an attitude score calculated for each participant by assigning values to answers to eight questions relating to various aspects of low-income work. Results of the data analysis show: (1) that most of the personnel had a generally positive attitude toward low-income work, with older employees having higher attitude scores; (2) employees who spent most  time with low-income audiences had higher attitude scores; also administrators and rural development agents had significantly more positive attitudes toward low-income work; (3) the employees felt that their first audience priority was rural communities; low-income farmers were rated second, followed by commercial farmers; (4) nearly all felt that specialized training was needed; (5) a small majority felt that each Extension worker should have responsibility for low-income work; (6) there was general agreement that such work will increase during the next five years; (7) generally, home economics subjects were listed as most important; and (8) the employees felt strongly that educational programs were the most effective strategy for assisting low-income audiences.

The nutrition knowledge of 120 homemakers was determined before any training in nutrition, immediately after eight weeks of training, and again four months later. The personal interview method was used to collect the data. The same questions regarding the kind of food and drink the homemaker had during the 24-hour period prior to the interview were used in each interview. Results of the study showed that participation in the Expanded Nutrition Education brought about changes in food habits and knowledge of  homemakers, but the observation four months later indicated regression in most cases. The structured organizational approach used by Extension in conducting the program proved to be a profitable experience for the Extension Aide. (DB)",

Adult education has been a strong factor in raising the expectations of the disadvantaged, and it has also been a tool in meeting some of these new expectations. Two educational concepts that grew in importance during the decade were career education and lifetime learning. Adult education is organized in many communities in connection with the elementary and secondary school system; however, in most communities employers, churches, unions, military service schools, colleges, public libraries,  correspondence schools, community agencies, and a wide variety of professional, proprietary, and voluntary institutions also provide adult education. It assumes such varied forms as courses taken for credit, informal instruction, on-the-job training, correspondence study, and discussion groups or demonstrations at home, in the shop, in the field, or in the office. The college or university has provided most of the training for adult educators. Among the estimated total population of 130,314,000 persons age 17 and over, 10.1% participated in adult education, and 8.1% were full-time students. Excluding full-time students, of the 119,719,000 eligible, 11% participated in adult education. Women outnumbered men in the population, but more men participated in adult education. A common concern  for effective methods aids in a predicted massive growth in adult education. (DB)",

        "description":"Two studies sought to investigate two levels (high vs. low) of guilt-shame arousing appeals in the areas of adoption and needy children on expressed guilt, attitudes toward the communicator and communication, information retention, and intended and actual commitment to various behaviors. Subjects were 68 adult men and women drawn from Presbyterian Sunday schools and women's clubs. A tape recorded-slide format served as the means of presentation. The high-guilt arousing message vividly portrayed the undesirable physical, emotional, and intellectual consequences of neglection on unwanted children. The low-guilt message was similar in content and length but utilized less \"emotional\" language and pictures. Both messages concluded with identical recommendations. The manipulation  checks on guilt arousal were significant in the predicted direction. No significant differences were obtained between conditions on information retention or attitudes toward the speaker or the communication. Generally low guilt was found to be significantly more effective in persuading subjects to comply with the recommendations of the message for intended but not actual behavior. (Author)",

A new curriculum for secondary schools is presented, the result of a three year project in public schools. Employing a combination of practicum and seminar experiences in series of classes in psychology as the basic pedagogy, high school students were shown to develop both the requisite skills as well as experience personal growth. Classes in peer-counseling, cross-age teaching, and nursery school work formed the practicum. The resulting curriculum gives promise of promoting psychological growth for secondary school students. Both statistical and clinical evidence indicated significant psychological  development on the part of the teenage psychological practitioners. References are included. (Author)",

The purpose of the study is to offer an introduction to research on the antecedents and consequences of early school leaving for planners, practitioners, and researchers who are concerned with education. &quot;Antecedents&quot; of early leaving comprise those factors outside as well as inside the school that seem to be related to departure from school; &quot;consequences&quot; of early leaving deal with the extent to which post-school characteristics of individuals differ according to their level of schooling. The major point of reference in the survey is the Third World; relevant materials from  developed countries such as the United States are included primarily to broaden the horizon of possible research designs, methods, and hypotheses that might be considered in formulating new studies in the Third World. The authors carefully note that the concept of early school leaving will vary by system and setting; therefore, what constitutes &quot;early&quot; leaving will have to be viewed in reference to the particular country where the study is conducted. A major portion of this bulletin is devoted to the research abstracts which detail time and location of the study, objectives, methods employed, and the findings. (Author/SES)",

The second segment of the study was an exploratory rather than definitive investigation of the general question given above.

Institutional factors that serve to exclude women from participation in post-secondary education include admissions practices, financial aid practices, institutional regulations, types of curriculum and services adopted, and faculty and staff attitudes. Situational barriers that deter women from participation in further education include family responsibilities, financial need, and societal pressures. Dispositional barriers that prevent women from continuing education include their fear  of failure, attitude toward intellectual activity, role preference, ambivalence about educational goals, level of aspiration, passivity, dependence, and inferiority feelings.

The data indicate that Human Relationists may be overstating the utility and benefits derived from increased worker participation in organizational decision making; and their belief in the necessity for workers to  self-actualize in their jobs is predicated upon assumptions which seem to ignore the influence that social class has on the motivations of workers.

To obtain information about problems of adaptation common to undereducated men, and to obtain information about knowledges and skills such men may not have, an achievement test/attitude questionnaire was administered to a large group of enlisted men. The instrument was designed to assess men's attitudes and skills with respect to financial, health, insurance, legal, and interpersonal problems. Men who took the test ranged in education level from less than 8 years to over 16 years. Higher educated men performed significantly better on the achievement test than did lower educated men, but high school dropouts (education level 9-11  years) consistently scored lowest of all. When attitude scale items were categorized as reflecting good vs. poor attitudes, poor attitudes decreased as education level rose. The results showed a strong correlation between errors on the achievement test and percentage of poor attitudes. (Author)",

In addition the study was concerned with the nature of the guidance model which was actually implemented in the schools: developmental, remedial, or a combination of these two. As an evaluative tool, the study results can be examined to determine both the degree of model implementation and model effectiveness as well as provide useful feedback to counselor educators who  prepare graduate students to perform specific guidance functions in elementary schools. Although the study included a group of elementary school counselors from just 17 Minnesota schools, the elementary school guidance movement is a relatively new phenomenon and thus theoretical conceptualizations, model building, and experimentation set forth here could be useful to anyone concerned with the development of elementary school guidance programs.

One of these differences is the greater reluctance on the part of females to support the use of institutional violence as an instrument of public policy. This paper empirically explores the components of sex-role identification, parental socialization, and socio-cultural milieu as independent hypotheses using a design which separately measures the effect of these on male-females attitudinal differences toward institutional violence. A systematic analysis of male-female differences in mean attitude scale scores revealed the following: (1) females, as hypothesized, are consistently more opposed to nuclear wars and capital  punishment, more pacifistic, and more concerned about world survival; (2) none of the previously hypothesized explanations of sex-role differences alter this pattern. The authors conclude by suggesting alternative conceptual approaches to the investigation of the genesis of male-female differences in attitudes toward institutional violence. (Author/WS)",

Specifically, the report addresses itself to the effects that school attendance laws and child labor laws have on the incidence of youth offenses and delinquency. It was further limited to the investigation of delinquencies in males, ages 12 through 17. Field case studies were conducted in ten locations, followed by literature searches and analysis of statistical data from federal and local agency reports. The study results do not support the hypothesis that a relationship exists among youth offenses and delinquency, compulsory school attendance laws, and child labor laws. Other conclusions of the study were that: (1) Youths' behavior with respect to school  attendance and employment was not influenced by child labor and compulsory attendance laws; (2) Youths who are out-of-school and out-of-work are likely to become greater delinquency risks; (3) Enforcement of a child labor law that closes most employment opportunities for youth does not necessarily result in an increase in youth crime; (4) Youth crime does not appear to represent hostile or aggressive acts, such as crime against persons. Recommendations for government action are included that relate to education, employment, and other problems of youth. (Author/SES)",

Research design was of the test-retest variety; specifically, I.Q. tests, three achievement tests, and a student attitude instrument were administered just prior to the student's first contact with the school psychologist and again at the end of the school year. Results were not significant at the .05 level; thus, conclusions could not be drawn. In addition, school records were checked and these revealed a significant increase in student attendance coinciding with the semester when they received  psychological service. Finally, a descriptive evaluation of the program was achieved through questionnaires. While teachers felt that psychological services were of some value in dealing with particular learning and behavior problems, school administrators responded that the program was more than satisfactory in fostering good teaching morale, in developing a good teaching-learning environment, and in contributing to out-of-school activities.

Particularly since World War II, as our industrial society has become more highly organized and as transportation facilities have increased, there has been a tremendous increase in the number of families moving from one place to another. How these moves from known neighborhoods, schools, and communities are made and to what extent the children are taken into consideration in planning often make a great difference in the psychosocial development of the child. Long- and short-range planning for such a move is discussed in light of the child's own self-understanding and, more specifically, what parents, teachers, and children can do to make the change of school and community less  difficult. Other sections of the bulletin include helping migrant children learn while they continue to move, integrating the new child into the classroom, and a reading list that includes books related to a wide range of experiences met by children in new school situations.

A discussion of the barriers to the emergence of a women's movement and a reconsideration of some current explanations of the emergence of a movement at this particular historical moment provide some context for a study of the social development of feminists. Criterion for selecting study subjects was self-identification in terms of commitment and action; in all, 54 women were interviewed, all of whom were students at the time of the interviews and were from predominantly middle class homes. The composite picture of the contemporary feminist which emerges from the research is described in terms of three non-exclusive and  sometimes mutually reinforcing models: the bright academic, the father's girl, and the early independent. While the process of becoming a feminist was most often a gradual evolution rather than a sudden conversion, most of the respondents were able to cite specific events and periods during their lives when they became conscious of their oppression as women.

        "description":"Black psychologists have indicated that new methods which are culturally aware, appropriate, and relevant are needed to deal with mental health problems in the Black community. In this study an attempt was made to determine if university student trainees (one Chicano, two White, eight Black) who had no prior experience could be trained to observe, assess, and intervene in the classroom environment using contingency management techniques. These Classroom Behavior Analysts (CBA's) were trained in a controlled environment and were then placed in either a Headstart class or an elementary school; in all cases the CBA and the target, problem-behavior child were of the same race. All five hypotheses were generally supported: (1) existing behavior procedures would have to be modified for  cross-cultural use; (2) many teachers would alter their definitions of problem behavior when asked to operationally define it; (3) many behaviors labeled as problem by white teachers would be viewed as non-problem by Black CBA's; (4) Black teachers would be more successful in modifying Black Children's behavior than were their white counterparts; and (5) old children can act as their own mediator and thus effectively function to modify their own behavior if they so desire.

The authors review the method of token reinforcement, with its subsequent problem of maintaining token-induced behavioral changes in nontoken environments. Second, they look at systematic desensitization, concluding that researchers are far from even a reasonable tentative answer to why the procedure works. A third area of research explored is the Masters and Johnson therapy, whose treatment package can be construed as behavior therapy. Finally, aversive therapy--avoidance or aversive \"conditioning\"--with  homosexuals is reviewed, with special emphasis on the work of Feldman and MacCulloch. The authors feel that the very essence of behavior modification is its critical and experimental stance towards the whole area of clinical psychology and psychiatry. References are included.

A validity comparison of a known extreme group with a sample from the general student population yielded a significant difference between the means of the groups. Construct validity was evaluated by first testing the differences between pro- and anti-activists on the Rokeach values scales and then examining the relationships between self value rankings of pro- and anti-activists and their perceptions of the rankings of student activists. Significant differences between the groups on self rankings were evidenced on a number of values known to differentiate activists from non-activists. Correlational data supported predictions that pro-activists would show positive  relationships between their own values and those they perceived activists holding. Anti-activists showed zero correlations between self and perceived value rankings which may have been due to lack of an extreme-activist group from the college population. The author suggests that securing such a group might lead to even larger differences between ranking as well as to strong negative correlations. References and tables are included. (Author/SES)",

Experiments were conducted which attempted to distinguish between the two. In addition, studies were conducted to assess (1) the concept of dissimulation, (2) the \"real world\" effects of fear of success in a competitive academic environment, and (3) the negative consequences which result from being a relatively successful woman. The results indicated that: the performance decrement of high fear of success in women is less robust than previously thought; dissimulation is acknowledged by women in subtle forms and under rather specified  conditions; fear of success does affect academic behavior, though nor necessarily academic performance, in the real world for both sexes; and whereas relatively successful women are perceived to possess traditionally masculine traits (e.g., intelligence), these traits are evaluated negatively rather than positively.

        "description":"The five different methods of teaching reading used in the schools of Neuchatel, Switzerland, are described in this study. Remi-Colette is the official method, approaching reading through the study of key words, then syllables, letters, and sounds. The second method, S'Exprimer-Lire (Express oneself-read), inspired by recent linguistic studies, emphasizes the phonetic approach to reading, arguing that the study of oral language is essential to learning the written language. The third approach, Bien Lire et Aimer Lire (Read Well and Enjoy Reading), stresses a mechanical reading approach, founded on letter and sound association. Accenting the spoken language, the fourth approach, the Sablier method, stresses that &quot;reading is rediscovering the oral in writing.&quot; Reading instruction  is not programmed; each student proceeds at his own pace. Je Veux Lire (I Want to Read), the fifth method, also stresses oral expression and argues that reading instruction should begin with the word, letter, or sound, but not the syllable. Phoneme study is a necessary mechanical phase of this method. Unlike the Sablier method, this approach does not try to satisfy the needs of each student; the context is imposed on the child by the teacher. (Author/DI)",

This study was designed to simulate the actual conditions of the Diagnostic Clinic at Northwestern University. The simulated and computerized child attended the clinic for the same length of time that children actually do attend the diagnostic clinic session; they were subject to similar tests, reports, and observations. The clinic staff met to plan, to develop hypotheses, to make decisions, to develop a diagnosis, and to recommend teaching procedures. At the prestaffing, the team received preliminary information about the child. At  the simulated noon staffing, the teams received computer printouts of the morning decisions and planned for two hours of additional diagnostic examinations. At the poststaffing, the teams evaluated the information they had obtained during the simulated sessions and developed a series of diagnostic decisions. The results of this pilot study suggest that computer simulation is a promising technique for the training of specialists in the diagnostic-teaching process. (Author/WR)",

The content of teacher beliefs is investigated in regard to the extent of agreement or disagreement with experimentalism. The structure of teacher beliefs is investigated in terms of the degree of open-mindedness of the teachers. Teacher educational beliefs, teacher philosophic beliefs, and the degree of open-mindedness of the two groups of teachers are compared on the basis of inventory scores on the Mann-Whitney U Test. The study finds no significant differences in educational beliefs, philosophic beliefs, or open-mindedness between the two groups of teachers. A ranking of high, medium, and low scorers on the three  inventories shows that there is a tendency for high scorers in philosophic beliefs, as opposed to high scorers in educational beliefs, to be more numerous in the experimentalist beliefs profiles. There is also a tendency for the DISTAR teachers in this study to score higher than basal reader teachers in educational beliefs and in their degree of open-mindedness. (Author/TO)",

In the second section, Maxwell H. Goldberg provides definitions of several of the central terms related to technological change and human values (e.g., \"science,\"\"technology,\"\"cybernetics,\"\"cybernation,\" and \"human values\") and discusses the present and future impact of technological change on society. In the third section, an assortment of opinions collected, by Alan J. Trachtenberg and others, as a sampling of contemporary responses to a changing world are presented. Major topics of opinions are \"technology as threat or promise,\"\"the pattern of the working day,\"\"the shape of the community,\" and \"the nature of the good life.\"  Concluding the volume is a bibliography of over 90 pages on technological change, human values, and the humanities. General divisions under which items are grouped are \"Background and Context,\"\"Impacts and Implications,\" and \"Further Resources.\" (This document previously announced as ED 036 525.) (LH)",

How familiar are they with major characters and works of Western literature? The ages of the subjects tested were nine, thirteen, seventeen, and adults. Results were analyzed according to sex and region of the country. The report includes samples of the testing devices used for each of the four major questions, some of the responses received, and some of the generalizations derived from this survey. The authors note that each question did not receive equal  assessment time, and that no one question could be exhaustively pursued in any one assessment year. They also note that the results may be interpreted in various ways depending on the reader's point of view. It is hoped that while the survey will not answer all or even many of the questions about the status of literary understanding in America, it will generate discussion and further research.

It points out that, although some major benefits may eventually arise from the writing of English behavioral objectives, \"the process bristles with problems in semantics, philosophy, psychology, measurement, and pedagogy,\" and \"there are real dangers to the English curriculum possible within the behavioral objectives movement\" if it fails to accommodate \"the humanistic aims which have traditionally been valued\" in English. Part 1 consists of a fictitious narrative concerning the problems faced by an English department chairman who must redefine English in a framework of behavioral objectives. Part 2 contains  11 articles concerning English instruction and behavioral objectives by Sue M. Brett, James Hoetker, John C. Flanagan, Lois Caffyn, J. N. Hook, Alan C. Purves, Isabel Beck, Geoffrey Summerfield, James Moffett, Donald A. Seybold, and Robert F. Hogan. A bibliography on behavioral objectives concludes the volume.

Three-, four-, five-, and six-year-old children were presented with various linguistic tasks under varied visual context constraints. Four context conditions--no visual context, a helpful pictured context, a helpful visual context acted out, and a misleading pictured context--were used in testing sentence comprehension. It was hypothesized that younger children's performance would be most affected by varying visual context and that fewest errors would result with helpful context, more with no context, and the greatest number with confusing context. The findings supported the hypothesis. In discussing the implications of these findings for language instruction (and  performing language therapy), the experimenter concludes that teaching language through context manipulation of communication demand situations may prove more profitable than present attempts to teach language rules directly.

ILR engages in studies of operations for the entire UC library system and conducts varied research and development projects in information science for outside agencies. Although ILR traditionally emphasized computer applications and other automated procedures for solving library problems, in 1971 the Institute broadened its outlook to embrace all library related problems--work underway including problems of social needs, production of library tools, investigation of library service needs, and system analysis. This report contains abstracts of completed, on-going,  and proposed research projects, a list of ILR personnel, and a bibliography of the institute's publications. (Author/SL)",

The design criteria included 1) the need for an average response time of .25 second or less; 2) an average key input rate per terminal of .5 key per second; 3) 10 percent of the connected terminals would be requiring output at all times; 4) a central memory requirement of 500 words per terminal; 5) a maximum student terminal cost of $5,000; 6) a student terminal that would be reliable and simple to operate at  remote locations by relatively unsophisticated users; 7) the development of a system that would be manageable by a relatively small staff; and 8) a hardware system architecture that would not inhibit the development of the software which was trailing behind the hardware development. The remainder of the document briefly describes the development and operating characteristics of PLATO IV. (Author/DGC)",

Since the goal-setting process implies the selection of priorities and the application of leadership by the library administration, the leadership styles and philosophies and the management techniques of these libraries were also considered. Separate summaries were compiled for observations about the public libraries of Baltimore, Brooklyn, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, the District of Columbia, Memphis, Minneapolis, New York City, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Toronto, and Tulsa. It was concluded that it is too soon to assess the overall impact of goals and objectives setting as a  management technique in large public libraries, since libraries have come to this process late and many such efforts are still in their initial stages. General observations were made on the goal-setting effort, requirements for its success, and barriers to be overcome. (Author/SL)",

A survey of public libraries was conducted in 1974 to determine if these decisions had resulted in an increase in community censorship of library materials. Since the size of the community might prove significant in its response to the Court ruling, the public libraries in each state were sorted into three groups by size of population served. One library of each size group (if applicable) in each state was then selected at random, for a total of 133. A ten-item questionnaire was constructed, and the instrument's reliability and validity was tested with a  trial mailing in February, 1974 to the American Library Association and five sample libraries. The final mailing, in April 1974, elicited 115 responses, an 86 percent return rate. The responses were analyzed by geographic region and community size. Of the 115, 108 reported no change in patron concern about library materials or about specific titles since the Supreme Court ruling. Survey materials are included. (SL)",

AIMLO is an innovative approach to undergraduate library instruction, providing on-demand, point-of-use programs about three basic library tools: periodical indexes, the card catalog, and U.S. government documents. To keep student usage of AIMLO on a strictly voluntary basis, three unobtrusive evaluation techniques were initially tried: counters on the machines to record use totals, optional questionnaires, and a telephone survey. When these results proved insufficient, it was decided to evaluate AIMLO instruction by means of a library use quiz, administered to three sections of an introductory psychology course in the fall of 1973. Section one of the  class was encouraged to use AIMLO for library orientation, section two was given printed guides, and section three received no library instruction. One week later, the unannounced quiz was administered. Fifty-two percent of the 502 students had made no use of library instruction and only 15 percent had made any use of the machines. Since the students using AIMLO scored high on the quiz in comparison to all other groups, continuation of the program was recommended. Appendixes include the questionnaires, the quiz, and the printed library guides. (SL)",

        "description":"In the fall of 1973, public, school, and college librarians in the Lowell, Massachusetts, area formed the Lowell Area Council on Interlibrary Networks (LACOIN). With a grant from the Library Services and Construction Act, Title III, LACOIN initiated library-sponsored public affairs radio broadcasting for its community. Utilizing the Lowell Technological Institute's radio station, WLTI, broadcasting began on November 18, 1973, with three hours of operation beginning at noon and incorporating three programs: public affairs/general interest interviews (Afternoon Agenda), educational philosophy and practice (School Bag), and ethnic oriented local history (Heritage). Plans were made for expanding to a full broadcasting day and incorporating several new programing concepts. LACOIN has  also initiated other library cooperation projects including a union list of serials for its member libraries. This report includes program schedules for the radio project and a list of those library and non-library agencies which have participated. (Author/SL)",

Among the goals of courseware authors are finding better ways to develop the cognitive skills of students, to shift some of the burden of routine classroom instruction away from the teacher so that more class time can be spent in more productive activity, and to learn more about the capabilities of computer-assisted instruction. Among the general conclusions that can be drawn about CAI courseware development are: (1) the importance of each individual's awareness of an involvement in the entire project, (2) the creation of fancy displays and animation does not necessarily result in more effective learning, (3) the use of student feedback in the development of  courseware generally results in a greater acceptance of the final product, and (4) courseware authors frequently see their lessons as works of art, and they frequently have highly vested interests in them. While the multiplicity of approaches to courseware development has been valuable for the PLATO project, changes in the technology of the system make it difficult to keep all authors apprised of system constraints and enhancements.

Comparisons were also made between teacher-reinforced lessons and no reinforcement, and children were questioned whether they believed additional programs would be helpful. Results showed that a large percentage of children watched the show at home, but a smaller percentage watched all six programs. Children who watched the program at school scored higher in post-test nutrition knowledge; girls scored higher than boys, and 4th and 6th graders higher than 5th. Teacher reinforcement significantly  increased nutrition knowledge. Both teachers and students evaluated the series positively.

As the adolescent matures in terms of moral thinking, the meaning of particular literary experiences may shift dramatically. According to the theory developed by Kohlberg at Harvard University, individuals in a number of different societies move sequentially through each of six moral stages. At each stage, particular literary issues are especially salient. Adolescents can be expected to move through the literature of social expectation (related to conventional moral thought), the literature of social revolt (related to the transition between conventional and post-conventional moral thought), and the literature of affirmation (related to  post-conventional moral thought). If libraries can encourage meaningful personal searches among young people, they can play a vital role in the process of moral development. (Author/PF)",

Among the early theoretical constructs thought to be important are E. L. Thorndike's concept of learning connectisms, Neal Miller's theory of motivation, and B. F. Skinner's theory of operant conditioning. Early devices incorporating those concepts included testing machines and aids developed by Pressey and Peterson in the 1920's and 1930's, and more recently by Skinner. The concept of optimization in learning systems is considered. A distinction is drawn between short-term and long-term optimization--the former having to do with the best procedures for learning a small, discrete item (e.g. how to spell a single word), whereas the latter deals with overall learning  strategies. Different approaches to the derivation of optimums are discussed. Finally, it is noted that much of the work to date on CAI has been based upon the thinking of behaviorists independent of researchers in cognitive learning fields. A closer working relationship between these discipline orientations is called for now. (DGC)",

        "description":"The effectiveness of a computer simulation model as an alternative means of teaching research methodology to students was investigated. Four sections of an introductory course on the subject were included in the study. Two were taught through the use of the simulation system, while the remaining sections were taught in the traditional lecture mode of instruction. The simulation was designed to teach skills and concepts in problem definition, hypothesis generation, sampling, research design, data analysis, interpretation and reporting, and the application of those skills and concepts via the simulation problem. Results of the study indicate that the simulation approach was very successful in terms of both attitudes and skill levels in research methodology. The data suggest that  students in the experimental groups gained additional skills when compared to the traditional sections. However, the lack of a closely controlled experimental environment suggests a number of potential caveats that should be investigated before further conclusions are drawn. (Author/DGC)",

Data acquired in the evaluation included: (1) the experience level of the participating personnel, (2) learning patterns using the simulator, (3) evaluation of the training potential, and (4) attitudes and acceptance. All personnel exposed to the GPS stated that learning was easy, and tests given the technicians after their training sessions indicated a high level of achievement. The system was generally found to be acceptable to trainees, although some  participants indicated a preference for more traditional teaching methods. The cost of using the GPS was found to be less than 10 percent of the costs of an actual equipment trainer. (DGC)",

It was concluded that there has not been a major change in the financial philosophy of pricing publications for the sales program because the Public Printers have traditionally operated on the philosophy that sales revenues should exceed full costs and although a different pricing formula was used in 1973 that formula was designed to recover the full sales program costs. It was further concluded that the GPO is now requesting appropriated  funds for costs it intends to recover through sales revenues. An analysis of the pricing formula being used by GPO and its application to specific documents resulted in the suggestion that the pricing method used may not be the most appropriate method. It was further recommended that whatever method is used should be consistently applied. (Author/PF)",

        "description":"An extensive study was conducted to determine whether California's Public Library Services Act had succeeded in its goal of improving and extending library service through the establishment and funding of library systems. The comprehensive study involved field interviews at all 20 systems; a review of system documents; a survey of reference services; and an intensive data collection effort to record activity, cost, and selected performance data related to system programs. It was concluded that public library systems in California have demonstrated a limited but constructive value under adverse circumstances. The systems have met substantial public needs for resource sharing, but inadequate funding has prevented optimal service. The funding formula used was not well-suited to  library system programs or to the objectives of the Act. After an exploration of alternative methods of providing interlibrary services, it was recommended that a top level consortium of the strongest libraries in the state be created to meet requests that cannot be filled elsewhere. Two possibilities--continuation of the present system structure or designation of regional intermediate libraries--were proposed to provide an intermediate level resource. A new formula for funding interlibrary activities would be keyed to demand for services. (Author/PF)",

To accomplish these goals Project SEIC first assessed the state-of-the-art of computer technology, validating that software packages capable of meeting Project needs existed. The appropriate packages were installed at a computer facility, while governance, privacy, and confidentiality issues were being resolved. The Project also focused on defining the problems in information dissemination and utilization, and on the relationship between these functions and the diffusion of innovations. Systems and management insights  were applied to supplement the understanding of the diffusion process originally observed by psychologists and sociologists. The Project itself was cast into a framework of planned change. A systematic program of dissemination/diffusion was developed known as RSVP (Responsive Services for a Variety of Practitioners).

Sixty-two percent of the respondents indicated that HCC programs increased their theoretical understanding of their job, 61 percent felt HCC programs  increased their job skills, and 42 percent felt their HCC experience had led to salary increases or promotions. Ninety-seven students (38 percent) had transferred to some other institution; of this group, 78 percent lost three credits or less in the transfer process.

Evening students from this group have learning handicaps which are in part the result of poor secondary education. The evaluation reported here of individualized instructional packets for the Introduction to Business course utilized three sections of evening students, with the same instructor and identical behavioral objectives for all the sections. One section utilized the individualized instructional packets, a second section used the lecture/discussion method;  while the third used the lecture/discussion method with students given the option of using the individualized materials as a supplement. The results of the evaluation, using end-of-course achievement scores as the unit of measurement, found the optional section to be significantly better than the individualized instruction section. However, the small number of students (20 percent) utilizing the optional materials makes this finding inconclusive. It is clear, however, that only marginal results will be obtained from individualized courses unless they are supported with media and personalized counseling.

After the initial period of growth (1968-1973), enrollment increases have leveled off. The Task Force suggests the implementation of educational strategies designed to maximize opportunity while maintaining educational excellence and increasing cost effectiveness. Towards that end, Task Force III sought to identify and develop contacts with groups that might benefit from current programs but are not availing themselves of the opportunity, and groups  that have traditionally been excluded from consideration in curriculum development (i.e., military, women, hospitals, penal institutions, and the middle class). Task Force IV reported on the projected manpower needs of the district and the colleges' role in fulfilling those needs. Task Force V studied various innovative and alternative educational delivery systems used by other districts and ranked them on the basis of their cost, versatility, and &quot;perturbation&quot; factors. Since computer assisted instruction was highest ranked, the current use of computers at Peralta is assessed in the appendix. (MJK)",

        "description":"Since studies show that students who have an orientation to college perform better than those who do not, this study at Mississippi Gulf Coast Junior College sought to improve the freshman orientation program by determining whether a programmed method of orientation would be more effective than the existing lecture method. To test the hypothesis that students using programmed instruction would score higher on a criterion-based orientation test than those receiving the same material in a conventional classroom setting, 102 students were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: one receiving conventional orientation, one receiving the programmed orientation, and one without treatment. The statistical evidence gained through a one-way analysis of variance of post-test  scores supported the hypothesis at the .01 level of significance. In subsequent use, while continuing to produce higher scores on objective tests, the programmed orientation has proven more versatile than the lecture method, especially in the case of late-entering students. Because it is easy to use and flexible, the programmed orientation is adaptable to an open enrollment situation. Brief reviews of the literature on freshman orientation and programmed instruction are included. (RL)",

        "description":"School counselors face identity crises since they must respond to the conflicting demands of students, faculty members, administrators, commercial and industrial interests, parents, and the local community. In order to defend themselves against public criticism, counselors must find a way of illustrating their effectiveness. Data obtained from an administration of the IRC Input-Output Analysis of Student Personnel Services (1971-73) was used to determine the performance (objectives, efforts, and outputs) of all Florida community college counselors and of Brevard Community College (BCC) counselors. The major conclusions drawn are: (1) counselors are an effective social force in educational institutions and will remain so as long as their services facilitate the goals of the  institution; (2) counselors do have an identity problem; (3) a systems approach to the management of counselor activities can be an effective tool in defining and evaluating the role and effectiveness of community college counselors; and (4) counseling is functioning at a healthy and satisfactory level in Florida community colleges and at BCC. The author recommends the adoption of a systems model by BCC counselors; such as a model will determine the results of exact services provided and will measure the benefits in relation to cost to the institution. A review of pertinent literature and several tables and charts illustrating data are also included. (DC)",

This load is used as an index of the demand for educational services and also as a guide for allocating the state's resources for educational purposes. The assumptions underlying the projections developed by the B.D.-240 are noted, and the procedures used in computing the B.D.-240 are described. Peralta District is projected to have a stable student load through 1984. However, a comparison of the projected figures with the actual figures through fall 1974 suggests that the demand  for Peralta's educational services will decline and not remain stable as projected. Recommendations are made to reverse the pattern of declining enrollments: (1) intensify recruiting efforts; (2) develop a systematic approach for provision of auxiliary services or additional classes for special interests; (3) maximize the number of graded classes as opposed to adult offerings; and (4) increase the number of Weekly Student Contact Hours generated by each college. A copy of Peralta's B.D.-240 for fall 1974 is appended. (Author/AH)",

The Plan focuses on the long- and short-range goals and objectives of the State Board for Community Colleges and the 16 institutions which comprise Maryland's community college system. Chapter I presents the Executive Summary of the Master Plan. An overview of the state system is given in Chapter II as a means of introducing the Master Plan that follows. Community college system-wide conditions, trends and projections for enrollment, programs of instruction, financing of current operations, and physical facilities are detailed in Chapter III. Chapter IV outlines the system-wide goals, objectives, and implementation strategies. The  five statewide goals are: (1) equal access to community college for all Maryland citizens; (2) expand programs and services; (3) provide geographic access to colleges; (4) continue the policy of low tuition; and (5) increase the overall cost effectiveness without impairing the quality of service. Chapter V notes the means for evaluating the degree to which the stated goals are being met. Major policy directions and actions are reviewed in Chapter VI, and individual implementation profiles of the 16 colleges are presented in Chapter VII. Charts, graphs, tables, and a map supplement the text. (Author/AH)",

An important requisite for a valid sponsored experiential learning program is an articulation agreement between El Paso Community based agencies and the college. The purpose of this research study was to measure the response of students, agency supervisors, and community college faculty involved in the experiential learning program concerning problems in communication and cooperation among all parties. A semi-structured interview questionnaire instrument was distributed to 15 members from each of the three components involved in the program. Responses were received and processed for all 45 subjects.  The results of the survey strongly favored increased communication and cooperation between agency supervisors and faculty. Agency supervisors and faculty deviated in their degree of intensity toward how and to what extent articulation between the community based agencies and the community college could be achieved. Recommendations based on survey responses are included, and the survey instrument and a list of the community based agencies participating in the program are appended. (Author/AH)",

Originally designated &quot;The Junior College of the University of Minnesota&quot;, the college was established in response to the diverse needs and abilities of the new student population which emerged during the early 1930's. The report demonstrates that the philosophy of the General College, as expressed in polity statements, attitudes, and practices of the faculty and administration during the college's first six years, was heavily influenced by the ideas of Dewey. The first part of the report is a brief explanation of Dewey's theory of individual growth and development and the manner in which this theory, according to Dewey,  should be applied in the educational process. This is followed by an inspection of the philosophy of the General College as manifested by the various policy commitments and curriculum procedures adopted by the college. Each curriculum area is examined in relation to Dewey's philosophy. The vast extent of Dewey's influence is shown, even though Dewey's name does not appear in any of the documents relating to the founding of the college. A General College Bibliography and selected Dewey Bibliography are appended. (Author/AH)",

Many community college students have not selected their occupations, thus community college administrators must make a concerted effort to provide adequate occupational information for students facing this crucial decision. A questionnaire was administered to 100 transfer program students, several personal interviews were conducted for additional information and related literature was reviewed. The data disclosed that 49 percent of the students felt that the selection of an occupation was their most difficult problem. Though 59 percent had already selected an occupation, they indicated a desire for more information about the world of work, especially  about job opportunities. While less than one-half of the students had sought occupational information at Gaston, 82 percent favored the establishment of an occupational information center. They indicated that they would use the center \"occasionally\" rather than \"frequently\" and that the best location for it would be the College Center. It was recommended that a committee of counselors and specialists be responsible for the occupational information center, which should be separate from the over-burdened guidance and counseling department.

Later they were asked to reverse their roles and assume the responsibility of the hearing examiner in rendering  fair decisions in the best interest of the general public. A pre- and post-attitudinal survey was conducted to determine the effectiveness of this technique in broadening students' insight into the whole picture of air pollution as it relates to the economy, private interest groups, and the general public. Results of the post-test reflected measurable changes in attitudes toward violating industries, reasons for establishing air quality standards, and the public hearing as a technique for collection of data.

It notes the problems and benefits of such an approach and cites five essential qualities of successful interdisciplinary teaching. The major problems of such an enterprise are: often courses are too broad; interdisciplinary mini-colleges tend to shut themselves off from the rest of the college; definition is elusive (How many credits should be granted? Is the course transferable? What requirements does the course fulfill?); enrollment requirements are difficult to determine (Must enrollment double if two teachers teach as a team?); and student-teacher rapport is threatened by too many students and more than one teacher. Although beset by these  problems, such courses and programs are beneficial: they offer an alternative to the traditional survey, introductory, chronological course; they provide opportunities for new personal and group dynamics; they expose students to several disciplines at once; and they can lead students into new fields. The essential qualities of a successful enterprise are administrative support, wide publicity, elaborate preplanning, continual emphasis on the interdisciplinary nature of the course or program, and organization around a theme or problem, rather than chronologically.

They are characterized by the merger of counseling and instruction, the lack of grades and normative student rankings, interdisciplinary coursework, student input into curriculum planning, contract learning and independent study, off-campus learning experiences, flexible class scheduling, and a sense of community among the participants. This report discusses experimental colleges at two- and four-year institutions and presents an evaluation of the Rio Hondo Experimental College (RHEC) in California. RHEC is a college within a college; it was designed to be a place where students could learn in an unpressured environment and sort out their academic and career goals.

A Regional Council for coordination, which would play an important role in implementing the guidelines for development, is proposed.

The proposed CSF program is a means of providing young people with opportunities to serve their communities while accruing educational benefits for later use in post-secondary education. Modeled after the GI Bill, the program would provide: opportunities for young people to test themselves in real-world experiences, manpower for community service work, a work-related student aid strategy for state and federal governments, and a means to better coordination between education and employment for youth and for  society at large. The report recommends that the locus of program implementation be at the state level, that incentive grants be made to states by ACTION, that a test of the CSF program be undertaken in a selected state, and that ACTION seek to resolve the legal complications of combining CSF programs with Comprehensive Employment Training Act funds. Three alternative CSF models are presented and the components of each model are discussed in detail. (Author/DC)",

The status of articulation agreements in Florida, Illinois, Texas, Iowa, Arizona, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, California, and Michigan is detailed. This monograph also notes the recommendations of the National Conference on College Transfer; chief among these recommendations are the concepts that state agency obligation with respect to  articulation/transfer is coordination rather than control, and that responsibility for student progress through an education system rests with institutions. It is also recommended that articulation plans contain the breadth and flexibility necessary to accommodate the greatly increased numbers of nontraditional students now seeking transfer opportunities. The trends in higher education which influence articulation are listed. (Author/DC)",

        "description":"Community colleges are failing to realize their potential because of problems at the very highest level of policy and management decision-making. Publicly elected trustees are apt to have political allegiances. Community college boards are usually too small to represent the range of talent and experience needed for constructing effective trustees supporting groups. The small size of these boards also prohibits committee work and forces the board to act as a committee of the whole, thereby wasting valuable board time. The political implications and the difficulties implicit in the structure and operation of many boards force community college presidents to devote inordinate amounts of time to work with, motive, and staff trustees functions; furthermore, the administrative and  management duties of presidents and boards are not clearly delineated. State superboards often devitalize institutional boards and make them powerless. Boards of trustees do not conduct systematic self-studies to test the effectiveness of present practices and to design improvements where necessary. The author recommends methods of correcting these problems, suggests that the community college trustee resource be studied in depth, and that three major national education associations mount a program designed to accomplish major increases in the effectiveness of trustee lay leadership.

In addition, a questionnaire was sent to all 115 1974 graduates, 52 (45 percent) of whom responded.

Results of the graduate survey indicate that there is still a great demand for  registered nurses. Forty-nine of the 52 respondents found full-time employment; of the other three, two chose to work four-day weeks and one chose to attend a four-year institution full-time. The 1974 graduates were hired in a variety of nursing areas, with a majority working in areas of their first choice. The greatest number are working day shifts and 25 graduates are earning $900-$999 per month. Only six of the 52 do not plan to continue their education at some point. The questionnaire is appended.

Their average first quarter GPA was 2.44 (-0.05 points below their LACC average of 2.49); one-third earned a &quot;B&quot; average or better at CSLA, while 19 percent fell below a &quot;C&quot; average. 38 percent of the transfers selected a major in the School of Letters and Science, 26 percent in Business and Economics, 20 percent in Fine Arts, 3 percent in Engineering; 14 percent were undecided. Highest averages were earned in courses in Education, Physical Education, and Drama. Departments offering the most difficulty were Biology, Economics, and History. Since  1975, the GPA's earned by new LACC transfers to CSLA have ranged from 2.36 to 2.60, with differentials between CSLA and LACC GPA's ranging from -0.13 to +0.21. The author concludes that students who transfer from LACC to CSLA experience little, if any, transfer shock. Tabulated data indicate the number of students transferring in each quarter of the 1973-74 school year; the academic performance of transfer students in their first quarter at CSLA according to quarter of entrance, college major, and department; and the academic performance of transfers from 1957 to 1974.

As a result of this study, the author recommends: (1) the employment of a student recruitment specialist to coordinate the total recruitment efforts at PCC; (2) the assignment of counselors to departments so that occupational students  can be guided by counselors familiar with and in favor of the program; (3) the recruitment of more women into occupational programs; (4) a reward system for faculty members who devote time to student recruitment; (5) inservice programs on student recruitment for faculty members; (6) expansion of the Career Guidance Center; (7) better publicity; and (8) ongoing research to update and improve student recruitment. The questionnaires and interview formats are appended. (DC)",

        "description":"In 1973, the state of Minnesota passed legislation lowering the legal age of adulthood from 21 to 18; this gave 18-year olds the opportunity to legally consume alcoholic beverages. At the same time, the University of Minnesota made policy changes which enabled dormitory residents to consume alcoholic beverages in their rooms. To ascertain the effects of these changes, the University of Minnesota Technical College at Crookston surveyed dormitory residents regarding their alcohol and drug usage. For comparative purposes, surveys were conducted before and after the changes went into effect. Seventy-seven percent of the 1973 dormitory residents and fifty percent of the 1974 dormitory residents participated in the surveys. Results indicated that consumption of alcohol had not  increased. Interviews with students brought forth the concept that 1974 students seemed to drink more for social purposes instead of drinking to get drunk. Student housing staff members claimed that there was less drinking and fewer problems related to the consumption of alcohol after the policy and legal changes. Student usage of marijuana and hard drugs also appeared to decrease slightly. (Author/DC)",

        "description":"In the near future, community colleges must meet the challenges presented by lack of funds, growing government control, uncertain enrollment projections, and potential changes in public policy. Their best defense is to develop an overall strategy for flexibility in the use of funds, assignment of faculty, and utilization of facilities. To achieve this flexibility, they should develop a comprehensive planning system tying together academic, fiscal, and facility resources and should utilize institutional research to answer \"What if?\" questions. From a philosophical point of view, they must emphasize life-long learning, consider education as an inherently valuable experience, develop new instructional strategies to relate to a diversified student body, recognize the entire community  as a place of learning, modify student-teacher relationships so that they become partners in learning, and provide non-cognitive learning experiences. Included charts illustrate the growth and decline of enrollments (1880-2000), percentages of GNP spent on higher education (1960-75), the availability of federal research funds (1960-75), the annual demand for new faculty (1965-90), federal outlays for construction (1960-75), enrollment distribution in higher education, the external factors influencing the share of enrollments at particular kinds of postsecondary institutions, and the ability of various kinds of institutions to adjust to current and potential situations.

In this paper, three questions are examined: the first pertains to the conception of media &quot;language&quot; formats as they theoretically relate to mental skills; the second question, to the identification of cricial &quot;language&quot; formats; and the third, to the identification and  measurement of the relevant mental skills.

Results indicated that: (1) the effect of television was significant and creates a more parallel pattern across  behaviors in the case of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;; (2) parents' positive attitudes toward television do not correlate significantly with children's overt reactions; and (3) the theory that the more intelligent the child, the more quantitatively he will react to the television was accepted for &quot;Sesame Street&quot; but rejected for &quot;Polka Dot Door.&quot; A review of the literature accompanies the report.

No significant Pearson correlations were found between creativity measures and Embedded Figures Test scores, but a significant Kendall's coefficient of concordance indicated a low positive association between creativity and field dependence for the group as a whole. An analysis by sex suggested a possible interaction with creativity mode, in that field dependence in boys was associated with verbal creativity, and field dependence in girls with figural creativity.

On both length and weight, the conserver's answer prevailed significantly more often than the nonconserver's; there were no differences on the control tasks. Analysis of the interaction revealed several measures on which conservers differed from nonconservers, and winners of the argument from losers.

Theoretical points of similarity and dissimilarity are cited. Relevant reasearch studies (Bell, Gouin-Decarie, Fraiberg) are reviewed in an attempt to resolve contradictions between the two theories. A possible theoretical convergence is proposed which involves altering the motivational basis for analytic theory so that it is more in linewith the Piagetian model of internal drives for mastery and competence. Piagetian theory would necessarily expand from a consideration of only the physical world to include social and affective spheres. Other studies and Erikson's work conclude a discussion of how  cogntitive development may influence affective behaviors and how affective drives may support the acquisition of new cognitive structures.

        "description":"This paper presents a study designed to clarify the role of perceptual-attentional factors in the development of conservation, and relates the results to procedures for assessing conservation. Subjects were 192 first and second graders. The number and type of perceptual cues in the conservation of liquid quantity task were systematically varied. In general, nonconservation increased in kindergarteners as the number of cues increased. In contrast, first graders were affected very little by the perceptual conditions. Both grades showed a specific training effect of borderline significance under certain conditions. The results suggest that the development of conservation involves several levels which vary from an early understanding of invariance which can be demonstrated only under  facilitating conditions, to a final, stable, generalized concept of quantity.

The memory task was the Wickens release from proactive inhibition paradigm in which short-term recall of words is tested on successive trials. On trials 1-4 words were selected from 1 of 2 categories, either words with masculine or feminine connotations. On trial 5 words were drawn from the second category. Sex-role preferences were assessed by asking the child to select his favorite pictures from an array that included masculine and feminine items. Recall by boys at both ages increased following a shift between words with masculine or feminine connotations, suggesting that this dimension of a word's meaning was encoded in memory. Recall by girls who selected a feminine item as their favorite  on the sex-role preference task increased following a category shift; recall by girls who chose a masculine item did not increase. These results were discussed in relation to previous research on the attributes of encoding in children's memory. (Author/CS)",

There was a strong order effect in the direction of increasing conservation over the eight trials.

The inventories provide a framework for an analysis of (1) characteristics of parents and teachers that influence home-school collaboration; (2) the extent to which different policies, programs, and interventions might influence parent-teacher interaction and involvement; and (3) the relationship of different levels of parent and teacher involvement and interaction to the child's school adjustment and achievement. A search of ERIC documents pertaining to home-school relationship, and a review of research on parent involvement in the  child's education in the home and in the school, provided the background for developing the inventories. A small pilot study was conducted with 20 parents of 4- and 5-year-olds at a child development center. Intercorrelations of scale scores were computed for the \"a priori\" scales for the pilot data and were examined for clusters of scales that might define major dimensions of parent-teacher interaction and parent involvement. These clusters indicate that major dimensions of parent-teacher involvement and interaction can be isolated from this inventory. (CS)",

Each child was tested on the following measures: Matching Familiar Figures (MMF); Matrix Solution (MS); Classroom Behavior (SCAN); Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales, Form U-P; and the Peabody Individual Achievement Test (PIAT). The most important finding was the identification of a cluster of classroom behaviors that negatively affect academic achievement: inattentiveness, high level of gross motor behavior, dependency, passivity, low social interaction, and aggression. These negative behavioral styles suggest a pattern  of disorganization and immaturity and stand apart from the general and expected relationship of mental and chronological age with a variety of school-related variables. It is suggested that a different classroom structure or learning environment could yield different results. (CS)",

Results of the study suggest that it is possible to develop observational techniques that can reliably record the antecedent conditions, flow, and outcome behaviors which make up the sequence of behaviors described as cooperation.

The classroom was composed of nine learning centers and was organized around the following activities: math, dramatic play, blocks, art, reading, listening, science, outside play, and games. Each of the 16 subjects was observed separately for one 55-minute period during a free choice or an integrated activity time in centers. Data collected on each child involved: (1) choice of centers; (2) length of time in the center; (3) peer interaction received and unitiated across sex, age, and race; and (4) interaction initiated by and received from staff members. The interaction data on each child  were combined in order to represent a sample of the overall interaction of all 5-year-olds in this setting. Data were classified as to verbal interaction in each center. Results indicate that students show a bias toward interacting verbally with peers of the same sex and race. It was concluded that simply grouping children heterogeneously by age, sex, and race does not guarantee that the children will communicate across the groups at random. (CS)",

Specific guidelines are given for observing and planning toward increasing opportunities for competency and play. Competency is viewed as consisting of growth, risk-taking, and a positive self-concept, based on the theoretical work of Maslow, White, Rotter, and deCharms. Play is considered the child's major means of achieving competency through environmental transactions. Definitions of the elements, processes, operations, objects, and functions of play are briefly given within this context. The major implication derived from a discussion of the interrelationship between competency and play is that the more  opportunities for play a child has, the greater in his potential for developing competency. Within this theoretical framework, the teacher is presented guidelines concerning: (1) analysis of the classroom environment for flexibility, information load, impact, pacing, transaction opportunities, locus of control, locus of reinforcement, and suspension of reality; (2) procedures for observing the child's transactions with the environment; and (3) intervention based on assessment of the environment and the child's transactions.

The general objective of the study was to assess the validity of the field-dependence measures in early childhood. Field-dependence was found to relate positively with perceptual egocentrism and inductive reasoning, however the field-dependence measures employed showed only moderate correlations with each other. Factor analysis and the absence of sex differences gave little support for the construct validity of the field-dependence measures. The usefulness of field-dependence as a meaningful construct in describing perceptual development in young children was considered doubtful. (Author/CS)",

The test consisted of a series of 61 items divided into six sections: passive vocabulary, complementary relationships, noncomplementary relationships, number concepts, verbal analogies, and awareness of self. A KR-20 reliability coefficient of .93 was obtained on a sample of 85 nursery school children. In terms of validity, significant correlations with the Stanford-Binet, the Slosson Intelligence Test and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test were obtained on a sample of 20 children and  later on a sample of 68 children. For the latter sample, these correlations were .90, .86 and .91, respectively. The advantages of the test are that the administrative time is brief and that it can be used by the average preschool teacher. (Author/CS)",

In 1968 close to 1,700 male respondents from these four groups, matched in terms of age and education, were interviewed for information on: age, education, and income; occupational patterns; visitation and settlement patterns; way of life preferences; religious beliefs and participation; attitudes toward  progress; reference groups and life satisfaction; and alienation and physical health. Findings indicated that migrants first moved to the ghetto, but moved on to the suburbs as they gained skills and urban competence; suburbanites (who were physically healthier, slightly older, more educated, and more skilled) valued family life more than those who remained in the ghetto, saw society as more orderly, and felt more a part of it than people in the other three groups; and the two Cleveland groups felt more a part of society than did the West Virginia groups.

The paper's objectives are to: (1) present a preliminary sociological realistic theory of dominant-ethnic conflict; (2) compare and contrast the theory in terms of 2 types of models (a \"static model\" and processual system); (3) illustrate by the processual system the theoretical advantages of considering \"feedback loops\"; and (4) discuss the methodological distinctions in terms of a classification of different types of relations and linkages. The type of conflict discussed is one which is infrequent, intense, and violent. The theory holds that conflict between an ethnic and a dominant group is a function of  13 independent variables. Among these 13 variables are the competive threat, large power differences, loss of powerful friends (by dominants), gain of powerful enemies (by dominants), ethnocentrism, degree of segregation, and goal contradictions. In the \"static model\", all the independent variables simultaneously influence the dependent variable. In the processual system, each and every variable has both independent and dependent functions.

Educational projects utilizing telecommunications in connection with the target groups were examined and then analyzed in terms of cost, effectiveness, quality, impact, and organizational control. Five separate elements were examined: (1) the physical setting and the population; (2) the problems and questions; (3) the forces, factors, and institutions; (4) the technology; and (5) the technological  capability. It was concluded that telecommunications has much to offer in terms of resource-sharing, having the ability to reach physically isolated populations; to teach and upgrade rural teachers; to share good teachers; to bring quality audio and visual information to schools; to teach in bilingual, bicultural situations, and to share administrative duties. Projected large-scale satellite-based educational telecommunications systems were found to be relatively inexpensive, costing no more than $35 per student school year. (JC)",

A log of approaches was kept by the specialist to record the significant approaches employed and the leader contacts made. Thirty-eight leaders were interviewed to determine opinions about various approaches. Twenty-five leaders approved of a CRD specialist working in the community; 1 did not; and 10 were undecided. Thirty-five leaders stated that the best way for a specialist to meet community leaders was via a face-to-face visit at their place of business. Eighteen wanted the specialist to work with them, while 14 wanted him to serve as an advisor only  Twenty-nine thought that the best way for a specialist to get started was to carefully study the community before taking action. While 19 thought a specialist should live in the community, 30 recommended he work from 2 to 4 days a week in the community. It was recommended, therefore, that a new CRD specialist approach community leaders face-to-face; have a pre-talk prepared for the visitation; carefully study the community before attacking a project; and either live in the community or work there several days a week.

Current research was reviewed, priority areas were identified, and allocation of Scientific Man Years were recommended. Major problems identified were in the areas of jobs, education, health, social institutions, and community facilities. It was concluded that research should be directed toward providing mobility aids for those who wish to move to urban areas and providing opportunities to facilitate those who wish to remain in rural areas and that the nature, location, and extent of rural inequities should be identified, evaluated, and alleviated in reference to an identified  clientele. Current research in Southern regions was classified in terms of major objective, problem area, and discipline. Major objectives identified were community services, human resources, and income and employment. The greatest percentage of research was identified as that done by experiment stations in the area of agricultural economics. Identified research priorities were in the areas of community services and facilities, economic development, environmental development, and general. (JC)",

Given the power wielded by the oil companies, the pressure of the national standard of living, and the lack of concentrated populations, rural areas are rendered especially vulnerable. But it is the nature of agricultural production patterns coupled with consumption patterns which best illustrate American energy vulnerability. When assessed in caloric terms, agricultural production and agricultural consumption are extremely expensive. The average American consumes approximately 3,300 calories and nearly 100 grams of protein a day which requires  an additional 10,017 calories for production, making the U.S. daily caloric outlay 9,000 more than that of an East Indian who expands only 763 additional calories to produce 1,990 calories per day. Comprehensive reform should include a single National Office of Energy Research and Planning; public ownership of oil companies; funding at both State and Federal levels for alternative energy sources; consumer participation in nonprofit energy cooperatives; Federal programs; nationwide conservation and development of a learner lifestyle; and agricultural reforms to promote energy efficiency.

        "description":"Although housing standards have been raised in all parts of the United States since 1960, there are still significant numbers of American families whose housing conditions fall below accepted standards and others who must pay excessive portions of their income for housing. Nearly two-thirds of the nation's substandard housing is located in rural America. Of the approximately 20 million households residing in nonmetropolitan areas, almost 2.5 million lived in housing lacking complete plumbing in 1970. For many years, it has been evident that rural people have found it much more difficult to obtain credit for homebuilding. There is some evidence in the 1971 Census data of the disparities between nonmetro and metro areas in the availability of mortgage funds to homebuyers. Congress  has enacted a number of programs designed to improve rural housing. Since 1968, when a number of housing programs were created or expanded by Congress, there has been a measurable increase in the federally-assisted housing made available to American families. For rural households, particularly those in places of less than 10,000 population, the most relevant housing programs have been administered through the Department of Agriculture's Farmers Home Administration (FmHA).

Curriculum is regarded as systemic--an integrated and cumulative series of experiences designed to help every student achieve increased: (1) power to make relevant and informed decisions about his life, and (2) skill in performance of his life roles (economic, community, home, avocational, religious, and aesthetic). Career education is a viable paradigm for determining educational purpose, sharpening expected outcomes, and organizing and deploying the educational and community resources in the rural setting. Briefly discussed in this paper are the: (1) definition of career  education, (2) strengths and limitations of educational delivery systems in rural settings, (3) major research and development accomplishments in career education which have implications for educational programs in rural settings, and (4) development of programs and products. Among the topics covered are: 4 major theories of career development (trait factor, sociological, personality, and developmental); 4 career education models; career guidance for minority youth and women; and staff development models.

It demonstrated for school districts and the college community a non-traditional model for preparing both teachers of young children and teacher trainers. The multiplier effect was built into plans for the second-year-and-beyond of the project: (1) the return of the 7 prepared teacher trainers to their own districts wherein they provide in-service training for selected teachers in grades  K-3; and (2) the participation of the 32 experienced teachers within school district in-service programs wherein they provide in-service training or leadership responsibilities for other primary teachers. This report describes the EPDA/ECE Project in terms of participants, personnel, financial support, training strategies, its effects on the curriculum at the graduate and undergraduate levels, materials development, its impact on early childhood developments outside the training institution, and its impact in the cognitive area and affective domain of the children in preschool, kindergarten, and early grades.

Employing the nonmetropolitan State Economic Area (SEA) unit and utilizing U.S. census data, migration rates were calculated for each of the nonmetropolitan SEA's in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. Total inmigration, inmigration from the nonmetropolitan and metropolitan  SEA's, and net migration were calculated for the population 5 years and older in 1970. Some results were: positive correlation between inmigration and net migration and percent employed in industry but negative correlation between inmigration and net migration and percent employed in agriculture; negative correlation between inmigration and agriculture regardless of size of farm; and positive correlation between net migration and proximity to large Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas.

Federal intervention in housing has been largely indirect and to the benefit of upper income groups, with tax subsidies accounting for two-thirds of all subsidy costs. Benefits from direct subsidies are about evenly split between low and moderate income groups, though the latter accounts for a rapidly increasing share. Federal intervention has sought to expand private business operations but has not offset the deficiencies of that sector, failing to eliminate patterns of racial discrimination and possibly intensifying patterns of geographic distortions. If adequate  housing is to be provided for rural areas, major reforms must be made in Federal housing policy and should include creation of: (1) a comprehensive national housing program; (2) a department of rural affairs; (3) an emergency rural housing administration; (4) a local housing delivery system; (5) a rural housing development bank; (6) a Federal capital budget which makes distinctions between wealth producing and nonproducing endeavors; and (7) a finance and subsidy arrangement that covers cost of: new and rebuilt housing, maintenance, operation (to include insurance and utilities), and taxes.

Two factors which have a controlling effect on child care provisions for rural families are: (1) distance and (2) resources. In order to create effective child care systems for rural areas, planners must cope with such problems as transportation, skilled people, facilities, and effective agencies. Planners should consider various options for delivering comprehensive child care through the auspices of a single agency. The point of \"single entry\" can be  child care centers, in-home visitations, family day care homes, community child care events, the media, or a mixture of these systems.

Services to rural America are measured by comparing the distribution of FY 1973 outlays in 5 broad program categories, based on 226 selected Federal programs, with the distribution of the total population grouped along a 6-part urban-to-rural dimension. This comparison provides insights as to which population groups, with respect to the dimension of their rural or urban character, are influenced most by the total package of Federal programs. The geographic unit chosen as the basis for population distribution is the substate planning and  development district. The 546 designated districts in the country, in addition to being grouped according to their urban-to-rural dimension, are grouped according to their rate of 1960-70 population growth and 1969 median family income. Analysis based on these groupings measures differences in per capita Federal outlays among declining and fast-growing districts and among low-income and high-income districts. The appendix presents the distribution of fiscal 1973 and fiscal 1972 total and per capita Federal outlays for counties grouped along an urban-to-rural dimension. (Author/NQ)",

Data were derived from personal interviews with selected local leaders (varying from 21 to 33 interviews per county) and from 464 representative household heads or homemakers (220 male and 244 female respondents) living in either open country areas (320) or town areas (144). The survey question asked was: &quot;In general and on the average, would you say that the quality of life for most people in this county has improved, gotten worse or remained about the same during the past 10 years?&quot; Leaders and residents were queried as to their opinions about changes  in the quality of life for &quot;most people&quot; and for their &quot;own families.&quot; Results, tabulated by place of residence (town or country) for residents but not for leaders, indicated that despite differences, most ordinary people and most leaders viewed the changes of the past decade favorably. Since these counties still rank low on most objective indicators of development, it was concluded that the people's subjective assessment of their quality of life may be as important as measures of present status or level.

Two main categories or images of woman, with variations and generalizations, have been: (1) the &quot;good woman&quot;, symbolized by a woman who can think or do no evil, is pure, understanding, kind, weak, passive, needs to be protected, but yet has an inner strength and a capacity for enduring and suffering; and (2) the &quot;bad woman&quot;, symbolized by one who is a temptress and seductress, representing evil through love and the perversion and excess of its passions. The &quot;bad woman&quot; is morally judged and condemned by all and must suffer a severe punishment for her evil actions, usually death by murder or suicide. A third gray-area category is one which  blends these two principal images; yet, one image consistently dominates the other. These principal images of woman have persisted in Spanish, Spanish American, and Anglo American literature from their respective beginnings to contemporary examples. These categories are examined in various selections and passages of several Chicano works. Among these are Roland Hinojosa's &quot;Estampas del valle y otras obras&quot;; Jorge Isaacs'&quot;Maria&quot;; Jose Montoya's &quot;La jefita&quot;; Estela Portillo's &quot;The Swallows&quot;; and Rodolfo Anaya's &quot;Bless Me, Ultima.&quot; (NQ)",

The study defined and identified the characteristics of problem-oriented research necessary to support &quot;social action&quot; toward the understanding and operational knowledge of medical care delivery in rural areas. Evaluation techniques were then devised to help indicate the relative usefulness of the research to active improvement of rural health care services delivery. A data base was designed,  constructed, and used for a knowledge assessment of ongoing research and research publications. The study concentrated on ongoing research projects and recent research publications contained in major national research information systems. This paper presents the: inventory and description of ongoing research projects, inventory and analysis of publications, evaluation of selected accepted research publications, knowledge assessment of ongoing research projects and of accepted research publications, comparative knowledge assessment of project/publications, and Socioeconomic and Sociomedical Indexes.

The CDC \"Final Report\" was presented in a large volume in order to make the entire data base available for different policy uses, assessment methodological applications, and further discussions. Prepared by EMO after the completion of the Final Report, this executive summary further explains the presumptions, assumptions, methodologies, conclusions, and recommendations of that report. Policy-relevant findings of the assessment are summarized and clarified by: (1)  presenting the models and objectives (values) used in the systems approach which produced the Final Report's recommendations; and (2) demonstrating a potential systems approach to the utilization of the Final Report's data base elements toward the goal of achieving a comprehensive knowledge assessment. The accepted research publications are categorized by: (1) indepth subject category and (2) document access number. (NQ)",

        "author":["Matta, Benjamin N., Jr."],
        "description":"Most Chicanos live in relatively well-defined areas called &quot;barrios&quot; within urban areas. These barrios are growing in population density due to such long-term forces as the: (1) declining opportunities in rural areas due to the gradual labor displacement and/or the bleak economic prospects faced by the smaller farm in this country; (2) continuing population influx of legal or illegal Mexican nationals; and (3) continuing intensive physical segregation and racism which keeps residents of Chicano barrios from moving out. The majority of the Chicano community depends on its labor power for its economic livelihood. Yet, in April 1970 the unemployment rate was 6.1% for Chicano males; only 61.8 percent of the male household heads and 23.7 percent of the female family heads worked  full-time year round. This paper presents a descriptive economic analysis that will build on what are considered major premises and conclusions of research on the Chicano community to date. Alternative means and implications toward economic development of the barrio as they have appeared since 1960 are described and assessed: private sector-public sector cooperation; promotion of Chicano capitalism; reform of the entire mechanism of public goods provisions; community economic self-determination; and Trickle Down Approach.

        "description":"Approximately 1,225 Mexican American and Anglo American children in grades 1-6 (ages 6-14) from California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas were tested using school achievement and IQ standardized tests and four Piagetian-derived measures (Cartoon Conservation Scales, Water Level Task, Figural Intersection Test, and Serial Task). The field study's goals were to examine the: (1) interrelations among the four neo-Piagetian measures in a Mexican American sample which varied as to geography and socioeconomic status; (2) neo-Piagetian measures' psychometric properties; (3) relation between developmental level as assessed by neo-Piagetian procedures and IQ as assessed by standardized measures; (4) extent of field-independence as measured by the Water Level Task; and (5) sex differences  in performance on the tests. The developmental measures were given to all subjects irrespective of site while the standardized achievement and IQ tests were given on a site specific basis. Among the standardized tests were: Otis-Lennon Mental Ability Test, Inter-American Series; and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. Some findings were: except for the Serial Task, the neo-Piagetian measures possessed high reliability, homogeneity, and validity; and these measures exhibited a developmental progression of performance scores across age in accordance with Piaget's theory of cognitive development.

The Anglo and Mexican American samples were randomly selected from the police and fire departments; the blacks, not being concentrated in sufficient numbers in any few departments, were taken from all 22 city departments. Telephone numbers and data about sex, birth, and employment dates, and salary were obtained from a document filled out by employees in the Personnel Department. A questionnaire was written to guide in eliciting responses about the same factual information taken from the personnel records. Two Anglo females who were experienced in interviewing for scholarly and commercial  research conducted the interviews. Significance of differences tests were conducted with the chi-square procedure. Inaccurate responses were categorized into over- and understatement. Some findings were: (1) of the 455 responses to the birth date question, 20 of the Anglo, 9 of the Mexican American, and 21 of the black responses were inaccurate; (2) of the 389 responses to the salary question, only 33 were correct within one dollar; and (3) the younger, but less well-paid blacks tended to report their salaries more accurately.

The War on Rats Program, in conjunction with Operation Clean Sweep, made a city-wide survey of rat infestations and recorded the areas of heavy rat infestation. After the problem areas had been identified, community organizations were asked for assistance in developing local support and motivating neighborhood residents to action. A massive public education program began. Using the Ratmobile, school assemblies, the Block program and posters, the public was informed of the various procedures and techniques that would help eliminate or reduce the neighborhood rat population. These included food source and harborage removal, solid waste collection, baiting activities,  and the repair or removal of unsanitary buildings. This 1972 report also includes a program for developing environmental health assistants designed by the Washington Technical Institute. The report concludes with statistical tables and graphs dealing with such topics as financial reports, rat bait and bait boxes utilized, a comparative study of major deficiencies, field acivities, and rat control.

The publication outlines six basic steps that are involved in initiating a wildlife project. These are: (1) Determine the types of wild animals for which the land is best suited; (2) Study the life requirements of species selected for management; (3) Prepare a habitat map; (4) Make a general inventory of that area's game species; (5) Determine which of the selected species' life requirements are lacking; (6) Design and implement projects that will improve the wildlife habitat and increase the number of wildlife. The publication devotes a section to each step: the sections include photographs, maps, diagrams, tables, background  information, and suggested resource materials. Such topics as winter cover, winter food, nesting cover, wetland development projects, and area types are included. The final section provides a closer look at such projects as pheasant projects, sharptailed grouse-prairie chicken projects, water fowl projects, and deer and ruffed grouse projects. A recommended reading list is included. (TK)",

This study focuses on the fresh water marsh found in the Florida Everglades which can furnish the student with several examples of past, present, and possible future ecological changes which impact this ecosystem. The study is developed around eight basic inquiry questions about change in the ecosystem of a marsh, which are accompanied by a series of learning activities. No one activity will answer all of the questions; however, completion of all investigations should provide the student with sufficient data on which he can develop tentative conclusions. The student learning activities have been designed into a role-playing simulation entitled&quot;The Everglades Survival Game.&quot; The guide is divided into three sections. The inquiry questions, section one, outlines the activities for the simulation game and includes learning activities, resources, evaluation, and teacher suggestions. The student materials, section two, are statements, background information or activities which are used in the game.

The paper discusses the independent studies program as a method of studying environmental problems as well as a source of academic credit. The establishment of such a program and considerations involved in such a study are examined. Environmental problem solving and the complexity of environmental problems are also discussed. The paper presents three project types which may be used as guidelines for other independent studies. The first project involves identifying and lessening the impact of a community environmental problem and involves either study of the relationships  between related concerns and establishing priorities or assessing the perceived problem through a number of interviews or questionnaires. The second project, Assessing Impact of a Developmental Project, involves using some of the guidelines established by the National Environmental Protection Agency in their impact statements. The third project, Environmental Research, requires a laboratory test facility. Suggested readings and a checklist of environmental concerns are included in the paper. (TK)",

The guide includes six topics: problem solving, solid waste, energy, population, awareness, and the Farkleberry Question. Problem solving includes land use, politics, and prescriptive thinking. Solid waste examines family garbage, methods of solid waste disposal and includes the garbage game, and supportive materials; role playing, data collection, and observation are used. Energy considers such topics as energy conservation, gasoline consumption, economic  costs, and utility management. Population focuses on crowding space, limited resources, population growth, and solutions; a population game is included. Awareness aims to help the student become emotionally involved with his environment; included are field trips, creative writing activities, and discussion topics. The Farkleberry Question is a simulation game which involves an environmental hearing on a project and its environmental impact. (TK)",

        "description":"This paper is chapter 4 of the proceedings of the National Working Conference on Emerging Issues in Environmental Education. It concerns a survey sent to 300 U. S. environmental educators to determine their attitudes toward nine previously identified emerging issues in environmental education. The survey was sent before the conference to working environmental educators who had replied to a previous questionnaire and to individuals who had received a grant from the Office of Environmental Education in 1972 or 1973. The results were used to provide a comparison with the responses of the conference participants and to provide a data base of prevailing attitudes for environmental educators. The paper is divided into three sections which cover the questionnaire development, survey  results, and comparison of survey results with conference participant results. The nine emerging issues on which the 45 survey statements are based are social justice, constituency, economics, autonomy, skills, formal education, local-global, values, and support systems. Respondents rated each statement according to agreeability and importance. Responses of the conference participants showed little difference with those of the survey respondents, despite the fact that the conference participants were chosen for their particular concern with the nine emerging issues.

Two versions of the instructional unit were prepared, one utilized a field or out-of-door approach and the second employed a three-screen slide tape presentation of the same concept. One hundred fifth grade students from Prince George's County (Maryland) Public Schools were selected at random and divided into four treatment groups of 25 each. Group 1 received no instruction, Group 2 received the slide presentation, Group 3 participated in the field approach, and Group four did both. A retention test was  administered after the instructional unit was completed. It was found that: (1) students receiving the slide presentation scored as high as students participating in the field approach; (2) students receiving the slide presentation scored higher than students receiving no instruction; and (3) students receiving both instructional methods scored highest.

Nine variables, ranging from biographical data through attitudinal data were studied. Effects on achievement and explanation of some of the differences were determined by examination of student responses to questionnaires that were developed to evaluate both the course and the teacher. The study included 406 students enrolled in 24 biology classes taught by 7 teachers. All students were required to complete 34 learning contracts. Psychometric inventories were used to obtain data concerning student characteristics. An author-constructed inventory was also used. Statistical analyses included group formation, testing of  assumptions, discriminant analysis, cross validation and analysis of variance. The findings indicated that differences did exist between the three levels of achievers in the biology program as related to all the variables investigated. By combining a number of factors, a summary description characterizing each group was presented. Generalizations made indicated that educational goals should not be the same for all students, and individualization provides an environment that enables students to become responsible for their own learning.

Evaluation was done on a post-exposure basis utilizing data from two schools of presumably similar groups who had experienced similar situations except for the independent variable. The use of an opinionnaire by students in the general biology course provided data of biographic nature, attitudinal data toward collective bargaining and opinions about the adverse effects of bargaining on the teaching/learning process. Student attitudes toward collective bargaining in general were positive. Students were neutral in their attitudes toward sanctions and the use of strikes. The groups  differed significantly in their attitude toward the bargaining impasse with students who had experienced that impasse negative in their attitudes and the other group neutral. Male students were more positive than were females. Correlational data analysis also showed those students who had a negative attitude toward collective bargaining impasse saw that impasse as an important adverse influence on their learning. An extended impasse collective bargaining situation was seen as an important adverse influence by students. (Author/EB)",

Twenty pre-service elementary school teachers were randomly selected and assigned to two treatment groups. One group received self-pacing instruction; the other group was taught in a normal classroom setting. Both groups received science instruction based on a modular package. The research design used is the one proposed by Campbell and Stanley as the Post-Test Only Control Group Design. Data were analyzed by t-test and Pearson product-moment correlations. The results indicate that teachers who were taught  utilizing a self-pacing technique did not achieve significantly better or have attitudes that were different from those who were not self-paced. These results indicate the need for educators to examine self-pacing under different learning environments. (Author/BR)",

The author reports that no clear evidence of a single superior method of teaching was indicated, but, rather, that many effective teaching strategies are available. Effective strategies can be based on discovery or expository approaches and are generally usable over a broad range of content fields. Observing that several of the studies reviewed had employed questionable research designs, statistical techniques, or instrumentation, the author provides guidelines for  strengthening future research in the area.

Students from four randomly selected schools were asked to order a set of 4, 6, 8, or 10 objects on length or weight. The sequence in which objects were placed in the row and the actual ranks of the objects in the final row was recorded. A 4 x 2 x 4 random block design was used. The Task Score (TS) was the Kendall Tau coefficient between the child's ranking of the object and the correct ranking. Three other scores were devised to distinguish strategies. Extreme Value Selecters (EVS) identified extent of value among unordered objects. Rearrangers (RAR) made an  unordered row and then rearranged the objects until correct. Students in the Insertion Strategy group (INS) randomly selected an unordered object and inserted it in the ordered row. The most important finding was that successful performance on the seriation task was usually achieved with use of a relatively systematic strategy. It appeared that most of the students in the population had yet to master seriation with weight. (Author/EB)",

This instrument was scored by methods similar to those of Schwebel (ED 063 896) and McKinnon and Renner, and was used to classify subjects as belonging to one of four stages (Concrete Substage II-A, Concrete Substage II-B, Formal Substage III-A, Formal Substage III-B). Frequency distributions of scores for the three groups were submitted to a chi-square analysis which confirmed (p less than .001) that the distribution of subjects among the stages varied with the group. Fifty-two percent of preservice elementary teachers were in concrete  operational substages, while less than 5 percent of the preservice secondary mathematics teachers and none of the calculus students were in this stage.

Participants in the experimental group received instruction in basic and integrated process skills; content for the control group was not specified. Open-minded teachers in both groups made consistent gains in a decrease of difference between idealistic and realistic attitude scores.

Conservation of volume was measured by an instrument developed by Lovell and Ogilvie. Instruction was in a mode compatible with the majority of elementary textbooks. Fifty-eight fifth-grade students were paired on the basis of age, sex, and responses to pretest questions. One member of each pair was randomly assigned to instruction on volume; the other received an equivalent amount of instruction on an unrelated topic. After instruction a posttest was administered; one month later a retention test was given. Results of the experiment indicated that instruction on volume did not affect conservation  by those students who gave non-conservation responses on the pretest; 50 percent of these students could reproduce the volume formula on the posttest, but less than half of these showed retention. Students who were able to conserve volume were all able to calculate volumes on the posttest, but only one-third of them retained this ability. (SD)",

Fast-paced mathematics classes were established to meet the needs of highly gifted junior high school students. Thirty-three students participated in the program. In 108 hours of instruction, 28 class members learned Algebra II and plane geometry at a high level of achievement. Twenty-three persons completed Algebra III. In addition, 14 boys successfully completed the 4 1/2 years of pre-calculus mathematics. These students self-paced themselves through their homework and preparation for class. Class success was based on: (1) identification of qualified students through appropriately  difficult tests of mathematical and non-verbal reasoning; (2) a dynamic teacher who introduced challenging material at a rapid-fire pace; and (3) voluntary participation by students. It appears that once these considerations are met the academic and social aspects of such a program will proceed &quot;naturally,&quot; as evidenced by these two classes. (Author/SD)",

Twelve low-achieving second-grade students were tutored on these concepts. The tutored children, along with members of two control groups, participated in a pretest covering these ideas. After the two-week tutoring period, members of all three groups participated in a mock classroom. The pre-remediated children performed significantly better than control group members on both types of problems (p less than .01), as well as in classroom participation (p less than .05).

Designed for use in the primary grades, the program incorporates training tutors in the determination of acceptable or unacceptable answers. Tutors are given detailed instruction on the use of materials for making this determination. \"No specialized knowledge of content or teaching methods is necdssary,\" and older children have been trained to use the materials in some situations. Three of these situations are described and compared in this paper. The individualized presentation of material by the tutor to the student involves presenting the criterion task first. If the student successfully performs this task, he moves to the next one. If  not, the tutor employs \"brightening\" to help the child reach an acceptable response. Also, detailed record-keeping by the tutor allows a child to skip material already mastered when it occurs within a lesson. Sample pages from the \"Programed Math Tutorial\" are included as an appendix to this paper. (SD)",

The efficiency of two different sequencing arrangements (mixed and clustered) of practice items was also examined. All treatments involved the teaching of basic arithmetic skills to seventh-grade students. The adaptive mastery learning model produced the same high level of performance on both the posttest and a delayed retention test as the other two models, but requires less time, fewer practice items, and minimized overpractice.

By analyzing mathematical concepts and citing related psychological and educational research, he develops and justifies this model. The basic premise on which the model is based is the notion that measurement provides an approach to number concepts which is more appropriate to young learners than the traditional counting approach. This premise is supported by the author's arguments that children do not readily grasp the concept of one-ness, and that ordinality is the central concept of arithmetic. The concepts of zero and continuity, assignment of numbers to related dimensions, accuracy in determining a quantity, and the arithmetic operations are developed. In discussing the  problem of transfer and its facilitation through this model, the author refers to research on memory and learning set. (SD)",

Forty students selected from four high schools were given pretests generating sixteen scores related to mathematics achievement, attitude toward mathematics, and other ability measures. These students were then asked to solve eight mathematics problems in individual sessions. Recorded protocols were coded for three types of variables. Pretest and protocol data were submitted to principal components analysis to reduce the number of variables, regression analysis, and two cluster analyses. The best predictor of problem-solving success was found to be mathematics achievement, which accounted for 50 percent of total score variance. A second predictor, heuristic  strategy components, accounted for 13 percent. The cluster analyses were performed in order to detect problem-solving modes. The first clustered students according to the frequency of use of certain heuristic strategies. The second grouped students on their willingness to use trial-and-error and equations. Together the analyses indicated that students using a wide range of strategies and techniques were able to solve more problems. (SD)",

        "description":"In this paper, an integrated view is presented of the direction that education must take if it is to become the creative, effective, joyful enterprise that many educators long for. Educational institutions are not humane because they fail to deal with the human condition in all its variety and meaning. They continue to affirm the intellectual part of the human being as if it were the whole person. Instead, the human condition is made up of six qualities including the intellectual, emotional, social, physical, aesthetic, and spiritual. In order to achieve a humane curriculum, subject matter must be responsive to these six categories in addition to teacher goals for student development which include fluency (knowledge), manipulation (application, analysis, synthesis, evaluation),  and persistence (continuation of learning). The result is an 18 cell grid in which the subject matter must respond or it is less than completely humane. The difficulty arises from the educational tradition that places intellectual ability above the other aspects of the human condition. Educators usually deal with only two cells of the grid -- the contribution of fluency and manipulation to intellectual growth. In order to achieve a humane curriculum, educators must define all curriculum changes by the complete set of criteria. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"Present court procedures and the lack of judge-lawyer-juror communication do little to encourage sound verdicts. To improve communication with the jury, a four part trial communication process including pre-service juror orientation training, pre-jury instructions, main jury instructions, and two-way trial communication is suggested. Pre-service juror training may include the presentation of orientation films and juror's manuals. Although it is not possible to provide the jury with all of the instructions at the beginning of the trial, it is possible to inform them of some rules as the trial progresses from state to stage. The main jury instructions at the conclusion of the trial definitely need to be redrafted in language intended for laymen. Written instructions should also be  provided to all jurors for use in the jury room. In order to promote an active two-way trial communication system, jurors should be allowed to take notes and address written questions to witnesses and lawyers through the intermediary of the trial judge.

This report contains information on the background, evolution, educational consequences, and dynamics of the conflict, and the results of the NEA investigation. Among the NEA conclusions are the following: (1) it is the basic principle of our Constitution that no group has the right to impose its religious value system upon the public schools; (2) education's fundamental purpose is to prepare students for good citizenship and for full, constructive lives by instilling in them the ability to think critically, reason, analyze and relate data, and to see behind  deceptive facades; (3) an essential task of public education is to treat students honestly, inform them of the history of this and other nations, and provide them with a vast diversity of literature so that they may understand and appreciate the many cultures, races, and ethnic groups that comprise our society; (4) teachers and students must be free to discuss controversial issues so that students may acquire the skills needed for intelligent analysis of issues; and (5) the West Virginia laws governing textbook selection place the responsibility for textbook selection where it belongs -- with the final decision-making authority vested in the elected board of educators, although it is recommended that parents should be involved as advisors, but not as censors.

The effects of national population growth have been confused with those of growing affluence, changing technology, and concentration of the population in metropolitan areas. Special attention here is given to the possible social effects of the present slowing population growth in the direction of a stationary or even declining population such as the aging of the population, the problems of \"depopulation\" in a large part of the United States and the smaller size family. These may involve less mobility, a longer life cycle, more accepting attitudes toward death, less  crime and violence, more pressure for foreign labor, and a possible (but dubious) trend toward conservatism and stability. The author concludes with a discussion of some possible effects of population changes on U.S. relations between the U.S. and Latin America. (Author)",

Students may study such cognitive concepts as spatial relationships; physical structure; physical, cultural and/or economic neighborhoods; transportation; and the impact of the new single-structure cities upon human behavior. Student skill development could include the translation and application of statistical, technical, and photographic data to the aforementioned cognitive concepts.  Affective activities could include a simulation where students have to decide who will be allowed entry into a limited number of domed cities when ecological catastrophe occurs in the year 2050.

From these resources, eight educational learning units were developed for use in the classroom, with considerable variation in the amount of structure and the kinds of activities. The focus of each unit is to provide students with primary source materials--letters, memoranda, records, transcripts, articles, readings--pertinent to the subject of the unit.  It is up to individual teachers to determine the best use of the materials for their classrooms. The library also disseminates films, document reproductions, and selected bibliographies.

        "description":"The goal of the review is to identify the factors which promote student cognitive achievement as measured by several studies conducted in developing countries. The major tool of analysis which measures the relationship between the school inputs, like teacher quality and school facilities, and cognitive achievement is the educational production function (EPF). The EPF expresses the maximum product of an input combination in the existing state of technical knowledge. Family background characteristics, school inputs, peer group characteristics, and initial endowments are variables for the EPF which have an important effect on academic achievement. These are influenced by policy controlled variables however, and by exposure-to-learning variables. It seems that the current technology  of formal education improves student cognitive achievement in developing countries. Results of the ten studies reviewed by this paper are summarized, showing which studies find a given schooling input to have a statistically significant impact on achievement following the traditional expectations of educators and economists. This review concludes that the determinants of student achievement are basically the same in both developing and developed countries. Moreover, the greatest gains in cognitive achievement occur simply because the student is removed from his home environment into his school environment. (Author/ND)",

Sample activities are provided for each of the five levels of learning: verbal association, discrimination learning, concept learning, rule learning, and problem solving. Each sample activity contains eight component parts including (1) focus, (2) learning objectives, (3) instructional set, (4) student directions, (5) student activities, (6) format of answer or decision sheet, (7) activity follow-up question, and (8) transfer readiness data. A similar  model can be used as a basis for creating pre-objectives and test-items at each level.

        "description":"The growing number of value clarification curriculum materials is an indication that moral education is becoming a major focal point of curriculum. This study looks at one social studies course that includes both a moral development component and an inquiry approach. The hypotheses of the study are that students will show significant growth in (1) social studies facts and principles, (2) learning and inquiry skills, (3) attitudes toward social studies, and (4) self esteem and moral judgment. The sample consists of students from six suburban Boston school districts between the eighth and tenth grade who had previously been exposed to materials developed by Ted Fenton. The dependent variables are pre- and posttestings on attitude toward self and self as a learner, social studies,  politics, knowledge, learning, inquiry skills, and moral judgement level. Although no real significant differences in the areas are observed in absolute individual gains, as a group the total sample did increase their scores on the inquiry Skills and Knowledge subtests and change their attitudes slightly in two areas. In the moral judgement level, it makes no difference whether teachers attended a five-day workshop on Kohlberg's theory or read a manual discussing the same material. It was found, however, that growth in moral reasoning is more likely to occur where a range of reasoning is present and expressed in an active classroom discussion, especially when teachers take an active rather than a parliamentarian role.

The specified modes of instruction being considered are inductive vs. deductive approaches. The materials used to test the hypotheses are Anthropology Curriculum Project (ACP) materials--one set using the deductive mode given to the control group and a second set written in an inductive mode (in Appendix A and B) given to the experimental group. Thirty teachers and their classes in seven school districts in five states comprise the sample. Four ACP instruments measured pupil achievement, included in  the appendices, and another instrument measured teacher personality variables. The major findings of the study indicate that there are no significant differences in achievement between the pupils of teachers who taught deductively and those who taught inductively, and that several teacher attitude patterns seem to be related to pupil achievement. An implication of the study is that more extensive research concerning the use of attitude inventories and other instruments for measuring attitudes and orientations should be undertaken.

Special care was taken to make the simulated trial as authentic as the original trial. College students and the general public provided the jurors, which were then divided into twelve separate juries and provided with various kinds and amounts of information and instructions concerning their role as a jury. Results indicate that six-man juries do not differ in any significant way from twelve-man juries. A jury watching a videotape trial will arrive at a verdict similar to a jury watching an actual trial. There is a tendency for juries to consider the cost of living in awarding damages to the plaintiff. College student jurors  return verdicts similar to non-student jurors. Lawyer and witness credibility, appearance, and personality influence jury decision-making. There is a consistency in the decision-making process among juries. When an individual holdout occurs, he is persuaded to join the majority through a one-to-one discussion with the other jurors. Overall, juries tend to make rational decisions based upon the witnesses, exhibits, and the arguments of the attorneys. (Author/DE)",

A second search, now taking place, tries to assess our condition by identifying the context which fosters estrangement and oppression but which is taken for granted in our thinking about schools. It is a context of estrangement between education and schooling, fact and value, mind and body, students and teachers.  Reconceptualist discourse on curriculum is moving from the realm of the scientific toward the realm of the ethical and aesthetic. The reconceptualist's question of &quot;How are alternative educational realities possible?&quot; The answer lies in the world of lived experience and comes when one asks &quot;What are my richest moments? From what process do they emerge?&quot; The answer requires a third search through ourselves for a way to get beyong the limitations of our condition. (Author/JH)",

        "description":"Equality of educational opportunity is a social goal in both the United States and Canada; yet, the nations differ considerably in their approaches and progress toward this objective. Canada appears to have achieved greater equality of condition vis-a-vis education than has the United States, judged by variation in expenditure per student among school boards. In Canada, federal and local power in education is less, but provincial authority is greater, than in the United States. The greater provincial authority provides a more wholistic base for decision making. Louis Hartz's political theory, which emphasizes the varying roles of liberal traditions and values, provides an explanation for these national differences. While both English-Canada and the United States are essentially  liberal fragments of European society, the historical point at which they were severed from Europe has influenced the political philosophies that predominate in the societies. In the United States, liberalism takes the form of equality of opportunity for its citizens; in English-Canada, of equal conditions for its citizens. Because of this difference between a wholistic view for Canada and an individualistic view for the United States, responses to social problems have been different. For example, while states attempt to bring low-expenditure districts up to a state median without raising the median for balancing funds among jurisdictions, Ontario has put a ceiling on educational expenditure and is achieving a low variation in expenditure through provincial-level control.

        "description":"The purposes of this paper are: (1) to identify uses of the term social competence for preschool and early school children, with origins directly in research, and (2) to formulate a definition of social competence reflecting consensus across three different research perspectives. From an ethnological perspective, social competence consists of adaptive interactions in the natural environment provided by classrooms. The second research perspective construes competence in the framework of structural theory of personality and as dimensions or clusters of task oriented behavior, extroversion, or the use of opportunities in the classroom. The social theory perspective analyzes competence as ability to assume roles and to express varied repertoires pursuant to goal attainment. Theory,  background, definition of behavior, methodology, and related research for each perspective is included. A modified definition of social competence emerges from the combination of the three separate perspectives and includes such concepts as purposiveness, adaptiveness, flexibility, and analysis of rules governing social interactions.

        "description":"The purpose of the investigation reported here is to test and extend the argument that teachers engage in subtle forms of discrimination in the classroom. Further, other arguments suggested are that teachers base this discrimination on ascribed characteristics of the student; manifest this discrimination in the form of differential expectations for students' academic performances with parallel differences in behavior toward students; affect student learning thereby; and, by doing these things, contribute to the transmission of social inequalities from one generation to the next. A model is developed to provide a systematic representation of the main components of the self-fulfilling prophesy argument. A postulated reciprocal relationship between teachers' cognitive and normative  evaluations of students is central to the model. Data comes from 16,000 male and female students who began high school in a major Canadian city in 1959. No evidence of socioeconomic discrimination is found, although sex and ability influences on teacher expectations are demonstrated. However, teachers' cognitive expectations are found to be substantially affected by the students' classroom behavior, a link in the self-fulfilling prophesy argument. Despite this, the data offer no support to the argument. (Author/JH)",

Examples of both overt and unobtrusive control mechanisms include such things as study halls, student council, elementary school door guards, and substitute teachers. The recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance is one ritual of social control that has complex meaning and affect upon students. Forty-five children from several different elementary schools, when asked if they said the Pledge in class, how they felt about it, and what they considered the most important part of the Pledge, responded differently according to grade level. For primary level children it serves as a day-beginning ritual and gives the child an opportunity to excel, thereby gaining personal  satisfaction, teacher and peer approval. For third and fourth graders it serves as a means of patriotic expression. In contrast, fifth and sixth graders reveal more apathy and derision for the ritual. Although some patriotic reasons continue, many mentioned participating because they view it as part of the school day or because their teacher insists upon it. Thus the Pledge is a convenient way to settle students down and instill social control through patriotic ritual. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"Authority relationships in American classrooms are mirror images of authority relationships in the larger society. These patterns originally developed out of the Western liberal tradition where parental authority and authority of counsel (or wisdom) evolved into authority by force and bureaucracy. In either case the result was politically and socially repressive for the classroom and society at large. From the colonial period to the middle of the 19th century, conceptions of authority found their basis in ideas from the Enlightment liberal tradition of Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. Proponents of these ideas translated into supporters of either elitist or democratic-elitist positions. In the elitist position, often supported by Federalists, there was no reference to education of  the masses. Although the democratic-elitists, made up of both Federalists and Republicans, supported universal male education, they believed in the ascendency of a natural aristocracy and rule by force if reason failed. The result was a nonegalitarian educational system that supported the status quo and failed to develop the creative individuality of the student. (DE)",

        "description":"This study deals with variables affecting the successful introduction of a program in aesthetic education. The Aesthetic Education Project is an innovative elementary level art program that reduces the traditional emphasis on skill development while increasing the emphasis on perceptual development, art appreciation, and appreciation of the creative process. Since this program is significantly different from most art programs, variables related to diffusion and teacher acceptance of the program are explored. Crossbreak analysis of questionnaire data obtained from 171 teachers indicates that: (1) teachers' perceptions of goals appropriate to a given group of students are influenced more by perception of general goals than by specific goals suggested by the innovative materials;  (2) the effect of teacher input to the decision making process and future use of the materials is low; (3) teachers who helped initiate the program are more committed to the precepts of the program than to the materials themselves; and (4) the stronger the belief of teachers in their own sufficiency as purveyors of the arts, the more likely they are to use and recommend the materials. The largest factor influencing future use of the program, aside from philosophic commitment to it, is positive or negative student response which itself showed little relationship to ability and socioeconomic status.

It is an internal, subjective, wordless perception of the essential wholeness of the universe and the individual within it. Little mention is made of mankind collectively in this philosophy. Forms of society are often put aside as necessary evils which the self-realized individual must overcome to reach his cosmic state of consiousness. However, although transcedence may be experienced only by an individual, it does not have to be at the disdain of the social order. The freedom and meaning to the world which the transcendent individual seeks can come about not in escape from the world but in satisfaction derived from well conceived and  executed action in the world. Meaning comes from humane movement directed by the individual. Freedom is not an idealistic static state of being but of being towards. If gifted individuals flee from this responsiblity of freedom and meaning, they become responsible for the uncertainty and chaos that they leave behind. (Author/DE)",

The materials, consisting of four versions of a simulation, were designed to teach skills for analyzing political situations from a strategic point of view, with the objective of improving political skills. This study evaluated the materials for teaching specific skills to 151 students by measuring posttest improvements over pretests. Open-ended essay questions were used as the evaluation instrument, and answers to the questions by a control group of politically experienced persons were used for determining criteria. The results indicated that students tended to (1) be more likely to define a clear-cut  political issue, (2) write fewer words in defining the issue, and (3) make more specific suggestions as to how to deal with more actors in trying to solve a political problem. The findings generally showed that the stipulated educational objectives were being achieved at the campuses tested. (ND)",

An actual civil court case was used to make both the simulated video and written versions as authentic as the original trial. Adultvolunteers from the general public and college students provided the jurors. Results indicate that the use of a video taped version of a trial, when compared to the use of a written version of the same trial, will result in measurable different outcomes and that the video taped version will more closely reflect the outcome of the original trial. Decisions reached by simulated 6 and 12 person juries, when compared with decisions reached by individual responses, will result in measurable different outcomes and will more  closely reflect the outcome of the original trial. Hence, the further removed the procedure is from the real world model of a jury watching the trial and reaching a consensus verdict, the less likely the outcome will concur with the original trial and therefore the less useful the technique will be in legal communication research.

If the masses do not see what society as a whole objectively requires, however, the leaders must be patient and resort to education and explanation, or the requirements must be altered to meet the objections. By the mid 1960's a trend in China's education had developed to create a group of experts to lead China towards modernization. Maoists considered this trend as an attempt to reimpose an elitist society and sharpen, rather than diminish, class divisions. As a result, the cultural revolution brought sweeping reform to the Chinese educational system. These changes included more emphasis on rural and vocational education instead of narrow academic  descriptives. Entrance requirements for higher education institutions were eliminated to increase the enrollment of students from less advantaged backgrounds. Tests and examinations were eliminated as a criterion for advancement in order to place more emphasis on learning and less on competition. In addition, all students and teachers were required to participate in manual labor to increase their socialist consciousness. (Author/DE)",

Therefore, it is difficult to make effective generalizations about long range issues related to curriculum analysis and implementation. An evaluation of a social studies curriculum implementation program in St. Louis provides a number of model variables that must be taken into consideration in systematic research projects. Eight of these variables are critically related to the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the curriculum implementation and dissemination in that project and include inter-district differences, teacher differences, administrative liason, goal ambiguity, teacher role conflict, inadequate conceptual skills, administrative complexity, and defects in conceptual design. Further,  there is little research focused on the process of curriculum evaluation, the personnel who ought to be involved in the process and their particular impact, or the means by which results of research are infused into the decision-making setting. New research must consider these problems in addition to publishers' goals and research, community involvement, teacher education, funding, and commitment to long tern research programs.

Controlled variables include a child's sex and I.Q. The null hypothesis is that there will be no significant difference in standard achievement test scores based on either the child's sex or I.Q., or whether they studied the standard curriculum or Bruner's MACOS course for the year. No significant difference between the test performance of the two groups is observed, demonstrating to teachers and administrators -- who frequently are reluctant to try  newer social studies programs because they fear the students' achievement test scores will decline -- that students do not suffer by using innovative, inquiry-oriented curriculum. Instead, teachers should be encouraged to use the new materials based on the findings. Some of the criticism aimed at the MACOS project are also answered in the document. (Author/JR)",

The issue of whether textbooks should and do adequately represent the real world of minorities is emphasized. In the past, when publishers either omitted minorities from books or made misleading statements in textbooks about minorities, textbooks did indeed represent the feeling of the real world, reflecting the discriminatory practices and social attitudes of society. Presently the treatment of minority groups in textbooks is undergoing a change toward the new concept of cultural pluralism. Although minorities are being included in textbooks now, there is a need to make sure that these are bias free. Trezise proposes three general criteria to judge the adequacy of textbooks: (1)  historical facts must be interpreted fairly and in the light of current historical research, (2) the accomplishments and contributions of minorities in textbooks should be presented realistically, and (3) textbooks should convey that certain values are intrinsically a part of the American system. Textbooks should describe the real world if we accept in educational terms a premise of cultural pluralism and its implications for education. Placing information about minorities in textbooks helps the reader to deal with the total experience of man. Education and textbooks can and should be the agents of cultural change. (Author/JR)",

Critical thinking skills can be taught by examining the problems inherent in a democratic society. Background materials and some teaching suggestions are presented to the teacher for dealing successfully with social problems in the classroom. Part one of the document provides theoretical and practical aspects of handling controversial issues, including teacher preparation and  models. Part two offers examples of specific areas of controversy. Chapter titles include \"Should Traditional Sex Models and Values Be Changed\"; \"Should the Study of Death Be a Necessary Preparation for Living\"; \"Should the Majority Rule\"; \"Should Integration be a Societal Goal in a Pluralistic Nation\"; \"Should We Believe That Our Planet is in Peril\"; and \"Should the Nation-State Give Way to Some Form of World Organization?- (Author/JR)",

The future of American Studies is briefly discussed. Other American Studies programs brought to attention by an ERIC search are abstracted and two that appear effective are evaluated.

The teacher center functions to: (a) identify common priorities of the school and university systems, and jointly design projects and programs of inservice, preservice, and curriculum development; (b) provide a resource facility for faculty, students, and community where ideas and problems are shared; and (c) experiment in organizational governance and differentiated staffing. The following assumptions elucidate the Minneapolis school system's position toward alternatives: (a) if the alternatives movement is to reflect more genuine choice, that choice should emanate from legitimate values differing from the goals and processes of  schools in the community; (b) the alternative schools must possess a variety of explicit options; and (c) the community needs more explicit models of schools to choose from and modify. Parallel to these developments, the College of Education developed the following objectives: (a) to explore ways of training teachers and deciding what different teacher roles may be needed; and (b) to develop training programs conceptualized in terms of school programs and the role needs of teachers in those programs. Both the University and the school system agree that their Project OPEN, and other types of change strategies as well, are needed to provide training for pre- and inservice teachers to better acquire those skills needed to teach in open schools or in an open classroom environment.

        "description":"Knowledge production and utilization (KPU) involves the communication and transfer technology of a discipline. In education as in other areas, the problems with KPU are due to (a) a lack of common language or frame of reference, (b) the sudden vast amount of research, and (c) the lack of a firm knowledge based on educational knowledge utilization. Given the newness of the effort and the many perspectives that may be taken, difficulties exist in sorting out systems levels--roles, relationships, and activities--among producers, diffusers, and consumers of education. However, knowledge and technology production is located in all the above systems levels, and is moved by three types of transfers: (a) those within the confines of the specific user system itself; (b) by direct  horizontal or indirect vertical transfers from one user system to another; or (c) by transfers directly from specialized resource systems or indirectly through mediating systems. Two information networks, the research and development (R&amp;D) network, and the practice improvement network, utilize these methods of transfer. However, successful installation of these networks into an organization involves changing structure, technology, or people's behaviors. Consequently, utilizing these methods in research, development, disseminaton, and evaluation (RDD&amp;E) is difficult, costly, and risky; although it is still being undertaken by a great variety of education organizations.

The author first presents examples of integrative decisions. These examples involve (a) teacher planning, (b) classroom interaction, and (c) pupil feedback. The author uses these examples to demonstrate that there are differences in the ways teachers collect and process information. According to the author, little evidence has been collected on a) whether integrative decision-making affects pupil outcomes and b) whether teachers can be trained to become integrative decision-makers. She does, however, propose three basic techniques for training teachers to become more integrative in their decision making. The first technique involves comparing alternative  procedures. The author states that this technique helps teachers become more integrative in their planning decision. The second technique concerns adapting procedures to pupil differences. According to the author, this process will help teachers become more integrative in their interactive decisions. The third technique shows teachers how to monitor interactive decisions in order to help them become more integrative in their use of feedback. (PB)",

Conditions surrounding education and schooling have, in the past century, become much more complex. What teacher education needs now, as it once had, is an integrating force which will serve to make possible the meaningful systematization of knowledge about the teaching process. The most useful integrating force is professional scholarship, which is distinguished from academic scholarship by its focus on study of practice. The total institutional environment is responsible for generating the conditions that bring about disposition toward scholarship. The unique function of the college of education is inquiry into professional practice, and such inquiry must be what integrates and gives meaning to the collegiate preparation of professional scholars who will teach.

It was assumed that a reduction of examination and public speaking anxiety through such techniques would improve student performance. Three subjects participated in the study--all female, 30 years old, and fulltime students. Inclusion in the study required that anxiety have an inhibitory effect on the student's performance. The subjects were gradually and systematically introduced to anxiety-producing situations while in a state of relaxation. The situations were organized according to degree of anxiety produced, and the subjects continued to a higher anxiety situation only when the previous situation had ceased to cause anxiety, i.e.,  when the students had been desensitized. Later sessions switched to behavioral rehearsal and in-vivo approaches to phobic situations. Each subject reported significant improvement that was also noticed by teachers, classmates, and friends. The study concludes that efforts should be made to allow for optimal student performance whether within traditional education or competency-based/performance-based teacher education programs. (PB)",

There was much argument for change in the 1950s, but it was Sputnik that sparked action in the field of education. The assumption at that time was that if the U.S. was technologically \"behind,\" the schools were to blame. Federal funds for schools began as an \"emergency\" measure. These funds were renewed year after year until, by 1964, they had taken on the characteristics of a permanent federal allocation. By the end of the Kennedy administration and the beginning of the Johnson administration, \"national defense\" was perceived in more subtle terms. It became evident that there were also domestic problems that could cripple our society. Equality of educational opportunity became very important. Much  legislation was passed at that time and the field became saturated with innovations. In a few years, however, students began protesting \"lack of relevance\" and it was alleged that differences among schools didn't make much difference. We have now entered a period of reaction--a desire to \"return to the basics.\" To advocate a return to \"traditional\" education, however, is to ignore all that has been learned in the past 10 years. Specifically, we know that each student has differing aptitudes for different subjects. The task for the 1970s is not to go back to basics; it is to use well-planned programs of educational improvement such as individually guided education (IGE) to move forward to basics. (PB)",

        "description":"The Committee on the Role and Status of Women within the American Educational Research Association (AERA) decided to send a series of questionnaires to universities, school districts, state departments of education, and major research and development organizations in order to analyze the respective roles and statuses of men and women within AERA. The purpose of these questionnaires was to determine (a) the relative position and status of women as students in doctoral programs in education; (b) the status of women on the faculties of institutions which train educational researchers; and (c) the status of women as employees in research organizations, local school districts, and state education departments. It was found that women consistently fall in the lower job ranks as  determined by responsibility and salary. Even in job categories at the lower end of the rankings, women were paid less than their male counterparts. It was also found that most employers of educational researchers have adopted affirmative action plans, but that a discrepancy exists between adoption and implementation of these plans. While it was found that maternity leave plans are generally available, very few paternity leave plans exist--constituting further evidence of sexually discriminatory practices. Finally, it was noted that heavy reliance exists among friends and colleagues in universities or other research organizations for the recruiting of personnel, which is discriminatory since equal access cannot be guaranteed with such measures.

After receiving instruction in brushing and flossing, students in one experimental group were confronted with inconsistencies between expressed beliefs and actual oral hyginene behaviors, as demonstrated with photographs of their own mouths. Data analyses indicated that when a measure based on photographs was used, these students' plaque scores (measuring oral cleanliness) measured at one, six, and twelve weeks after treatment, were significantly lower then the control group or the group receiving instruction only. Scores of students who participated in verbal rehearsals of correct oral hygiene procedures also revealed immediate improvements, but these changes were not maintained. When  clinical measures of plaque and gingivitis scores obtained in the field were used, no significant differences were found between the mean scores of the control group and any of the three treatment groups.

Questions asked concerned the students' perceptions of (a) the role of the elementary school classroom teacher, (b) their feelings of adequacy in performing that role, and (c) the value of their university courses in helping them prepare for that role. In general, it was found that students perceived the role realistically in terms of what they observed, had serious concerns regarding their ability to function adequately in the role as they saw it, and placed greater faith in experience than in the college classroom for gaining the competencies  necessary for alleviating these concerns.

The ratio and its component parts are determined from only three gas fractions: (a) alveolar carbon dioxide, (b) expired carbon dioxide, and (c) expired oxygen. Exercise was conducted on a bicycle ergometer at a power load of 900 kpm/min, and an open circuit method, adapted for the determination of end-tidal carbon dioxide, was used for gas analysis. Significant differences (.025 level) were found between each of the three athletic groups and the sedentary group, but no differences were found between the athletic  groups. Athletes had a higher pulmonary function ratio, a higher oxygen extraction, and a lower alveolar ventilation than the sedentary subjects. (Author/JS)",

A program of progressive relaxation can be easily incorporated into elementary and secondary schools. Objectives of such a program include the following: (a) to learn to relax technically for purposes of complete rest (deep muscle relaxation), and (b) to learn to relax away needless tension in order that everyday activity might proceed with greater efficiency (differential or selective relaxation). In a series of lessons, the student can be taught to recognize the tension signal in specific muscle groups. The recognition phase is accomplished while the student is moderately contracting a specified group of muscles. Once identified, less contraction often elicits the signal  even though there may be no visible contraction. If the training has been successful, such unwarranted tensions are simply relaxed away and the advent of a new habit pattern of efficiency is thus encouraged. Relaxation programs can be conducted without sophisticated apparatus for support and testing Biofeedback devices may be available for school use within a decade. (JS)",

        "description":"The current status of career education can be described at local, state, and national levels. Although 5,000 of the 17,000 school districts in the U.S. have initiated some kind of career education effort, fewer than 500 have received federal funds. The quantity of effort expended at the local school district level has exceeded the quality by a very wide margin. State involvement has been strong--both in preparing materials for career education and in funding--and is continuing to grow in strength. At the federal level, career education has received considerably more rhetoric than concrete action. Many professional organizations have studied and endorsed the career education concept. When one considers this combination of local, state, and national activity in career education, it  seems appropriate to conclude that career education represents a topic that should no longer be ignored by teacher education institutions. There are some assumptions that teacher education institutions should consider as they adopt positions and take actions regarding career education. These are: (a) that the increasingly close relationships between education and the world of paid employment should be reflected in educational change; (b) that the word \"work\" is a viable one for use in the conceptualization of career education; (c) that the days of educational isolationism, both within and outside our formal education system, are past; and (d) that all professional educators are key functionaries in implementation of the career education concept.

An ancillary concern was to develop instruments which could be validated for use in further studies. In this study, significantly bothersome and frequently perceived problems of teachers were considered to be educationally significant events. The procedure used to identify and verify these educationally significant events were as follows: (a) descriptions of \"raw problems\" were solicited from teachers over a 10-day period, (b) the descriptions were synthesized for the purpose of developing  a checklist, and (c) the checklist was administered to an independent sample of teachers in order to determine specific problems and problem clusters that were reported as most bothersome and that occurred most frequently. The results suggest two different conclusions. The first is that teacher problems consist largely of role-related strivings which the teacher generally has not previously encountered and for which s/he is unprepared. The second is that the global areas of teacher problems are not unlike global areas of people generally (i.e., there is no dichotomy of general and role-derived needs), but the problems may seem different because being the \"teacher\" exacerbates particular general human needs or goals, making them more difficult to attain.

Difficulties in instigating change in schools are due to: (a) diffused and poorly defined school goals and objectives; (b) a school environment of conflicting and contradictory expectations from parents and other taxpayers; (c) an uncompetitive school environment; and (d) minimal control by schools over the people they educate. An important determinant of an organization's ability to define and diagnose its problems is its technology and the degree to which members share the technology. People should first agree that change is necessary to alleviate a problem, and second, agree that the particular change decided on is  the best one. Reaching such consensus is facilitated by precise and shared organizational ends as well as a highly developed and shared organizational technology. School rated lower than business on such change-promoting factors. By implication, change in schools would be more difficult and less frequent than in organizations which were high in such factors.

        "description":"This paper reviews the current state of the art in competency identification procedures for competency/performance based teacher education (C/PBTE) programs within the context of an overall strategy to improve teacher education through the generation of knowledge about teaching and learning. Strengths and weaknesses of theoretical approaches, task analysis procedures, and course conversion methods all suggest the need for further work on methodology and indicate that while there are numerous routes to competency identification, no single route would be best under all circumstances. Theoretical approaches are most likely to result in conceptually unified programs--but can only be useful to the extent that the underlying theories have good explanatory power in the real world. Task  analysis procedures for competency identification run the risk of being too firmly tied to what actually goes on in the real world to result in the generation of new knowledge about teaching and learning. Course conversion methods of identifying teaching competencies, while probably the most expedient approach, can easily result in program fragmentation and, unless combined with a more theoretical orientation, are not likely to produce fruitful hypotheses for continuing research. An eclectic approach combining the best features of all these methods may be the most useful for accomplishing the task, although the question of which is the best or most useful can only be answered through a continuing process of program evaluation and competency validation research.

A fixed-alternative questionnaire was administered to 585 women who were currently active in sport. Results indicated that peers and family were the significant agents of socialization during childhood, peers and school were most significant during adolescence, and peers were most significant during adulthood. Also, a dominant influence from male rather than female role models was evident during childhood, partially evident during adolescence, but rejected at the adult stage as female role models became more significant. It was also found that a stronger reference group influence was associated with younger ages, while a stronger opportunity set was not. No statistically  significant relationship was found in the comparison of correlations between reference group influence and active sport involvement. It was also found that sport type was a function of socioeconomic status. Team sport participants tended to come from a low socioeconomic background, while individual and dual sports participants were identified with a higher socioeconomic status. No relationship was found between sport type and family versus peer influence. Nor was any found when socioeconomic status and type of reference group influence were examined. (PB)",

Analysis of the clinical data revealed some developmental dynamics that may characterize all subjects: a deep desire to excel, early goal-setting and the ability to follow through with these goals, a strong self-concept, well-developed heterosexuality, and parents who were supportive and had high expectations of their daughters. Analysis of the EPPS data revealed two pronunced psychological variables: a high need for  achievement and a high need for autonomy.

Each girl was filmed executing the standing broad jump on two separate occasions. On the second try the girls were randomly assigned to one of three groups. One group of 10 girls was treated with the videotape feedback experimental factor, while the second group of 10 girls was treated with a one dollar monetary reward experimental factor. The third group served as a control group.

Sports and physical education held a minor place in Russian society prior to 1917, but with the onset of communism, the fundamental credo became that sports and physical education were for the masses and not solely for the elite. Since 1917, sports and physical education have had a powerful organizational nucleus with the rights and priveleges of a ministry in the Soviet government. Although sports organizations or committees under the control of the Community party have changed names, they have basically remained the same as far as goals, administration, and organization. The functions of these committees are  stated as being to (a) perfect the scientific system of bringing sports within the reach of the whole population, (b) build and operate sports facilities, (c) train coaches and instructors, (d) manufacture sports goods and equipment, (e) stage country-wide competitions, and (f) maintain international contacts and cooperate with other state agencies as well as the trade unions and Young Communist League organizations. The promotion and administration of sports is to be carried out by the party, government, trade unions, Young Communist League, and sports organizations. (Author/PB)",

Its purpose was to determine the influence of school characteristics on mobility, taking into account the influence of teaching-staff composition. This report describes the (a) relations between school characteristics and the characteristics of teachers assigned to schools--a resource allocation problem, (b) relationships between teacher characteristics and mobility, and (c) direct relationships between school characteristics and teacher mobility. The schools studied ranged in size from 100 to 1,200 pupils. On the average, 30 percent of the pupils had Spanish surnames. Four school characteristics were examined in relation to transfer, separation, and leave of  absence of teachers: school size, racial-ethnic distribution of (a) pupils and (b) teachers, and pupil socioeconomic status. The effects of teacher characteristics on teacher mobility are summarized from an earlier study. The major findings were (a) leave of absence and separation were determined solely by teachers' personal characteristics, not by school characteristics; (b) transfer was directly influenced by the socioeconomic status (SES) of the schools' student body, because SES affected the attractiveness of a school to teachers (the rate of transfer was higher in low-income schools); and (c) schools' SES also influenced the composition of teaching staffs, which in turn affected the rate of transfer.

According to the introduction, the program began a three-year cycle of assessment in grades 3, 6, and 9 and was designed to collect a broad base of information on educational needs from students, teachers, and principals. The report is divided into two sections: (a) the primary and elementary teachers' questionnaire, and (b) the primary and elementary principals' report. Each section includes a summary of highlights and a detailed presentation of results. Conclusions drawn from the study indicate that (a) elementary teacher attitudes are good; (b) teachers consistently report good performance from principals; (c)  teachers desire help with special education problems; (d) more practical inservice programs are needed; (e) additional funds for supplies and materials should be allocated; and (f) there is a need for support personnel. Apprendixes include the following: (a) a sample teacher questionnaire; (b) a sample school information questionnaire; (c) summary response data elicited from the questionnaires and (d) assumptions and calculations regarding spending on teacher benefits, new personnel, and institutional materials.

This questionnaire was distributed to current as well as former participants. Major recommendations included the following: (a) program goals and objectives and criteria for competent teaching must be more precisely defined; (b) modules should be rewritten to include descriptions of objectives and assessment criteria, and specification of the approximate amount of time required to  complete the module; (c) the role of cooperating teachers should be more adequately defined; (d) the role of college personnel should be changed to include more field-based involvement and the assumption of more responsibility for the total education of the intern; and (e) participants should be more adequately prepared for involvement in the program.

A total of 289 classrooms involving eight experimental programs, ranging from open classrooms to contingency management classes, along with a comparison sample, were observed. Four observation instruments were used; two were coded during the classroom observation, and two were coded from audio tape. Factor scores were calculated for each set of observation data and used to test discrimination between programs. The scores were also related to classroom mean pupil regressed gain which had been scored to identify different levels of complexity. Observation was successful in discriminating between programs, with 33 of 39 factors significant. Results  indicated that classroom measures and pupil gain showed more significant relationship with skill than with abstract or concrete growth. Although there were inconsistencies, gain in skill was related to greater amounts of (a) focus, (b) drill, (c) convergence, (d) structured activity with the teacher and time spent on reading, and (e) lesser amounts of pupil freedom.

Chapters 3-5 discuss concrete experiences with collaboration in Washington State and abstract considerations of inservice education. Chapter 6 questions traditional practices, functions, and terminology regarding certification and  inservice education, and considers new roles for teacher organizations in a changing political context. Chapter 7 presents a discussion based on a preworkshop reading of chapters 5 and 6. Chapter 8 reports on the discussions of 87 selected people who read the first seven chapters, examined the purposes and assumptions stated earlier, and developed recommendations for rethinking inservice education.

Each of the four participating teams consisted of 12 runners. Each runner ran approximately 10 miles, one mile at a time. The powerlifting meet included the bench press, dead lift, squat, and a physique exhibition by Mr. U.S.A. 1974. The rodeo involved dummy roping, calf dressing, bull dogging, goat tying, and riding a bucking barrel.

TRQ ratings on nearly 14,000 pupils, gathered in the Study of Achievement and a New Canadian Report, constituted the data source. Questionnaire performance was determined in a variety of ways: comparison of teachers' ratings and student promotions estimation of TRQ total score, section and question reliability; grade independence; and relationships between TRQ sections. In addition to a theoretical discussion of item effectiveness and correlations among items a detailed statistical analysis was undertaken of the ratings for a sample of students who had been assessed on  all forms in the longitudinal study. While validity of TRQ adjustment and creative-expression sections was not directly demonstrated, a reasonable degree of correlation with other measures of academic success (standardized achievement test, I.Q., promotios) was found reflecting the overall validity of the TRQ, especially the performance section. A large part of the differences between any two sets of TRQ ratings were found due to differences in teacher interpretation and their perceptions of pupils. (Author/BJG)",

        "description":"A 15-stage pyramidal test and a 40-item two-stage test were constructed and administered by computer to 111 college undergraduates. The two-stage test was found to utilize a smaller proportion of its potential score range than the pyramidal test. Score distributions for both tests were positively skewed but not significantly different from the normal distribution. The pyramidal test's score distributions tended to be platykurtic while the two-stage test's distribution tended to be leptokurtic. The assignment of subjects to measurement subtests in the two-stage test was more accurate than in a previous empirical investigation since the misclassification rate was less than 1%. Comparison of scoring methods for the pyramidal strategy supported earlier findings that the average  difficulty scoring methods were most useful. The correlations between scores on the two adaptive strategies ranged from r=.79 to .84. Both adaptive strategies appeared to adapt item difficulties to individual differences in abilities so as to reduce chance effects due to guessing. The pyramidal strategy seemed to be slightly more successful in eliminating guessing than the two-stage strategy. Results are discussed with respect to internal consistency reliabilities, stabilities, and the relation of each strategy to conventional testing. Simulation studies are suggested to further delineate the optimum characteristids of each testing strategy. (Author)",

This paper reports on work carried out by the author to further research and development of this measure related to human relations. An analysis is made based on three elements which are necessary for defining interest dimensions: (1) the sample of problematic situations, (2) a sampling of alternative courses of action, and (3) the task given the respondent to study. In each of the inventories, the situations consist of short paragraphs depicting a problem in human relations. The problem situations were those that might occur at elementary and high school levels. These were also situations in which the teacher may interact with her students. A rating scale was  developed and administered to the groups. Methodology used included varimax rotation, oblique factors and correlations among oblique factors. The questionnaire used in gathering the data on problematic situations is included. (Author/DEP)",

These objectives were addressed in 19 sessions where an effort was made to provide an in-depth focus on a limited number of evaluation techniques while providing relevant theoretical coverage. Problems faced included addressing the sessions to the different levels of sophistication of the participants, conducting the  sessions in a building with a high noise level and uncomfortable seats, and maintaining seminar continuity for participants with work conflicts. The seminar was generally viewed as a meaningful first step in the training of Venezuelan evaluators. The United States/Venezuela partnership in financing this special program was deemed positive.

While both techniques produce similar results, the variation in procedure used to obtain the data has limited most direct comparisons. Because of this, the differences between the several methods of making the evaluations have not been adequately explored. In this study, three methods of associate (peer) evaluation--one rating procedure and two nomination procedures--were compared in terms of reliability, interrelationships of techniques, relationships with other leadership measures, and relationships with concurrent performance measures. All three evaluations yielded levels of reliability adequate for use in short-range individual selections; all three  methods measured the same individual attributes. The nomination method was suggested as the clear choice for operational use because of the additional benefits of minimal rater resistance, ease of scoring, and simple administration. (Author)",

        "description":"This volume reports an effort to use the video media as an approach for the preparation of a battery of symbolic tests that would be empirically valid substitutes for criterion referenced Job Task Performance Tests. The graphic symbolic tests require the storage of a large amount of pictorial information which must be searched rapidly for display. At the time this video effort was started, no completely satisfactory way had been found for rapidly searching and displaying such information. The anticipated results that the video media would provide satisfactory and economical solutions to these problems did not materialize. From a testing point of view, video symbolic tests place the test subject in a passive evaluative role of watching someone else perform each task. Success in  this passive role does not ensure his success in the active role of performing the same task. Also, the development costs of the video tests proved to be very high in terms of video equipment and test development time. To obtain video materials of acceptable quality, would require both quality video equipment and studio production facilities. As a result, it was recommended that video should not be further considered as a testing medium for performance analogues and that future efforts should be aimed at improving and refining graphic symbolic substitute tests.

The strategy and objectives of a longitudinal assessment of children's conceptual learning and development are presented. Perspective is provided regarding the role of the present cross-sectional study in the longitudinal assessment. For the present study, assessment batteries were developed to assess each child's level of concept attainment and also the related use of the concepts equilateral triangle and cutting tool. Both batteries were designed as paper-and-pencil tasks and administered to 100 children enrolled in each of four grades: kindergarten, third, sixth, and ninth. Predictions based on the model  about children's conceptual development were strongly supported across both concepts. The two concepts were attained in an invariant sequence according to four successive levels: concrete, identity, classificatory, and formal. As the concepts were attained to higher levels they were used increasingly (a) in cognizing supraordinate-subordinate relationships in a hierarchy where the attained concept was an element of the hierarchy, (b) in understanding principles that stated a relationship between the attained concept and one or more other concepts, and (c) in solving problems that required the use of the particular concept. Having the labels of the concept and of its defining attributes facilitated (a) attainment of the concept and (b) mastery of the three uses of the concept.  (Author)",

While the assessment of cognitive development has received the primary thrust of research efforts thus far, most child experts would agree that the child's affective development is of equal importance to his total well-being. The Purdue Social Attitudes Scale (PSAS) focuses on the latter. Research programs have been developed to determine the validity and reliability of this scale. The test booklets contain cartoon-type picture stories. The examiner reads the legend under each picture to the child. The child then selects the face which he thinks properly completes each story and places a pencil-mark in the  box under that face. (Author/BJG)",

The Brazilian educational structure has three degree levels with the First Degree covering the first eight years of schooling, the Second Degree covering the next three, and the Third Degree all additional education. Students who are classified are admitted to the First Cycle of the Third Degree which consists of a year's preparation for professional programs. Classification follows a predetermined quota for a major area of study. Only those students who have declared a major area of  study and who have a high ranking will be classified. The new legislation requires that the content of entrance examinations should correspond to the difficulty level of the core courses of language, social studies, science, and mathematics in the Second Degree schools and that the examinations should be objective, avoid questions involving sheer memorization, and test scores should be transformed into standard scores.

It is often useful to know what the distribution of items completed would be if the number of items on the test were much larger. It may also be of interest to estimate the correlation between working speed, as measured by the number of items completed, and the total score. The method described assumes that working speed and total score are bivariate normally distributed in the population of interest and allows estimation of the means and standard deviations for items completed and total score, and the correlation between items completed and total score given a theoretically infinite number of items in the same time limit.

        "description":"The effects of the violation of the assumption of normality coupled with the condition of multicollinearity upon the outcome of testing the hypothesis Beta equals zero in the two-predictor regression equation is investigated. A monte carlo approach was utilized in which three differenct distributions were sampled for two sample sizes over thirty-four population correlation matrices. The preliminary results indicate that the violation of the assumption of normality has significant effect upon the outcome of the hypothesis testing procedure. As was expected, however, the population correlation matrices with extremely high collinearity between the independent variables resulted in large standard errors in the sampling distributions of the standardized regression coefficients. Also,  these same population correlation matrices revealed a larger probability of committing a type II error. Many researchers rely on beta weights to measure the importance of predictor variables in a regression equation. With the presence of multicollinearity, however, these estimates of population standardized regression weights will be subject to extreme fluctuation and should be interpreted with caution, especially when the sample size involved is relatively small.

The main question addressed in this evaluation was whether each of seven Follow Through sponsors had successfully implemented his program in a variety of sites. The steps in the evaluation of implementation included: (1) a determination of the essential program components, (2) a translation of these components in terms of observable phenomena, (3) a measure of the phenomena, and (4) a standard by which to judge implementation. The SRI approach was formulated in the context of the SRI Classroom Observation Instrument in liaison with the Follow Through sponsors. Only program components that could be  translated into observation variables were included in the analysis. To focus on the innovative aspects of the Follow Through programs, the standard established to assess implementation was based on comparisons with Non-Follow Through Classrooms. Implementation scores were derived for individual observation variables, and a total implementation score was derived for each classroom. While all sponsors' classrooms had mean total implementation scores that were significantly different from the Non-Follow Through scores, there were differences in the pattern of implementation among sponsors.

In 1972-73 the higher education system was comprised of 158 institutions: eight universities, 54 &quot;B.A. granting&quot; colleges, and 96 junior colleges. In 1972-73, 13 institutions selected their students through centralized entrance examination (CEE). The other institutions selected their students through separate entrance exams. The CEE is carried out by the Testing Center of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education once a year in the summer. The CEE is composed of objective tests combined as a test battery and supposed to measure intelligence, abilities of applicants in the Persian language and a foreign  language, Natural and Social Sciences, and Mathematics. The combination of these subjects depends on the areas of major emphasis in high school. Because of recent correlational studies between high school grades, CEE scores, and college achievement in the first two years, one university has the first time selected students based on high school grades, rather than testing. Recommendations for further improvement are offered. (RC)",

The names were encoded as identification numbers onto optical scanning sheets, which were then transfered to magnetic tape. Initial compilation of frequencies of nomination was carried out for 13,000 pupils. Four clear factors were obtained from analysis of 29 nomination sociometric items. Reliability estimates for the four  factor scales are moderate, but adequate for comparison of groups. Educable Mentally Retarded (EMR) and Learning Disabled (LD) are perceived to have a definite cognitive deficit, and to be more disruptive in their behavior than normal peers.

There remains, however, a need for state agencies to compare the results of local districts to a variety of comparison groups for the purpose of identifying where the greatest needs lie. This paper deals with nonparametric techniques for the comparison of matrices of criterion-referenced scores (rather than the comparison of means). Specific examples include chi square, the median test, rank correlation, the Wilcoxon tests, Kendall's W, and others. (Author)",

It provided a systematic bilingual program for Spanish-background pupils who lacked experiential background and who needed special attention with basic content at the same time they were developing language skills in English and Spanish. In the program, all subjects were taught in both English and Spanish to enable the pupil to learn subject matter in the comfort of his dominant language. Teachers were bilingual and of Latin heritage. Pupils who started the program in kindergarten or first grade were expected to be at least average for their grade level. At the secondary  level, bilingual reading and social studies courses were developed and bilingual students' advisors and counselors assisted with education and personal problems. Biculturalism was a twin goal with bilingualism. Spanish-American culture was emphasized to replace negative self-image with ethnic pride. (Author/BJG)",

The questionnaires are designed to obtain information about potential problems in schools which may be amenable to treatment by mental health indirect services program carried out by mental health consultants and members of the schools' staff. The guide should help consultants and principals gain a comprehensive picture of their schools which would aid them in problem solving. Part I, in addition,  contains outlines on the necessary steps to be taken to obtain the interview and questionnaire data, statistical procedures involved in data analysis and guidelines for the assigning of priorities for the interpretation of data from three sources. Part II is an exploration of the general meanings of reliability and validity. It is concluded that measures of internal consistency are the most appropriate measures of reliability. Face validity and demonstrations of the utility of the instruments seem most appropriate in addressing the issue of validity. (Author/BJG)",

Exotic designs are avoided and five basic models which appear feasible to implement in real-world settings are focused on. Each is briefly summarized in terms of general characteristics, strengths and weaknesses, and considerations relating to its implementation. Twelve hazards which are commonly encountered in educational evaluation and which may completely invalidate otherwise sound studies are described. A procedural guide, in decision-tree form, for selecting a suitable evaluation model given the particular set of constraints faced by the project director  and the evaluator is presented. The sections on implementation are intended for use by evaluation specialists and are somewhat technical. It is assumed that the reader will have had a least one college-level course in elementary statistics. Ways of analyzing, interpreting, and reporting results are suggested, and details of recommended procedures are included.

In achieving an understanding of the design of these efforts it is important to recognize that the first projects, e.g. the Demonstration Guidance Project, Higher Horizons, established a virtually universally followed model of educational intervention which: (1) employed a \"deficit\" model to account for differential rates of academic achievement; (2) offered supportive educational services; (3) worked with a segment of the \"disadvantaged\" population; and, (4) concentrated on the development of reading and mathematical skills. While most of the studies considered possess serious methodological weaknesses, the resulting evidence  nevertheless suggests that the projects have increased the numbers of students graduating from high school and applying to, enrolling in, and graduating from college. The findings also indicate some positive impact in the areas of academic values, attitudes and motivations. But neither the gap in academic achievement between \"disadvantaged\" and \"advantaged\" students nor the academic achievements of participating students relative to non-program students from similar backgrounds seems to have been affected.

Further analyses dealt with racial balance in the class, grade level taught and perceived socioeconomic background of the pupils. Classroom observations, discussions with elementary teachers, and a review of related research and literature led to the development of the following hypotheses: (1) younger teachers will be more accepting of dialects characterized as non-standard than older teachers; (2) male teachers will be more accepting than female teachers; (3) academic background of the teachers will be reflected in the attitudes they express. Those with more degrees  will be more accepting; (4) teachers with five years or less of teaching experience will be more accepting of non-standard dialects than more experienced teachers; and, (5) race will have no significant effect on the attitudes expressed.

The purpose of this paper was to draw together statistical data on women and minorities in areas such as labor force, education, income and occupations. The Commission plans to utilize it for a variety of purposes. Primary among these is to identify those practices which have a disparate effect on a particular group. The data will be used also in the educational forum. The Commission is attempting to give more attention to work directed at halting discriminatory practices  prior to the filing of a formal complaint. Further it can be used to disprove some myths about women and Indians. Several agencies and departments of state government were contacted to compile this data. The most useful, despite the under reporting of minorities, proved to be the reports of the Bureau of the Census. The Bureau of Indian Affairs was very helpful in gathering data for Indians on/near the reservations.

        "description":"The New Orleans Parent-Child Development Center (NOPCDC) was funded four years ago to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a model of parent education. The ultimate goal was to prevent the effects of poverty on human development. The parent education program was designed to increase the mother's knowledge and understanding about child development and to change her parenting behavior toward her child in ways which, theoretically, should lead to the development of competence in her child. NOPCDC developed and tested two alternate models of parent education, a Center-based program and a Home-Visit program. The Center program included several treatment elements which the Home-Visit Model did not. The major instrument for evaluating changes in optimal mother behavior was the  Mother-Child Interaction Scale, an observational procedure. Child development was measured through a battery of standardized and more discrete tests of cognitive abilities. Results from both the pilot wave and the first experimental wave, including Center, Home-Visit, and comparison groups, indicated that the Center model was extremely effective in aiding mothers to become effective enhancers of child development. The Center children began to diverge developmentally relative to the control children approximately one year after the mothers showed improvement. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This study examined the effects of family size on a sample of some 5000 students in Bayamon, Puerto Rico and examined the effects of family size and spacing on some 537 families in four suburban towns near Boston. It was found that there were major effects of both socio-economic status and religion on family size, but that the direction of the effect was opposite in the two samples. In the U.S. higher status families tended to have more children than their counterparts in Puerto Rico. In the U.S. non-Catholics tended to have smaller families than the Catholics, while in Puerto Rico the non-Catholics had the larger families. Both in Puerto Rico and the U.S. small family mothers were more likely to have worked both prior to and after marriage than large family mothers. In both  cultures small family children felt more accepted by their parents. Generally, small family children in both cultures were more intelligent and did better in school than did large family children. American children distantly spaced from the next youngest child were more oriented toward college. When two children were closely spaced, the older was more authoritarian and the younger was more obedient, serious, emotionally stable, and careless of protocol. Both younger and older siblings were less intelligent if they were closely spaced. (Author/JM)",

The implementation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 has engendered an  increasing amount of literature on the scope, problems and policies involved. Title VIII prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, financing or marketing of housing, establishes remedies for such discrimination, and requires all Federal departments and agencies to administer their programs and activities in a manner affirmatively to further fair housing policies.

In 1970 and 1971, the Center for Urban Education (CUE) conducted an extensive survey of a sample of New York City schools and school neighborhoods. A portion of the CUE data is directly relevant to the substantive and methodological questions raised here. Of the 48 public elementary schools in the sample used in this  study, 22 had student populations that were 70 percent or more black, 26 had student populations that were 70 percent or more white. Within each racial grouping, the sample selection procedures were designed to insure inclusion of schools reflecting the full range of existing variability in community SES. Once the sample was selected, data about these schools were gathered from school system records, interviews with personnel in each school, Parent Association presidents and a sample of mothers whose children attended each of these schools.

Three purposes guided the design of that study of educational change and race from 1958 to 1972: First, there was the fundamental curiosity to discover the changing nature of participation by the Black community in the creation and implementation of public educational policy. This general purpose was transformed into an empirical description and analysis of Black involvement in selected aspects of the educational institution. The nexus between the Newark Board of Education and the Black community was the primary object of study. A second basic purpose was to develop an interpretative understanding of the changes which occurred in the arenas of race and education. The third basic purpose  was to gain systematic insights that have applied significance for those concerned with revitalization of the Black community and in the improvement of the educational institution in Newark. Following the presentation of this paper, the author participated in a seminar discussion of his paper with 21 scholars, educators, administrators and concerned citizens chaired by Ron Edmonds, Director, Center for Urban Studies, Harvard Graduate School of Education.

The California Supreme Court in Serrano v Priest declared wealth and expenditure disparities that favor the wealthy in violation of the equal protection provision of the U.S. and California constitutions. Legislatures have proposed a number of ways to satisfy the implied mandate and eventually attain quality of expenditures.  This paper concludes that more equality of expenditures may well result in less equity of expenditures for Black children. Quality education for Black children cannot be bought in a system designed for white culture with equal dollars. One position advocated is that relevant educators demand equal funding for a Black perspective on all major research that threatened to have a major impact on the Black community. (Author/JM)",

Put politely, it is necessary to know whether social scientists may be induced to use their research to arrive at premeditated conclusions. Put bluntly, it is necessary to find out if social scientists can be \"bought\". That brings up the cognate question. It is necessary to know to what extent that government, special interest groups and philanthropic foundations favor or disfavor certain people or points of view. Finally, it is necessary to examine the historical aspects of the relations of social scientists of the past to public policy. Several questions are posed for subsequent debate: (1) how should a core group of critics be composed? (2) how  should this basic group of specialists meet and work themselves into a team? (3) should such a team, once developed, restrict itself to research? (4) an appropriate methodology needs to be fashioned; and, (5) which few subjects should be researched almost immediately? The remainder of his presentation illustrates how revealing it might be to do a systematic study of the impact of social science upon the race relations policies of this nation. (Author/JM)",

The insistence on integrating every public school that is black perpetuates the racially demeaning and unproven assumption that blacks must have a majority-white presence in order to either teacher or learn effectively. This assumption limits the definition of \"integrated schools\" to those which are  predominantly white. The current massive commitment to school integration by the national office of the NAACP, the Legal Defense Fund, and virtually every other legal agency with sufficient legal and financial resources to effective represent the educational interests of black and other minority group students, is questionable on grounds of: (1) historical precedent; (2) parental priorities; (3) educational expertise; and, (4) legal strategies.

Their case rests on three arguments: (1) schooling has been traditionally viewed as the door of access to full participation in the culture. This has not been true for some members of the culture, particularly non-white minorities; i.e. certain socio-cultural factors make it difficult for them to get through the door, Moreover, these \"sub-cultural\" factors are at variance with the demands of the mainstream school; (2) schooling is not the door through which one must pass if one is to have  access to mainstream American life. The explicitly stated role of the school is not the real one; and, (3) this argument focuses on what the various roles of education are and how they affect minorities. The presentation ends with a discussion of some of the authors' research which (1) questions the idea that basic abilities for example, attention, abstraction, etc. are non-transferable; and (2) demonstrates that performance changes are domain specific.

Although \"Starpower\" has been used extensively throughout the country with numerous groups, there is almost no research evaluating its effectiveness in terms of attitude and/or behavior change related to racism and/or sexism. Freshman and transfer students (N=182) attending Maryland's 1974 New Student Orientation Program were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions or a control group. During a two-hour period, the experimental groups played the simulation game followed by a post-game discussion on racism and/or sexism. The control group participated in a social simulation game and  discussion unrelated to racism and/or sexism. Experimental subjects, particularly those who discussed both racism and sexism, indicated significantly more positive attitudes toward blacks and more willingness to support black student growth activities. Males who discussed either sexism only or both racism and sexism demonstrated significantly more positive attitudes toward women and men in non-traditional sex roles. (Author/JM)",

Even rarer have been investigations of their newly forming labor force of professionalizing, bureaucratically employed workers. The purpose here is to advance the study of these nineteenth century professionals by examining the careers of public school teachers in five Northeastern cities. What is meant if increasingly successful employee socialization is measured as increasing durations of stayless quick leavers, more long  stayers, or merely an increase in the median duration? Should variation in the timing of moves within the hierarchy be studied by sampling all moves ever performed by the members of a cohort or is the proper sampling frame the individual career? By looking at successive entrance cohorts it is possible to chart the progress of socialization and career upward mobility. The methods employed emerge from demographic studies of fertility.

A second purpose was to examine the extent to which segregation was increased as a consequence of teacher judgments entering into grouping decisions. Also, an hypothesis relating teachers' own SES backgrounds to SES segregation was examined. Data on reading grouping were collected in 38 fourth, fifth and  sixth grade classrooms in four school districts in central New York State. 114 reading groups based on a total of 914 students were included in the study. In an interviewing situation, teachers were asked to recommend to the following year's teacher an appropriate reading group placement for each of their students.

This appeal is a consolidation of two suits initiated by parents of black children who claim that  they were denied admission to the appellant schools because of their race. The Southern Independent School Association intervened in this action, holding the position that racial discrimination by private schools is not prohibited by section 1981 and, in any event, cannot be prohibited constitutionally. The appeals were from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, at Alexandria. (Author/JM)",

State Advisory Committee members who met with representatives of the State Department of Education left with the impression that the Department had good intentions, but no authority or funds to plan or implement programs in the area of human relations. Since 50 percent of Vermont's teachers are trained in Vermont colleges, there is obvious need for instruction in the area of human  relations and minority groups. The Burlington branch of the NAACP is the only one of the three organizations interviewed by the State Committee that is actively working with schools on the need for multi-racial, multi-ethnic education. Committee members felt that the Vermont Educational Association was the only educational organization aware of the need for education in Vermont concerning human rights and minority groups.

For this study, black students who are currently enrolled in the grade levels under study were used for comparison purposes. In addition, a sample of approximately eight percent of the white students was also utilized in order to investigate the effects of desegregation on the white population. Under the current design, sixth grade centers were established in the previously all black schools. Most sixth grade students in the Metropolitan area attended these centers. The remaining elementary schools in the Metropolitan area were converted to K-Five Centers and black students from the  previously all black schools were bussed into these schools in order to achieve full integration. This report includes a statement of the problem specific to Clark County, a review of the literature regarding the general effects of desegregation throughout the nation, the procedures used in this study, limitations of the study, findings within the District, and conclusions regarding achievement patterns in the Clark County School District.

Page during the winter of 1971-1972. The intent of this controversial document was to defend publicly the right of scientists to pursue the investigation of the role of biologic factors, in human behaviors. The author identifies two historical trends--and perhaps even forces operating within science that contribute to much of the confusion in the current controversy. One is the tendency of scientists to reify or think of theoretical formulations, and especially Descartes' distinction between the mind and body, which are  comfortable ways to think about data as if they are Platonic truths. Behavior genetics, in contrast, identifies the artificiality of the gene-environment distinction and insists on recognizing genetic and non-genetic factors as essential co-determinants of human behavior. Another factor involves the use of the IQ test to select the intellectual elite class. The author concludes by arguing that it is the prime responsibility of the academic community to guard the precious fire of free inquiry. (Author/JM)",

This report is an attempt to look at National Assessment findings over the first four years, beginning in 1969 and ending in 1973. The National Assessment of Educational Progress is an information gathering project which surveys the educational attainments of 9, 13, 17 and 26 to 35-year olds in 10 learning areas. Data were gathered in the learning areas of science, citizenship and writing the first year; reading and literature the second year; social studies and music the third year; mathematics and science for the second time, the fourth year, or 1972-1973. In other words, change data were first reported in science and  appeared in print in March 1975. Looking at results for the various sizes and types of communities (STOC groups) National Assessment considers in its reports, some evidence can be found of persistent patterns of educational attainment. The results in the area of reading are most indicative and underlie all other learning areas. Classification into type of community was based on occupation and place of residence, plus information about communities in which the respondents lived or attended school, but not about the individual.

There are three relevant aspects of a setting, the space and contents of the space, as in the set of a play, the cast of characters who are present on the set, and the activities which occur on the set involving the cast of characters. The author and her associates have studied children in Okinawa, the Philippines, Northern India, Kenya, Mexico and the United States. Findings indicate that the characteristics of the setting evoke and reinforce habits of social interaction which become the core of a child's behavioral profile. To date, the behavior of Kenyon urban children in city settings have not been explored in detail. Since, however, the problems of city life are of concern both to countries which have been long urbanized and to the  developing countries the Child Development Research Unit is embarking on an analysis of the effects of urbanization on Kenyan children. From prior work, some preliminary observation of Kenyan urban children and interviews with urban mothers, an estimate was made of the time young children spend on various sets, the people with whom they interact and the activities they perform. On the basis of findings from the Six Culture Study, some preliminary guesses as to the effects of such variables on children's behavior were made: these are discussed in the body of this report.

The definition of &quot;modern&quot; includes at least three separate indices--the presence of wage earning employment, and formal education, and urban or suburban residence patterns where the urban center is pluralistic in cultural tradition. The work in Kenya suggests that to understand the learning environments which influence behavior of children and the socialization pressures exerted on them, it is necessary to increase the cross cultural sample used to include modern communities. It may well be that without adding these modern  communities, curvilinear relations will be mistaken for monotonic ones. Particularly important for understanding U.S. society are the cumulative effect of complexity, nuclearity and formal education in increasing the proportion of seeking behaviors and decreasing that of offering behaviors. These findings cast some doubt on the validity of the stereotype of the association between individualism, achievement and self reliance. They also raise questions as to the relations of values to behavior. (Author/JM)",

Metcalfe asked the General Accounting Office (GAO) to review implementation of the Medicaid Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) program administered by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare's (HEW's) Social and Rehabilitation Service (SRS). An estimated 10 million children under age 21 are eligible for free physical examinations and medical diagnosis and treatment under the EPSDT provisions of the Social Security Act. GAO examined steps taken to implement EPSDT by SRS and Alabama, Idaho, Illinois, Massachusetts, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Wisconsin. Both HEW and the States have been concerned also with the potential cost of providing EPSDT. As a result, only a small percentage of eligible children have been  screened. Increased outreach efforts are needed. Increased use of allied health professionals is needed. States are not meeting their targeted screening schedules. States need to insure that conditions are treated. The primary recommendation of the GAO is that the Secretary of HEW should direct the Administrator, SRS, to take more aggressive action, including formal compliance hearings, to make States comply with the law and SRS regulations. This report contains no recommendations requiring legislative action by the Congress. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Head Start is a federally funded preschool program for disadvantaged children. In this paper the problems of evaluating Head Start from an economic viewpoint are considered and a reanalysis of the data collected for the 1969 Westinghouse Learning Corporation--Ohio University study is carried out. An evaluation of Head Start is difficult because of conceptual and statistical problems. The conceptual problems deal with the difficulty in translating the benefits of Head Start into dollar terms so that it can be determined if the benefits exceed the costs and if Head Start is the most efficient social action program. Statistical problems arise because it is rarely possible to measure all of the independent variables in the model and some of the independent variables may be measured  with error; these specification errors can lead to biased estimates of program effects. Regression analysis is used in the re-analysis of the Westinghouse data. The findings of the reanalysis are comparable with those of Westinghouse study but differ because of the changes in the structure of the model. The re-analysis suggests that Head Start produces statistically significant cognitive benefits for white children from mother-headed families and minority children; there is no evidence from the data to suggest that these benefits are permanent.

The factors include parental background, number of siblings, national origin, race, intelligence, aspirations, motivations, peer group influences, schools, the influence of wife's characteristics, first job, age at first job, migration, fertility, and child spacing.

Although the mathematical and statistical techniques used are sometimes complex, even the non-technical reader can learn much from the methodological  discussions. Criticisms are presented under four headings: (a) a vagueness of the specific purposes of their analyses; (b) a selection of a mode of presenting their findings which hinders translating them into an understandable language, and thereby impedes useful and practical applications of their results; (c) excessive complexity of the models and sometimes confusing exposition; and (d) a number of dubious rationalizations of the structures of their models and a number of dubious interpretations of some of their empirical results.

The present paper focusses attention on one such variable that has received almost no attention in the literature, namely, experience. The concept of experience is explored, its various forms examined, and then a number of operational measures of experience in models of individuals' earnings are applied. The primary objective is to learn more about the quantitative importance of experience as one (or more than one) determinant of earnings. Also investigated is the quantitative importance of schooling as a determinant  of earnings. Regression estimates are sensitive to the specification and measurement of experience. A body of data is analyzed to assess both the quantitative importance of the various types of experience and the effect of their inclusion on the estimated co-efficient of schooling. This body of data is drawn from a national sample of 3000 male veterans aged 18-35, who were included in the 1964 Current Population Survey. Data for the 965 men for whom complete information was available on the variables of interest was used. (Author/JM)",

Periodic racial-ethnic surveys of public schools by the Office for Civil Rights were authorized under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. A wide variation was found among school districts in the fundamental demographic constraints confronting school systems seeking to desegregate. The percentage Negro among students varied from less than five to more than 90 percent. Among instructional staff the percentage Negro ranges from a low of two percent to a high of 84. Levels of racial segregation estimated by the index of dissimilarity were typically high. The index ranged from a low of 39 in Sacramento to a high of 97 in Tulsa and Oklahoma City. The average  level of school segregation among the 60 cities was 70. The task of desegregation for each city was estimated using an index that reflects both the degree of segregation and the racial composition of students. Cities in the South would have to let an average of 32 percent of their students shift schools compared to 26 percent in the North. Finally the segregation of students of one race from teachers of another was determined. Race of teachers in most school systems continues to be restricted mainly to that of their students.

The weak effect of education on black income might be attributed to the alleged low quality of Negro education provided in parts of the South. The 1967 Survey of Economic Opportunity made it possible to re-examine the education-income relation for a more recent period of labor market experience. The sample consisted of a Current Population Survey for 1967 augmented by a special sample drawn from low-income areas. Among other questions, respondents surveyed were asked their place of residence at age 16. The answer should offer a excellent proxy for geographic source of education. Part 1 of this report is an\"Introduction'. Part 2 builds upon the earlier earnings functions studies using later data and introduces the improved region of education variables. In Part 3, Markov techniques are used to project the black male labor force by region, age and education over the period 1967-68. Then 1967 incomes are applied to these labor-force figures to estimate the expected path of black income and poverty experience over the next two decades. Finally, some conclusions are presented in Part 4. (Author/JM)",

Field techniques employed in ethnological studies and in dietary surveys were followed in this study. The original population consisted of 63 female household heads of southern (predominantly rural) origin who resided in a specific census tract in the central city of Milwaukee. Twenty-three of the sixty-three female household heads participating in the study were intensively interviewed. Measurements were made of one week's food consumption of these 232 families, permitting comparisons of the cost, variety, and nutritive quality of the diet. National and racial  indexes of socioeconomic status were not very useful in classifying the respondents. However, in terms of values, attitudes, beliefs, and practices, three sociocultural groups emerged. Findings of this study are stated to have applications to Office of Economic Opportunity policy concerns. In order to achieve the specific goals of the OEO program, it is necessary to recognize and identify the various subcultural groups residing in target areas which may appear to be homogenous communities.

Discriminatory practices are said to be supported by policies of house builders, lending institutions, and government, and by the prejudice of the white majority. The paper analyzes the racial beliefs and practices of real estate brokers in an attempt to understand the economic incentives that lead brokers to discriminate against blacks. It is argued that a broker's job consists of three steps: (1) attracting customers, (2) matching customers with listings, and (3) finding financing for 'matched' customers. It is then shown that at each of these steps the structure of  the real estate industry interacts with the racial prejudice of the white community and of brokers to give each broker economic incentives to discriminate against blacks. The techniques used by brokers to discriminate are also reviewed, and several proposals designed to eliminate broker discrimination are made: by eliminating brokers' control over information and by eliminating local boards' control over access to listing, one would eliminate the economic incentives to discriminate.

        "author":["Yinger, John"],
        "description":"One crucial step toward an understanding of discrimination against blacks in rental housing is a careful analysis of the landlord's economic incentives. Such analysis does not exist in the literature. This paper develops a model of landlord behavior under perfect competition when both black and white tenants have racial prejudice. This model provides considerable support for open housing legislation and some insight into the design of such legislation. According to this exclusion model, open housing can help eliminate restrictions on the supply of housing available to blacks and reduce the differential between black and white rentals. Open housing will not lead to integration in individual apartment buildings, but this result is due to the prejudice of blacks and whites, not to  any deficiency in the open housing approach to discrimination in housing. Furthermore, the exclusion model indicates that open housing will not be a financial disaster for landlords, and that it will not completely eliminate the black-white rent differential for neighborhoods undergoing racial change. Finally, clearinghouses for apartment information, which significantly lower landlords' incentives to discriminate, will increase the effectiveness of open housing legislation. Several ways to improve the effectiveness of open housing legislation are derived. (Author/JM)",

        "author":["Yinger, John"],
        "description":"Racial prejudice is said to influence strongly the locational decisions of households in urban areas. This paper introduces racial prejudice into a model of an urban area and derives several results about residential location. A previously developed long-run model of an urban area adds a locational dimension to a model of the housing market under perfect competition. The solution to such a model is a set of prices and quantities that, in addition to satisfying the usual profit and utility maximization conditions, ensures that no firm or household will have an incentive to change its location. The main theoretical contribution of these models is therefore a locational equilibrium condition, which is the price per unit of housing services, expressed as a function of location, that  ensures that no one will have an incentive to move. The paper examines the demand side of this type of model in some detail and shows how a simple formulation of racial prejudice affects the locational equilibrium condition. In particular, housing price functions are derived that lead to locational equilibrium for prejudiced whites and for prejudiced blacks. These functions are combined to obtain a condition for racial equilibrium such that neither blacks nor whites will have an incentive to move. (Author/JM)",

        "author":["Williamson, Jeffrey G."],
        "description":"This paper discusses American long-term experience with changes in the distribution of income since the turn of the century. It supplies quantitative documentation of a pronunced secular swing in inequality. Inequality indicators were on the rise up to 1914, exhibited no trend to 1926 or 1929, and traced out a well known egalitatian leveling up to 1948. The paper uses a simple general equilibrium model to decompose the sources of these macro distributional trends. This approach supplies a concrete means by which to isolate the main causes of movements in the wage structure, factor shares, numbers in poverty, and size distribution statistics. Hypotheses regarding macro distribution performance over time can be readily classified as related to factor demand or factor supply. These  two forces need not be in conflict, however. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the key forces appear to have come from the factor demand side rather than from the supply side. That is, the combined effects of demographic, immigration, and capital (human and non-human) formation forces are found to have been small when compared with factor demand. The latter includes sectoral imbalances in rates of technological change, exogenous changes in demand mix, and, less important, factor-saving biases in new technologies. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The objective of this study is to examine and compare the determinants of migration for households grouped first by race and then by poverty level. Household demographic and economic characteristics are defined in the context of a linear probability function. A measure of the expected gain from migration is developed to reflect the relative benefit of leaving the area of origin. The data, covering annual observation periods 1968-69 and 1969-70, are generated from the first three interview waves of the Panel Study on Income Dynamics, Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan. The sample study focuses on household headed by persons less than 45 years old who are in the labor force at the beginning of an observation period. The dependent variable, migration behavior, is  dichotomous, defining migration to include any change in the household's state of residence or any move between a metropolitan and a non-metropolitan area within the state of residence. Independent variables are specified as characteristics of the household head and characteristics of the household. The former reflect the primary importance of the head as decision maker, while the latter may be interpreted as barriers to moving. It is shown that the response of the poor to migration determinants is substantially different from that of the non-poor. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This paper consists of an exploratory analysis of factors associated with inequality in the distribution of fiscal resources--the capacity to generate public goods--among municipal governments in metropolitan areas in the U.S. Political incorporation by class and status into municipal enclaves is stated to be institutional mechanism creating and perpetuating inequality among residents in metropolitan communities in the U.S. and tending to divorce financial resources from public needs. An investigation of data collected for a large number of metropolitan areas in 1960 reveals a number of variables associated with inequality in the distribution of fiscal resources among municipalities in metropolitan areas. The population of metropolitan areas consists of standard metropolitan  statistical areas outside of New England with three or more municipalities with populations of 2500 and above. The level of income inequality among municipal governments in metropolitan areas varies directly with: location in the South, age, size, and density of the metropolis, non-white concentration, family income inequality, residential segregation among social classes, housing segregation by quality, and governmental fragmentation. The data appear to provide support for the argument that governmental inequality occupies a central position in the urban stratification system. (Author/JM)",

Programed Tutoring was developed as a supplement to classroom teaching. The three basic skills of reading (sight reading, word analysis, and comprehension) are broken down into sub-skills which are taught by nine item programs. Each of the programs has a series of test and teaching steps which must be followed. The tutoring procedures are simple. They are systematically programed and are specified in great detail so that tutors with limited education and work experience can be trained to a high degree of effectiveness. Of the 461 students enrolled in Programed Tutoring, 228 were first graders, 194 were  second graders, and 40 were third graders. Approximately 57 percent of the students were boys and 43 percent were girls; 63 percent were black and 37 percent were white. In 1972-73, through the help of a Home-School-Community Coordinator in each school, a parental visitation program for programed tutorial was expanded. Evaluation reports for the six years during which this component has been in operation show that this activity significantly improved the educational attainment of disadvantaged children in the area of reading.

These bibliographies were organized by using a computerized search of \"Dissertation Abstracts International\" from 1965-69, and a hand search of the same abstract bibliography from January 1970 through June 1972 volumes. While this work was proceeding, several university programs were examined. Faculty and students were interviewed to determine what factors increased research productivity. Eleven universities were identified as leading in production of the largest number of  dissertations on the education of disadvantaged populations. In the discussion that follows in the body of this report, the names of some institutions and of people have been changed to preserve confidentiality; it was found that several institutions and individuals assumed leadership in doctoral research on the disadvantaged. It was concluded that, with the diversity of individuals and institutions dealt with, it is difficult to summarize the positive and negative effects of combining doctoral dissertation study with the need to better educate poor and minority group children.

Available data about recent immigrants are quite limited in scope because the information (a) fails to focus specifically on recent immigrants; (b) fails to include appropriate samples, and (c) contains many methodological biases. Since the passage of the present Immigration Act in 1965, the number of immigrants to Hawaii has increased to 6,055 in 1971 with Filipinos accounting for 61.2 percent of the 1971 total. The problem areas of recent immigrants that are discussed in the paper consist of education and language, employment, housing, health, and intercultural problems. The major findings for each of the problem areas follow: (1) many Samoan immigrants have less than a high school education; (2) for  Filipino immigrants, there is a problem of under-employment for professionals and perhaps a problem associated with a change of occupation for many others; (3) residency and U.S. citizenship requirements have severely limited employment opportunities; (4) housing is the problem most frequently mentioned to be an immediate concern by Filipino and Samoan immigrants; (5) recent immigrants from the Philippines account for a disproportionately high number of newly reported cases of active tuberculosis; and, (6) various intercultural problems are encountered.

        "description":"This paper argues that the fundamental problem of individual inequalities in school success should be solved. Individual inequalities exist because present forms of schooling serve only a fraction of the different individuals in the population and because of the absurdity that precociousness in young children sets the standard for school success. Inequalities persist because of neglect--the failure to appreciate the developmental strength and the idiosyncracies of children. Far too large a proportion of the population fail in schools: well over two-thirds are white students from middle class homes. Age and idiosyncracy, two obvious sources of variation in academic performance, should be exploited, not neglected. If the concern should be with competence at the end of schooling,  the importance of demanding that elementary school children excel at traditional scholastic performances can be doubted. That serious consideration be given to the fact that: (a) all of the formal learning now required (even though more than a third of the students never complete it) during elementary school can be accomplished in much shorter order during the intermediate years; and (b) that many students, given this delay, will eventually attain a higher level of accomplishment than they do now, is held to be supported by informed opinion and evidence.

This allowed comparisons of before measures (1966); comparison of short-run effects (1968); and comparison of long-run effects (1972). While neither educational aspirations nor educational expectations were affected to a significant degree, the desegregated group was more likely to define their life chances in racial terms and also saw the schools they had attended as being more detrimental than did the segregated group.

The population is the total non-institutional population of the U.S., 18 years or older. Analysis is confined to 1348 white respondents. The deptendent variable, opposition to busing, was derived from responses to Question 48. Four independent variables were used in the analysis. Sex and years of schooling completed are straightforward status variables. The third independent  variable indicates simply whether or not the respondent has any school-aged children at home. The fourth independent variable, racial prejudice, was a six-item Guttman scale. Multivariate cross tabulation was used. The most striking general findings are the very high levels of opposition to busing that persist across important status and attitudinal characteristics among white adults. Only among college educated women with no school aged children, who also have low racial prejudice, does the opposition to busing begin to approach an even split. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The goal of this report is said to be to review current approaches in psychological anthropology in such a way as to demonstrate what are perceived to be their relevance and importance to an adequate anthropology of education. Part One examines the trends seen emerging in the study of perception and cognition which those interested in education should find valuable. Part Two reviews research in socialization process emphasizing that education is embedded in a sociocultural matrix. It is argued that educational practices, in any given culture, arise from the requirements of the maintenance systems of that culture. In Part Three, the importance of historical context (migration and change) and situational factors (minority status) are argued. Some specific researches with various  groups for whom the educational literature has had some interest, and in some cases preoccupation, are examined. The concluding section: (1) recommends how psychological anthropologists might more effectively influence educational research; (2) builds on the material previously presented, some delineation of priority problems in education; and; (3) as an overview, takes up a fundamental criticism which might appear to argue that psychological anthropology, despite what has been said here, does not have relevance to the study of education.

        "description":"The purpose of this practicum was to develop a model in-service program for training mainstream teachers of Spanish speaking pupils. As the Spanish speaking population of the Norwalk, Connecticut community has grown over the past decade, the school problem of dealing with the non-native English speaker was identified. Through the initial financial facilities of an Emergency School Aid Act (ESAA) grant, a model inservice training program for mainstream teachers of Spanish speaking pupils was developed, conducted, and evaluated. This model was developed specifically for secondary school mainstream teachers (grade six through twelve) who must cope daily with the Spanish speaking pupils. In addition, through a liaison between the secondary and elementary levels, the applicability of  the model, with some modifications, was evident at the elementary level. The program, through the careful selection of administrative, guidance, and teaching personnel, provided a de facto insertion of the model into the seven secondary schools of the city. An assessment of the total practicum indicated that the in-service participants did become a cadre of teacher trainers within their own builders, thus effecting an instructional improvement within the total secondary school system.

The data for this research came from a larger study of the achievement behavior of 99 black and 127 white high school youths. In the fall of 1972 a stratified, probability cluster sample of high school sophomore males was drawn from a large metropolitan area of the midwest. An analysis comparing demographic characteristics of the sample with county, state, regional, and national census data (1970) revealed no appreciable bias in the analysis data set. Respondents were interviewed in group settings and  were paid to participate in the study. The results reveal that: (1) significant other influence manifested similar significant effects for both control groups; (2) academic performance had a significant impact for both control groups; however, the effect was more pronounced for black youth; (3) the impact of verbal ability was primarily direct for white youth and indirect for black youth; and (4) mothers' educational achievement had a significant direct effect on academic self-concept for the black respondents.

        "description":"The military orientations of rural East Texas black and white high school students interviewed in 1966 were very similar; those of metropolitan and nonmetropolitan youth also did not differ much. Since then, status projections of Texas youth have been extended by adding a sample of Mexican American sophomores (1966) to compare with the East Texas ethnic groups. In addition, the original 1966 respondents were followed up in 1968 when they were seniors. The sophomores of the original 1966 study areas were restudied in 1972. Among the findings of the analysis reported here are the following. All three ethnic types desired military service to a similar extent--a majority of each. The greatest difference between the Chicanos and the other two ethnic types in reference to expectations  was that a much higher proportion--almost half of the Chicanos expected to enlist. Adolescent boys' orientations toward military service do not appear to differ very much by ethnic type and do not appear to change greatly over late adolescence. Historical period of time may, however, produce dramatic changes in military orientations of youth: a very dramatic negative drift away from military service was observed between 1966 and 1972 in the occupational status projections of the black and white youth studied here.

        "description":"Policy, as much as the merits of an individual proposal, determines which researcher gets how much money to do what kind of study. Federal money accounts for over 75 percent of all educational R &amp; D funds expended. In the formation of federal educational R &amp; D policy, there are two separate structural events--authorization and appropriations--influenced by the same three forces: (1) the Administration; (2) external groups and consitutencies; and (3) the House and Senate Committees and Subcommittees. Despite a somewhat gloomy picture at this point, many at the National Institute of Education, in Congress, and in potential constituencies are apparently convinced of the importance of education and of educational R&amp;D. A recent analysis concluded that, maintaining even the present  level of support for education, R&amp;D will require a solid coalition of diverse interests and emphases among concerned organizations and a reconceptualization of the role of R &amp; D which diversifies types of and sites for productivity, bringing the process of inquiry closer to the point of effective action in education. To improve the stability of policy direction and policy itself, the formation of a board similar in intent to the New York State Educational Conference Board, formed by representatives of the coalition is recommended.

        "description":"In 1969, after much controversy and the submission of many bills, the New York State Legislature passed--and the Governor signed--a school decentralization law. The law went into effect on February 16, 1970, with the major transfers of power operative on July 1, 1970. This report examines those aspects of the three-year school decentralization experience that have the greatest relevance for the New York State Charter Revision Commission for New York City. It does not evaluate the overall success or failure of the present community school district system Rather, the focus is to evaluate the structural and functional elements of school decentralization that are germane to decentralization of other municipal services. Specifically, by pointing out the problems of the first years of  the education, experience, the report seeks to help the Commission avoid pitfalls in the decentralization of other services, such as parks, and health and social services. As noted, education in New York City is primarily a State function. But school decentralization is important by analogy to the decentralization of municipal services. The Commission is to develop a plan for municipal decentralization based on an understanding of its probable consequences The short-term consequences of school decentralization are now said to be discernible.

        "description":"Results are reported from a survey of 6,185 students in 23 elementary schools, 10 middle schools, and 6 high schools of a Maryland suburban district where schools vary significantly in the authority systems of the classrooms at each grade level. Analyses of the relationship between the 'openness' of a school's instructional program and student achievement failed to show a consistent pattern across four elementary and secondary grades. Family background variables were then statistically controlled for. In no case was more than 3 percent of the total variation uniquely accounted for by school openness. However, in every case there was a large interaction effect between school openness and student family background on achievement. The pattern was always the same: students from the  higher social class categories showed a more positive relationship between school openness and achievement than students from the lower social classes. In grades where the overall relationship was positive, the more advantaged students were most strongly positive; where the overall relationships were negative, the higher social class group was least negative; where the overall relationship was not significant, the higher social class group tended toward a positive relationship, while the lower social class group tended toward a negative one.

This report prepared by staff incorporates those recommendations, focusing on the need for: (1) creation of a Federal Food and Nutrition Office; (2) formalizing nutrition policy making into a written National Nutrition Plan; and (3) implementation of a better system of National Nutrition Surveillance. Members of the Nutrition Committee submitted legislation for improved nutrition education during the ninety-third Congress, and those recommendations are therefore only treated briefly in this report. A  comprehensive National Nutrition Policy is necessary to coordinate and monitor the varied nutrition-related programs and activities now dispersed throughout the government. The present global food situation threatens millions overseas with starvation and requires immediate concerted action. The present lack of policy coordination derives from the multidimensional character of nutrition. Agricultural policy, tax policy, and even foreign policy all have nutritional implications. The flow of information to decision makers in a form they can use must be coordinated. (Author/JM)",

To date, most career education programs have been concentrated in the suburbs. The National Urban Coalition wants career education to be made part of the curriculum of urban schools, so as to increase the options available to low-income and minority students. To achieve this goal, the coalition is working to enlist business, labor, and service organizations in planning school curricula and supplying jobs and training during and after schooling. On October 21-22, 1974, a National Conference on Career Education took place at Wingspread, which was, to the knowledge of the conference convenors,  the first national conference to focus on career education for inner city students. It brought together representatives of business, labor, public service organizations, school systems and government, to develop plans that would open doors to higher education and careers to low-income and minority students. The 55 participants sought to pinpoint the ingredients of a good career education program and determine what it takes to administer one successfully. (Author/JM)",

Vocational programs for the disadvantaged and handicapped in Indiana are said to be significantly different in many respects from traditional vocational programs, and, hence not easily comparable; vocational programs for the disadvantaged and handicapped are becoming institutionalized in the total effort in vocational education. Substantial differences are stated to  exist in programs within each category program (disadvantaged handicapped, and multi-population) and across categories of programs.

That method maximizes the realization of individual potential and at the same time permits students to make choices which the standard packaged curriculum denies them. Since the purpose of language is social interaction, however, individualized instruction must be balanced by small group (five to nine students) instruction, which provides social contact while maintaining a workable level of individualized assistance.

        "description":"A Federal contract study with Johns Hopkins University School of Health Services was initiated to analyze career decisions and behavior of unaccepted medical school applicants for implications as to their recruitability to alternative health careers. Questionnaires were sent to a national sample, stratified by sex, of 3,500 of the 16,800 unaccepted applicants to the 1971-72 entering medical school class. From the 3,034 located respondents, there was a 68 percent return. Focus was on the 73 percent of respondents remaining unaccepted applicants in 1973. The current major activity of 53 percent of males and 49 percent females was study, with 46 percent males and 49 percent females employed. Half of both males and females were in health-related jobs or study, with very few in  innovative, mid-level health occupations. Over half the unaccepted applicants reapplied to medical school within a year. Post-rejection advice to persist was the strongest correlate for reapplication. An early, single-minded commitment to a medical career also was correlated with persistence. Women displayed an overall pattern of lowered aspirations in reaction to the blocked career. Implications are the need for career information on newer mid-level and alternative health careers and intensified pre-application counseling and counseling for women. (30-page appendix). (EA)",

        "author":["Court, David"],
        "description":"Despite rising sentiment, the decision to &quot;de-school&quot; society seems premature unless it derives from a comparative empirical assessment of school and nonschool educational programs' relative contributions to national goals. One of many new alternative systems, Kenya's village polytechnics (low-cost primary training centers in rural areas) are widely perceived to be alleviating unemployment and manifesting self-help. The polytechnic is significant as an ideological movement whose essence is an attempt to break away from conventional concepts and to develop types of training rooted in practical local and individual needs, conveying a sense of individual purpose and a capacity for continuing self-instruction. Data are used to illustrate the movement's achievements, problems, and  potential in the task of national development--its major problems have derived from the pervasiveness of the ethic of formal schooling; part of the movement's achievement and much of its potential lie in the extent to which the polytechnics have nevertheless exemplified significant new principles of education: flexibility, availability, individualization, and relevance. The data suggest, however, that the alternative system must await modifications in the present social structure linking schooling and wage incentives before it can have extensive impact on educational philosophy and practice in Kenya.

        "description":"The proceedings consist of 11 papers grouped in two major categories: the context of adult learning (social significance and fact and fiction about adult learning) and the utilization of learning models for adult instruction. Contributors are Floyd B. Fischer, George L. Maddox, Rolf H. Monge, Eric F. Gardner, Arthur W. Combs, William J. Hoyer, Francis J. DiVesta, H. Peter Dachler, Rayman W. Bortner, David F. Hultsch, Samuel S. Dubin, Tom Hickey, and Robert M. W. Travers. A summary synthesizes the papers in a philosophical vein with comments on conceptualization of learning as related to an internal system of human control; operant psychology and individualized learning; information processing models, reflecting both internal and external loci of control; expectancy models (as  part of motivation theory); and the effect of educational technology on learning as a socializing experience. The comments reflect subjects discussed in the second major section. References are included after each paper. (MDW)",

        "author":["Borden, Karl J."],
        "description":"There are more than 60 million U. S. adults who lack a high school diploma. Their employability is decreasing, due to the upswing in white collar occupations. Also, they are often barred from the skilled and unskilled labor market; on-the-job training is increasingly academic; General Educational Development (GED) examinations are rigorous and the material irrelevant for most adults; and GED is primarily a credentialing program. All these factors indicate a need for alternative approaches to adult diploma programs. A synopsis of the history of American adult education reveals its marginal place in the educational scene in terms of legal status, administration, facilities, and funding. Today's public school adult programs often have a vocational emphasis while adhering to  secondary school practices and administrative patterns. Awareness of the inflexibility of GED programs led to broadening of diploma programs; yet data received in a survey of 45 states and over 50 local agencies showed little or no imagination in the adult programs of 29 of the 37 states offering them. Adult educators must respond to demands other than enrollment economy and develop a curriculum philosophy of their own, as California has done. (Fifty-three pages of appendixes give descriptions of programs in nine states). (MDW)",

        "description":"Today we honor Charlie Lankford, a former prison inmate, who has turned his back on crime and is now involved in rehabilitation efforts in Fairfax County. Sadly, Charlie is the exception; our efforts toward rehabilitation have generally failed. In recent years, emphasis on rehabilitation and diagnosis has taken precedence over protecting society, creating an unbalanced system of corrections. We cannot diagnose crime as if it were a physical or mental disease; we cannot prescribe a precise treatment or guarantee a cure. To develop a more rational system of correction we must improve our local jails, and decide which types of offenders we want to incarcerate. I would certainly include the violent offender, the repeat offender, and the white-collar criminal, and keep out of jail the  younger first offenders, the alcoholics, and those found guilty of non-support of their families. These people belong in community-based programs. In reforming our prisons, we should build smaller, more manageable institutions, and locate them near large urban centers where adequate educational, medical, and staffing needs can be provided. The establishment of the National Insitute of Corrections is a recent step toward providing a mechanism by which Congress can provide funds to help improve corrections at the regional, State and local levels.

The guidelines  for package implementation, developed by student teachers, can be employed for 6-, 10-, or 20-week programs. They include manufacturing concepts and student activities, implementation analysis, and possible problems and their solutions for a simulated manufacturing business. A sample mass production unit, designed for mass production techniques and special tooling, provides information and suggested activities.

        "description":"The report describes an 18-month research project at Chanute Air Force Base, Illinois, designed to evaluate the effectiveness of inceptive motivation techniques in Air Force technical training. The first phase of the research identified incentives. The findings were used in the second phase of the research which made these incentives contingent on performance in two of the resident training courses at the base. The first system gave performance based incentives in the courses. The second utilized a system that attempted to give effort based incentives, while the third used financially based incentives. Research results indicated that while secondary performance measures such as amount of remedial instruction, frequency of probations, and frequency of course failures decreased  under the incentive program, the primary performance measures of exam scores and speed of course completion did not generally show much improvement. Yet, from a cost-effectiveness viewpoint, even the relatively small (i.e., 8 percent) increase in speed of course completion was meaningful. Attitudes to the program generally improved or stayed the same. The financially based incentive system was found to be the most cost-effective for Air Force technical training. A 150-page appendix provides background information, incentive attractiveness data, questionnaires, manuals, and item statistics. (Author/MW)",

        "description":"The report evaluates the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) in Missouri by comparing the dietary adequacy and nutrition knowledge of 200 program families representative of urban, small town and rural areas with that of 200 similarly representative non-program families. Data were gathered by personal interviews taken in March, 1972, employing the 24-hour recall questionnaire method. The tabular presentation of data states that: program families' dietary adequacy was not consistently better than that of control families; both program and control groups' nutritional adequacy was comparable; program families' nutrition knowledge was higher than that of control families; nutritional adequacy depended most on educational level; median percent recommended dietary  allowance and nutrition adequacy did not depend upon tenure in the program; and food buying and nutrition knowledge increased with more frequent visits of program workers. The study concludes that the EPNEP has been successful in its efforts, especially during the first 18 months of a family's participation, but it questions whether the data indicate that the adequacy of diets observed among program families can be attributed to the program. A 29-page appendix tabulates the percent recommended dietary allowance for eight nutrients for each location where the data were gathered. (JR)",

Lifelong learning is viewed as necessary for coping with a complex and rapidly changing society and additional benefits of adult education can be seen in terms of cost benefits and the use of existing educational structures. Social factors influencing the need for adult learning opportunities include the knowledge explosion, computer technology, and the trend away from strictly youth-oriented schooling. Five areas of individual need are: pursuit of life-long interests; professional, vocational, and career upgrading; coping with the information explosion; identifying and resolving community problems; and life enrichment. Canadian citizens and provincial educators are indicating more interest in adult education.  Many feel that the concept could better be served by a restructured Department of Education with support and coordinating services for an adult education program; cooperative action at regional and community levels through decentralization, already begun in the province; and by new methods of need assessment, coordination and delivery of services. Appended are: a Canadian policy for continuing education; adult education in British Columbia; and tables illustrating growth of adult education in British Columbia. (MDW)",

Major conclusions/recommendations include the following: (1) the Air Force should take no action to educate its present personnel in the area of non-monetary benefits--except the retirement benefit--in general (evidence  indicates that increased knowledge has a negative effect on non-monetary benefit valuations); (b) the retirement benefits should be stressed and explained in terms of its high \"present value\" during the first enlistment because of its positive role in personnel retention; and (c) the Air Force should consider providing cash to its present personnel in lieu of non-monetary benefits (benefit allocations are not necessarily the same allocations that would be chosen if Air Force members had cash).

Variables affecting workers' employability and mobility were analyzed to determine the potential in Oregon for mobility within and out of the industry, the function of the labor market in distributing jobs, and the interface between the labor market and workers' adaptations. Hypotheses dealt with social marginalization, defined as the process of becoming economically obsolete, and job rationing, defined as the process by which one applicant is selected over another for a particular job. Because of the size of the population studied (a longitudinal study of 50) a random sampling of workers,  and 20 in-depth profiles of workers); and because of acknowledged missing observations, evidence in some areas was mixed, and further research is planned. Data from the study are tabulated and discussed at length. Additional formal education and high firm seniority seemed to have low value, and results also suggested that although changing jobs can be a rational response to a tight labor market, the practice threatens workers' re-employability.

        "description":"The paper is concerned with determining from a large sample of British industrial workers, whether there is an unconditional relationship between job specialization and worker dissatisfaction, or a relationship contingent on middle-class work values. The recent work literature includes three contradictory propositions relating job specialization and worker dissatisfaction. The first predicts an unconditional relationship between these variables; the second predicts that it will be higher among workers committed to middle-class work values; the third predicts that it will be higher among &quot;alienated&quot; workers. Data were gathered in a survey of 5,274 industrial workers employed in six factories in England, Scotland, and Wales. The research instrument, a 153-item questionnaire, was  completed by 61 percent or 3,193 workers. For the most part, workers of both sexes and of varying age and tenure, were low skilled and worked on production lines. From the data, presented in tabular form, it is concluded that correlates of job specialization related in different ways and in varying degrees to worker dissatisfaction. The complexity of the problem is that workers' affective responses to characteristics of specialized work are not uniform, but vary with different job characteristics. A bibliography is provided.

        "description":"\"Compensatory\" and \"spillover\" models have described the two basic relationships individuals form between work and nonwork experiences. The assembly line worker seeking compensation in nonwork activities for deadening work exemplifies the first. A person whose nonwork activities are an extension of work experiences exemplifies the second. The study was designed to deal with criticisms of past research; an individual's own perceptions of his two social environments were used to determine how he personally saw them as related. His self-concept was considered to determine whether any individual differences moderate the form of adjustment an individual achieves between the two spheres. A sample of 178 individuals, using a set of 25 semantic differential scales for comparison, could  be classified into four types: spillover/work-oriented; spillover/nonwork-oriented; compensatory/work-oriented; and compensatory/nonwork-oriented. Analysis revealed that both types of spillover individuals viewed both spheres of experiences equally. Compensatory individuals showed sharp contrasts--the work-oriented viewed work experiences as more positive, and the nonwork-oriented viewed them as less positive, than nonwork experiences. Compensatory individuals of both types viewed themselves as less deliberate, active, orderly, and challenging than did spillover individuals. The theoretical implications of these results are discussed. (Author/AJ)",

        "description":"The paper examines literature concerned with the relationship individuals form between experiences in their work and nonwork spheres, an issue which is most pronounced in societies where a marked separation exists between the institution of work and social institutions. The author identifies established theoretical models and evaluates empirical evidence for the relationship. The work-nonwork relationship is described by two basic models: spillover (a continuation of work experiences away from work), and compensatory (a reaction to work experiences that guides the selection of nonwork experiences). It has been pointed out by several sociologists that if work lacks meaning, the worker seeks meaning in leisure activities. Another implication is that bad work experiences  (alienation) spill over to nonwork activities. Empirical research is classified into two groups: the relationship between work and activities in the nonwork sphere, and studies attempting to relate specific characteristics of people's jobs to their nonwork activities. The studies reviewed are discussed with respect to the spillover and compensatory relationship models. Conclusions and recommendations revolve around building upon past research and theories in constructing more in-depth studies of these relationships. (JB)",

        "description":"The ultimate goal of a learning group is to help learners achieve their goals and objectives and to help them learn to live in a rapidly changing and evolving society. Within the context of social change, the author examines how internal dynamics can be used to aid a teacher in developing an effective learning group. Drawing from psychology, sociology, and adult education, the paper deals with the structure and definition of learning groups; the interests, motivations, expectations, and aspirations of each individual; the development of a conducive atmosphere; group size and composition; group identity; social control; group standards; human relations skills; role definition; communication patterns; goals; methods; and group evaluation. The role of the teacher evolves from that  of the traditional educator to one of facilitator who must understand the dynamics of collective behavior and its impact on the individual, Several checkpoints for the facilitator to be aware of are: group size; diverse capabilities within a group; mutual involvement of facilitator and student; group solidarity; maintenance of standards related to subject competency; detection of problems; student responsibility for learning; cooperation; effective interdependent communication; coordination of needs, goals and methods; and the mechanics of group evaluation.

        "description":"A review of the research literature on goal-setting in organizational settings reveals that goal-setting on an individual job results in better task performance. However, the processes behind their effectiveness is unclear. For example, how are various job attributes of task goals related to performance, and how do various individual differences factors affect the goal-setting process? The study examines the impact of variations in individual differences on the task goal attribute and performance relationship. The investigation studies five task goal attributes: participation in goal-setting; feedback on goal effort; peer competition for goal attainment; goal difficulty; and goal specificity. One hundred thirty-three first-level supervisors in the accounting and customer service  departments working under a goal-setting program were investigated through the use of a task goal attribute questionnaire, an adjective check list, a demographic information sheet, and performance measures. The results indicated that the need for achievement can represent a significant influence on the relationship between an employee's task goal attributes and performance. Participation in goal-setting was essential for low need achievers, while feedback and goal specificity were more important for high need achievers. A bibliography is provided. (JB)",

The goals of continuing education and community service revolve around new opportunities for all groups, new flexibility in methods, programing through research, and curricula reflecting new content. Basic issues facing adult educators are: the dimensions of need for continuing education and community service; ways to serve the adult education market; financing; coordination; and quality education. A listing of sponsored programs, data in graph form on enrollment and adult participation in education are included. The need for a knowledge of  a variety of skills and available resources to meet the needs of community is regarded as one of a partnership between educational institutions, the State, industry, advisory councils, and private institutions. Recommendations cover the areas of: new opportunities for adults, new programs, establishing advisory councils, shared financing by State and student, and curriculum development.

A section covers actions and studies of international organizations regarding paid educational leave and European attempts to increase educational opportunities through national and State legislation, private practice, and collective bargaining. A major portion outlines in detail educational plans of American companies and international unions; other sections discuss policy recommendations and strategies for implementation in the United States. Three basic recommendations are made: for a coalition among the educational world and the worlds of industry and labor (requiring a vehicle for communication among labor, management,  government, and education); for agreement between labor and management prior to adoption of national or regional legislation; and for effective representation of the formal education system in such a coalition. Conclusions point out the paradoxical need for more expenditure on recurrent education in a time of economic crisis, and call for National Institute of Education aid in coordination, planning, and research in the United States.

Data were obtained from; mail surveys of both disabled veterans and employers regarding employment; personal interviews with veterans and employers; telephone interviews with long-term unemployed disabled veterans; personal interviews with State Employment Service and Veterans Administration personnel; a study of services by various veterans' organizations; and evaluations of programs for training or hiring disabled veterans. The data, displayed in table form showing characteristics of disabled veterans related to employment, indicate a relationship between employment problems,  severity of disability and low educational attainment. The young, non-white, undereducated veteran had the most problems. From the examination of programs of job assistance for disabled veterans, inadequacies were found in the following areas: counseling, resource availability, training, contacts with employers, selective placement, and elimination of job discrimination. Recommendations offer an alternative approach to job placement: thorough assessment and testing of applicant and job, and coordination with employers. The appendixes contain supplementary tables, legislation, the data collecting instruments and their use, and letters from veterans. (JB)",

Foreign and U. S. born graduates of foreign medical schools (FMGs) are critically examined, and it is suggested that ways be found to decrease the number of FMGs practicing in the State. The study surveys medical education in the State, reports favorably on the location and distribution of existing schools and their close alliance with teaching hospitals, and suggests expanding both undergraduate and graduate medical education. The supply and demand for physicians in the  State through the year 2000 is projected in graphical form with respect to various assumptions and hypothetical growth rates, with the conclusions that the major need is for primary care physicians, that 260 physicians per 100,000 population is achievable by 1990, and that with expanded medical education and with major increments in the number and capability of physician extenders, reliance on FMGs could be reduced substantially without reducing physician services.

        "description":"The study investigated the farm wife's role in decision-making related directly to general farm matters and to the adoption of agricultural innovations. Data were collected in personal interviews of 67 farm wives; statistical analysis yielded five major findings, including: (1) wives seeking information about farm matters were also likely to participate in decisions about those matters; (2) wives who participated in farm tasks tended to participate in decision-making; and (3) the husband's acceptance of agricultural innovations was not associated with his wife's involvement in decisions. Income, farm size, and number of children were negatively associated with the wife's involvement in decision-making. Three independent factors, labeled &quot;wife's business-partner role,&quot;&quot;age,&quot; and&quot;socioeconomic status,&quot; were reflected in the interrelationships among all variables. The clustering of variables concerning the wife's farm activities suggests a package of behaviors associated with her role as farm business partner. The strong relationship between the wife's involvement in farm decisions and her information-seeking activity suggests that such wives might be potential candidates for the Agricultural Extension Service. The study has used the same population involved in four earlier research studies, allowing different aspects of innovation-adoption behavior within the group to be observed. (Author/AJ)",

Classes were held during the morning hours on two consecutive days for seven weeks (with a five-week extension course) in a community center; 45 adults were enrolled. Their ages ranged from 30 to 80 with the average being 38. They spoke 10 native languages; nearly half were German speakers. The aural-oral method, as used in the regular English language training classes, was the main basis of instruction with some adherence to the older cognitive code-learning theory. While the steess was on situational teaching, team teaching was employed, as were numerous and various teaching aids to supplement  the situational contexts. A sample of a typical day's lesson is offered. In light of positive student progress in terms of command of the language (especially in situational contexts) and of social confidence, the program was considered a success. Because of its success, plans were developed and implemented to expand it to include five other community centers, where the results were similarly positive. (JR)",

        "description":"The report documents the results of a 1967 survey of health professionals in the four-State Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE) Mountain States Regional Medical Program (MS/RMP). Addressed to health professionals in each of the four States--Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Wyoming--the survey focuses primarily on the characteristics and continuing education needs of the Mountain State health professionals. The disease categories of heart disease, cancer, and stroke are emphasized. Part 1 reviews the major findings of the survey data analysis, providing summary profiles of the following groups: physician, dentist, hospital administrator, registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, medical/laboratory technologist, physical therapist, radiologic/X-ray technologist.  Part 2 presents the survey design and analysis plan. Part 3, making up the major body of the report, examines each of the professional groups listed above as they relate to: selected personal and professional characteristics, need for continuing education, desired methods and procedures of continuing education, and other factors relevant to continuing education. Statistical findings are discussed and tabulated. Part 4 reports the patient referral patterns and practices of physicians and dentists. Findings and conclusions are discussed along with their implications for immediate and long-range actions. Survey instruments are appended. (MW)",

        "description":"The study's purpose was to use the Adjective Check List (ACL), a self-administered personality assessment instrument, to determine whether there were response differences between a sample of Adult Basic Education (ABE) students and the general test norms. The ACL was administered to 142 students in ABE high school completion programs in Des Moines, Iowa and in several surrounding nonurban areas, validated and scored according to test instructions. On the basis of univariate &quot;t&quot; and multivariate Hotellings T-square analyses, it was concluded that there were significant differences between the adult sample's ACL score and the predicted norm on 14 of 24 test scales. The ACL provided a consistent personality attribute portrait of the sample. A comparison of the interpretations of  each of the 14 significantly divergent normed means found none to be in psychological opposition. The ABE sample scores showed the students tended to be more anxious, worried, and critical of themselves and others; less self-confident; less adequately socialized; less satisfied with their current status, yet less certain about adventure and risk taking; more prone to action than to thinking; at times self-centered and insensitive to others; and less trusting while more calculating in interpersonal relationships.

        "description":"Sex-role stereotyping was found in almost all post-1970 high school level career guidance materials studied in a content analysis of more than 9,500 pages and 1,850 illustrations. Random samples of the materials, taken from commercial and noncommercial lists, indicated that: about 75 percent of illustrations of people of one sex were men; 75 percent of proper names used were male; 33 percent of men and 4 percent of women were pictured outdoors; 36 percent of the materials differentiated between male and female career patterns and 14 percent on pay scale; and 30 percent mentioned \"working mothers.\" The report offers representative stereotyped and nonstereotyped quotations from the materials. Data is analyzed, tabulated, and discussed in relationship to: methods and procedures, an  analysis and comparison of the samples, and the testing of the instruments for reliability and validity. A revised and shortened form of the testing instrument is examined. Recommendations include: (1) honest discussions of occupational skills and life styles, (2) the use of the third person plural form of pronoun wherever possible instead of the usually unjustified use of \"he\" or \"she,\" and (3) awareness of sex-role stereotyping throughout the materials rather than in special statements on the subject.

Married women with husbands present show the most pronounced increase in participation rates with increases in every age group. Chart 1 and Table 1 present data on the percentage of women in the U. S. labor force over this period by both age and marital status. Table 2 provides statistics on the contribution that working wives make to family incomes. In dealing with the question of female status and mobility for the Unites States' (1940-1970) and New York State (1960-70), occupational areas were defined and examined: professionals, managers, clerical workers, craftsmen, operatives, service workers, and laborers. Tables 3 and 4 and Appendix A illustrate the results. New  York showed a stable rate in female employment in clerical occupations, a decrease in manufacturing and laborer occupations, with an increase in medicine and other professions, contrasting with some of the national norms and reflecting a combination of factors. Twelve measures of female/male occupational mobility; indexes of the seven occupational groupings for both New York and the U. S. in graphic form, and a summary of the methodology are appended.

The document presents an overview of the Warren, Ohio career education program and resource units for the K-6, 7-8, and 9-10 levels. Each resource unit presents a rationale, objectives, framework, and learning activities aimed at developing a curriculum incorporating career education concepts and community involvement. The K-6 level focuses on: developing positive awareness and attitudes toward work; exploring the rewards of work; job clusters; worker relationships; success performance factors and skills; and career choice. The 7-8 level orientation program makes use of community resources to direct the curriculum toward critical  social and personal issues, modern community studies and issues, a survey of occupations, and related curriculum and occupations. It also includes a student career orientation handbook with suggested resources, a listing of occupational clusters, and a job index. Materials presented for grades 9-10 focus on career exploration, treating vocational preparation, career choice, and community involvement.

Prepared by a developmental committee composed of representatives of local school districts, regional education service centers, and career education research projects, it was designed to assist classroom teachers in integrating career education into the existing program. Each sample activity cites a performance objective that relates directly to a career concept and a career cluster. The activity is suggested for a particular unit in a subject area. More specificity is providing by citing an appropriate lesson in the unit for which the activity can be used. Many of the sample activities are easily adaptable to other subjects, some are alternatives  for achieving the specific objective, while others are cumulative. Corresponding instructional resources are suggested. The following elementary level concepts of awareness are continued and expanded: attitudes toward work, attitudes toward those who work, seeing oneself as a valuable person, and the relationship of school to work.

The format contains a synopsis of the entire unit, general objectives, behavioral objectives, teaching strategies, hands-on activities, evaluation techniques, and guidelines for correlating subject matter. Instructional materials include an occupational questionnaire for indepth study, fact  sheets, a personality inventory, listed interviewing techniques, and typical personnel forms. Sixty-five pages are devoted to a listing of specific occupations within the occupational clusters as they correlate to academic disciplines. This correlation of all the disciplines is intended to aid students in acquiring competencies appropriate to their projected adult societal roles. An extended bibliography lists books, kits, and related audiovisual aids. (MW)",

Although the list does not cluster all occupations it does include many of the most common ones. Five pages of the guide are devoted to the Cluster Interest Inventory, a student self-interest scale. Part one is a clustered list of occupations so arranged that the student may check his career preference (like, uncertain, or dislike) and thus single out several  clusters for further investigation. Part two permits students to rank their interest (high, medium, and low) in school subjects and sports and hobbies for comparison with their selections in part one. (JR)",

The report discusses three varieties of adult self-education (casual contacts, structured events, and self-directed learning) and concludes that the hidden costs and deficiencies of such learning are enormous and frequently discourage many adults from desiring to learn. Based on a concluded necessity and expediency of providing organized and directed educational programs for adults, the report surveys various institutions' involvement in adult education: Department of Education; other Provincial government departments; Federal government; business, industry, and labor; community recreational centers; religious groups; voluntary agencies;  proprietary schools; cultural institutions; and professional associations. The report also summarizes the results of recent research into the nature of individual participation on adult education with respect to: personal characteristics; socio-economic characteristics; residence factors; attitudes; attendance and dropout; and learning needs. The report agrees with earlier recommendations for the creation of a Director of Adult Education and a Council of Adult Education in the Provincial Department of Education, and favorably reports on studies made in Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Alberta suggesting the extension of educational opportunities to the total population.

Four presentations were related to the Singer Graflex System and its uses for career exploration as well as for mentally retarded and correctional programs. Two presentations covered JEVS (Jewish Employment and Vocational Service, Philadelphia) work sample  battery and its implications for community colleges. One described the Tower (Institute for Crippled and Disabled, New York) system of vocational evaluation, while another provided a JEVS/Singer Graflex/Tower comparison. A concluding section by the Chief, Special Needs Section, provides workshop observations and implications. The workshops indicated no specific vocational assessment system provides total comprehensive evaluation; each system has its strengths and weaknesses. Tool handling success is dependent upon evaluator skill with clients. Likewise, various assessment systems have different implications with special needs groups.

Since the test did not produce a meaningful associative map of the work environment, the stimuli were converted from single words to 40 phrases in seven categories. The phrase stimuli were tested on 19 male auto mechanics, 19 female secretaries, and 19 computer data processors (14 males) with the aim of deriving stimulus meaning from their multiple word associative responses themselves by means of content analysis.  The response distributions for each occupation are discussed in the text and tabularly displayed by stimulus phrases and each of 13 derived response categories. The test results indicate that people associate positive affect with the work environment, which the report considered as general support for a positively valenced work ethic.

        "description":"A model experience-based career education program for secondary school students in Philadelphia, called the Academy for Career Education, has been operated by Research for Better Schools, Inc. (RBS), for three years. It utilizes employer/community participants as instructional agents and learning sites for career exploration and specialization, delivers career guidance/counseling services to students, and provides for individualized basic skill instruction. RBS does not regard the program developed for the academy as either a rejection of, or a free-standing alternative to secondary schools, but rather as a program to be used in conjunction with existing programing, and one which has yet to undergo field testing in various environments. The academy's past and future development  is considered from a research, development, and dissemination perspective with relation to prototype development, dissemination, diffusion, replication, transportability and nurturance. The effectiveness of the prototype in the developmental setting has been determined and RBS will in the future continue to work with more user organizations towards its dissemination. This work entails its testing and adaptation on various environments, followed by necessary redevelopment. It also entails the testing of the program's diffusion strategy and assumptions, and the development of a change support system. (Author/SA)",

A sample of 90 second graders from North Carolina (66 from open classrooms and 24 from self-contained classrooms), who participated in a dramatic play program in which they constructed a model community in the classroom, was compared with a control group of 33 students who participated in a traditional program of career education (field trips, movies, and sound tapes). The results of the pre- and posttests, which were cross analyzed by ability level and socioeconomic level and presented in tabular form, suggest that dramatic play was more effective than traditional methods both in the self-contained and the open classroom setting. Greater gains were produced in  factual knowledge, occupational awareness, and productive thinking in relation to social and community organization in both disadvantaged and more advantaged students. Evidence did not suggest however, that the dramatic play program had a differential effect on behavior patterns in the classroom or on achievement in reading, mathematics, or language. Two appendixes provide the test instruments administered to the students and selected parents' responses to a questionnaire about the program. (JR)",

At the beginning of the program, the community includes only a few structures. As the students realize the need for more buildings and services, the community continues to develop, with more occupations being explored. Pupils portraying various worker roles in the community begin to experience the interdependence of jobs. The dramatic play is to be spontaneous, with the teacher assuming the role of observer. Research lessons may involve reading, talking to adults, field trips, or audiovisual aids. Sixteen units focus on working related to the post office, supermarket, service station,  construction company, airport, bank, department of public works, police department, traffic court, doctor's office and hospital, department of motor vehicles, fire department, newspaper, mayor and city council, and library. Individual units are organized according to lesson plans and activities and related sources of information and comments. Bibliographies on each worker category identify easy and more difficult reading level books, films, pictures, and other audiovisual aids. (EA)",

Ten students, chosen through a rigorous selection process, were provided with 30 hours of paid training in which they learned the many duties and responsibilities that they would have as peer counselors. Initial results from implementation of the program were even greater than the authors expected. Some early results of the student-to-student  counseling were: (1) the total number of withdrawals during the semester decreased; (2) the total number of program changes was reduced by nearly 200; (3) faculty, staff, and students felt that the image of the university in responding to the individual had been strengthened by the program.

It was hypothesized (1) that subjects who were angered would drink more in the tasting task than control subjects; and (2) that subjects who were given an opportunity to retaliate against their provoker would drink less than subjects who were angered without an opportunity to retaliate. Sixty college students served as subjects and qualified for the study by scoring in the heavy drinker category of the Drinking Habits Questionnaire. Paired subjects were either assigned to the experimental group with angered conditions or the no-anger control condition. The main findings of the  experiment were consistent with the prediction that subjects in the angered condition would drink significantly more than subjects in the anger-with-retaliation condition.

The Purdue LEAD Program is characterized as a dual-approach instructional system in that it provides an undergraduate course in leadership aimed at developing skills particularly relevant to leading college discussion groups and, at the same time, furnishes qualified and supervised discussion group leaders to enhance the effectiveness of instruction in the large marriage and family  relationships courses. In the appendix of this report, the authors have included a variety of materials which should be helpful in developing a similar program within most educational contexts. (Author/PC)",

        "description":"Until recently, the use of contingency contracting has been largely an issue of theory and discussion with little experimental research evidence gathered to support efficacy. Two major reasons for this problem are suggested and discussed: (1) the concept of contingency contracting has not been adequately defined nor its minimal requirements delineated in terms of an applied behavior analysis; (2) the applications of contingency contracting have not been clearly distinguished from other types of contingency management procedures. This paper resolves the above problems by presenting a set of definitive requirements of contingency contracting from an operant point of view. Accordingly, it focuses attention on the importance of both the discovery and control of relevant consequences  of adult behaviors in their natural settings and the reliable measurement of those behaviors. Finally, the paper draws attention to the special characteristics of this technique which distinguish its applications from other types of contingency management procedures. (Author)",

Upper- and underclassmen from large and small high schools completed questionnaires and the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale. Participation in five activity areas was related to self-concept scores using a multiple-regression technique. The perceived similarity of each student's priorities with the school's priorities was also correlated with self-concept. The relationships accounting for the greatest proportion of the variance in self-concept scores were found among small-school upperclassmen. The results were interpreted as support for Barker and Gump's argument that small school students feel a greater obligation to participate in school activities.  (Author)",

Data for the project was gathered from a three-year study of the determinants of achievement for majority and minority students in segregated and desegregated school settings. Operationalizations used in the study included: (1) family socialization practices, (2) family authority structure, (3) family educational orientation, (4) socioeconomic position, (5) school contextual factors, (6) achievement and I.Q., and (7) self-concept. The conclusions reached from the study were: (1) Self-concept is a  significant determinant of student achievement performance, (2) Controls for self-concept reduce the relationship between student achievement performance and each of the independent variables, (3) Family socialization practices exercise a larger effect on self-concept than any other variable. These results suggest that the family must be brought into the everyday interactional exchanges occuring in the schools in order for such progras to be successful. (Author/PC)",

Ss were given a TAT-like measure of Ms and a measure of sex role identity. They also performed a series of tasks in competitive and non-competitive conditions. No sex differences or clear age trends in Ms imagery were found; however, there were sex and grade differences in the reasons given for avoiding success. Ss, regardless of Ms status, performed better in non-competitive than competitive conditions. Developmental data show a tendency for ninth and eleventh grade females with Ms to perform better in non-competitive conditions, while older females without Ms perform better in competitive conditions. Eighth, ninth and eleventh grade males with Ms performed better  in a competitive condition, while their peers without Ms performed better in a non-competitive condition. These results question that a relationship exists between Ms imagery and competitive performance for males and young females, but indicate such a relationship for older females. Sex role identity was not related to Ms, thus casting doubt on the notion that Ms is a direct function of feminity. (Author)",

        "description":"In this study of young male schizophrenic patients who reported they were not taking antipsychotic medication at follow-up, those treated with placebos in contrast to those treated with chlorpromazine while hospitalized showed significantly greater long term clinical improvement, less pathology at follow-up, fewer rehospitalizations and better overall functioning in the community between one and three years after discharge. These individuals, in general, were experiencing an acute psychotic break and their first or second hospitalization upon admission to the study. Between hospital admission and discharge those on chlorpromazine showed greater improvement. A greater proportion of those who were assigned to chlorpromazine while hospitalized, however, showed deterioration after  discharge. Factors measured at hospital admission that were related to post-hospital outcome were good premorbid history and paranoid characteristics. One evoked potential criterion, slope, also was found to be related to outcome. Similarities and differences between this and other drug outcome studies were discussed. The study supports previous observations that there is a subgroup of schizophrenics who do well or better long term without the routine or continuous use of antipsychotic medication. This finding underlines the need for more selective utilization of antipsychotic medication. Factors which may have an effect on the successful management of acute schizophrenic patients not on medication are mentioned. (Author)",

Followers of his theories are now collecting evidence to support or validate his contentions. The assessment of client life styles serves: (1) to make the client aware of his misconceptions, (2) as a reference point for therapy, and (3) as the focal point of personality change. Thus, the assessment procedure--done one-to-one or in groups--constitutes for Adlerians an important part of therapy. Bringing into awareness the clients misconceptions implies respect for his ability to correct his mistakes; it is a form of encouragement. A counselor, to encourage, must respect the client's right to choose. Adlerians and others think that with proper information the  individual will decide more effectively. Ideal thinking and behaving is a function of a healthy interest in others; this is termed social interest. A social interest index is used to measure the extent to which an individual is interested in his fellow human beings. Adlerians are now doing systematic research on the results of life style assessments. (Author)",

The academic advising conference between adviser and advisee normally occurs in a dyadic setting; thus, as with counseling, it seemed plausible to the authors that the interpersonal relationship between the adviser and student is important in developing a satisfying exchange. This document reports on a study which sought to train advisers to operationalize different counseling behaviors. Three advisers were trained to use attending behavior/no attending behavior, and self-disclosure/no self-disclosure to 60 subjects. Each student was randomly assigned to one of the four experimental manipulations. Significant main effects on the various variables in the experiment  provided support that attending behavior and self-disclosure help strengthen the adviser-advisee relationship.

Two hypotheses were tested: (1) fewer adolescents who report greater parental control will report engaging in delinquent behavior than adolescents who report less parental control; and (2) fewer adolescents who report greater parental interest will report engaging in delinquent behavior than adolescents who report less parental control. Approximately 7,000 high school students responded to a four-page questionnaire containing self-report questions on juvenile delinquency, parental control, and parental interest. Results indicated little, if any, support for the two hypotheses. However, when using  individual items which were combined to create the overall rating scales, almost every relationship was significant. The author discusses the reasons for these results.

Twenty undergraduate students volunteered for the study and were assigned to either the reactive inhibition group, the reciprocal inhibition group, or the non-treatment control group. Sarason's Test Anxiety Scale (TAS), the IPAT Anxiety Scale and the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) were administered to all subjects both before and after treatment in order to assess anxiety level. The reactive inhibition group met for five twenty-minute sessions. Treatment consisted of having subjects concentrate on scenes from a standardized hierarchy of anxiety-arousing test situations, while at the same time  trying to increase any feelings of tension and bodily sensations they were experiencing. The reciprocal inhibition group met for five forty-minute sessions consisting of training in deep muscle relaxation, and imagining scenes from the standardized hierarchy while in this relaxed state. Results were inconclusive, with trends suggesting that the appropriate treatment is dependent upon the objective desired. (Author/CJ)",

        "description":"Ninety-six male undergraduate students participated in an experiment assessing behavioral aggression and addressing itself to the issue of specific versus general mediation of a hypothesized relationship between sexual arousal and aggression. Differing sources of arousal were experimentally crossed with the alteration of the aggressive cue properties of a behavior. Differential responses to different cue properties were observed in the sexual arousal conditions, but not in the other conditions. More specifically, subjects exposed to a sexually arousing film were less aggressive when the aggressive cues were made salient than when these cues were de-emphasized. On the other hand, subjects exposed to a film eliciting general excitation, as well as those exposed to a non-arousing  film, evidenced no differential responsivity in relation to the aggressive cues. This pattern of data was observed in spite of the fact that the degree of \"general arousal\" remained constant in each of the exposure conditions. These results point to the significance of the source of arousal in terms of aggressive behavior. Alternate explanations were discussed for the finding that sexually aroused subjects to whom pain infliction was made highly salient showed reduced aggression. (Author)",

Sixty Anglo subjects (eight and nine years old), identified as a relatively homogeneous group working at approximately the fourth grade level of ability, were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups and taught selected concepts of mathematical symmetry for three consecutive days. Instruction was provided by self-paced booklets having either intermediate or maximal guidance. A posttest developed by the investigator was administered on the fourth day to assess initial learning and, again,  for retention six weeks later.

In order to curb this use among soldiers the Army initiated a comprehensive program to prevent and control the abuse of alcohol and drugs. Prevention was considered to include education, law enforcement, and community action, but particularly education and training. The research reported in this paper assessed the effectiveness of education in preventing drug abuse in the Army units surveyed. A cross-sectional survey of 1,716 men on 16 posts, plus a separate evaluation at one post and group interviews, produced data that suggest that Army drug education programs appear to influence immediate drug use less than related  demographic factors such as last civilian residence, age, or race. Civilian studies corroborate this finding. (Author)",

Recently, the emerging role of the counselor as a specialist, consultant, group learer, and supervisor of paraprofessionals has broadened his contact with the student body as a whole. But these are only stopgap measures until a more highly integrated approach to counseling can be incorporated into the curriculum. The entire student body would benefit from a highly unified program centered around counseling. The model presented emphasizes the integration of the principles of human and career development psychology with the everyday school-related experiences of the child. Because of the nature of the materials which would be employed, the learning experience would be largely activity-centered and  would demand the participation of the pupil as an active rather than as a passive learner.

The National Consortium for Humanizing Education addressed itself to the first of these questions; this document reports on three large N studies of teacher behavior. The first two studies indicate that in describing relationships with affective teacher behavior, it is necessary to move into polynomial models. The third study demonstrates that in predicting student outcomes, factors  other than the linear term of the mean of the teacher's behavior add considerably to the predictive power of the model. Additionally, the fact that the teacher's stability of affective behavior is a significant predictor of student outcomes offers some implications which help explain why polynomial models of affective teacher behavior seemed to be more adequate than linear models. Extensive data graphs, tables, and charts are included. (Author/PC)",

        "description":"A study was conducted among high school students to discern their reasons for dropping out of school. Indepth interviews were conducted with a random sample of 544 dropouts from a large urban board in Canada. The profile of a typical dropout in the literature is one of a chronic low achiever who is aimless, alientated, angry, and has a variety of personal and social problems. This classic pattern accounted for only 23 percent of the current sample. The strategy of this study was to attempt to develop a series of composite pictures or types which defined various categories of dropouts. The largest group of students, 53 percent of the sample, was described as work-oriented and included students who were usually borderline passes, preferring work to school. A similar group,  comprising 6 percent, were the homemakers who left to get married or to get a job. The fourth group was the intellectual elite, students who seemed to have the capacity to do well in school but who had renounced the system. The various patterns of dropping out were discussed with a view toward developing strategies which might help keep these students in school. (Author/PC)",

The topic has been in disfavor, and citizens and educators have tended to swing from one extreme to another in their evaluations of such matters of social concerns. This virtual dismissal of intelligence has been followed by great enthusiasm for the concepts of Piaget and the application to classroom learning problems of Piaget's stages in intellectual development. The irony here is that the tasks of Piaget and the tasks of Binet measure the same general factor in intellectual behavior. There is general support in the speech for individualized tracking and for providing the students with the opportunity to dig more deeply into subject matters than is currently provided in  the curriculum. Schools cannot deny individual differences in students, and so must begin to offer a variety of programs arranged in a variety of ways. (Author/PC)",

The four treatments were Randomized-No Instructions, Randomized-Instructed, Blocked-No Instructions, and Blocked-Instructed. Results support earlier findings that retention and clustering are facilitated by a blocking technique. Clustering was also improved by instructions. For free recall however, instructions aided impulsives but hampered recall for reflectives. This suggests the use of different organizational strategies by people differing in cognitive tempos. Free recall was no better when instructions were given than when they were omitted; however, cued recall was facilitated by  instructions. Support for a retrieval deficit hypothesis is indicated.

By the sixth grade, reflective children displayed less incidental learning and greater central learning than impulsive children when picture stimuli were used. Also, reflective children showed a trade-off of incidental for central learning but impulsive children did not appear to attend selectively. There were no differences between these children in selective attention when shape stimuli were used. It was concluded that reflective children are more flexible in their deployment of selective attention. The findings were discussed in terms of Hagen's two-stage model  of selective attention.

Each child performed two separate tasks in an individual setting. Each task contained a set of four puzzles. Children were asked to &quot;explain&quot; their outcome by attributing their performance to four causal factors: ability, effort, luck, and task. The findings indicated that attributional behavior in achievement settings could not be predicted entirely from informational cues or dispositional biases along. When confronted with consistency information or outcome information  across trials in actual performance settings, the high and low motive groups did not act according to a simple predictable dispositional bias.

The second treatment, a cognitive self-instructional modeling approach, included each of these components plus the behavioral rehearsal of the thought process leading to an effective empathy response. Although the thought process was observed and practiced orally, the overt-verbalizations were faded to covert behaviors by the end of treatment. The dependent measures consisted of pretest and posttest empathy ratings of responses to videotaped emotional stimuli. A repeated measures analysis of variance was employed on the  data. Although both treatments showed substantial gains on empathy from pretest to posttest, the cognitive self-instructional group gained significantly more in their empathy ratings than did the Carkhuff group.

Eight male and eight female graduate students trained in role-playing situations representing a typical and an atypical sex-role condition. Videotapes of the interviews were analyzed to assess reinforcement patterns of counselors. Paper and pencil inventories were filled out. Contrary to expectations, results indicated that counselors exhibited more behavioral bias with typical than with atypical clients. Further, counselors reacted more positively toward the atypical than toward the typical clients. Female counselors appeared to be more  reinforcing and less punishing than male counselors with female clients in both roles, as well as less behaviorally biased than the male counselors. The study concludes with a discussion of implications for counselor training and directions for further research. (Author/PC)",

The sample group was made up of 24 groups of six medical students, up to half of whom were women. The data were collected from responses to a questionnaire administered to the members of each group at the beginning of the semester and again at the end. The findings indicated that a solo woman poses the greatest threat to the security and stability of a formerly all-male group, and as such is subject to intense peer pressure to assume a low profile. A group with several women poses a somewhat different situation. Two women in a group do not necessarily form a supportive dyad, as the men in the group may succeed in dividing the women thereby minimizing the threat. Groups with  three women seem to offer the greatest potential for self-actualization by women. The authors recommend that faculty responsible for forming mixed-sex groups of medical students do so, where feasible, in approximately equal numbers of men and women. (Author/PC)",

At  the end of the 14 weeks, 48 members of the group rated the overall impression of the value of the group study as excellent; 48 rated it good; and only 12 called it fair.

But somehow in our society we have failed to build in reasons for appreciating those added years. Our heritage has been adapted to career building with the concommitant factors of home-making and family-raising. Through this Puritan approach to life there has been a poor job done of developing values for aging. The basic assumption that is made about man as his chronological age increases is that he is inclined to make sense out of his life in a new and fundamental way. This is not an implication which can be used in so limited a situation as retraining or rehabilitation. Rather it is a suggestion that the aging person look about himself, assess  his personal potentialities, and try to define a set of values relevant to his situation. There is necessity for re-examining and re-defining values called for in the nature of the aging person. Education for the aging person requires vigor of mind in designing a program with reasonable prospects of success. Perhaps the best educational program for aging is that which begins in early life and progressively prepares for transforming values into learning. (Author)",

Additionally, each student is assigned to work in a program area in either the Student Counseling Center or the Academic Advisement Center. In-service training for the paraprofessionals begins with a three-day workshop in the Spring semester and another in the Fall prior to the beginning of the second year. During the academic year, this training is conducted through a  university class, \"Student Advisor Laboratory\", for which each participant receives three credit hours.

        "description":"This counselor training program is based on the self-management concept which has been \"field-tested\", and which focuses upon trainee behaviors and is committed to self-directed change. Program participants were assigned to learning labs of six to eleven students where they worked in triads on a communication skills approach to interpersonal interactions. At the beginning of each lab session, students identified two goals they hoped to achieve during that session. A self-evaluation component was included in order to establish a self-reinforcement schedule. While students learned to identify behavioral changes they would like to have made in the learning process, they were not always able to observe changes they were actually making. The author discusses the difficulties  associated with using this technique with actual clients. (Author)",

Motivation was determined by measuring both student performance and the time spent on the performance task. Eighty students from two grade levels (six and ten) took part in the experiment. Materials used consisted of a booklet of line-drawing problems. Predicted differences in performance for subjects in the two conditions failed to materialize. While the data from this study tended to be somewhat nonsupportive, certain results seemed to offer sufficient incentive to prompt modifications in the instruments and the sample population for future investigation.

        "description":"In measuring personal attitudes toward drug users, it is important to minimize the fabrication of \"socially desirable\" responses. This drug attitude film was designed to reduce such fabrication by (1) presenting vivid stimuli that provoke strong feelings, (2) using oblique response scales, and (3) requiring quick responses. The author reviews the preliminary research on the instrument properties in two studies. In the first, data was collected for 21 college students on their responses to the different modes of presentation of the film material (printed transcripts of the film clips, silent presentation of the film, and presentation of the regular film). In the second study, pre- and post-responses to the DAF were obtained from 93 seniors in a required two-day drug education  program. Responses indicate some significant changes from pre- to post-test. The author discusses whether or not use of the film is worthwhile due to the complication of administration. Excerpts from the film, \"Grooving\", are included. (Author/PC)",

        "description":"Following the reasoning of \"expectation states theory\", the present study was designed to answer three questions: (1) Is the task orientation of males and females different when they work on a task together? (2) Is the task orientation of males and females working on a task, separately, different? and, (3) If there are differences, will status theory account for them? Forty male and forty female high school students served as subjects in the study and were placed in several different mixed- and same-gender groups. The group task was a board game which required collective decision-making and allowed investigation of the effect of female status on the emergence of female leadership. Results showed that mixed-gender groups were more active than single-gender groups, and that when  males engage in collective tasks with females they are excessively active. While the analysis helped dispel prevalent notions that males are, in fact, more task-oriented than females, it shed little light on the extent of status differentiation, based on gender, that occurs within groups.

        "author":["Wong, Martin R."],
        "description":"This paper delineates models of drug abuse prevention education that have been indicated in the literature during the past six years, and discusses the research related to each. The nine models were considered according to: (1) basic premises, (2) positive and negative salient criticisms, and, (3) implications and modes of application for drug abuse prevention education. Models under discussion are: (1) the legal, political model; (2) the fear induction model; (3) the medical, psychiatric model; (4) the psychosocial, human skills model; (5) the information processing, rationality model; (6) the reinforcement model; (7) the religious, spiritual model; (8) the assumed drive model; and (9) the alternatives model. What emerges from the reported data is that drug abuse is a complex  phenomenon and that a wide variety of programs and modes have been used in an attempt to counteract it. First, peer influence seems an effective way of bringing about desired changes in drug abusing behavior, particularly among young persons. A second important consideration involves human interaction, a theme paramount to the medical psychiatric, psycho-social human skills, reinforcement and the alternatives models. This present review calls, as do other similar reviews, for more and better research and followup. Since humans vary so greatly, it seems unlikely that the linkage of a decline in drug use to some specific fact of one particular mode of prevention education will occur. The plethora of approaches and models may remain, for some time to come, the most reasonable attack on the  problem. (Author/PC)",

The Ball-Stick-Bird method is a code-emphasis approach developed by Rene Fuller. In this system, each letter of the alphabet is taught on the basis of its distinctive features. Capital letters are used exclusively in the first books, and the distinctiveness of each letter is established by showing that it may be composed of a unique arrangement of three basic forms: a line, a circle, and an angle, called, respectively, a stick, a ball, and a bird. The subjects used in the study were first graders; three groups of children had been classified as educable mentally retarded and one group as emotionally disturbed. The IQs  of the students ranged from the low 40s into the 80s. Findings indicated that the method was effective in developing the reading skills of students with previous records of reading failure. The results of the study are presented in narrative and table format. (RB)",

At the end of the course, students must demonstrate their ability to skim a short reading passage and write a one-sentence summary of its central theme and main ideas, as well as to outline the passage so that relevant details are organized to reflect the original. The course consists of two parts. In the first part, the teaching of various methods of attacking study reading is discussed. Students are taught to read for the main idea, locate topic sentences, distinguish between general and specific statements, read for paragraph structure, and practice writing concise summaries. The second  part of the course consists of problem solving with difficult reading materials in order to give the students experience. The teacher guides the learner through the problem-solving process by helping the learner identify the problem and by suggesting bases for possible solutions. It is concluded that teaching problem solving develops human potential and enables individuals to maximize their skills and resources so that they can establish their independence and fulfill themselves in relation to their environment.

Metropolitan reading and Slosson intelligence tests were also administered. Significant relationships between syntax attainment and reading achievement (R = .70) and between reading achievement and certain syntactic competencies were found. The competencies most closely associated with reading achievement were compound subject formation, adjective and adverb modification in the N/V statement, and auxiliary verb question formation. The causative effect of syntax attainment on the reading achievement of the subjects was demonstrated through analysis of redundancy coefficients. Syntax attainment was also shown to  be significantly superior to intelligence as a predictor of reading achievement. Results of the study imply the importance of syntax attainment in assessment of reading achievement, in reading instruction, and in the development of models of the reading process. (Author)",

However, obtaining this information using traditional diagnostic tools is particularly difficult and time consuming because of the variety and complexity of the skills involved. This paper proposes the use of PLATO, a computer-aided instruction system, for the rapid diagnosis of reading skills. A study was conducted to compare the performance of children taking a reading comprehension test on PLATO to that of children taking the same test with paper and pencil. Fourteen fifth graders and 22 sixth graders from a medium-sized parochial school in Madison, Wisconsin, participated in the study. The results showed that with proper response procedures children performed  comparably in the two testing situations. This paper contains the details of the study and includes a brief outline of future plans to develop a total on-line diagnostic system. (Author/RB)",

A prescription sheet is filed for each student. A student selects reading materials and/or reading machines and vocabulary words and then works through the individual prescription at his or her own pace. Class sessions for group interaction are conducted. In combining self-pacing with other approaches in a writing program, it is important to use the student's own writing as the  basis of the learning module, the module being designed to help the student revise his or her own papers, line by line, and process by process.

Begun in 1971, the program serves first through sixth grade students in a number of schools. The students move through a cycle in which their reading levels are determined and their specific reading skill needs are diagnosed. On this basis, subgrouping takes place within levels according to specific needs, and instructional activities are prescribed and conducted to meet individual and group needs. When a student has mastered the skills at one level, his or her needs at the next level are diagnosed and the cycle begins again. Feedback about each child's  performance is provided to children individually, to children in small groups, and to parents in conferences. A major goal of the program is to evolve an increasingly efficient differentiated staff operation and to develop detailed descriptions of staff roles and organization charts. Program materials include informal reading inventories, a teacher handbook, and a collection of plans for varied skill development activities. (TO/AIR)",

The children, most of whom are white, come from middle-income families in a small city. The program was developed to strengthen the basic reading program by using songs, word riddles, and play-at-home games. Specifically, the program aims to develop early in the first-grade experience the ability to hear and visually recognize separate sounds in words; to familiarize beginning readers with the vocabulary they will later encounter in their basal texts; to develop the meaning of the vocabulary taught; and to present necessary patterned drill without the usual monotony of traditional instruction. Students are  taught a traditional first-grade song, which the teacher subsequently uses as the basis for reading skill instruction. Song cards are used to provide sounds in the context of words and words in the context of sentences, and to develop phonetic sounds that include consonants, vowels, blends, diphthongs, and phonograms. The play-at-home games are vocabulary maintenance games. The program operates in the regular classroom. (WR/AIR)",

One model postulates that a reader primarily uses sound/symbol cues to recognize a word; a second model states that a reader focuses mainly on whole-word characteristics. To determine which model best fits beginning and adult readers, a multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine the relative strength of sound/symbol and whole-word characteristics as predictors of word recognition difficulty. The analysis indicated that whole-word characteristics are strong predictors of recognition difficulty at all levels; sound/symbol characteristics are significant predictors up to the fourth grade. This was interpreted as evidence that beginning readers use sound/symbol and whole-word cues but gradually  become less reliant on sound/symbol information. In an effort to increase the predictable variance in word recognition difficulty, another predictor (previous exposure to a word) was experimentally entered into the regression equation. It was found that exposure to a word was the strongest predictor of word recognition difficulty. This was interpreted as evidence that experience with a word is an important, if not the most important, aspect of the word recognition process. (Author)",

The remedial approach employs reading centers, diagnostic-prescriptive techniques, programmed learning multimedia materials, and individualized contracts. Materials are self-directing and self-correcting, and students chart their own progress. Training of teachers in the content areas is accomplished by a system of  assists: the content area trainee assists a more fully trained teacher in the reading laboratory and is in turn assisted by a master reading teacher in his or her own classroom.

The program employs a diagnostic-prescriptive approach to instruction in a nongraded setting through the use of the Lippincott Basic Reading program. When a child enters the program, he is introduced to a decoding process that teaches him to sound out all letter sounds. During this decoding process the child is able to connect the sounds, or partial words, into a complete word. All phonetic activities, including word songs, ear-training exercises to distinguish sounds, and pictures to discriminate and recognize words, are introduced in grades 1 and 2. The child learns to reinforce the skill by reading from workbooks, dittoed materials, filmstrips, and code books  that offer additional practice in the development of reading skills. Much of the phonetic introduction and reinforcement is done in group settings. If a child is having difficulty in the group, the teacher or aide takes the child out of the group to teach the child in an individual setting. All during the program, various types of reading materials and activities, including other texts, library materials, kits, listening posts, and card games are used. (WR/AIR)",

The program curriculum is designed to improve the student's basic skills in reading and social science learning. The student reads or listens to short passages that are based on the concept of the functional community. After each passage, the student answers up to 18 multiple-choice questions that are directly related to the content of the passage but that may require the student to evaluate or generalize from the passage. Students score their own tests and enter their scores on reading profile sheets. Project students receive about 50 minutes a day of instruction in this reading program. At the beginning of the year, each student's reading status is  determined from his or her ability to read the first two or three passages in the curriculum. Students who read the first several passages correctly proceed through the materials at their own rate, recording answers to the questions following each passage on an answer sheet, scoring the sheet, and recording their scores on profiles. During this process the teacher serves as a supervisor, adviser, and motivator. (WR/AIR)",

One of the goals of the program, begun in 1969, is to permit the junior college to retain or even slightly increase its academic standards while, at the same time, admitting all students irrespective of their preparation. To improve the skills of students, a three-unit course in reading/study skills is offered. The goals of the students taking the course range from passing the GED examination to excelling in upper-level humanities courses. The initial phase of the course is a teacher-student interview for which the student assesses his or her own needs and goals. During the initial development of the individual program for that student, the instructor  observes the student's skills and adjusts the instructor to remedy the deficits. The instructor always places a strong emphasis on supportive counseling so that the student's immediate academic needs are being met by the program. The program is designed to correct the skill deficiencies of those students who, prior to this program, had histories of dropping out or academic failure. It also serves many high-achievement students who take the course to work on specific skills. (TO/AIR)",

The New Approach Method is a series of 84 gamelike lessons, each of which is taped for a particular child by his or her learning partner. The first 36 lessons cover use of the tape recorder and prereading skills such as color recognition, spatial relationships, shapes, and cardinal and ordinal number concepts. The remaining lessons teach reading skills such as identification and printing of letters, consonant and vowel sounds, word families, and sight word recognition. Several concepts are usually combined in each lesson, and concepts  are repeated and reviewed frequently. Accompanying each lesson is a series of worksheets that provide visual reinforcement for the taped lesson. By the way a child responds to instructions, the learning partner knows when the child has not understood a key concept. The learning partner can then reinforce the new lesson with supplementary activities, repeat prior lessons, or ask family members or school staff members for help in presenting the lesson. (TO/AIR)",

General reading and language problems, including younger students' deficiencies in language readiness, are treated with a language-experience approach. At the secondary level, groups are formed for children with mild and severe reading problems. All of these groups  meet from two to five times a week under the direction of a reading specialist. Skills taught in these groups are reinforced by the regular classroom teacher. Children who need concentrated language readiness and beginning reading instruction are placed in an open-space second grade. In this setting, two classroom teachers and volunteer aides work with a reading specialist on an intense language readiness program. (WR/AIR)",

The prime objective of the program is to ensure that all Maryland students can meet society's reading demands. The following three major considerations determine the goals: the reader as a person, the reading conditions, and the purposes for reading. Functional reading skills are identified to enable students to cope with everyday experiences that involve written communications, such as directions, forms, labels, and mail, and to achieve personal development. Specific reading goals are established for students to achieve by grades six, ten, and twelve. For example, among the expectations for students in grade ten are the ability to read  applications for a driver's license, job, and welfare and for medical and banking purposes; to understand directions for cooking, sewing, and mechanical devices; and to use vocabulary words related to individual needs. The program delineates the skills that all students should achieve, but it is expected that many students will acquire additional skills to improve their reading ability. (WR/AIR)",

The information on this chart provides the structure for instructional strategies which focus on the development of gross and fine motor, visual and auditory perceptual, and cognitive language skills. Using an array of sequenced publishers' materials, all the children pursue prescribed activities that develop these skills. Reading and language skills are taught with the Distar reading and language  programs. Second graders also spend 50 minutes a day working in the High Intensity Learning System (HILS) center.

The program encourages students to tape-record many stories or experiences that are important to them. Typed copies are returned to the children and put into their folders, which then become personalized readers. When the children receive their typed stories, they may choose to share them with their teacher or their  peers, or simply to read them to themsleves. Sometimes a small group of the entire class uses the blackboard to describe a special class activity; this helps students to build sentences and talk about a main idea. Another strategy encouraging self-expression is a daily journal. Read-aloud literature is often used to foster appreciation of books and to stimulate children to create stories on their own.

The program is designed to train school personnel to identify perceptual deficits in areas specifically undergirding the reading process in kindergarten or first-grade children and to implement needed remediation so that students will be able to profit from formal reading instruction. At the beginning of the program, 20 reading teachers representing eight school districts attended a four-week summer workshop. These teachers were trained to administer screening instruments to kindergarten children entering first grade, to interpret the results, and to prescribe and implement activities to help identified children overcome their perceptual or  developmental lags. Remediation activities used include training in auditory and visual discrimination of objects, letters, and words; visual-motor coordination; knowledge of the alphabet; recognition and reproduction of sight words; and concept formation. The program includes a monitoring and evaluation component and regularly scheduled supervision of the program participants by the director and staff. (WR)",

A diagnostic-prescriptive reading profile is developed for each student, and instruction is based on objectives. Classrooms feature learning and interest centers. Learning packages are organized to teach specific skills and are coded for use by the teacher, aide, or parent or by the child independently. The packets emphasize self-correcting and self-pacing activities and employ a multimedia approach. The materials include linguistics and phonics  textbooks, worksheets, workbooks, library books, audiovisual media, and manipulative devices.

About 85 percent of the students are white and come from both middle- and low-income families living in an urban area. This approach to reading is based on the assumption that to master reading skills, the child needs assistance at every new step in the learning process. The program precedes and supplements the regular basic reading program with instruction offered to children who have reading problems. The emphasis in the program is placed on phonic skills, comprehension, and language-related skills. The program, which begins at a low learning level and proceeds step by step, is geared to teaching handicapped students and slow learners. The fact that no memorization  of key words is necessary makes the approach advantageous for a child who has a limited vocabulary. Mimeographed practice sheets are used to take the child through each of seven steps in the mastery of associating letter forms with corresponding speech sounds. Steps for each sequential decoding skill are determined by task analysis and developed as part of the program. (WR)",

Staggered scheduling allows two ungraded reading chains of 12 groups each to meet 45 minutes daily. Grouping is determined not by grade level but by reading comprehension. The reading specialist and classroom teachers teach the reading chain groups in morning and afternoon reading classes. Pupils move up the chain on teacher recommendation. Initially, all pupils view the same 10 half-hour formula phonics video tapes, which teach them a system for decoding. The students also meet in &quot;dialogue groups&quot; in which the oral reader (called the model) uses the system to decode  unfamiliar words. Reinforcement is accomplished in a companion spelling program and in followup activities. Reading matter is chosen for its literary worth and interest level. Instruction is designed to move quickly from questions that clarify the reading to discussions that involve Socratic dialoguing, which teaches critical thinking skills and open-ended questioning at the highest level.

The following five programs to help individualize elementary school reading instruction have been instituted: a comprehensive reading program, an early identification program, a transition grade program, a Title I remedial reading program, and an enrichment program. For the comprehensive reading program, a hierarchy of essential reading skills for K-6 has been developed. Teaching suggestions, useful materials, and criterion-referenced tests have been keyed to these skills. The transition grade program, for kindergarten children identified as high risk, is a one-year program before first grade,  offering the children a chance to mature. The Title I program involves the use of modified Wisconsin Design materials to diagnose, prescribe, and evaluate students' progress toward specific reading behavioral objectives. The enrichment program consists of Junior Great Books clubs. Remedial reading classes are provided in each school. (TO)",

The overall social mobility from generation to generation is very similar in both countries, as are the relative effects of social origin and individual ability on educational attainment and social status. Although the American educational system is more open and competitive than the British system, the qualities that lead to high levels of attainment are very much the same in both countries. These findings are interpreted in relation to Lipset's analysis of the two countries' value systems and Turner's contrast between &quot;sponsored&quot; and &quot;contest&quot; mobility patterns. It is suggested that the two countries use quite different mechanisms to  bring about largely the same result. (Author/JG)",

Parts one and two trace the evolution of social learning theory in education and planning. Part three attempts to identify within a practical setting -- a ten-week project to plan and develop an ecology site with eighth graders -- elements of this dual process of individual change through experience and social system change through experimentation. Part four examines the impact of group structure (size and composition) on group effectiveness in participatory planning and action. It was found that four students to one facilitator appeared to be the most consistently effective ratio for  beginning groups and that heterogeneity in group composition appeared to lower group effectiveness. Other variables considered included the nature of the task activity, the role of the facilitator, time, the role of structure, expert knowledge, and consensus on goals in supporting participatory action. In part five, implications for research and action are drawn from the experience with the junior high students. (Author/MLF)",

School boards from politically contentious districts tend to be more responsive, but they have even less success challenging the dominance of the superintendent than do less responsive school boards. To make schools truly responsive, some means will have to be found to offset the dominance that results from the specialized knowledge and expertise of the superintendent. There is some evidence that schools are gradually becoming more politicized and less isolated from their constituents, but it is doubtful that the educational content or achievements of \"responsive\" schools would differ markedly from unresponsive  schools. Even so, as long as people are committed to maintaining the trappings of democracy in education, the realities of democracy should be achieved; school boards should either govern or be abolished.

The objectives of the study were: (1) to investigate some interaction patterns among members of the school populations, (2) to investigate some interaction patterns between the school population and the available physical resources, (3) to investigate the physical systems as a background to the educational environment, and (4) to organize information to be used in developing design criteria for educational facilities. Two public elementary schools, matched for educational philosophy, available resources, budget, and demographic description, were selected for the study. Data were taken from discrete time sample viewing of remote-controlled videotape recordings made  simultaneously in the schools, controlling for subject, time of day, and day of week. Videotape information was supplemented by informal interviews, observations, and measures of the physical environmental systems. The results suggest three general conclusions: (1) the open plan design appears to facilitate the interaction patterns of the schools' philosophy better than the fixed plan, (2) there is more use of the available physical resources in the open plan school, and (3) first grade and fourth grade interaction patterns may necessitate different design requirements.

A pool of response distinctions was collected, with special attention to those commonly made in training practice. A large number of training strategies were also collected and organized into a classification scheme.

OR data collection should be viewed in terms of objective, cost, and effectiveness. For the model formulation objective, proper data strategies emphasize multiple views of the operating system to identify the \"relatednesses\" to be depicted. For the objective of estimating parameters or testing predictions, bias, precision, and level of confidence of results are effectiveness concepts to be balanced against cost. Decision and utility theory, sensitivity analysis, and sequential analysis apply or OR data collection strategies and employ operational parameters to define data needed and, hence, minimize costs.

Remote auditory prompting was accompanied by increases in five of these behaviors. Increases in three behaviors and a decrease in one behavior occurred when the videotape self-monitoring procedure was used. Overall, increases were greater using the RAP procedure.

        "description":"Written for Iowa's school psychologists, the report examines current issues in mental retardation including the problem of definition, court actions affecting the schools, and trends in educational programming, evaluation, and diagnosis. Considered are reasons why mental retardation is difficult to define (such as the lack of an acceptable definition of intelligence), historical changes in the definition, and the differences between the 1961 and 1973 American Association on Mental Deficiency (AAMD) definitions. Iowa's current use of the 1961 AAMD definition is discussed. Recent court decisions on due process and service to low functioning children are reviewed as they affect school psychologists. Discussion of educational programming focuses implications of the trend toward the  Cascade System of Special Educational Services (a continuum of instructional levels to meet the educational needs of children regardless of traditional labels); on the desirability of mainstreaming; and a special class curriculum and instruction. Effects of the Cascade System and the team approach on the school psychologist's role in identification, evaluation, and diagnosis, and a model process for making intervention decisions are examined. The author suggests that school psychologists become leaders and catalysts in changing professional practices in the education of mentally handicapped children. Listed and described are statewide health, education, and welfare services for the mentally handicapped available in Iowa. (LS)",

The report explains the program's rationale (focusing on potential advantages of regular class placement of handicapped learners and on estimated costs of special class and consulting teacher approaches) and methods (including behavior theory, service and research activities, teacher preparation, and dissemination of skills and knowledge). The summary of program results, in which program projections are compared with  actual accomplishments, indicates that participating teachers developed methods to measure educational deficits of handicapped children on a daily basis, that measured educational deficits were ameliorated through applications of behavior modification principles, and that the effectiveness of such application was researched through functional analyses of behavior.

        "description":"The research study (described in a paper presented at the 1973 American Speech and Hearing Association Convention) was designed to compare information obtained from the use of the ABC and the Boone/Prescott Systems, two different procedures for recording and analyzing speech clinician-client interaction. Videotapes were made of eight University of North Dakota student speech clinicians involved in articulation and language therapy with 4-to-6-year-old clients. Because both systems did not contain a time factor, it was difficult to establish whether or not the two systems would provide the clinician with similar information. Greater ease was noted in recording within the Boone/Prescott system. The two systems yielded approximately the same information when the therapy situation  was basically stimulus, response, reinforcement, with a minimum of irrelevant behavior; however, the ABC System gave more pertinent information when the session was poorly planned and carried out. Both systems provided objective information which could be useful in changing clinician behavior. (LH)",

Ss tended to be placed in the special schools earlier than EMH students in the U.S. are placed in special classes. Classes were observed to determine teaching style, and children were administered a version of the Intellectual Achievement Responsibility Questionnaire, a measure of locus of control. The level of intellectual stimulation and types of learning opportunities offered were evaluated along the following parameters: level of cognitive demands, variability of cognitive demands, sources of cognitive demands, richness of activities, pupil task involvement, degree of individualization,  sources of individualization, and modes of teacher influence. Comparison with American classes revealed that Dutch teachers depend much less on recitation, discussion, and individual interactive tutoring than American teachers, that Dutch children displayed a much higher degree of self-direction and persistence than American children, and that Dutch children showed a slightly lower level of internal locus of control than American children. Noted is the lack in the Netherlands of consistency in pedagogical theory, curriculum, or teaching style and the high degree of reliance on the individual teacher in supervising instruction. (DB)",

Outlined is quarter by quarter progress made on strategies carried over from fiscal year 1973 and 15 strategies for fiscal year 1974 relating to material development and services (such as the development of the Storyland and Holidayland filmstrip series, the My LIFE Pictionary-Multiple Meanings, and a series of language sets on themes including safety, energy, and communication). Activities of the research department  field test network (such as corresponding with special research projects and designing auditory supplement packages ) from June 1, 1973 through May 31, 1974 and developments in General Electric's (GE) marketing of Project LIFE instructional materials (such as the addition of three audiovisual dealers for marketing the GE/LIFE Program) are summarized. Charted are the dates, personnel involved, locations, and purposes of third quarter meetings between Project LIFE representatives and representatives of various programs and organizations. A symposium presentation which includes a review of Project LIFE's 10-year history, specific program objectives, and a list of materials currently available is appended. (LS)",

Studies classifying poor readers by a verbal-performance pattern analysis of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and multifactorial studies of etiological factors are discussed. Described is a procedure which uses the Minnesota Percepto-Diagnostic Test (MPD) to assess visual perception and visual motor abilities and which classifies children's reading problems as primary, secondary or organic and children with behavioral problems as emotionally disturbed, schizophrenic, or brain damaged. Specific behavioral  characteristics (as manifested in performance on five standardized tests of reading and cognitive development) are analyzed for 172 Ss to show that children differentiated into reading disability subgroups by the MPD (on the basis of visual perception). Characteristics noted include the primary group's high average performance IQ, the secondary group's low average scores on the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities, and the organic group's low scores on laterality tests. Findings are compared to those of similar studies. (LS)",

The study provided two 5-minute situations, a play situation and a storytelling situation, in which the mother's speech to her children was viewed. In general, mothers produced speech that was slow, with pauses located always, and only, at sentence boundaries when they talked with their younger children. They used a smaller vocabulary range and often repeated what they had said, with and without variation. Mothers seldom made linguistically meaningless repetitions or interjections, and they seldom produced broken sentences in talking with their younger children. The  mothers' sentences fell into two major patterns--one built on the imperative sentence and the other including variations and permutations of a \"be\" sentence with \"that\", \"this\", \"it\", \"there\", or \"here.\" Mothers also used more single-word responses and gramatically incomplete responses in talking with their younger children.

Results supported conclusions such as the following: that deaf Ss can be taught to hear five speech discriminations through the  tactual mode; that hundreds of corrected repetitions are required for either a deaf or hearing S to learn simple tactual discriminations; and that the S's memory and ability to discriminate increases as the number of words he has mastered increases.

The principal evidence Perlmutter cites for the necessity of the SSC is the behavior of the Spanish particle \"se.\" However, it is demonstrated here that there is at least one case in which a different deep structure analysis of \"se\" would obviate the need for a SSC. Perlmutter's analyses of the other sources of \"se\" are also examined critically. It is suggested that the whole notion of SSCs deserves fresh examination. (LG)",

        "description":"Two experiments conducted at the University of Texas at Austin are discussed in this paper. One experiment deals with the production of final syllable lengthening and stress in Spanish and English by native Spanish speakers learning English. The other experiment deals with judgments about the Spanish speakers' production of English by native English speakers. In the former experiment, duration and frequency are measured. From these measurements, final syllable lengthening and duration and frequency ratios between stressed and unstressed syllables are calculated. In the latter experiment, the Spanish speakers are ranked according to their overall English pronunciation ability as perceived by native English speakers. Explanations are given for the durational and frequency  adjustments the subjects make from Spanish to English, and the implications of the experimental results for English training programs for Spanish speakers are discussed.

Political language can shape people's opinions and thereby shape events. There appear to be two beliefs or myths that people use to explain social problems: the first sees the sufferer as responsible for his own plight in a basically sound social structure; the second sees the sufferer as the victim of an oppressive society that exploits the weak for the benefit of the elite. Linguistic cues such as &quot;welfare,&quot;&quot;repression,&quot;&quot;security&quot; evoke and reinforce these myths in the public mind and thereby shape the political process. The language used to classify and delimit social problems separates them into categories while they are actually symptoms of the same  malfunctioning economic and social system; they are treated separately and, therefore, are not solved. Language of rehabilitation or professional solutions to political problems is used to soothe public anxiety, gain public approval, and stifle opposition. Such solutions often do little to solve problems; therefore, they continue. (CK)",

        "author":["Blaubergs, Maija S."],
        "description":"Early psycholinguistic investigations were based on linguistic theory (primarily Chomsky's transformational theory) as a model of competence. Recent studies have suggested that naive language users neither make the same linguistic judgments as the theorizing linguists nor productively follow the linguistic rules, and that nonlinguistic knowledge may be involved in the interpretation of sentences. Thus, psychologists are beginning to question the feasibility of using linguistic theory as the model of competence and have turned instead to developing comprehensive theories that include competence and performance, linguistic and nonlinguistic knowledge, and contextual effects. If this broader psychological approach is focused on the interpretation of anomalous sentences, anomaly may  well be replaced by interpretability, and interpretability may well be affected by a given context, or by imaginatively providing a context, as well as by the application of linguistic rules. A pilot study is reported, and further research questions are outlined. (Author)",

This is not an attempt to write a phonology, but rather an outline of some theoretical and formal devices that may be used for gaining insight into the phonological system of the child. An evaluation procedure suggested is that of \"developmental adequacy\" which accounts for the process by which a child moves closer to a system that is constantly presented to him. Such a procedure includes statements of stability that mark certain aspects of the child's system as similar to, and others as distinct from, the model to which he is presented. A summary of rules suggested for the child's system include: reduplication, diminution, production alternation,  and adaptation. The productive rule is introduced to cover the child's comprehension of sounds he does not yet produce, and the adaptive rule expands the notion of \"developmental adequacy.\" (Author/LG)",

The shift is characterized as a general movement away from surface observation and analysis to attempts at the description and analysis of underlying linguistic forms. The interest in underlying linguistic forms has, in a rather natural way, led investigators to confront once again the seemingly awesome relationship between language and cognition. In the area of child language, there have been some interesting attempts to describe cognitive precursors to language and the cognitive relations expressed in semantic intention. These cognitive aspects of language development have important implications in instruction and program development for the linguistically deviant child.  (Author)",

Begun in Toronto, Canada as the result of pressure from both the ethnic community and from educators, the program is designed to run for the two years of kindergarten (junior and senior). The bilingual teacher, with the help of a bilingual teaching assistant, conducts classes using mainly Italian. English is introduced gradually with the intention that by the third year of school (i.e., grade 1), the pupils will be able to enter a regular program and learn to read and write in English. Comparisons made between the experimental group and children of similar backgrounds in regular English kindergarten programs revealed two major  differences, favoring the experimental group: availability of the mother tongue resulted in a larger proportion of children participating in group conversations and in their parents having more contact with the school. Appendix A consists of background reports relating to the implementation of the program, and Appendix B contains copies of the observation schedules, teachers' rating instruments, and parents' questionnaires used for the project. Findings are detailed in Appendix C. (Author/PMP)",

        "description":"Mongoloid children appear to be useful candidates for studying difficult methodological problems found in developmental research. They represent a subpopulation in which general development is markedly slower than in the normal child and in which language development appears to be more dependent on age than general intellectual development. This report discusses some important considerations for studying a child with a restricted linguistic system, including data collecting, segmentation and glossing of utterances, and speech style. The subject of this study was a five-and-a-half-year-old mongoloid boy who was studied over a two-day period, and from whom 270 utterances were collected. Forty percent of the child's utterances were intelligible and could be segmented by intonational  contours, pauses, change of speakers, and mean length of utterance. Establishing new criteria for glossing unintelligible utterances enabled most of the rest of the corpus to be glossed. An analysis of the glossable utterances classified as conversation showed that the child's style was characterized by: (1) volume changes, (2) phonetic changes relating to the other person's speech, (3) rephrasing when misunderstood, (4) vocal and gestural annoyance, and (5) gestures complementing the conversational context. A summary of the phonological analysis is provided. (Author/LG)",

Recent sociolinguistic studies take the view that social rules, rights, and duties are properties not of individuals but of interaction itself, and are constantly changing. This implies that social organization derives not from an idealized structure but from continually evolving everyday life. In order to communicate in a language, therefore, it is necessary to learn a community's rules for speaking along with the language's grammatical structure. Conversational analysis may eventually be used to solve problems of culture learning and cross-cultural interaction. (CK)",

At least one major objective is stated for each section of the guide. This objective is a broad statement encompassing the work of large units or entire sections. Numbered sub-objectives are also included. They are specific statements intended to  indicate the level of learning, the course content, and the means of evaluation. Nearly all of the objectives are followed by a list of suggested activities. (Author/PMP)",

        "description":"Constraining linguistic metatheory by demanding that it allow the construction of grammars for all the frequently occurring idiolects of standard American English is shown to narrow the choices among competing theoretical positions. In this way data from a nonhomogeneous speech community are used to illuminate rather than cloud a theoretical question. &quot;While&quot;-clauses are taken as exemplary of the class of English adverbial clauses in general and temporal clauses in particular. In surface structure, &quot;while&quot;-clauses are shown to be Chomsky adjoined to the verb phrase if postposed and to be attached directly to the S-node if preposed or medial. Following M. Geis (1970) the internal structure is shown to be that of an adverbial relative clause. A rule of Oblique Equi-NP Deletion is  motivated to account for subjectless &quot;while&quot;-clauses. Two alternative deep structure sources for &quot;while&quot;-clauses are discussed: The higher-S and lower-S analyses. Data from 345 native speakers of English are shown to require the construction of three distinct grammatical descriptions of the constraints on Oblique Equi-NP Deletion. Requiring that linguistic theory allow just these grammars to be written eliminates the possibility of constructing grammars in which no rules are extrinsically ordered. The higher-S analysis is shown to require a serious violation of the Strict Cycle Condition, while the lower-S analysis is shown to require the use of an ad hoc category and to predict the existence of a dialect of dubious existence.

Now in its fifth year of operation, the St. Martin project serves the rural communities of Breaux Bridge and Parks, in classes from kindergarten through grade 5. Detailed here are the project's policies on staff development, curriculum planning and implementation, and progress reporting. Activities of the Parent Advisory Committee, involving parents of project participants and other interested community members, are also described. The following four factors lending supportive evidence for the success of the bilingual education program in St. Martin Parish are summarized: (1) Studies show that approximately 85 percent to 90 percent of the performance  objectives for both the English and French areas of instruction have been achieved by 70 percent or more of the students; (2) pre- and posttest comparisons reveal that bilingual education program students do as well as or better than nonbilingual students on achievement tests; (3) differences in grade equivalent scores are significantly higher in favor of bilingual education students; (4) the Bilingual Education Program has been strongly supported by members of the community.

        "author":["Chafe, Wallace L."],
        "description":"The report documents performance on a 24-month R&D effort oriented toward the development of a computerized model for machine translation of natural languages. The model is built around a set of procedures called verbalization, intended to stimulate the processes employed by a speaker or writer in turning stored information into words. Verbalization is seen to consist of subconceptualization and lexicalization processes which involve creative choices on the part of the verbalizer, together with algorithmic syntactic processes determined by the language being used. Translation is viewed as (1) the reconstruction of the verbalization processes which went into the original source language text and (2) the application of parallel verbalization processes in the target language. The  target language verbalization looks for creative choices to the source language verbalization and tries to apply corresponding choices simultaneously with application of syntactic processes dictated by the grammar of the target language. Verbalization and translation processes are illustrated in some detail with examples taken from English and Japanese. Some of these processes have been implemented in an interactive program on CDC 6600 at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (AEC), but the main intent of the report is to demonstrate the kinds of processes that need to be incorporated in such a system.

It begins with a short questionnaire to be filled out by the cooperating teacher, designed to help the teacher decide how he or she actually feels about working with a student teacher. In the next section of the guide, suggestions are made concerning an orientation program for the student teacher, followed by a list of suggested activities for the first few weeks of the student teacher's working session. The sample student teacher observation sheet provided next is to be filled out daily by the cooperating teacher. A detailed checklist for evaluating the student teacher's personal characteristics, general teaching ability, foreign language ability,  and professionalism is presented, followed by suggested criteria for making these evaluations. The guide concludes with an analysis of foreign language teacher competency requirements. (PMP)",

        "description":"Until the end of the 19th century there were basically two traditions in American universities, all of which, for practical purposes, were private, nonprofit institutions. The first and unquestionably more important of these traditions was that of the church-related college. The second great tradition was the notion of elitist, liberal education. The big change in American higher education patterns came with the expansion of state university systems, particularly after the Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890. Presently, there are three conceivable organizational schemes for the operation of universities. These are the free market organization, dictatorship, and a cooperative system. The university world is presently in the process of passing from the second to the third of these  without the first ever having been seriously tried. The third model, the co-op model, is meant to imply joint ownership by a large group of people. But multiple ownership with delegated, centralized management and transferable interests guarantees results quite different from those found in the typical business corporation. The net result of this form of administration and decisionmaking is inevitably a negotiated compromise of the various conflicting interests within the faculty. One of the less publicized effects of this developing organizational system is the extreme difficulty in implementing any innovation or change. This entire arrangement is bolstered by arguments about academic freedom, which most often is a claim for power without responsibility. (Author/PG)",

        "description":"More than half of the colleges and universities in the U.S. require entering freshmen to present scores on the American College Test (ACT) as a condition of admission. Within recent years, colleges and universities have been asked to determine procedures whereby prior educational achievement and life experiences could be evaluated and college level credit could be awarded. One response to this need has been the College Level Examination Program (CLEP). As interest in CLEP grew, it became readily apparent that validation of prior achievement and experience needed additional information in order to make realistic choices. Since the ACT examination already had been established as a condition for admission, the ACT appeared to be the most satisfactory instrument to use for predicting  success on CLEP. The method that proved to be most satisfactory was the tally matrix from which probabilities were computed, as described in this report. The probabilities of earning credit based on ACT scores are disclosed in the tables accompanying the text. The method described for obtaining probabilities was computerized, thus permitting a generalized application of the technique. Nevertheless, the procedure can be accomplished manually and can be of significant value in counseling students, in program planning, and in evaluation monitoring of the CLEP program. (Author/PG)",

        "description":"The adult leaders of the Little League baseball organization announced that their &quot;world series&quot; would be limited to American teams. This raises a question about the capacity of Americans to adjust to a world in which power is diffused and centers of decision are plural. First one must consider whether the leaders of public higher education still have jurisdiction over what is taught and learned in college, or whether future decisions about education are going to come from the outside communities that both criticize and support higher education. Who gets in and what they need to succeed when they emerge has passed largely out of the jurisdiction of higher education's leaders. The author suggests that the policy of meeting each new demand by increasing present course structures  has gone far enough. It may be time for a new kind of coure curriculum, including training in integrative brainwork, a capacity for self-analysis, education about social goals, public purposes, and ethics, some practice in real-world negotiation, and some knowledge required to take up citizenship in the world. Americans must be able to cope with the world interdependence. The capacity of Americans to cope with interdependence will depend most on two factors--the nature of their education and the quality of their leadership. (Author/PG)",

        "author":["Barkin, Thomas G."],
        "description":"This paper is a legal analysis of the constitutionality of the Office of Education criteria for defining a self-supporting student. The criteria suggest a student cannot have been claimed as an income tax dependent, nor received more than $600, nor have lived at his parents home more than 14 consecutive days in the year for which aid is received or the year prior to that in which aid is received. The \"self-supporting\" definition is measured against two constitutional requirements. Equal protection is the first. It is concluded that the rules impair no fundamental rights nor contain any suspect criteria. In addition, flaws incidental to the operation of the statute do not seem severe enough to overcome the presumption of constitutionality. The criteria seem to be a reasonable  exercise of legislative authority. Second, the statute is analyzed to find whether due process of law is denied because an \"irrebuttable presumption contrary to facts\" is created. Despite the findings by the Supreme Court that a Food Stamp Act using a definition similar to one of the elements in the Office of Education rules was unconstitutional, it seems that the Office of Education criteria would pass judicial scrutiny. The paper concludes that if the system of allocating financial aid is to be reformed it must be done via the legislative process. One possible reform is an appeals board to provide funds for students who fall just outside the self-support criteria. (Author/MJM)",

The regional goals articulted in 1961 by the SREB Commission on Goals have been studied in an effort to assess the degree to which they have been accomplished during the past 13 years. The rationale for assessing accomplishment has involved a survey questionnaire mailed to representative samples of five regional associations believed to have an active interest in regional development. The intent of the survey was to tap the informed opinions of faculty members in Southern colleges and universities who might have a special interest in regional progress in higher education. Analysis of these responses indicated that very few of the goals stated in 1961  are perceived as fully accomplished in 1974. Although the respondents were emphatic in their judgment of progress, they indicate that the majority of goals still remain viable for the Southern region. Many respondents would see the Southern region renew its efforts to cast out its double standard of the past, its traditional failure to embrace academic standards, and its lack of general academic excellence.

        "description":"Traditional methods of recruitment and selection in academic administration have not placed an emphasis on formal training or preparation but have relied heavily on informal notions of experiential learning. Simulation as a device for representing complex processes in a manageable form, gaming as an organizing technique for training and indoctrination, and modeling as an analytical tool for concepts and principles can serve an unusually valuable purpose by reducing the conflict with traditional notions. Not only can simulation reduce the initial reluctance of administrators to seek formal training, but it has the potential to present concepts, principles, and techniques in an organized, integrative manner that could make their application a more likely prospect. In summary, the  advantages and educational implications of simulation deserve far better attention than they have received from academic administrators. Under the right conditions and with the right preparation of simulation tasks, it is highly probable that administrative concepts, principles, and techniques can be conveyed in a realistic, meaningful fashion.

This anthology is for the most part a compilation of representative articles printed in it from the beginning to May 1973. Taken as a whole, they delineate a theory of the traditional university much in need of articulation during a period of rapid change in our conception of the university. The contents are divided into the following sections: freedom and order; the disease defined (intellectual decay, radicalized academy, bias and discrimination, declining standards), the politicized academy, and a strategy of freedom in order (suggestions for confronting the radicalized campus, teacher evaluation, limits of academic freedom, tenure safeguards). The final  section includes reviews of books by Nisbet, Buchanan and Devletoglou, Hook, Dietz, Glazer, Frankel, Ulam, and Barzun. Throughout the brief span of its existence, the University Professors for Academic Order has sought to uphold by word and example the ideals of the traditional university. This book is a further contribution to that end. (Author/PG)",

Slightly more than one half of all medical students came from families whose total annual income before taxes was less than $15,000 in 1970. Marital status was the most important determinant in the amount of money needed by medical students for their annual expenses. Average annual expenses were $4,295 for single students, while expenses for married students averaged $6,919. Expenses for students in private medical schools were nearly  $1,200 higher than expenses for students in public schools. Nineteen percent of medical students' total income was derived from their own earnings and savings and an equal proportion came from a variety of loan sources. Nearly 22,000 medical students reported loans totaling $41.8 million for their professional education.

Findings are categorized into three areas: baccalaureate completion, graduate study, and employment patterns. Regarding baccalaureate completions, highlights indicate: (1) Among the 705,512 freshmen who enrolled at 4-year college or universities in 1961, over half received a bachelor's degree within four years. (2) Among the 1,309,524 1966 freshmen, just under half received a bachelor's degree within four years of college entry, but about 60 percent earned the bachelor's degree by 1971. (3) Women completed undergraduate study more quickly than men: two-thirds of the 1961 and over half of the 1966 women received a bachelors degree within  four years, compared to less than half of the men in each group. Highlights of graduate study indicated: (1) Over half of the 1961 freshmen had enrolled for advanced study at some time. (2) Among the 1966 freshmen, 29 percent (404,148) had enrolled in graduate or professional school by the time of the followup survey (1971). Employment patterns suggest: In 1967, 67 percent of the 1961 group and 58 percent of the 1966 group were employed full-time. Teaching and business were the most popular current (and long-run) employment choices of both groups. Statistical data and additional findings are indicated. (Author/PG)",

        "description":"Presidents of colleges and universities are, and should be, well aware of pressure on them and their boards of trustees to reexamine and change the structure of these organizations, and the distribution of authority within them. Since the response affects our presidential role and the nature and content of presidential leadership, the author suggests several related matters that seem to merit consideration. The ideal structure arrangement for governance, in the author's view, would be one that accommodates presidential leadership based on board appointment with a process by which that leadership can receive student and faculty acceptance. Presidents must be wise enough to find ways to solicit responsible input in policy decisions at the governance level, retaining their ultimate  authority to decide. They must also develop ways of allowing faculty and students to express their feelings about proposals before final decisions are made. Moreover, these larger, college-wide policy decisions must rest on involvement and decisionmaking at localized levels within the organizations of the various constituents. Once policy has been set, however, the administration of that policy must be left to the managers--if for no other reason that that is what they are paid to do. Thus the crisis of higher education is not only in numbers and dollars. More realistically, it is one of imagination and leadership that must be solicited from all voices in the college community.

Summary of major findings includes: (1) The majority (70 percent) of Oregon high school seniors who graduate in 1972 plan to continue their education at the postsecondary level in the fall of 1972. (2) The future educational plans of Oregon high school seniors are closely related to the educational background of their parents. (3) The post-high school plans of members of certain minority  groups in Oregon are significantly different from the majority of Oregon high school seniors. (4) The vast majority of Oregon high school seniors who plan to continue their education at the postsecondary level intend to enroll in Oregon institutions. (5) Roughly equal numbers of Oregon high school seniors intend to enroll in vocational-technical and academic programs at the postsecondary level. (6) The primary reason motivating Oregon high school seniors to pursue post-high school education is a desire to learn skills that are necessary for a job or career.

Criteria for selection were: (1) evidence of creative programs in the past, (2) the quality of current educational programs and leadership, and (3) the prospect that a Venture Fund would be continued with local support after the conclusion of the program. Many institutions met these criteria, but the foundation was able to assist only 49. The grantees are representative of a broad spectrum of American higher education. They all have demonstrated the capacity to be responsive to try to do new things in new ways. They are located in 34 states; 31 are privately sponsored and 18 are public  institutions; a few are single-sex but most are coeducational. In this report, each of the 49 institutions provides its own answers to the following questions: (1) What are the three most significant innovations in undergraduate education on your campus in the last five years? (2) Why were they undertaken? (3) To what extent has each been successful? (4) How many students are directly involved in, or touched by, each? (Author/PG)",

        "description":"This paper reviews the cost of higher education. Section one discusses the costs of higher education in light of the costs of college attendance, foregone income, incidental expenses, educational costs, cost differential, and total costs. The second section discusses who can afford and who is willing to pay the cost of higher education. Emphasis is placed on the issues of college accessibility and college finance, individual values and philosophical positions regarding the individual and higher education, and political activities both in educational institutions and in the government guaranteeing every high school graduate a tuition grant to cover the cost of higher education. This impact is discussed according to the lower, middle, and upper socio-economic group and the National  Commission on the Financing of Postsecondary Education data and generalizations. Finally, the social factors that led to the American high school with its universal attendance are discussed in relation to their impact on higher educational attendance. These factors include democracy, industrialism, and professional education. (MJM)",

Essential to successful contract administration and harmonious faculty administration relationships is a grievance procedure designed to provide an opportunity to resolve differences informally; a quick and fair hearing, when necessary, limited to contract interpretation; well reasoned decisions based on the facts; and a feeling of satisfaction for all parties arise out of the airing of differences. This report presents the results of an analysis of second and third level grievance reviews under the contract negotiated between the State University of New York and the Senate Professional Association.

One way to meet space needs is for two or more institutions to establish a cooperative effort that makes better use of existing facilities. This effort can range from administrative acts, such as cross-registration, a common calendar, joint purchasing and storage, and library cooperation, to ambitious collaboration in academic, athletic, and other programs. Not uncommon are joint efforts between academic and non-academic groups. The impact such efforts have on space use is outlined in this article, along with examples. (Author)",

The project's specific objectives were to describe some major developments in academic governance and to apply sociological organization theory to decisionmaking in American colleges and universities. The historical roots of academic governance patterns were examined to put contemporary conditions in proper perspective. The research undertaken on contemporary conditions examined a sample of 249 colleges and universities, focusing on their organizational features and environmental relationships, and a large sample of faculty members, focusing on their autonomy, morale, and  policy-influencing activities. On the basis of the information gathering, the project identifies some emerging trends that may affect governance patterns in the future: the tightening of resources, the reductions of faculty and presidential power, the increasing involvement of outside groups and students in academic decisionmaking, and the unionization of faculty members.

Only students who, in Autumn 1968, had earned between 80 and 100 quarter credit hours (approximately junior level) were included in the above study groups. In general, the findings are as follows: (1) Over a common 5-year period of possible upper division attendance, native students have a markedly higher UW graduation rate than have transfer students from either the 2-year or 4-year colleges; (2) When compared on upper division GPA earned between 1968 and 1971, native students significantly outperform 4-year transfer  students, who, in turn, significantly outperform 2-year transfer students; (3) Among those who withdraw from upper-division programs, grades are very low for those dropping out early (most pronounced for transfer students) but quite adequate for those dropping out late, and (4) A supplemental analysis was conducted on native and transfer groups who, as of Autumn 1967, had previously earned between 35 and 55 quarter credit hours (approximate sophomore level). This analysis revealed the same achievement trends as observed for the junior-level groups (and therefore are not included in this report) except that the community college students fared relatively worse than the other comparison groups both in graduation rate and post-transfer grades.

All too often research into the \"real world\" experience of hospital administration is not undertaken nor are alumni fully utilized in the total process of curriculum development. This monograph demonstrates one facet of another approach--the approach of a school using the valuable resources of its' alumni to assist in development of curriculum. Columbia University had a highly motivated alumni group who were encouraged by the school to investigate the role and function of hospital administration with the objective of curriculum change. This paper  was designed to provide quantitative answers to questions concerning what hospital administrators do and what decisions affect them, their responsibilities and their activities. The answers to these questions formed a basis for curriculum development in hospital administration. The survey questionnaire is included in the appendix. (Author/PG)",

The analysis shows that youthful alienation, critical perspectives on society, and rejection of traditional values, contribute to the protest behavior of youth, and that these personal dispositions are, in turn, encouraged by various factors in the social backgrounds, family environments, and educational contexts of young people. These findings are generally consistent with theories that hold that the social backgrounds and family experiences of young people predispose them toward protest involvement. However, the analysis also reveals that the  social class backgrounds of youth and academic standing of the colleges and universities they attend strongly encourage protest activity independently of personal dispositions, such as youthful alienation, social criticism, and traditional values. The sizable independent contributions of family SES and school quality lead to alternative interpretations of the protest movement in terms of the \"dynamics of disorderly politics\" and the \"political incorporation of the student status,\" and to suggestions for further analyses of these data.

The second paper, What's Lutheran About Higher Education?

The third paper, Should We Be More Assertive About Our Christian Values?--A  Constitutional Perspective, suggests that in view of the explicit constitutional policy in favor of religious liberty it would be anomalous to suggest, on the one hand, that it must renounce the religious aspects of its programs.

Often the criteria and measurements used are misleading. In presenting the perspective of a large university, three erroneous means of increasing efficiency are highlighted, including: (1) the use of overly simplistic measures of efficiency; (2) short-run responses to each fluctuation in program enrollment; and (3) insistence on institutional or system-wide uniformity. Special considerations of the large university, in order to deal with efficiency, are the university budget, trying to achieve efficiency through increasing uniformity, the range in program and faculty quality, and the range in student quality. Areas to begin  to improve efficiency and effectiveness include departmental reviews, central university monitoring of course and program proliferation, cost analysis and comparison among institutions, conversion of the institutional budgeting process into an effective management reporting system, resensitizing the system to rewarding improvement, tenure and retirement decisions, position control at the provost's level, annual enrollment forecasting down to departmental levels, training workshops for chairmen and assistant deans, good research and development in instructional improvement, reexamination of academic governance and grievance processes, the education of bureaucrats, the education of faculty groups, and bridging boundaries of disciplines.

Emphasis is increasingly being placed on the exploitation of all higher education resources through regional or state coordination, and on the adjustment of services to the changing educational and vocational needs of society. The Ninth Annual Conference of The Society for College and University Planning, held in Denver July 14-17, 1974 examined the causes and results of these new developments. The report on the conference explores the implications of the new priorities in higher education. Emphasis is placed on the new realities of the 1970's and 1980's including declining enrollments, assumptions of the steady state, political implications, and finances. The emergence of statewide  planning is discussed in relation to the 1202 commissions, statewide data and research, statewide coordination of academic programs, and interstate reciprocity. In reviewing the alternative of consortia, the Auraria Consortium is described, along with models of dividing up the curriculum, private participation and the future of consortia. Finally, implications for the world of higher education are discussed in relation to the students, faculty and staff, government, educational institutions, and institutional planners. (MJM)",

Recommendations include: (1) It is sound fiscal policy for Michigan to find ways to maximize utilization of existing facilities, public or independent, to provide higher educational opportunities at lowest cost to the taxpaying public. (2) Michigan's independent colleges and universities have made and continue to make a very significant contribution to the state's economy and general welfare. (3) The avoidance of duplication in higher education programming is particularly stressed. (4) The state legislature is urged to expand immediately on programs already begun to  guarantee equal educational opportunity and economy of choice for every Michigan citizen. (5) Legislative programs should result in narrowing the tuition gap existing between public and independent institutions.

As demands for courses in black literature can be met by an increased supply of scholars in Afro-American literature, fewer schools see a need for anyone to teach African literature. This is made easier by the convenience of the racial label \"black literature\" which is used ambiguously to cover all the literature of black peoples, including African, Afro-American, and Caribbean, thus hiding cultural distinctions behind political desires. Since the parameters of a traditional department are threatened by courses such as African literature, such courses will be  tolerated only as long as political necessities force departments to offer them--or until these departments come to realize a humanistic necessity. Scholars have themselves all too long ignored these problems. The formation of an association of those interested in the field will serve not only as a symbol of commitment to the discipline, but also as an effective means of pooling and channeling energies toward defining long-term aims and defending the necessity of research and teaching in African literature.

It is obvious that the structure of governance comes first, and the leadership role follows from it. Governance is both a structure and a process. It is a structure that legitimates power groups and power relationships. It is a process for making basic decisions about purpose and form of governance, either implicit or explicit. Leadership is also a structure that establishes roles or influences the behavior of other persons in a social unit. It is a process of encouraging, persuading, and even of directing others to make decisions and to perform in accordance with decisions. The only two models for governance and leadership in higher education today are  the institutional governance model and the community governance model. Interest in the community governance model is waning at the moment. Yet the institutional governance model will be different in the future from what it has been in the past. It will gradually be replaced by one in which institutional leadership perforce will exert ever more influence on academic affairs. Necessarily, this new kind of institutional leadership will require much more extensive information sharing, more lengthy consultation, and more careful sharing of authority than in the past.

From this information two basic development objectives were distilled: a full range of library services for the residents, and the location and design of library facilities for efficient as well as effective service. Taking into account changes in future population, land use, and new residential development, the commission considered alternative plans for library  development. The commission has recommended a plan, to be implemented over an 18-year period, which includes some new facilities, additional mobile library units, increased materials, additional staff, a single seven-county federated library system with local autonomy but free exchange of information and materials, and a regional governing board.

        "description":"To perform a complete and useful evaluation of the impact of federal funding, under Titles I, II, and IV of the Library Services and Construction Act (LSCA), on public library services to the disadvantaged, handicapped, and institutionalized, two convergent lines of study were undertaken: the study of project plans and achievements and the study of the needs of users and potential users. A comparison was made to determine the degree to which the projects satisfied the needs of the users. The study team examined the plans and actions of each state, queried all project directors, and conducted interviews with project personnel and with users and nonusers of the offered services. A determination of success and failure factors within projects contributed to the definition of a model  program for service to special clienteles. It was concluded from the data gathered that the LSCA projects studied had been successful to some extent. More projects succeeded than not, and significant numbers of special clientele groups were reached. LSCA funds also proved to have been a critical factor in these projects and to have been a prime factor in innovation in public library services in the United States. The bulk of this report consists of data presented in tabular form. (SL)",

The survey was directed at manufacturing, service, professional, trade, and retail firms in the central Ohio area. A one-page questionnaire was devised to elicit information on the respondent's firm, sources of information, and opinions about the public library. The Chamber of Commerce membership directory formed the mailing list. The results of the survey suggested that two kinds of efforts were necessary to improve the services of the Business and Technology Division. The first was improved publicity, since only a small percentage of the respondents indicated an awareness of familiarity with  the public services to business. The second was better services and facilities within the business library itself, in response to the expressed needs and opinions of the respondents. Survey results are presented in narrative and tabular form. (Author/SL)",

Awareness of the deaf world among the hearing and being involved with it are possibly just as important as those services established specifically for the deaf. The planning of library programs for the deaf, which should be done in conjunction with deaf members of the community, should commence with the establishment of priorities, perhaps including staff training for manual communication or the assumption of an advocacy role for the development of services. Resources for expanded library services can be explored in the areas of personnel, materials and equipment, and  budget. There are a variety of programs and services which can be implemented to expand the public library's informational, instructional, and facilitative functions in direct aid to the deaf or for increased awareness among the hearing population. A list of agencies for the deaf provides additional sources for information. (Author/SL)",

The state library and three large public libraries were connected by teletypewriters, and the state library had a computer terminal to interface with Ohio State University and the Ohio College Library Center. One of the three public libraries, Cleveland, was a communication link with seven other public and two academic libraries, four  of which had a union catalog of adult nonfiction. Results of the pilot project were encouraging. Ninety percent of library requests were filled within eight working days, and 11,518 transactions took place in the year July 1972 through June 1973. Some possibilities for future improvements included better report forms, wider instruction of librarians in the knowledge and use of the TWXIL system, increased communication between the cooperating organizations, cost sharing, inclusion of subject requests, and system expansion.

Finally the two librarians had a brief informal conversation and invited audience comment. The show had been previously announced in newspapers, on local radio, and in fliers.

The success of the educational programs depends in large part on the way learners use resources to find, evaluate, and apply information. The media specialist works with teachers and students to plan and carry out a program which makes the best use of all types of media. Individualization of instruction is impossible without an active media program. The elementary schools of Groton, Connecticut are moving rapidly toward this learner-oriented type of program, with the media program taking an important role. Lack of trained media specialists has been a limiting factor, but, since the Groton schools never had separate audiovisual  and library programs, many of the coordination problems faced by other schools have been bypassed. The media program has moved beyond the media centers into the entire school and is attempting to play a strong role in curriculum development and the individualization of instruction. This report utilizes many quotes from a study, published by the U.S. Office of Education, which reviews the school library media field. (Author/SL)",

The media specialist, whose educational background includes a study of children's and adolescent literature, is able to provide reading guidance to the individual student and to promote the study of literature through story hours, book discussions, and the preparation of reading lists. Supplementary print and non-print materials are distributed to improve classroom instruction.

The purpose of this research was the development and evaluation of three major telegraphic production schemes. Telegraphic prose refers to an abbreviated writing style similar to that found in telegrams. These reduction schemes were based upon the analysis of word frequencies, grammatical categories, and kernel sentences. Eight experiments were conducted in which different types of educational materials were shortened to form various levels of word deletions of the traditionally written materials. Comprehension, reading rate, reading time, and presentation efficiency measures were obtained from samples of college students. The  results showed that some degree of prose reduction was possible without significantly affecting reading performance. Extreme reduction levels in certain grammatical and word frequency categories did adversely affect performance. Results showed that the three telegraphic production schemes do provide a basis for the development of telegraphic materials. Results were interpreted as supporting the assumption that written language contains many words and word sequences which are unnecessary for the comprehension of newspaper style, fiction, and scientific materials.

Due to personnel, funding, and space limitations, the conscientious librarian must serve his research staff by coordinating the resources of his own and other libraries, as well as being familiar with data bases and other specialized information resources that complement his collection. Each library is funded through the research center budget and is locally administered. In the end, however, it is the philosophy and goals that the librarian  sets for himself and his library that are responsible for the success and relevance of the library services. (Author)",

Another use is making computers a vehicle for learning, and this is usually referred to as computer-assisted instruction. The last use of computers has suffered from stagnation and disappointment despite the early high expectations. The field of CAI is in dire need of revitalization and several new directions for human uses of computers in teaching are gaming and  simulation, artificial intelligence in CAI and \"ad-lib\" CAI.

However, this need not be so, for one seed of creativity, student control, is inherent in programed instruction. To test the possibility of teaching creative behavior via programed instruction a program on problem solving was developed and experimentally evaluated. The experiment involved six schools and 62 subjects in each of three groups: control, program alone, and program instructor-presented. A battery of psychological tests involving various aspects of creativity was used as a pre- and posttest. The results of the experiment  indicated that the program instructor-presented group scored significantly higher gains than the program alone group, which in turn was significantly higher than the control group.

The Dallas Public Library, in cooperation with Southern Methodist University, set up a library independent study project (ISP). College credit could be obtained through the College Level Examination Program (CLEP); however, learning for self-enrichment was also encouraged. The criteria for measuring the effectiveness of the ISP were librarian and student satisfaction. In a study of the Dallas ISP, librarians found that they spent most of their time explaining the CLEP and ISP concepts to students, and little of their time in readers' guidance. They also felt that they lacked time for more individual guidance, though they were able to provide some. The number of students  completing CLEP tests (125) was disappointing in relation to the number of study guides taken (6,000). However, many students were pleased to find a place to continue learning. The library plans to continue its involvement and experiments with independent learning projects. (LS)",

        "description":"Previous studies show that a listener has the potential to receive recorded information at a rate far exceeding the rates that are used for conversation and for the production of tape recordings. However, few studies have examined listeners' rate preferences. Thus, 48 elementary school children in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade listened to a series of four recorded presentations. While listening to each recorded presentation, the subjects were allowed to manipulate the rate of presentation of the recording through the use of a speech compressor. All subjects listened to the same four recorded passages. The results support the following conclusions: (1) children will manipulate the rate of presentation of recorded information in a self-paced listening situation; (2) children  demonstrate a preference for a certain rate; and (3) the extent a listener alters the listening rate is positively related to the difference between the initial rate of presentation of recorded information and the listener's manifest preference for rate. As such, instructional materials that are designed for use in a self-paced listening environment will be more likely to be altered by the subject toward a preferred rate when the initial rate of presentation is more different from the listener's preferred rate.

In a computer-related course, 13 students used batch processing mode to solve problems on the computer, while 12 other students used conversational mode to solve the same problems. It was found that those students accessing the computer in conversational mode developed more positive attitudes toward programing (as measured by the author's attitude test) than the students using batch processing. Also the grades obtained in the time-sharing environment did not seem to affect the students' final attitudes towards programing. The majority of two-year college computer centers operate under batch processing mode. This could be a factor in the high student attrition rate in  introductory programing classes. To lower this rate, and to make the computer more accessible to the campus classroom, it is suggested that minisystems with numerous learner consoles be used. (Author)",

The implementation of this system involved: (1) the design and implementation of a systematic procedure for determining those characteristics of a school program which affect or are affected by the physical contraints of a school building, (2) incorporation of those characteristics into a model which could be applied by a simulation system to a proposed floorplan, and (3) the development of computer programs which could successfully simulate educational activities on the proposed floorplan and provide feedback to the architect as to the  sufficiency of his design.

Initial data was called from an earlier user survey. When additional administrative and service data proved necessary, an in-house and an external survey of reference operations was conducted. For the in-house survey, the reference staff formulated a master list of all tasks performed. Individual interviews provided estimates of time spent on tasks on an annual basis. For the external survey, a questionnaire and a copy of the reference task list was completed by the head of public services  at each of eight college libraries in Colorado. Survey results indicated that the USAFA Library was very rich in public service resources; its higher costs were largely due to its function as a special, as opposed to a strictly academic library. The survey results have been incorporated into preliminary one-year and five year plans to streamline the public service department of the USAFA Library. (Author/SL)",

The principle objective of OTIS is to provide the information necessary to formulate educational, manpower, and economic development plans and policies. OTIS consists primarily of a manpower demand subsystem, a manpower supply subsystem, and an interface subsystem. These areas were evaluated for their effectiveness in the two states. A resurvey was made to determine the accuracy of OTIS in predicting manpower demand. In Kentucky the forecasts for manpower demand and supply are inaccurate and the cost of the personal interview census is excessive; however, it is recommended that system development be continued if these problems are  corrected. The favorable factors in Kentucky are the widespread support OTIS has and the type of information it provides. (WH)",

The results of this research so far has been quite disappointing, in that researchers have failed to point out the difference between research on media and research with media. Research also has tended to become highly specific, thus losing representativeness. A conflict between better control over specific variables and representativeness could be solved by some new research methods. In field studies a pseudo-experimental design or a staged innovative design allow research to be conducted in naturalistic surroundings. In strictly experimental studies the rotation design and the ecological design can be used. The major theme of these techniques is to move media research out of its traditional either  internal-or-external validity conflict toward better and more fruitful research. (JY)",

A 50-minute composite tape of program segments was shown, after which observation sheets, questionnaires and interviews were used to learn children's character preferences, ability to grasp the educational concepts, attention span and scheduling preferences. Ninety-eight percent of 7-9 year-olds and 84% of 10-12 year-olds said they enjoyed the program and 75% would watch it if offered for home viewing. Adults were evenly divided when asked if they would recommend &quot;Monkey Bars&quot; to children. Two-thirds of the 7-9 year-olds  preferred a Saturday morning viewing time, while 10-12 year-olds preferred afternoon. Results showed that younger children overall enjoyed the program, but were not able to grasp all its humor, as older children could.

At the same time the (unclassified) report has been accused of not meeting the same standards of authority, scientific rigor, and retrievability as conventional journal publication. Report publication was reviewed in the light of standards commonly accepted for journal publication, and the inherent characteristcs of technical reports were assessed. It was concluded that both reports and scientific journals have distinct roles to play in the communication of scientific and technical information, and that a cost-effective system will make full use of the strengths  of both.

Enormous needs to expand educational services to adults in the United States were identified. An historical review of educational and library services indicated that a large part of the reason for the gap between educational preparation and life needs in this technological age is that educational institutions view their mission as the transfer and preservation of cultures rather than as the change agent for those cultures. The study demonstrated that obstacles preventing the initiation and coordination of services to disadvantaged adults could be overcome in the presence of a  middleman or catalyst such as the AAEC.

Programs of instruction originate at Stanford University and are broadcast to the students where they work. Students receive instruction by television, but otherwise participate in their courses in the same manner as on-campus students. This is accomplished through a two-way audio  system which links the students with each other and with the instructor so that they may interact while the course is in progress. Some programs are also videotaped for viewing at field locations.

Intertype networks cross jurisdictional, and often governmental, boundaries to join academic, special, and public libraries. The history, objectives, methods, and fiscal and administrative structures of intertype networks, their potential for interface with regional and national networks, and their cost effectiveness were assessed. Three large states with the most intertype networking experience--New York, California, and Illinois--were chosen for analysis. Networking activities in Maryland and Washington states were also considered along with the Southwestern Library Interstate Cooperative Enterprise (SLICE), a  normative multistate network. It was concluded that the intertype network is a rapidly spreading phenomenon and that the public library system commonly serves as its nucleus. It was recommended that national coordination, with shared state and federal responsibility, should begin. (Author/SL)",

The provision of supportive information increases the effectiveness of all types of advocacy. The limited success achieved by recent library outreach programs in the inner city is partially due to the absence of a commitment to advocacy by the library profession and a lack of systems capable of supporting advocacy efforts. The improvement of information delivery services must begin with an understanding of the library as a subsystem within a larger overall services delivery system. Libraries must utilize systematic approaches to the identification of information needs and develop formal linkages with major information sources. To improve professional attitudes toward service  and advocacy library education must be restructured, encouraging the librarian to practice as an information specialist and advocate. (Author/SL)",

At the national level, federally funded programs, foundation aid for children's television, and the supportive declarations of national professional organizations point to efforts for bringing services to young children in less advantaged neighborhoods. The local public library has long been active in services to young children. Now, because of changes in communication media and social needs, libraries find their services must expand. Three contrasting approaches can be distinguished: story hours, nursery school programs, and total family serivce in the form of an alternative neighborhood learning center. Other activities include concurrent parent  programs, toy loan services, and fine arts programs. Although it is recognized that libraries, especially in rural and inner city areas, must reach out with more children's services, in most instances the planning of preschool programs is sporadic. An articulated philosophy of children's serivces is needed. To this end, research should be conducted on the effects of family and social environment, on preschool learning, and on the effectiveness of specific programs and materials. (Author/SL)",

Attempts have been made to ally these institutions in a single coordinated approach to community-based education, the ideal being a &quot;communiversity&quot;--a federation of all the educational and cultural forces of a community to serve all age levels. The public library has a long tradition of informal adult education, based on three differenct conceptions of its service role: (1) the full spectrum view, which holds that the library should provide a full range of educational services; (2) the elitist view, which would concentrate service on the educated population; (3) and the activist view, which feels that the public library should take the  initiative for the improvement of the community or its residents. From these three conceptions many modes of educational service have been devised. The key problem of the public library as an educational institution is that many librarians, and most citizens, do not realize that it is a center of learning. Librarians, through improvement of their own programs and more active collaboration with other institutions, can alter this picture. (SL)",

It was concluded that the states in most instances have not performed adequately in their efforts to sustain and build a pattern of public library services.

In the spring of 1967 an upperclass course in library materials was taught using this method at a small university. The course plan included brief lectures, assignment of a research project, talks by library staff members, conferences with librarians, presentation of class reports, and open-book tests. Small difficulties and inconveniences, mostly arising from the lack of time and other resources, threatened the successful implementation of the library college concept, but the concept was found to be promising with respect to increasing  student involvement and enthusiasm. It was concluded that librarians will begin to play their role in implementing the library college concept when they become aware of the efforts on the part of the faculty in this regard, and that implementation of the concept will reveal so much basic worth that its eventual theoretical development will pose no problem.

Books, slide/tapes, audio tapes, posters, and 3M sound pages were the media utilized for the packets. Since the layout of the library itself was a problem to students, floor plans were drawn up and posted at the entries and several levels of the library. As a part of the packet development effort, students were polled. Six hundred  ninety-four students responded as to how they used the library and how often, as well as to their awareness of library services and reference publications and their interest in instruction on library use.

        "description":"The selection of nonprint software media for library media center agencies, as reported by the literature of library service, instructional technology, and education was investigated. Eleven textbooks and eight research studies were selected for review. The books were analyzed for their contributions to a theory of media selection, while the research was reviewed for indications of actual practice. Overall, the literature was fragmentary and not subject to generalization. The texts laid down principles without a theoretical framework for media selection. The studies had an educational emphasis, ignoring comprehensive media collections. Scant empirical data precluded comparison of theory and practice. Available evidence suggests that in an educational context, the teacher assumes  the greatest role in selection, with the personal preview method the recommended means of selection. Evidence supported the texts in portraying conditions of selection as highly varied. To provide a survey of current practice in nonprint selection, further research is recommended. (KC)",

Specific instances are cited, with emphasis on projects in the less developed areas, which might serve as tentative guidelines for future development. The first section discusses the need for a nonformal approach to education and how this might be combined with other formal and informal learning opportunities. The second section deals with the  types of media and technology currently in use including TV, radio, traditional folk media, games and simulation techniques, audio cassettes, programed instruction, and multimedia approach.

These activities showed that there was an increase in the number of students who are older and are attending part-time in the evenings; most students favored some form of student government, but demands of college studies and employment precluded their own involvement; most of the student respondents to the survey indicated that they were unaware of the present student government and its activities, but showed interest and had definite opinions about the structure and function of  student government; members of the Student Council valued the experience, but agreed that other forms of student government might facilitate increased involvement and effectiveness; club representatives saw a vital role for student government, but wanted fiscal and functional independence from student government; and both administrators and members of the Board of Trustees were vitally interested in the topic of student government and eager to cooperate with a representative and responsible student government. The study findings led to the conclusion that the form of student government at El Camino College should provide for maximum student input at all levels, agree with the philosophy of the college, and parallel as far as possible the organizational structure of the college.

The average faculty load in the district, 507, is 2 percent lower than the state average of 517. The district and college loads for each major discipline are compared with the statewide average loads, and those disciplines which differ significantly from the statewide pattern in terms of their standard percent deviations are isolated  for discussion. The disciplines found to have district loads significantly lower than the statewide averages include liberty science, social science, and interdisciplinary studies; those with higher than expected loads include communications, engineering, commerce, and apprenticeship. The important factors contributing to variations in faculty loads include special characteristics of particular disciplines, program size, and fluctuations in program popularity from year to year.

Subjects were 132 graduates and 34 currently enrolled students, of whom 127 had taken the A.C.T. preadmission test and 108 had written the state-board examination. The first five classes of the program were studied. The college implemented the program in 1969. This corelational study had an ex post facto design with interval measures indicating a parametric correlation technique be employed. The Pearson product-moment correlation machine calculated formula was used. The findings  indicated a correlation of 0.438 between the A.C.T. and GPA and 0.542 between the A.C.T. and state-board examination score. As a result of this study, the screening committee for the practical nursing program will have a more valid determination of minimum cut-off composite score on the A.C.T. preadmission test in the selection of potentially successful students and graduates. Major recommendations include a study by the committee of the A.C.T. Student Profile Section for information on other factors which may affect a student's success or failure in the program; development of rating scales for other variables predictive of the strengths and weaknesses of the prospective student; and the screening committee must continually evaluate and improve the procedure for the selection of  successful practical nursing students in the future classes.

Utilizing student admissions applications, a student characteristics survey was made of the personal and socioeconomic characteristics of 2,905 students admitted to Central Florida Community College 1971-73. Sixteen major fields of study were identified and cross-tabulated against 15 characteristics: sex, marital status, number of dependents, race, full-time or part-time status, father's occupation, father's education, mother's occupation, mother's education, student's daily round-trip commuting mileage, source of financial support, family income, total score on the Florida Twelfth Grade Placement Test (FTGPT), rank in high school  graduating class, and age. In addition, each characteristic was cross-tabulated against two broad classifications of students--those intending to obtain an Associate of Arts (AA) degree and those intending to obtain an Associate of Science (AS) degree. Results of the survey showed no significant differences in sex or racial distribution in the two degree areas. The AA students were, however, more likely to be single than the AS students and were more likely to be full-time students. The educational backgrounds of the AA students' parents tended to be stronger than those of the AS students' parents. The AA students' scores on the FTGPT were somewhat higher than those in the AS group. As a group, the AS students ranked lower in their high school graduating class and relied much less on  their parents for financial support. The college's black students tended to enroll heavily in some programs but infrequently in others. (Twenty tables provide the survey data.) (DB)",

The model's primary purpose is to classify, organize, and assign priority to community needs, so that the educational system can assign these needs to the proper administrative unit for changes to be planned and implemented. The NAP is first developing a process or tool to ascertain the educational needs of the people in each community, using one college area to develop and test the model. The data collection for the simulation of the model has begun and will continue as the model is refined with the most relevant factors. The model (or prototype) work will be in two areas: the community as a service area, and the college as a  training institution for the total community. Some of the factors that should be studied in analyzing educational needs include future school population projections in each program area, planned traffic patterns and transportation networks, land use changes and land costs, basic demographic characteristics, planned industrial suburb movement, shifting community interests, new skills needed, and changing economic emphasis. Because the initial model will be related directly to assessment of job needs in terms of education, a quantified method will be developed to analyze the economic job market. The following year, the job need portion of the model will be expanded to include college transfer programs, adult basic education, community interests, programs in social cultural areas, and  general education.

This paper presents the approach to be taken in developing the Needs Assessment Model: a description of the study with a review of related literature, the procedure to be followed in the analysis and computerization of the simulation model, and the significance of the Needs Assessment Model to the educational system and society. The six phases in the development of the model are: Data Base Development, Initial Prototype Development, Model Testing, Model Evaluation and Verification, Model Revision, and Complete Documentation. The educational system selected for analysis and  implementation of the system is Florida Junior College, with the Jacksonville area providing the community base in which the model will operate. Within the community, the Needs Assessment Model will result in greater job and class mobility, higher individual self-concept, better knowledge for the individual with which to compete in society, more help to problem youth, and economic impact predictions for local environmental planning. The model's main contribution to the community is in its forcefulness on ending isolation through more experience and exposure so that more realistic goals for career choices can be made. Through effective evaluation and followup procedures, the community college can place primary emphasis on the students it serves. (DB)",

To express the relation between the two variables, hours of extracurricular involvement (activities not directly related to the academic program) were plotted against grade point average.

        "description":"Characteristics of Associate Degree Nursing (ADN) programs in New York State which relate to the achievement of their graduates on the State Board Test Pool Examination (SBTPE) were identified. A questionnaire was designed and mailed to all two-year colleges in the states offering the ADN. A total of 32 questionnaires were returned (91 percent). The criterion variable for the analysis was the percent of first time candidates from the school who passed th licensing examination between 1970-73, with the four years averaged. Program visits were carried out in eight schools, and student data were collected in these same schools. The questionnaire data, which were numerical, were coded and analyzed using t-tests of differences between means of the top and bottom group categories. The  more subjective interview data were described as to the program characteristics found to a greater degree in the high-achiever programs. In general, the study results showed that programs doing well on the licensing exam were also making noteworthy attempts at providing quality nursing education. Strong support was given to the conclusion that the passing rate on the SBTPE could be improved through student selectivity and providing a strenuous, selective program. Findings also indicated that nursing programs providing quality education were capable of maintaining high passing rates while admitting less academically qualified students.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between student verbal ability and performance in an introductory United States history class at a comprehensive community college. For the purposes of this study, performance was defined as grade point average and rate of persistence. Because of degree requirements, students at Cuyahoga Community College must successfully complete three courses in either history, political science, or social science, all of which are verbally demanding. Despite the fact that the student body is heterogeneous, as is often the case, with regard to socioeconomic background, reading and writing skills, and goals, instruction is quite traditional, emphasizing lecture and discussion. Thus, all students receive basically the same  instruction. Two sample populations were selected for the study. Those U.S. history students who were concurrently enrolled in English 101 classes were defined as verbally able. Those who were concurrently enrolled in English 091, a remedial class, were defined as verbally deficient. With a sample of 121 English 101 students and 41 English 091 students, mean grade point averages and withdrawal rates were calculated. Through the use of a t-test, a significant relationship was established between student grade point average and verbal ability. A chi-square test established that there was no significant relationship between verbal ability and withdrawal rates from U.S. history classes. To enable students with poor verbal skills to succeed in U.S. history classes, faculty in the history  department should write a program of individualized instruction and self-instructional learning packages at a less demanding reading level.

        "author":["Grippando, Gloria M."],
        "description":"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the class scheduling of a pharmacology course for L.P.N. students at the College of Lake County, in Grayslake, Illinois, and the final course grade. It was hypothesized that subjects will learn pharmacology concepts more effectively when the course content is concentrated within a shorter time span. Subjects were 30 students enrolled in spring 1973 who were assigned to a one hour/week class for 16 weeks and 24 in spring 1974 scheduled three hours/week for 6 weeks. The mean age of the 1973 group was 23, range 18-45, with an A.C.T. composite score mean of 15. The mean age of the 1974 group was 25, range 18-43, with an A.C.T. composite score mean of 16.7. The final grade for both groups was based on a final written  examination and unit quizzes. These and the text were the same for both groups. A parametric test, the t-test, was used plus an opinionnaire consisting of eight items and using a scale scoring response. Of the 1973 subjects, 57 percent received a grade of F for the course, while 16 percent failed in 1974. The t-test indicated a mean difference of 10.258 estimated standard deviation for population of 10.579, standard error of difference of 2.897, T-Ratio of 3.541, 52 degrees of freedom and -6.924 difference of critical mean. The probability level was set at the 0.1 level for a one-tailed test. The obtained T-Value exceeded the Critical Values of a t-table value. Based on the t-test and subjects scale scoring responses, the recommendations are: (1) change the text; (2) consider educational  background of subjects when selecting text; (3) consider reading level of text; (4) revise lectures to correlate with new text; (5) schedule future classes for three hours/week for 6 weeks block; and (6) continue to evaluate student achievement.

The data from the ARRT report are presented in five tables, as follows: (1) an overall summary; (2) California community colleges; (3) California institutions other than community colleges; (4) performance by state, all institutions; and (5) performance by state, community colleges only. The study data showed that: (1) the 29 LACC candidates were the 11th largest group of all 1,030 institutions in the U.S., 7th largest of the 99 U.S. community colleges, and 2nd largest of the 20 California community colleges; (2) 18 percent of the candidates are from community  colleges, and in California, over half of the candidates are from community colleges; (3) community colleges averaged 14 candidates per institution (18 in California); other institutions averaged 7 candidates; (4) when compared with other California community colleges, LACC performance was slightly better in failure rate (7 percent compared with 9 percent) and slightly poorer in average scaled score (83.0 compared with 84.0); (5) California community college candidates performed better than their counterparts nationwide in both failure rate and average scaled score; and (6) when compared with other California institutions, California community colleges' performance was about equivalent; failure rate was slightly poorer; and average scaled score was slightly better.

An evaluative model was constructed by accepting the performance standards and program guidelines that Roueche and Kirk listed in &quot;Catching Up; Remedial Education&quot; (1973), after their study of five successful programs. The components of the Eastern Campus program were described and found in a number of significant areas to differ from the model. Data on the academic performance of a sample of developmental students for the 1973-74 academic year were collected and presented. Interviews of faculty, counselors, and paraprofessionals were also conducted. On the basis of the data collected, recommendations were made to bring the Eastern Campus  developmental program into line with the guidelines of Roueche and Kirk. (Author)",

Variables that are indicators of quality education are: cost, or the yearly tuition rate; its distance from the consumer; the quotient of intelligence among those who are rejected as applicants; student/faculty ratio; and faculty degrees. Public service or community service functions of the community college provide excellent linkage systems between community leaders and the knowledge resource systems that exist in the university and in industry, as well as in the State and Federal governments. Locally based colleges could become a rich source of community agents. This would call for the establishment of a problem-focused center or institutions at the college with a specific administrator from the  cooperating community organization designated to provide continuing liaison and leadership. Public service is not only compatible with quality education but also could become a major prerequisite for quality in many of our institutions. (DB)",

The input-output model identifies appropriate data elements according to their status as influents on institutional performance in the area of affirmative action. The primary components are political variables (regulations of federal, state, and local agencies), demographic variables (features of the college and community), social psychological variables (features of the individuals in the college and community), and institutional variables (policies and procedures of the college). Each variable can be categorized into one of three classes--input factors, intervening factors, or output factors. Input factors represent the full range of political, demographic,  social psychological, and institutional variables that shape college policy in the area of affirmative action. An \"expected output\" can be determined through analysis of the impact of these variables on institutional policy and procedures (intervening factors) that are used to regulate college performance in minority hiring. This output can be measured through a number of factors (output factors) that define the relationship between the college and the community in terms of prevailing demographic trends. (DB)",

In addition, the external portion of the data base was expanded by adding 1970 census items that describe summaries of employment by four gross employment categories. Five tasks were carried out: creation of a student extract file from the complete Active Student File; aggregation of student data items to individual census  tracts; creating an individual college service area definition algorithm; creating a census subfile for employment data; and computer mapping of critical data items. In addition to map production, the processed data were used to generate three tabular reports: Student Enrollment Data, Occupation of Employed Population, and District Student Data. (DB)",
