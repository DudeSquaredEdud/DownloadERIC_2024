The primary work function of 83 0/0 was direct patient care, and over half of the respondents worked 40 to 49 hours per week. It was learned that podiatrists, as a group, are older than members of professions requiring similar training and are usually male.

        "description":"Reported are causes of hearing loss for 41,109 hearing impaired students enrolled in 555 special educational programs as part of a national annual survey during the 1970-71 school year. Data is provided on the relationship between hearing loss etiology and the following variables: age and sex of students, additional handicapping conditions, family history of hearing loss, age of discovery, hearing threshold levels, and type of educational program. The data indicated that the cause of hearing loss was due to prenatal factors for almost two thirds of the students, that maternal rubella was the greatest single cause of hearing loss (14 0/0 of all cases and 21 0/0 of cases caused by prenatal factors), that meningitis was the greatest single cause of hearing loss occurring after birth  (5 0/0 of all cases and 13 0/0 of cases caused by postnatal factors), and that hereditary factors were the cause of hearing loss for only about 8 0/0 of the students, though an additional 12 0/0 of the students had one or more hearing impaired relatives in their immediate family.

        "author":["Schustereit, Roger Clinton"],
        "description":"A study of the three aspects of composition in freshmen English programs with regard to five groups of students in Texas two-year institutions of higher learning was conducted. The three aspects of composition were the aims, forms and media; and the five students groups were transfer, terminal technical/commercial, adult and remedial. Aims were defined as explanation/thesis, persuasion, creativity and self-expression. Description, narration, exposition, and argumentation were the forms. Media included writing, speech, art/photography and dramatization/film. A 70-item questionnaire was constructed and sent to 60 two-year Texas schools. Thirty-eight schools participated. Raw responses were converted into percentages, and mean and standard deviation were computed for the analysis of  the three parts of composition in regard to the five student groups. Results included the following: (1) for 63 0/0 of those responding, over half of their program was concerned with transfer students; (2) 99.4 0/0 reported composition assignments with the aim of explanation/thesis, 92.8 persuasion, 75.6 creativity, and 85.2 self-expression; (3) 91.6 0/0 indicated assignments utilizing description, 79.2 narration, 98 exposition, and 92.8 argumentation; (4) all respondents reported written composition assignments; 84 0/0 used speech, 28.2 used art/photography, and 33 dramatization/film. It was concluded that most of the data was valid, with certain exceptions. (Author/KM)",

        "author":["Adema, Jos J."],
        "description":"Linear programming models with 0-1 variables are useful for the construction of tests from an item bank. Most solution strategies for these models start with solving the relaxed 0-1 linear programming model, allowing the 0-1 variables to take on values between 0 and 1. Then, a 0-1 solution is found by just rounding, optimal rounding, or a heuristic. In most applications, the latter can be executed very rapidly. This paper uses the revised simplex method to solve the relaxed 0-1 linear programming method for test construction. The simplex method is modified such that the characteristics of test construction problems are taken into account. The modifications were implemented in the computer program LINPROG. Two item banks, each containing 450 items, were generated to determine if  central processing unit (CPU) time was gained. Computational experiments showed a gain of CPU time for most modifications. Ten tables present the results for the modifications. (Author/SLD)",

        "author":["Cankoy, Osman"],
        "description":"The aim of this study is to explore high-school school mathematics teachers' topic-specific pedagogical content knowledge. First, 639 high-school students were asked to give explanations about &quot;a[superscript 0] = 1, 0! = 1&quot; and &quot;a [division] 0&quot; where a [not equal to] 0. Weak explanations by the students led to a detailed research on teachers. Fifty-eight high school mathematics teachers in Northern Cyprus were the participants. They were asked to write how they teach the above topics to high school students. The researcher determined some categories and themes from the written explanations of the teachers using inductive content analysis. Then, three pre-service mathematics teachers had a four-hour training on deductive content analysis. The pre-service teachers went over the written explanations independently and used the pre-determined categories and themes to code the explanations in a deductive way. The results indicate ([chi][superscript 2]) that experienced teachers propose more conceptually based instructional strategies than novice teachers. The results also indicate that strategies proposed by all the participants were mainly procedural, fostering memorization. Hence, giving teachers the opportunity to view and teach mathematics in a more constructivist way and more emphasis on topic-specific pedagogical content knowledge in teacher training programs are recommended.

        "description":"Findings obtained by providing rats with a single fixed series of events, A-B-C-..., often are equally compatible with three alternative serial learning interpretations: that the signal for items is (A) their position in the series (position view), (B) the prior item of the series (chaining view), and (C) one, two, or more prior items of the series (sequential view). By employing a novel procedure of supplying rats with two different series, rather than a single series, it was possible to choose between the three alternatives. Employing 10 and 0, 0.045g, Noyes pellets as items, rats in both runway experiments reported here received a three trial series, either a 10-0-10 series or a 0-0-10 series. In Experiment 1, the other series was a single 0 pellet trial (along with 10-0-10) or a single 10 pellet trial (along with 0-0-10). In Experiment 2, the other series was either 0-0 (along with 10-0-10) or 10-0 (along with 0-0-10). Considering both experiments, findings were consistent with the sequential view but not with either the position view or the chaining view. The possibility was suggested that, under some other experimental conditions, particularly those not employing reward events as items, greater control over discriminative responding might be exercised by position cues than by item cues.",

        "author":["Raff, Lionel M."],
        "description":"The fundamental criteria for chemical reactions to be spontaneous in a given direction are generally incorrectly stated as ?G &lt; 0 or ?A &lt; 0 in most introductory chemistry textbooks and even in some more advanced texts. Similarly, the criteria for equilibrium are also misstated as being ?G = 0 or ?A = 0. Following a brief review of the thermodynamic equations related to reaction spontaneity and equilibrium in systems involving a single reaction, this paper addresses the nature of these errors by first discussing the conceptual problems thereby introduced. This qualitative discussion is followed by a quantitative treatment of the 2NO[subscript 2](g) ? N[subscript 2]O[subscript 4](g) reaction conducted both under constant temperature and volume and under constant temperature and pressure conditions. The results provide clear examples of the conceptual problems introduced by using ?G &lt; 0 or ?A &lt; 0 as criteria for reaction spontaneity and ?G = 0 or ?A = 0 as the corresponding criteria for equilibrium. It is shown that ?G &lt; 0 or ?A &lt; 0 are necessary conditions for a transformation from state A to state B to be spontaneous, but they are not sufficient conditions. If ? denotes the reaction coordinate, the correct criteria for a spontaneous forward reaction are (?G/??)[subscript T,p] &lt; 0 or (?A/??)[subscript T,V] &lt; 0 when the process can be characterized by a single reaction coordinate. The correct criterion for equilibrium is either dG = 0 or dA = 0. The paper concludes with some briefly stated recommendations as to the manner in which textbooks should be altered. The pedagogical problem of presenting the correct criteria for spontaneity and equilibrium to beginning students not versed in calculus and thermodynamics is also addressed, and some recommendations are made.",

The tasks involved number-line placements on two different number lines (0-to-10 and 0-to-20) and place-value understanding. Participants were 119 children from four different classes (Years 1-3). Children's placements were more accurate on the 0-to-20 than the 0-to-10 number line but many found midpoint placements difficult. Children with good place-value understanding were better than their peers at making accurate number-line placements.

A status survey design was used with a priori and post hoc groupings. Independent variables investigated were age, gender, and marital status. Dependent variables were the MBTI Extraversion-Introversion scale and the MMPI 0 scale scores. An analysis of variance was used to test the null hypotheses. Results suggest the following: (1) age and marital status should be investigated simultaneously when using the MMPI 0 scale scores; (2) an association is found between MBTI extraversion-introversion scores and the  MMPI 0 score; (3) no association is found for age and the MBTI scores studied; (4) no association is found for gender and the MBTI scale scores studied; (5) no association is found between gender and MMPI 0 scale; (6) no association is found between marital status and MBTI scores studied; and (7) the two scales of the instruments studied appear to give approximately the same information.

The Nordic countries have a long history of using the DC system. The Nordic DC:0-5 collaboration was formalized in 2015 when a Nordic DC:0-5 working group was initiated by the Nordic affiliation of the World Association of Infant Mental Health (NAIMH) and the Finnish affiliation PIRPANA. This article describes efforts to explore applicability of the DC:0-5 during introduction training courses and supervision sessions. The revised DC:0-5 is overall considered an improvement over earlier experiences with DC:0-3R. In this article, the authors present reflections and experiences from clinicians, researchers, students, and trainers who have provided feedback about training and use of the DC:0-5 system from the first 5 years of implementation.",

        "description":"Purpose: To investigate the effect of age on voice fundamental frequency (F[subscript 0]) difference limen (DL) and identification of concurrently presented vowels. Method: Fifteen younger and 15 older adults with normal audiometric thresholds in the speech range participated in 2 experiments. In Experiment 1, F[subscript 0] DLs were measured for a synthesized vowel. In Experiment 2, accuracy in identifying concurrently presented vowel pairs was measured. Vowel pairs were formed from 5 synthesized vowels with F[subscript 0] separations ranging from 0 to 4 semitones. Results: Younger adults had smaller (better) F[subscript 0] DLs than older adults. For the older group, age was significantly correlated with F[subscript 0] DLs. Younger adults identified concurrent vowels more accurately than older adults. When the vowels in the pairs had different formants, both age groups benefited similarly from F[subscript 0] separation. Interestingly, when both constituent vowels had identical formants, F[subscript 0] separation was deleterious, especially for older adults. Pure-tone average threshold did not correlate significantly with either F[subscript 0] DL or accuracy in concurrent vowel identification. Conclusion: Age-related declines were confirmed for F[subscript 0] DLs, identification of concurrently spoken vowels, and benefit from F[subscript 0] separation between vowels with identical formants. This pattern of findings is consistent with age-related deficits in periodicity coding. (Contains 3 tables, 4 figures and 2 footnotes.)",

The current study employed the case study design, which is one of the qualitative research methods. In the selection of the sample, the criterion sampling method, one of the purposive sampling methods, was used. The study was conducted with the participation of a total of 114 third-grade pupils (58 girls and 56 boys) attending two state primary schools located in the city of Ankara in the fall term of the 2019-2020 school year. As the data collection tool, a semi-structured interview form developed by the researchers in relation to the concepts of &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; was used. In the analysis of the data obtained in relation to the concepts of &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;, content analysis was used. The primary school third-grade pupils made sense of the number &quot;0&quot; in association with the categories of four operations, ineffective element, absorbing element, number, natural number, meaningless, valueless, absence, even number, beginning, and letter. The categories in which most thoughts about the meaning of the number &quot;1&quot; are gathered are number, ineffective element, and uniqueness. It was determined that the pupils are more successful in the use of the numbers &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; in the addition and subtraction operations than in the multiplication and division operations.",

DC:0-3, published in 1994 by ZERO TO THREE, was created to address the significant need for a systematic, developmentally based approach to the classification of mental health and developmental difficulties in the first 4 years of life (i.e., birth through 3 years old). Based on advances in knowledge, ZERO TO THREE decided to revise DC:0-3 and published DC:0-3R in 2005. The current revision, DC:0-5, was substantial, expanding the age range from 3 years old to 5 years old and expanding the number of diagnostic categories and clinical disorders from previous versions. The authors describe the new features of DC:0-5, detail three levels of the training model, highlight other DC:0-5 resources, and discuss the future of DC:0-5.",

Method: The experimental design manipulated two factors, that is, semantic context, by comparing the intelligibility of normal sentence versus word list, and F[subscript 0] contours, by comparing the intelligibility of utterances with natural versus flat F[subscript 0] patterns. Twenty-two children with CIs completed a speech recognition test. Results: Children with CIs could use both semantic context and F[subscript 0] contours to assist speech recognition. Furthermore, natural F[subscript 0] patterns provided extra benefit when semantic context was present than when it was absent. Conclusion: Dynamic F[subscript 0] contours play an important role in speech recognition by Mandarin-speaking children with CIs despite the well-known limitation of CI devices in extracting F[subscript 0] information.",

VOT was measured from the recordings of 56 young men reading phrases containing all 6 English voiced and voiceless stops in word-initial position across high-, medium-, and low-F[0] levels. Separate analyses of variance for the voiced and voiceless stops revealed no significant main effect for F[0] for the voiced stops but a significant F[0] effect for the voiceless stops. Across the voiceless stops, productions at high F[0]s displayed significantly shorter VOTs than productions at low or mid F[0]s. The findings indicated that researchers must take into account the F[0] level at which voiceless stop VOT is measured. (Contains 7 figures and 4 tables.)",

A white male interviewed 83 students who were Menominee or had other tribal affiliations. Of those interviewed, 46 0/0 were female and 54 0/0 were male. All but 2 lived in Menominee County. The students responded to questions on parental attitudes toward education; parental contact with high school; student interest in academics; the relationship between formal education and adulthood; the use of study centers; tribal language and culture and their relationship to school; teachers; principals; guidance; student council; student involvement in school activities; and Indian and white peer relationships. Major findings were: (1) Menominee students  characterized themselves as more friendly, more adventuresome, freer of parental control, more casual, more interested in happiness than success, and better athletics than Whites; (2) most of the Menominee students did not feel teachers were prejudiced; and (3) the majority of the students wanted both Menominee language and culture taught in high school.

A formula for N[subscript k] is derived, in terms of an auxiliary sequence {E[subscript k]} and the starting value N[subscript 0]. It is shown that each E[subscript k] satisfies k [less than or equal] E[subscript k] less than 1.585k; this, in turn, leads us to conclude that N[subscript 0] is unbounded, which is a contradiction of its definition, thereby establishing CC.",

F[subscript 0] range (?F[subscript 0]) was negatively correlated with infant age and number of children. ?F[subscript 0] was significantly smaller in clinically depressed mothers and mothers diagnosed with depression in partial remission, relative to nondepressed mothers, mothers diagnosed with depression in full remission, and those diagnosed with depressive disorder not otherwise specified. ?F[subscript 0] was significantly lower in mothers experiencing their first major depressive episode relative to mothers with recurrent depression. Deficits in ?F[subscript 0] were specific to diagnosed clinical depression, and were not well predicted by elevated self-report scores only or by diagnosed anxiety disorders. Mothers with higher ?F[subscript 0] had infants with reportedly larger productive vocabularies, but depression was unrelated to vocabulary development.

After a pretest, kindergartners with at least one risk factor (n = 28) were randomly assigned to either a structured add-0/1 training condition, which focused on recognizing the n + 0/0 + n = n and the n + 1/1 + n = the number-after-n rules, or an active control group. Using pretest fluency as the covariate, ANCOVAs revealed that the structured add-0/1 group significantly outperformed the control group on both practiced and unpracticed (transfer) n + 0/0 + n and n + 1/1 + n items at the delayed posttest and had significantly larger gains in mathematics achievement. Key instructional implications include: Early intervention that targets discovering rules for adding with 0 and 1 and &quot;family-specific&quot; developmental prerequisites is feasible and more effective than typical classroom instruction in promoting fluency with such basic sums. Such rules may be a critically important bridge between informal and formal mathematics. (Contains 8 footnotes, 5 tables, and 4 figures.)",

All ICD-10 diagnoses were given prospectively at the initial contact. The DC: 0-3R diagnoses were allotted in mutual consensus conferences. The most common ICD-10 disorders were Oppositional Defiant (ODD), Hyperkinetic (HKD) and Emotional Disorders. In DC: 0-3R, nearly half of the children could not be coded adequately (\"Other Disorders\"). Sleep Behavior Disorders were followed by Feeding Behavior and Regulation Disorders. Both classification systems are needed in infant, toddler and preschool psychiatry.

The two phases learning session we designed was implemented in the AlgoRythmics environment which includes ten algorithmic dance choreographies (and attached interactive computer animations). In addition to previous studies that had focused only on supporting students in assimilating the strategy of the studied algorithms, this study examined whether they are able to build on this knowledge by extracting from visualizations some algorithm efficiency related concepts too. To this end, the learning environment was complemented/supplemented with targeted questioning (with and without teacher guidance). Participants (first year undergraduate students) were grouped based on the number of years they had learned programming in high school (0, 1/2 or 4 years). We performed two analyses: (1) group-0 vs. group-1/2 and group-4 (N=181; self-paced setting: algorithm visualization complemented with teacher prepared questions); (2) group-0 (one-group pretest-posttest design, N=46; supplementary Socratic questioning). Research results revealed that the AlgoRythmics environment, if complemented/supplemented with tutorial questionasking, could be an effective instrument in introducing students with no prior knowledge in computing (group-0), even with deeper Computer Science concepts such as algorithm efficiency.",

        "description":"In the number to position task, several studies have shown that typically developing children shift from a biased (logarithmic) to an accurate (linear) mapping of symbolic digits onto a spatial position on a line. The initial pattern of overestimation of small numbers and the underestimation of larger numbers is compensated by means of age and education. Children with mathematical disability seem to show less accuracy in placing numbers on the line and their mapping tends to be more biased than linear. Here we evaluate to what extent this hypothesis holds for a sample of Italian children who have received a formal diagnosis of developmental dyscalculia (DD). Ten children with DD (M age-months = 123, SD = 25) and ten typically developing (TD) children (M age-months = 121, SD = 23), matched for age and gender, completed two number to position tasks (intervals: 0-100, 0-1000). For the interval 0-100, children with DD obtained a mapping in an intermediate stage between logarithmic and linear whereas the TD group reached a linear mapping. For the interval 0-1000, children with DD exhibited a logarithmic mapping whereas TD children had a linear mapping. These results highlight the presence of basic numerical deficit in children with DD.",

Descriptive scales for oral interaction were prepared as well as a general outline of scale characteristics for listening comprehension and reading. Experts in the field reviewed the project proposal and recommendations were made to devote the major effort to oral interaction. The major outcomes at this stage were the following: (1) a commitment to some form of the 0-5 government scale; (2) concentration on the relationship between linguistic ability and the larger area of inter-personal communication; and (3) concentration of efforts at the 0-2 range, the one most second language speakers can expect to attain after the ordinary academic course of  study. The major outcomes of the study are summarized as follows: (1) consensus on the usefulness of the expanded definitions at Levels 0 and 1; (2) agreement on the usefulness of a bilevel system; and (3) the need for definitions at Levels 0 and 1; (2) agreement on the coordination of efforts among the various agencies concerned with language proficiency testing.

In two preregistered studies (N = 218), we investigate the scope and malleability of the left digit effect. Experiment 1 used a typical forward-oriented 0-1000 number line estimation task and an atypical reverse-oriented 1000-0 number line estimation task. Experiment 2 used the same forward-oriented typical 0-1000 number line estimation task from Experiment 1, but with trial-by-trial corrective feedback. We observed a large left digit effect, regardless of the orientation of the line in Experiment 1 or the presence of corrective feedback in Experiment 2. Further, analyses using combined data showed that the pattern was present across most stimuli and participants. These findings demonstrate a left digit effect that is robust and widely observed, and that cannot be easily corrected with simple feedback. We discuss the implications of the findings for understanding sources of the effect and efforts to reduce it.",

There was a need for a diagnostic classification system that would take into account the rapid pace of development in the early years, the importance of the child's early relationships, individual differences among children, and the impact of the caregiving environment on children's health and development. To meet this need \"Zero to Three\" convened an expert Task Force and published the \"DC:0-3\" in 1994. The 2005 revision of \"DC:0-3\" provides needed specifications and clarifications of criteria in order to facilitate reliability among clinicians and advance the evidence-based evolution of the system. \"DC:0-3R\" represents a further step toward a seamless system of diagnostic classification. The authors describe the new features of this evolving system and detail three levels of training in \"DC:0-3R,\" as well as a state-level \"Training of Trainers\" model in which \"Zero to Three\" is working with several states to build a cadre of trainers prepared to teach \"DC:0-3R\" to professionals statewide.",

Yet, the idea that cellular respiration can occur not only in the absence of oxygen but also involve the oxidation of inorganic substrates (e.g., AsO[subscript 3 superscript 3-], Fe[superscript 2+], H[subscript 2], H[subscript 2]S, Mn[superscript 2+], NH[subscript 3], and S[superscript 0]) is often foreign to many undergraduate students. This article describes a problem-solving exercise where students are introduced to the thermodynamic fundamentals of respiration with a particular focus on the role of redox (reduction-oxidation) potentials (E[subscript 0]'). In the exercise, the students investigate how the difference in redox potential ([delta]E[subscript 0]') between different pairs of reductants and oxidants affects the range of permissible microbial metabolic reactions in natural environments when oxygen is absent.",

A new task of paired position-learning was designed, based on the A-B A-C paradigm, which was used in paired word learning. There were three different paired position-learning conditions: (1) positions of several different objects (B-objects and C-objects) around referent objects (A-objects) were learned in the A-B A-C position-learning condition, (2) positions of several different objects with no referent objects were learned in the 0-B 0-C position-learning condition, and (3) positions of identical objects (stars) with no referent objects were learned in the 0-star 0-star position-only condition. The results revealed a significant priority effect on performance in the A-B A-C and the 0-B 0-C position-learning conditions but not in the 0-star 0-star position-only condition. Contradictory results were obtained with respect to the sex variable: a female superiority effect on paired position learning was significant in Experiment 1, but this effect was not replicated in Experiment 2. In addition, an articulatory suppression task used in Experiment 2 had a significant effect on recall of different object positions but no effect on recall of identical object positions. This suggested that verbal encoding was not necessary for learning of positions of identical objects.",

        "description":"Purpose: The objective of this study was to determine if and how the subcortical neural representation of pitch cues in listeners with normal hearing is affected by systematic manipulation of vocoder parameters. Method: This study assessed the effects of temporal envelope cutoff frequency (50 and 500 Hz), number of channels (1-32), and carrier type (sine-wave and noise-band) on brainstem neural representation of fundamental frequency (f[subscript 0]) in frequency-following responses (FFRs) to vocoded vowels of 15 young adult listeners with normal hearing. Results: Results showed that FFR f[subscript 0] strength (quantified as absolute f[subscript 0] magnitude divided by noise floor [NF] magnitude) significantly improved with 500-Hz vs. 50-Hz temporal envelopes for all channel numbers and both carriers except the 1-channel noise-band vocoder. FFR f[subscript 0] strength with 500-Hz temporal envelopes significantly improved when the channel number increased from 1 to 2, but it either declined (sine-wave vocoders) or saturated (noise-band vocoders) when the channel number increased from 4 to 32. FFR f[subscript 0] strength with 50-Hz temporal envelopes was similarly small for both carriers with all channel numbers, except for a significant improvement with the 16-channel sine-wave vocoder. With 500-Hz temporal envelopes, FFR f[subscript 0] strength was significantly greater for sine-wave vocoders than for noise-band vocoders with channel numbers 1-8; no significant differences were seen with 16 and 32 channels. With 50-Hz temporal envelopes, the carrier effect was only observed with 16 channels. In contrast, there was no significant carrier effect for the absolute f[subscript 0] magnitude. Compared to sine-wave vocoders, noise-band vocoders had a higher NF and thus lower relative FFR f[subscript 0] strength. Conclusions: It is important to normalize the f[subscript 0] magnitude relative to the NF when analyzing the FFRs to vocoded speech. The physiological findings reported here may result from the availability of f[subscript 0]-related temporal periodicity and spectral sidelobes in vocoded signals and should be considered when selecting vocoder parameters and interpreting results in future physiological studies. In general, the dependence of brainstem neural phase-locking strength to f[subscript 0] on vocoder parameters may confound the comparison of pitch-related behavioral results across different vocoder designs.",

The promoted action chosen by the teacher will depend on the knowledge possessed by the teacher. It is commonly referred to as pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). In addition, to become a professional teacher with a well-measured PCK, the prospective teacher has been trained since the lecturing process. This study aims to describe promoting the actions of prospective teacher students in learning mathematics online. It is descriptive qualitative research on the subject of four students who take the peer teaching program. Subject selection was based on the PCK criteria of subjects with categories 0-0, 0-1, 1-0, and 1-1, which indicated the order of levels of pedagogical knowledge- content knowledge. Data collection methods are tests to determine the PCK of prospective subjects, observation of the learning process, and documentation of learning records. The triangulation used to see the credibility of the data is time triangulation. The results showed that all subjects elicited promoted actions in motivation, concentration, processing, and exploration phases. The four students have different ways of bringing up encouraging action based on their ability criteria.",

The results replicate previous findings showing that higher accuracy on the number line estimation task is predictive of higher mathematical reasoning, for both the 0-10 and 0-100 number line.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the academic achievement of students enrolled in an elective English program with the achievement of students enrolled in a traditional English program. The 320 subjects were eleventh and twelfth grade students at two New Jersey high schools, selected at random, and assigned to groups according to treatment, sex, and grade level. The results of the pretesting and posttesting were submitted to an analysis of covariance procedure to determine results against the following seven hypotheses: treatment effects=0, grade level effects=0, sex effects=0, treatment x grade level interaction=0, treatment x sex interaction=0, grade level x sex interaction=0, and treatment x grade level x sex interaction=0. The first hypothesis was found to  be significant at the .05 level, and all others were found to be nonsignificant. It may be concluded that students enrolled in an elective English program do achieve more than their peers enrolled in a traditional program, and that the difference is due to the treatment and not to any other factor. Care should be exercised not to conclude that the advantage for the experimental group necessarily implies superiority large enough to warrant implementation of elective programs. (Author/RB)",

        "description":"A study of the effects of color as used in presentation software on short-range (immediately following treatment) and long-range (one hour following treatment) memory retention was conducted. Previous studies have concentrated on color as cueing or coding mechanisms primarily in print media and have not explored the effect of individual colors as presented on CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) computer screens. Twenty-eight subjects were selected from 6th and 7th grade students enrolled in a public school. Subjects were shown a series of alphanumeric characters (three per slide times three slides, equaling nine total per color) using black text upon white, blue, and green backgrounds. The slides were prepared using presentation software. Slides were automatically timed for 10 seconds each.  Subjects were given answer sheets and asked immediately (time 0) following treatment to write down what they remembered from the series. One hour later (time 1), the subjects were given another answer sheet and asked to write what they remembered. The white, blue, and green slides were presented at one week intervals using a different set of randomly selected alphanumeric characters upon each subsequent background. The answers were scored for number correct in order and sequence from all colors and time references and t-tests were conducted on the data. Results show a statistically significant memory loss from time 0 to time 1 at the .05 level in the trial using blue and in the trial using green. Additionally, in a comparison between mean number of correct responses, a trend may have been  discovered which shows black text upon a white background to rank higher than both colors in both time 0 and time 1. Blue may rank second in time 0 and third (worst) in time 1 while green may rank third in time 0 and second in time 1. Recommendations for additional research are given. Several appendices provide information on specifics of the study. (Contains 37 references.) (Author/AEF)",

        "description":"In order to develop conclusions about future policy aimed at addressing the challenge of workers at risk because of low skills, the NEWSKILLS project combined scientific analysis with consultation with social partner representatives, policy analysis, and field work in firms. Population proportions in International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) 0-2 group (those who had completed lower secondary or less education) varied widely among European countries. In all countries, the proportion of adults in the 0-2 group declined from 1985-95 resulting predominantly from more young people receiving further education and training. Adult upgrading from ISCED 0-2 remained the exception. Measured by duration, the low skill group received less employer-provided education and  training than higher skill groups. The 0-2 group's labor market position declined over the same period relative to the national average. Technological change explained much of the decline in labor market demand for the group without further education and training. Older workers without full lower secondary education were at greatest risk. Increased expectations in social competence and communication resulting from growth of service economy employment was found. Suggestions were to frame education policy in terms of entitlement to a minimum level and not only to an entitlement of years of education. (Contains 73 references.) (YLB)",

Questionnaires were randomly administered to 300 AD students enrolled at New York City Technical College in spring 1996, receiving usable responses from 121 students. Further, respondents' performance after three semesters of study was analyzed with respect to grade point average (GPA), number of college credits earned, and enrollment or graduation status. Study findings included the following: (1) after 3 semesters, 18% of the sample had a GPA of 0 to 1.99, 65% had a GPA of 2.0 to 2.99, and 17% had a GPA of 3.0 to 4.0; (2) 23% had earned 0 to 29 credits, 35% had earned 30 to 49, 21% had earned 50 to 69, and 20% had  earned 70 or more; (3) 12% had completed an internal transfer to another academic curriculum, 15% had stopped out, and 18% had graduated; and (4) students with the highest levels of dissatisfaction were more likely to stop out, to have achieved a GPA of 0 to 1.99, to have earned between 0 and 29 credits, and to have completed an internal transfer than those with low dissatisfaction levels. As a result of the findings, it was recommended that the questionnaire be used to help the college predict which students are at academic risk. (BCY)",

This study examined undergraduate research assessment practices and the implementation of a satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U) research course in all academic units within a college of agricultural and life sciences. During the 2013-2014 academic year, undergraduate students registered for a letter-graded research course, and faculty supervising undergraduate research experiences were surveyed regarding assessment practices. Based on survey responses, an S/U 0-3 credit research course and syllabus template were implemented. Undergraduate students were subsequently surveyed on their 2015 and 2020 fall semester research course experiences. At baseline, most students did not receive a course syllabus (87%), however, they were verbally informed of research expectations (89%). Grades were determined by attendance and participation, and these findings were confirmed by the faculty respondents. Following implementation, 58% agreed or strongly agreed that they were more likely to participate in research with a 0-credit option and that having research on their transcript was important (89%). By 2020, 64% of respondents preferred a 0-credit option. Receiving a syllabus continued to be uncommon. S/U-grading of undergraduate research may be most appropriate for participatory-based assessment; however, steps are needed to promote the 0-credit option and ensure syllabi use for transparency of course expectations and assessment criteria.",

        "description":"The connection between linear and 0-1 integer linear formulations has attracted the attention of many researchers. The main reason triggering this interest has been an availability of efficient computer programs for solving pure linear problems including the transportation problem. Also the optimality of linear problems is easily verifiable through existing algorithms. However, there is no efficient general technique available to solve 0-1 integer linear problems or to verify their optimality. This paper shows that in the case of one of the easier 0-1 integer linear problems, namely a single assignment problem, such a relation between linear and 0-1 integer linear formulation can be built. The theory behind the proposed \"bridge\" is based on the combination of the absolute point principle and shadow price theory. The main practical benefit of this work is in providing an algorithm to find a MFL (more-for-less) solution for the assignment problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first efforts to provide a \"more-for-less\" result for a 0-1 integer linear problem. (Contains 5 tables.)",

Students' responses were scored by three scoring systems: the correct/incorrect criterion (0/1); a holistic scoring rubric (0-4); and an analytical scoring rubric for measuring maturity levels of mathematical reasoning (0-4). The results demonstrate that cognitive constructs in a performance-based format were different from those in a multiple-choice format. Outcome cognitive constructs in students' responses were not the same as the planned ones in tasks. Bloom's Taxonomy was not sufficient for classifying mathematical reasoning. The correct/incorrect scores could not distinguish different levels of mathematical  reasoning. The combined use of a holistic scoring rubric and an analytical one for reasoning were informative.

Nationally representative data (N = 8,670) of adults between the ages of 18 years old and older years were obtained from the 2012/2014 Program for International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC). Structural equation models showed that higher literacy skills (0-500 points) (b = 0.159, p &lt; 0.05) were associated with greater MtL. Additionally, foreign-born individuals tended to have (b = -0.064, p &lt; 0.05) lower MtL than U.S.-born individuals. Limited literacy skills, educational attainment, and being an immigrant are potential barriers to motivation towards life-long learning participation among middle-aged adults.

Method: Participants of this cross-sectional study included 99 full-term neonates (165 ears) with mean chronological age of 46.7 hrs (SD = 26.3 hrs). Of the 99 neonates, 58 were Malay, 28 were Indian, and 13 were Chinese. The neonates who passed high-frequency (1 kHz) tympanometry, acoustic stapedial reflex, and distortion product otoacoustic emission screening tests were assessed using a pressurized WBA test (wideband tympanometry). To reduce the number of measurement points, the WBA responses were averaged to 16 one-third octave frequency bands from 0.25 to 8 kHz. A mixed-model analysis of variance was applied to the data to investigate the effects of frequency, ear, gender, and ethnicity on WBA. The analysis of variance was also used to compare between WBA measured at TPP and 0 daPa. An interclass correlation coefficient test was applied at each of the 16 frequency bands to measure the test-retest reliability of WBA at TPP and 0 daPa. Results: Both WBA measurements at TPP and 0 daPa exhibited a multipeaked pattern with 2 maxima at 1.25-1.6 kHz and 6.3 kHz and 2 minima at 0.5 and 4 kHz. The mean WBA measured at TPP was significantly higher than that measured at 0 daPa at 0.25, 0.4, 0.5, 1.25, and 1.6 kHz only. A normative data set was developed for absorbance at TPP and at 0 daPa. There was no significant effect of ethnicity, gender, and ear on both measurements of WBA. The test-retest reliability of WBA at TPP and 0 daPa was high with the interclass correlation coefficient ranging from 0.77 to 0.97 across the frequencies. Conclusions: Normative data of WBA measured at TPP and 0 daPa for neonates were provided in the present study. Although WBA at TPP was slightly higher than the WBA measured at 0 daPa at some frequencies below 2 kHz, the WBA patterns of the 2 measurements were nearly identical. Moreover, the test-retest reliability of both WBA measurements was high.",

Method: Twelve younger listeners with normal hearing and 13 older listeners with (near) normal hearing were evaluated in their use of [delta]F[subscript 0] in the perception of competing synthesized vowels for 3 conditions: unprocessed synthesized vowels (UNP), envelope-vocoded synthesized vowels that simulated a cochlear implant (VOC), and synthesized vowels processed to simulate electroacoustic stimulation (EAS) hearing. Tasks included (a) \"multiplicity,\" which required listeners to identify whether a stimulus contained 1 or 2 sounds and (b) \"double-vowel identification,\" which required listeners to attach phonemic labels to the competing synthesized vowels. Results: Multiplicity perception was facilitated by [delta]F[subscript 0] in UNP and EAS but not in VOC, with no age-related deficits evident. Double-vowel identification was facilitated by [delta]F[subscript 0], with [delta]F[subscript 0] benefit largest in UNP, reduced in EAS, and absent in VOC. Age adversely affected overall identification and [delta]F[subscript 0] benefit on the double-vowel task. Conclusions: Some but not all older listeners derived [delta]F[subscript 0] benefit in EAS hearing. This variability may partly be due to how listeners are able to draw on higher-level processing resources in extracting and integrating cues in EAS hearing.",

Data for the tests given after the two units covered in the fall semester of grade 3 are presented in this paper. The scores for each objective, developed using matrix sampling procedures, indicated mastery of addition and subtraction without regrouping, mastery of the addition algorithm for numbers 0-99 and near-mastery of the subtraction algorithm for numbers 0-99.  These results reflected the instructional emphasis. There was marked improvement on several of the problem-solving 0-99 and sentence-writing 0-99 objectives not previously mastered, though only one of these objectives was actually mastered. With the exception of the subt-join-addend sentence-writing 0-20 objective, progress (or maintenance) on the objectives associated with the numbers 0-20 was excellent. (Author)",

        "description":"The use of an internal standard is a conventional and convenient way to monitor the conversion of one or several monomers during a controlled radical polymerization. However, the validity of this technique relies on an accurate determination of the initial monomer-to-internal standard ratio, A[subscript 0], because all subsequent calculations of the conversion are based on this value. In most kinetic studies using an internal standard for the determination of the conversion, an incorrect determination of the value of A[subscript 0] will result in absurd conclusions and will thus be detected and corrected. However, an incorrect determination of A[subscript 0] can be significantly misleading in the case of controlled polymerization. This article shows that deviation of the kinetic plots from their true shape because of an error in A[subscript 0] will not look absurd in the case of controlled polymerization. On the contrary, the plots will fit with a possible deviation of the polymerization from a \"quasi-living\" to a less controlled process. As a consequence, an error on A[subscript 0] may not be detected and can result in a misinterpretation of the behavior of the system. (Contains 6 notes and 4 figures.)",

        "description":"In this note we unify two physical situations treatable with hydrostatics: an object floating on a denser fluid and an open U-shaped tube with two immiscible fluids. We begin by reviewing the problem of a partially floating uniform, rectangular prism of horizontal area &quot;A&quot; immersed in a denser fluid, with respective densities ?[subscript 1] &lt; ?[subscript h] for the prism and fluid (the subscripts stand for light and heavy): see Fig. 1. We define three horizontal levels within the solid, y[subscript 0], y[subscript 1], and y[subscript 2], corresponding to the bottom, flotation line, and top of the prism. The buoyant force is ?[subscript h] (y[subscript 1] - y[subscript 0])gA upwards, and the weight of the prism is ?[subscript 1] (y[subscript 2] - y[subscript 0])gA downwards. By Newton's second law, these two forces balance at equilibrium. After dividing by the common horizontal area, one obtains: y[subscript 1] - y[subscript 0] divided by y[subscript 2] - y[subscript 0] = ?[subscript 1] divided by p[subscript h].",

        "description":"Maintaining spending power in real terms (current) while preserving an endowment's value in real terms (future) is the crux of intergenerational equity. Tobin's (1974) model provides the conceptual basis on which simulations were developed to study the impact of various inflation (0%, TIPS, CPI, HECA, and HEPI) and new giving scenarios ($0, $4 million and $8 million) on the value of the USD Foundation endowment as well as the value of the future payouts from the endowment. All inflation scenarios except 0% inflation require new gifts to the endowment to maintain or grow the inflation-adjusted value of the endowment with a 6.85% nominal return, 4.80% payout and 2% administrative fee. With $8,000,000 in annual new gifts to the endowment, the inflation-adjusted value of the endowment grows in all five inflation scenarios. With $4,000,000 in annual new gifts to the endowment, the inflation-adjusted value of the endowment grows over time in the 0%, TIPS, and CPI inflation scenarios but declines in the higher inflation scenarios (HECA and HEPI). The level of new gifts required to provide for intergenerational equity was also determined; new giving increases the size of the payout on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Holding the sustainable payout rate constant at 4.80% and using HECA as the inflation assumption shows that the &quot;break-even&quot; calculation is $4,946,170 in new gifts per-year. Finally, the sustainable payout rate under the assumption of zero new gifts was determined. As expected, the sustainable payout decreases with higher inflation and is lower than the current payout rate.",

        "description":"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation of respiratory forced oscillation to the acoustic characteristics of vocal tremor. Method: Acoustical analyses were performed to determine the characteristics of the intensity and fundamental frequency (F[subscript 0]) for speech samples obtained by Farinella, Hixon, Hoit, Story, and Jones (2006) using a respiratory forced oscillation paradigm with 5 healthy adult males to simulate vocal tremor involving respiratory pressure modulation. The analyzed conditions were sustained productions of /a/ with amplitudes of applied pressure of 0, 1, 2, and 4 cmH[subscript 2]O and a rate of 5 Hz. Results: Forced oscillation of the respiratory system produced modulation of the intensity and F[subscript 0] for all participants. Variability was observed between participants and conditions in the change in intensity and F[subscript 0] per unit of pressure change, as well as in the mean intensity and F[subscript 0]. However, the extent of modulation of intensity and F[subscript 0] generally increased as the applied pressure increased, as would be expected. Conclusion: These findings suggest that individuals develop idiosyncratic adaptations to pressure modulations, which are important to understanding aspects of variability in vocal tremor, and highlight the need to assess all components of the speech mechanism that may be directly or indirectly affected by tremor.

        "description":"To account for the mechanism of number transcoding, many authors have proposed various models, for example, semantic-abstract model, lexical-semantic model, triple-code model, and so on. However, almost all of them are based on the symptoms of patients with left cerebral damage. Previously, I reported two Japanese patients with right posterior cerebral infarction showing pure misallocation of ''0'' (omission: ''40265'' [right arrow] ''4265,'' addition: ''107'' [right arrow] ''1007,'' transposition: ''4072'' [right arrow] ''4702'') both in writing and oral reading of Arabic numerals. To examine whether the pure misallocation of ''0'' is commonly observed in patients with right cerebral damage, I investigated writing and oral reading of Arabic numerals in 18 patients with right cerebral damage and 16 healthy controls. All patients with right cerebral damage showed pure misallocation of ''0'' both in writing and reading. The pure misallocation of ''0'' due to right cerebral damage cannot be explained by current models. It may be more useful to explain the phenomenon by regarding an Arabic numeral as graph on a two-dimensional plane composed of two axes (place-holding values and digits).",

        "description":"There is a renewed debate about whether educated adults solve simple addition problems (e.g., 2 + 3) by direct fact retrieval or by fast, automatic counting-based procedures. Recent research testing adults' simple addition and multiplication showed that a 150-ms preview of the operator (+ or ×) facilitated addition, but not multiplication, suggesting that a general addition procedure was primed by the + sign. In Experiment 1 (n = 36), we applied this operator-priming paradigm to rule-based problems (0 + N = N, 1 × N = N, 0 × N = 0) and 1 + N problems with N ranging from 0 to 9. For the rule-based problems, we found both operator-preview facilitation and generalization of practice (e.g., practicing 0 + 3 sped up unpracticed 0 + 8), the latter being a signature of procedure use; however, we also found operator-preview facilitation for 1 + N in the absence of generalization, which implies the 1 + N problems were solved by fact retrieval but nonetheless were facilitated by an operator preview. Thus, the operator preview effect does not discriminate procedure use from fact retrieval. Experiment 2 (n = 36) investigated whether a population with advanced mathematical training--engineering and computer science students--would show generalization of practice for nonrule-based simple addition problems (e.g., 1 + 4, 4 + 7). The 0 + N problems again presented generalization, whereas no nonzero problem type did; but all nonzero problems sped up when the identical problems were retested, as predicted by item-specific fact retrieval. The results pose a strong challenge to the generality of the proposal that skilled adults' simple addition is based on fast procedural algorithms, and instead support a fact-retrieval model of fast addition performance.",

Harrison, was examined with a sample of 23 non-handicapped preschool children (14 females and 9 males) ranging in age from 3 years 0 months to 6 years 0 months at the time of initial testing. The sample was drawn from a rural/suburban community in the midwest with a predominantly middle socioeconomic level. Each child was tested with the ESP by examiners trained in its administration. Retesting occurred an average of 10 months after initial testing, with a range of 5 to 15 months. The ESP is a nationally normed screening battery for children ages 2 years 0 months through 6 years 11 months. The battery measures development in cognitive, language, motor, and self-help/social areas and provides standard scores with  means of 100 and standard deviations of 15. Pearson product moment correlations were computed and produced the following stability coefficients: (1) a cognitive profile of 0.54; (2) a language profile of 0.49; (3) a motor profile of 0.51; (4) an expressive language profile of 0.47; and (5) a receptive language profile of 0.44.

        "author":["Brick, J. Michael"],
        "description":"The National Household Education Survey (NHES) is a data collection system of the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) designed to address a wide range of education-related issues. It is a telephone survey of the noninstitutionalized civilian population. This working paper presents information on the potential for undercoverage bias in estimates from the 1995 NHES. Estimates from the 1995 NHES are subject to bias because only households with telephones were sampled. Data from the 1992 October supplement to the Current Population Survey of the U.S. Census are used to evaluate the potential size of the bias of the estimates. The focus in the report is on the statistics for two separate populations: 0- to 2-year-olds who were sampled as part of the Early Childhood Program  Participation (ECPP) component and civilian adults who were sampled for the Adult Education (AE) component. The analysis of undercoverage bias shows that the coverage biases for estimates of adult characteristics are not very large, but biases for 0- to 2-year-olds are somewhat larger, yet still relatively small. The coverage bias is small even though some of the differences in characteristics for persons living in telephone and nontelephone households are large. The undercoverage bias for subgroups in the NHES may be more of a problem. In this study, the undercoverage biases for characteristics of Black and Hispanic American 0- to 2-year-olds were generally larger than for all children. For adults, these undercoverage biases were not as large as for children. Overall, however, results  support the use of the telephone survey methodology. An appendix presents three tables of study data. (Contains nine references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"This dissertation study examined racial differences in leadership orientation and effectiveness at United States four year, public colleges and universities as self-perceived and as perceived by presidents, as a means to contribute to the literature on race leadership orientation and effectiveness. The quantitative study design is to determine significant relationships among University or College Presidents or Chancellors (UCPC) pertaining to their leadership frames and effectiveness using (Bolman and Deal 1991a, 1991b, 2003) four-frame leadership theory and Quinn (1988) competing values model. The study attempts to understand any distinct observations that may be present. This study will not be an attempt to either predict success or failure of presidents. The study is twofold: (a) to investigate the experiences of selected UCPCs in public and private institutions and (b) to present descriptive and trend data in order to develop a comprehensive profile of UCPCs black, white, and non-black non-white in higher education Understanding what factors these presidents considered to be success and failure within the context of leadership effectiveness is most important. The study explored how direct reports of the senior executive leadership team interacts with UCPCs and to what extent, if any, are there statistically significant differences based on race. The study also examine factors (Gender, Race, Years in Current Job, Total Years of Management Experience, Age, and Educational Level) which influence the president and his/her senior leadership team. In addition, no significant differences were found between black and non-black leadership characteristics, which stands in contrast to extant research-supported evidence. The study employed survey methodology to gather information about presidents' self- perception of their leadership orientations and perceptions of leadership effectiveness of the presidents' performance as reported by his/her direct report staff. Information on demographic characteristics was gathered to determine if they explained variations in the responses. The Bolman and Deal Leadership Orientation Questionnaires for SELF and Quinn's Competing Values Leadership Instrument (CVLI) were employed to gather the information. This study analyzed the 91 UCPCs and 38 subordinate participants from executive leadership positions in higher education institutions. Identified race by the participants in the study included (UCPCs/DRs): 74/25 White Non-Hispanic, 5/2 Black Non-Hispanic, 0/4 Hispanic, 1/0 Asian, 0/0 Native Hawaiian, 1/0 American Indian or Alaskan Native, 1/0 Two or More Races, 0/0 Race/Ethnicity Unknown, and 1/0 Other.

        "description":"Purpose: The goal of this study was to use speech resynthesis to investigate the effects of changes to individual acoustic features on speech-based gender perception of transmasculine voice samples following the onset of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with exogenous testosterone. We hypothesized that mean fundamental frequency (f[subscript 0]) would have the largest effect on gender perception of any single acoustic feature. Method: Mean f[subscript 0], f[subscript 0] contour, and formant frequencies were calculated for three pairs of transmasculine speech samples before and after HRT onset. Sixteen speech samples with unique combinations of these acoustic features from each pair of speech samples were resynthesized. Twenty young adult listeners evaluated each synthesized speech sample for gender perception and synthetic quality. Two analyses of variance were used to investigate the effects of acoustic features on gender perception and synthetic quality. Results: Of the three acoustic features, mean f[subscript 0] was the only single feature that had a statistically significant effect on gender perception. Differences between the speech samples before and after HRT onset that were not captured by changes in f[subscript 0] and formant frequencies also had a statistically significant effect on gender perception. Conclusion: In these transmasculine voice samples, mean f[subscript 0] was the most important acoustic feature for voice masculinization as a result of HRT; future investigations in a larger number of transmasculine speakers and on the effects of behavioral therapy-based changes in concert with HRT is warranted.",

        "author":["Yuan, Boping"],
        "description":"In this article, an empirical study of how Chinese wh-questions are mentally represented in Japanese speakers' grammars of Chinese as a second language (L2) is reported. Both Chinese and Japanese are generally considered \"wh-in-situ\" languages in which a wh-word is allowed to remain in its base-generated position, and both languages use question particles to mark questions. It is assumed that C[superscript 0] in wh-questions is essentially ambiguous and unvalued and that unvalued C[superscript 0] must be valued. In Chinese, the wh-particle \"ne\" values C[superscript 0] with [+Q, +wh] features, which licenses the wh-word \"in situ.\" As a result, no wh-movement is necessary and Subjacency becomes irrelevant. Japanese also employs question particles, such as \"ka\" or \"no.\" However, they are \"defective\" in the sense that they can only value the ambiguous C[superscript 0] as [+Q] and they are unable to specify the question as to whether it is [+yes/no] or [+wh]. To value C[superscript 0] as a head with [+wh], a wh-operator in a wh-word inside the sentence has to raise overtly to C[superscript 0]. The results of an acceptability judgement task show that although the Japanese speakers respond in a broadly target-like way, the lexical morphological feature [+wh] of the particle \"ne\" in their L2 Chinese lexicons is permanently deficient, which leads to variability in their intuitions about Chinese wh-questions. A lexical morphological feature deficit account for the results is proposed, and it is suggested that the lexical morphology-syntax interface can be a source of variability in L2 acquisition.

        "description":"We analyzed the effect of an 8-week strength training (ST) program on the rate of force development (RFD) and electromyographic activity (EMG) in older women. Seventeen women (M age = 63.4 years, SD = 4.9) without previous ST experience were randomly assigned to either a control (n = 7) or training (n = 10) group. A leg-press isometric test was used for assessment. ST (three sessions/week, three sets of 10-12 repetition maximum, five different exercises) induced significant increases (p less than 0.05) on peak RFD (48.4%) and on RFD and EMG of vastus medialis at time intervals of 0-50, 0-100, 0-150, and 0-200 ms (41.1-69.2% and 43.8-64.3%, respectively). Therefore, ST resulted in favorable changes in neuromuscular responses in older women. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"This paper traces Einstein's discovery of \"the equivalence of mass [m] and energy [\"E[subscript 0]\"].\" He came to that splendid insight in 1905 while employed by the Bern Patent Office, at which time he was not an especially ardent reader of physics journals. How then did the young savant, working outside of academia in semi-isolation, realize that these two seemingly disparate concepts were actually \"identical\"? Until now little attention has been given to exploring the physics that guided his thinking in this remarkable endeavor. That work culminated (1907) in the equation \"E[subscript 0] = mc[squared]\", where \"E[subscript 0]\" is \"rest energy\" and \"m\" is \"invariant mass.\" Despite claims to the contrary, Einstein did not write this equation, or its ambiguous variant, \"E = mc[squared]\", in 1905. Furthermore, we will propose a compelling reason for his otherwise inexplicable caution. This paper is meant to help clarify the contemporary literature in the service of an informed pedagogy.",

On the first two occasions, the subjects' vocabulary and grammar skills were assessed through the IDHC. Simultaneously, lexical and grammatical measures were obtained from spontaneous speech samples. Standardized measures of general cognitive abilities (WPPSI-R) and receptive and expressive language (RDLS-III) were obtained at age 4 ; 0. Results showed high and significant levels of concurrent and short-term validity of the IDHC. Strong associations were found between lexical development at age 2 ; 0 and language scores two years later. These results coincide with those obtained with other CDI versions, and suggest that the IDHC is an effective and reliable tool.",

Results revealed no significant changes in F[subscript 0] with advances in pre-language vocal development for TDI. Infants with hearing loss, however, showed a statistically reliable higher variability of F[subscript 0] than TDI, when age was accounted for as a covariate.

The findings of the research were analysed by means of descriptive method. The following results were obtained: teachers only performed the activity of &quot;sending a notification to families&quot; out of all the available participation activities. Among the adoption and developmental indicators, they had difficulties in designing activities in order to gain cognitive and psychomotor development indicators, and in evaluating emotional development. They used the plans already available in the market for activity planning, and they mostly preferred finger games.

The two IQ levels also varied significantly in both cases. Significance was not found with respect to any levels of the MA variable. Results on series 1 and 2 showed significantly better performance within MA group with increasing MA: on series 2, the performance of nonreversers was significantly better.

Data for Hispanics ages 25 to 65 (N = 700) come from the 2012/2014 Program for International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC). Binary logistic regression models were used to predict online health information seeking as a function of literacy skill scores (0-500 points) and primary language use (Spanish vs. other). Literacy (Odds-Ratio = 1.012, p &lt; 0.001) was a positive predictor, while speaking Spanish at home (Odds-Ratio = 0.352, p &lt; 0.01) was a negative predictor of online health information seeking. Literacy skills and language use appear to be separate contributors of online health information seeking among Hispanic adults. Adult educational research and practice should consider literacy skills and English language use as separate and important predictors of online health information seeking among Hispanics in the U.S. [This paper was published in: J.

The productions of 25 children with linguistic impairment and their matched controls, aged 4; 4-10; 0 (mean age 5;11) were evaluated by ratings of fundamental frequency patterns, and by perceptual analysis by ten linguistically naive listeners to assess the distinctiveness of the accents. These methods give a more detailed description of the children's productions of tonal word accents. The results show that 60.8% of the children with language impairment have difficulties to produce the contrast of tonal word accents according to the F[subscript 0 patterns. The difference in the rating of the F[subscript 0] curves between the children with LI and their matched controls was significant. There is a significant positive correlation between the perceptual results and the F[subscript 0]-rating, indicating that the better a child was perceived, the better his/her F[subscript 0] production was rated. We conclude that the distinction between the tonal word accents is a difficult feature to acquire for Swedish children, which is shown both by acoustic and perceptual evaluations.

Specifically, we measured response variability and novel responses to categories for 3 children who demonstrated the lowest level of variability during an initial individual Lag 0 testing session. An additional 3 children who emitted a high level of variability during initial individual Lag 0 testing sessions served as peers during group sessions. Results showed that participants conformed to the Lag 1 schedule and were more likely to repeat peer responses in the group and during individual testing in the Lag 1 condition. Furthermore, the reinforcement schedule in effect during group sessions affected participants' varied responses during individual testing, during which the reinforcement schedule remained unchanged.",

        "description":"One important mechanism suggested to underlie the acquisition of grammar is rule learning. Indeed, infants aged 0 ; 7 are able to learn rules based on simple identity relations (adjacent repetitions, ABB: &quot;wo fe fe&quot; and non-adjacent repetitions, ABA: &quot;wo fe wo&quot;, respectively; Marcus et al., 1999). One unexplored issue is whether young infants are able to process both adjacent and non-adjacent repetitions. As the previous studies always compared the two types of repetition structures directly, the ability to learn only one of them was sufficient for successful discrimination in these tasks. The present study reports two experiments, in which we test the ability of infants aged 0 ; 7 to discriminate adjacent and non-adjacent repetition structures against random controls (ABB vs. ABC and ABA vs. ABC). We show that, contrary to some previous proposals, infants aged 0 ; 7 successfully discriminate both repetition types from random controls, but show no spontaneous preference for either of them.",

Inverse pairs of formalized operations, such as multiplication and division, provide obvious examples of this reversibility. However, there are exceptions, such as multiplying by 0. If we are to follow Piaget's lead in defining mathematics as the science of reversible mental actions, such exceptions must be examined. We consider the case of multiplying by 0 by adopting Davydov's model of multiplication as a transformation of units and by investigating the underlying mental actions. Results of this investigation have implications for breaking down the barriers between various domains of mathematics. [For the complete proceedings, see ED583608.]",

Fifty-one middle schoolers participated in this study, including 27 students with mathematics disabilities. Participants were asked to estimate 10 fractions on a 0-1 number line and 11 fractions on a 0-5 number line and explain their procedures. We identified two incorrect strategies (i.e., not-on-the-line and ruler-tick-mark counting strategy) and two execution mistakes (i.e., unequal segmentation based on denominator and inaccurate numerical transformation) on both number-line estimation tasks. We also identified one additional faulty strategy (i.e., treating 0-5 as the 0-1 number line) with the 0-5 number-line estimation tasks. Students with mathematics disabilities were significantly more likely to use the faulty strategies than students without mathematics disabilities. The faulty strategies, rather than execution mistakes, were consistent across two number-line tasks and predicted students' performance in other fraction problem-solving tasks. Results illustrated specific problems that students with and without mathematics disabilities encountered when using number lines to illustrate fractions. We discussed possible negative influences of using rulers to teach fractions and how to help students to construct the concept of units.",

Single-year matched gains were calculated for the 1997-1998 and 1999-2000 school years. Student progress was assessed using scores from the SAT/9 reading, mathematics, and language achievement tests for those school years. Researchers compared 3rd graders with 3 years versus 1 year of CSR; 4th graders with 2 years versus 0 years of CSR; and 5th graders with 1 year versus 0 years of CSR. Overall, 3rd graders with 3 years of CSR had larger gains in reading and language than those with 1 year. In math, 3rd graders with 3 years of CSR out-gained those with 1 year. Fourth graders with 2 years of CSR scored  significantly larger gains in reading than 4th graders with 0 years and exhibited somewhat larger gains in language than students with 0 years. In mathematics, there were losses for both groups. Fifth graders with 1 year of CSR showed lower gains in reading and larger gains in math than those with 0 years. CSR more significantly impacted the reading and language scores of 3rd grade English language learners with 3 years versus 1 year of CSR. (Contains 22 references.) (SM)",

The location 0-back task, compared to the color 0-back task, activated segregated areas in the frontal, parietal and occipital cortices whereas no differentially activated voxels were obtained when location and color 2-back tasks were directly contrasted. Several midline cortical areas were less active during 0- and 2-back task performance than resting state. The task-induced deactivation increased with task difficulty as demonstrated by larger deactivation during 2-back than 0-back tasks. The results suggest that, in 11-13-year-old children, the visual attentional network is differently recruited by spatial and nonspatial information processing, but the functional organization of cortical activation in WM in this age group is not based on the type of information processed. Furthermore, 11-13-year-old children exhibited a similar pattern of cortical deactivation that has been reported in adults during cognitive task performance compared to a resting state.

        "description":"Purpose: The \"Lombard effect\" describes the tendency for speakers to increase pitch, intensity, and duration in the presence of noise. It is unclear whether these modifications are uniformly applied across all words within an utterance or whether information-bearing content words are further enhanced compared with function words. In the present study, the authors investigated the influence of linguistic content on acoustic modifications made to speech in noise. Method: Sixteen speaker-listener pairs engaged in an interactive cooperative game in quiet, 60 dB of multitalker noise, and 90 dB of multitalker noise. Speaker productions were analyzed to examine differences in fundamental frequency (F[subscript 0]), intensity, and duration of target words in sentences across noise conditions. Results: Proportional increases in F[subscript 0], intensity, and duration were noted for all word types as noise increased from quiet to 60 dB. From quiet to 90 dB, content words that referred to agents, objects, and locations were disproportionately elongated compared with function words. Additionally, agents were further enhanced by increased F[subscript 0]. Conclusions: At moderate noise levels, most word types appear to be uniformly boosted in F[subscript 0], intensity, and duration. As noise increases, linguistic content shapes the extent of the Lombard effect, with F[subscript 0] and duration serving as primary cues for marking information-bearing word types.",

        "description":"The purpose of the present study is to investigate indifference management structural model in education system of Ardabil Province. The research method was integration study using Alli modeling. Statistical society of research was 420 assistant professors of educational science, managers, and deputies of Ardabil's second period of high schools that 383 individuals were selected by simple random sampling. The data collection tool was a researcher-made questionnaire. Face and content validity of the questionnaire was confirmed by experts and its Cronbach's alpha coefficient was obtained as of 0/80. In order to investigate hypotheses of research, obtained data were transferred to LISREL software to fit Alli model of structural equation and then were analyzed. The obtained findings of the statistical analysis showed that behavior and performance of manager indirectly has a meaningful impact on indifference management variable through employee's empowerment variables, job satisfaction of employee, organization's culture, organizational climate and employee's perception of the organization. Goodness of fit index (GFI) 0/92 and root mean square of residuals latent variables model was RMSEA = 0/045. Therefore, the model has a good fit and has a great ability to measure main variables of research.",

        "description":"One common modification to the Angoff standard-setting method is to have panelists round their ratings to the nearest 0.05 or 0.10 instead of 0.01. Several reasons have been offered as to why it may make sense to have panelists round their ratings to the nearest 0.05 or 0.10. In this article, we examine one reason that has been suggested, which is that even if panelists are given the opportunity to provide ratings to the nearest 0.01 they often round their ratings to the nearest 0.05 or 0.10 anyway. Using data from four standard settings, we show that in many cases ratings ended in a 0 or 5 when panelists were given the option of using a scale from 0 to 100 in one-point increments and that only about 9% of all ratings ended in a digit other than a 0 or 5. We also examined the impact of different rounding rules and we found that results were quite similar when using different rounding rules. Additional analyses showed the common phenomenon of panelists giving too high of ratings for hard items and too low of ratings for easy items in comparison to conditional p-values. It is suggested that rounding ratings to the nearest 0.05 or 0.10 represent reasonable alternatives to rounding ratings to the nearest 0.01.",

One-half of the subjects (Ss) at each age level were lower class black children; the remainder were middle class white children. A matrix completion task was used. A subject is presented with stimulus objects in the form of a 2x2 matrix with one cell  empty. A subject is to choose the object from a choice set that completes the matrix. Two practice matrices and five test matrices were employed. Familiar objects were used. Social class comparisons at each age level for the combined matrix forms indicated no significant difference at either the four-five or six-seven year levels. At the eight-nine year level lower class Ss performed significantly more poorly. There was a significant age by social class interaction effect. (JM)",

Clinical records from individuals targeted adolescent treatments were also examined. Results indicated that by age 25, 56.1 percent of adolescents and young adults had been arrested. Six percent had only juvenile records, 27 percent had only adult records, and 23 percent had both, with differences between males and females. A larger portion of males than females had both juvenile and adult records. The earliest age of arrest was 9 years. The hazard rates for first arrest revealed the maximum at age 17 for girls and age 18 for  boys. In boys, rates increased from ages 13 to 17, then declined after age 18 to a rate of 0 at age 22. In girls, first arrest risk was low until age 17, declined to 0 at age 20, rose again at age 22, and declined to 0 at age 24. Risk factors for juvenile and adult arrest included gender, length of stay in residential or day treatment, admission age, and adjudicated delinquency. (CR)",

This study analyzed the relationship between digital competencies, transformational leadership, and job performance of Peruvian university teachers. A predictive cross-sectional study was conducted with 201 teachers from a private university in Peru in three regions of the country (coast, highlands, and jungle). The Digital Competencies in Teaching (CDD), Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ 5X Short), and the Job Performance scale were used for data collection. The samples were analyzed with structural equation modeling and an adequate fit to the data was obtained ([chi-squared] = 194.342, p &lt; 0; [chi-squared]/df = 2.23, CFI = 0.952, TLI = 0.942, RMSEA = 0.078, SRMR = 0.061). In addition, both digital competencies ([beta] = 0.28, p &lt; 0) and transformational leadership ([beta] = 0.76, p &lt; 0) were found to be predictive factors of job performance. These findings provide evidence that digital competencies and transformational leadership were directly related to the job performance of university teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, it would be appropriate for educational leaders to consider these findings to enhance the digital competencies of teachers, promote a positive work environment, and support professional growth by stimulating motivation and job satisfaction during crisis situations.",

        "description":"Judith P. Hoyer Family Learning Centers, also known as Judy Centers, serve all children birth through kindergarten who live in designated Title I school zones. There are twenty-seven Judy Centers and three satellites throughout Maryland serving forty-four elementary school zones. The Kindergarten Readiness Assessment (KRA) is conducted in the beginning of the kindergarten year and reflects school readiness based on the new curricular standards. The KRA replaces the previous school readiness assessment, the Maryland Model of School Readiness (MMSR). Comprised of a range of selected-response, performance-task, and observational-rubric items, readiness is measured in four domains--Language and Literacy, Mathematics, Social Foundations, and Physical Well-Being and Motor Development--as well as a combined, or Composite, score. In the four domains, students are rated as Demonstrating Readiness or Not Yet Demonstrating Readiness. For the Composite score, students are rated as Demonstrating Readiness, Approaching Readiness, or Emerging Readiness. The purpose of this study is to examine whether entering kindergarteners who had received Judy Center services were better prepared for school compared to those who did not. Further, the study examines whether the Judy Center services ameliorate the school readiness gap for at-risk children. KRA scores were examined for two groups of children. The first group accessed Judy Center services, the second group did not. This sample included 2,090 students who accessed Judy Center services (referred to as JC-1 children, or the treatment group), and 1,317 who did not (referred to as JC-0 children, or the control group). One of the first findings of this study is that there was a higher proportion of Free and Reduced Price Meals Program (FARMS) students in the JC-1 sample than in either the JC-0 sample or Maryland population. The key take-away message from this is that the JC-1 sample presents a solid target group for further intervention. Additional efforts could be made to direct resources toward engaging this subgroup with additional Judy Center services. A second key finding is that JC-1 students scored higher on the KRA than JC-0 students. Primarily, it appears that Judy Center services have a positive relationship with students' KRA performance. As such, encouraging those students who have special needs to access Judy Center services in the year prior to kindergarten could affect their KRA performance. Further, expanding Judy Center implementation to areas that are in need of such services could further improve KRA performance. This study examined the proportion of kindergarten students who had one or more special needs (i.e. special education, English Language Learners, FARMS). The full Judy Center sample had a greater proportion of students with special needs than Maryland overall. This suggests that the current Judy Centers are well-placed to address the needs of Maryland's neediest children and families. In addition, JC-1 students with special needs out-performed JC-0 students with special needs on the KRA. This points toward the Judy Centers' success at addressing the needs of the most disadvantaged students. With regards to special education, this study found that, first, there is a very low prevalence of kindergartners receiving special education services (between 8 and 10%). Also, JC-1 special education students scored higher on the KRA Composite score than JC-0 special education students, but not on the Mathematics or Language and Literacy domains. This suggests that students with disabilities may need more than a single year of Judy Center services to address their needs. ELL students' scores, on the other hand, demonstrated that accessing Judy Center services was associated with demonstrating readiness. This finding indicates that Judy Center services are affecting outcomes quickly and effectively for ELL students. Finally, there were very notable differences between JC-0 and JC-1 scores among FARMS students, with JC-1 FARMS students regularly out-performing the JC-0 FARMS students. This suggests that Judy Center services are positively associated with students' performance and readiness."},

Play and stereotyped behaviors are juxtaposed on the same continuum by virtue of their possible opposite action in maintaining optimal stimulus input in an organism (0). Play generates large information loads by virtue of its elements of novely; stereotyped behavior generates minimal information either as a substitution for stressful stimulus input or a bacuum activity under conditions of perceptual deprivation. The adaptation of the 0 to a given level of  stimulus complexity requires an increasingly complex interaction with the environment to maintain the information flow and optimal arousal. (WY)",

        "author":["Inui, Miki"],
        "description":"In Lao People's Democratic Republic, two streams exist in pre-primary education, the standard three-year and a one-year preparatory class called 'Grade Zero system'. This research aims to investigate the introduction of the Grade 0 system, one-year pre-primary class, and its impact on ethnic minority children in rural villages of Lao PDR. The research methodology included qualitative research comprising interviews with villagers, school authorities, and an officer of the local education office and observations carried out at schools in rural villages. The results show Grade 0 has been introduced in accordance with the circumstances of attached primary schools; more specifically, small villages with incomplete schools offer Grade 0 because they can't possess three years pre-primary education. Moreover, Grade 0 plays an important role in the acquisition of Lao language when entering primary school. For instance, the repetition rate greatly improved due to the adequate preparation period. Grade 0 is an effective system in bridging the gap in primary schools, especially for minority children whose linguistic and cultural background is different from majority. As pre-primary education has finally been considered important, more international study projects will be essential, such as contemplating the construction of schools, teacher trainings, and bilingual education.",

An analysis of the data, which are presented on a series of graphs and tables, indicates that: (1) on an average, 21% of the students who enrolled in a course during the ten-year period withdrew or audited the course; (2) this average has varied between 16% (in 1972) to 24% (in 1978 and 1979); (3)  both high point enrollment and end of semester enrollment correlate positively with attrition rate; (4) among the curriculum areas, attrition rates varied from 0% to 50% during the semester; (5) no relationship was revealed between enrollment and attrition rates in the curriculum areas; (6) curriculum areas with very low attrition rates in 1980-81 were Stone Masonry (0%), Dental Hygiene (0%), Machinists (0%), Professional Growth (0%), and Plastering-Cement (1%); and (7) courses with especially high attrition rates in 1980-81 were in the areas of Arabic (52%), Assessment and Advisement (45%), Hebrew (40%), Italian (40%), and Accounting (36%).

Research has shown effects of such factors as the perceived masculinity/femininity of instruments and musician's personality but there are little background data on other factors. The present study had two major aims. The first aim was to gather some useful background data on musician's history of playing, looking at such things as number of instruments played and given up, number of main instruments, age of starting studying, and so on. The second was to examine some additional background factors and specific motives for choice, such as instrument availability and perceived need for players, in students studying music at post-secondary level. A total of 157 music students completed a questionnaire that asked about their musical history and about various background factors. The results show complex musical histories, and many varied and multiple motives for specialization.

Findings indicate that counting skills, inhibition, and updating are the most important predictors of the shape of the mental number line over and above age-related developmental differences, with number lines from 0 to 10 being linear to a large extent and number lines from 0 to 100 developing from a random pattern toward logarithmic representations.

Recent years have witnessed increasing interest in various test statistics and so-called fit indexes, most of which are actually based on or closely related to F[subscript 0], a measure of model fit in the population. This study aims to provide a systematic investigation about the performance of four available estimators of F[subscript 0]: a conventional estimator based on noncentral chi-square approximation; a newly proposed estimator that does not assume noncentral chi-square approximation; and two variations of the newly proposed estimator. A Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted to examine how these four estimators of F[subscript 0] perform across varying model misspecifications, data distributions, model sizes, and sample sizes. The results show that, under normality, all four quantities estimate F[subscript 0] equally well; and, under nonnormality, the three newly proposed estimators outperform the conventional estimator. Issues related to these findings are discussed.(Contains 6 tables.)",

The research question was: What do quality research studies identify as the components and/or characteristics of quality teacher education for the foundation phase programmes that allow new teachers to begin to teach for epistemological access. A search for systematic reviews on educational programmes related to foundation phase for initial teacher education was conducted for the period between 1980 and 2011. The researchers added Stage 0 as a fifth step to the traditional four-step systematic review process. Stage 0 or quasi-tertiary review allowed us to present substantive findings of the identified systematic reviews and to explore their methodological quality. From the initial 2876 hits (mostly health and medical studies), only 19 studies were related to the educational field. Only three of the 19 studies were finally accepted as eligible at Stage 0. None of the reviews directly addressed programme design but contained elements that were considered as useful when designing programmes. The present study makes it clear that there is a dearth of research on entire programmes related to initial teacher education for foundation phase teachers.",

        "description":"The increasing use of online pedagogy in higher education has revealed a need to analyze factors contributing to student engagement in online courses. Throughout the past decade, social media has been a growing influence in higher education. This quantitative cross-sectional study examined the attitudes of students and faculty towards computer technology and Twitter for educational use. Four research questions were formulated, and four null hypotheses were tested on differences between students and faculty, taken together. These were H[subscript 0]1, attitudes toward the use of computers for learning and student engagement; H[subscript 0]2, attitudes toward the use of Twitter for learning and student engagement; H[subscript 0]3, attitudes toward the use of computers for learning/engagement based on the number of courses taken online; H[subscript 0]4, attitudes toward Twitter for learning/engagement based on number of online courses taken. A total of 127 students and 50 faculty were administered the 30-item Attitude Toward Computer Technology for Educational Purposes Survey. The hypotheses were tested with the Mann-Whitney U and Jonckheere-Terpstra tests. For H[subscript 0]1, H[subscript 0]2, and H[subscript 0]4, no significant differences were found between students and faculty on the variables. For H[subscript 0]3, significant differences were found. Attitudes toward computers for educational purposes between students and faculty differed based on number of online courses taken (6-10 online courses, U = 950, p = 0.046; 10 or more online courses U = 1,396, p = 0.015). Implications for practice include administrators' sanction of social media for educational use and provision of professional development training for faculty, with follow-up and refresher workshops. For students, mandatory orientation courses and additional courses in the use of Twitter for education could be instituted. Student-faculty forums may help participants feel more at ease with social media use in education. Further research is recommended for quantitative studies, such as replication of the current study at other universities with larger samples, as well as separation of student and faculty survey responses. Qualitative studies could include interviews with students and faculty on reluctance to use technology and Twitter in education, and suggestions for overcoming barriers. Use of these tools can provide many pedagogical benefits for both university students and faculty. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

        "description":"The ability to distinguish between exact and inexact differentials is an important part of solving first-order differential equations of the form Adx + Bdy = 0, where A(x,y) [not equal to] 0 and B(x,y) [not equal to] 0 are functions of x and y However, although most undergraduate textbooks motivate the necessary condition for exactness, i.e. the requirement that aA/ay = aB/ax, simple proofs that this condition is sufficient are not always given. Here we demonstrate that the condition is sufficient using a novel proof by contradiction. Our approach is compared to other proofs existing in the literature, and considered in the context of personalized learning.",

Methods: Participants included 1792 students aged 10 to 16 years who were randomly selected across 9 data collection periods between 2012 and 2014. The Survey of Physical Activity and Nutrition was used to measure time spent in physical activity and sedentary behavior, and dietary intake and the dependent variable was the number of PACER laps achieved. The Kruskal-Wallis test and pairwise post hoc comparisons were conducted. Results: Only 0.95% (N = 17) participants met all 4 goals outlined within the 5-2-1-0 guidelines. Whereas 10.04% met 3 (N = 180), 41.63% met 2 (N = 746), 34.99% met 1 (N = 627), and 12.39% did not meet any goals (N = 222). Pairwise comparisons indicated there were significant differences: between groups not meeting any of the 5-2-1-0 goals and other groups (meeting one goal [p = 0.000], 2 goals [p = 0.000], 3 goals [p = 0.000], and all 4 [p = 0.008]). Conclusions: The positive relationship between PACER laps and adherence to the 5-2-1-0 goals suggests targeted and sequential behavioral changes may have positive implications on adolescents' cardiovascular fitness and body mass index.",

        "description":"Phonetically governed changes in the fundamental frequency (F[subscript 0]) of vowels that immediately precede and follow voiceless stop plosives have been found to follow consistent patterns in adults and children as young as four years of age. In the present study, F[subscript 0] onset and offset patterns in 14 children who stutter (CWS) and 14 children who do not stutter (CWNS) were investigated to evaluate differences in speech production. Participants produced utterances containing two VCV sequences. F[subscript 0] patterns in the last ten vocal cycles in the preceding vowel (voicing offset) and the first ten vocal cycles in the subsequent vowel (voicing onset) were analyzed. A repeated measures ANOVA revealed no group differences between the CWS and CWNS in either voicing onset or offset gestures. Both groups showed patterns of F[subscript 0] onset and offset that were consistent with the mature patterns seen in children and adults in previous studies. These findings suggest that in both CWS and CWNS, a mature pattern of voicing onset and offset is present by age 3;6. This study suggests that there is no difference between CWS and CWNS in the coordination of respiratory and laryngeal systems during voicing onset or offset. Educational objectives: The reader will be able to: (a) discuss the importance of investigating children who stutter close to the onset of stuttering; (b) describe the typical change in F[subscript 0] during voicing onset; (c) discuss the potential implications of these results with regard to future research.

        "description":"Preservice elementary school teachers' fragmented understanding of mathematics is widely documented in the research literature. Their understanding of division by 0 is no exception. This article reports on two teacher education tasks and experiences designed to challenge and extend preservice teachers' understanding of division by 0. These tasks asked preservice teachers to investigate division by 0 in the context of responding to students' erroneous mathematical ideas and were respectively structured so that the question  was investigated through discussion with peers and through independent investigation. Results revealed that preservice teachers gained new mathematical (what the answer is and why it is so) and pedagogical (how they might explain it to students) insights through both experiences. However, the quality of these insights were related to the participants' disposition to justly their thinking and (or) to investigate mathematics they did not understand. The study's results highlight the value of using teacher learning \"tasks that  situate mathematical inquiry in teaching practice but also highlight the challenge for teacher educators to design experiences that help preservice teachers see the importance of, and develop the tools\" and inclination for, mathematical inquiry that is needed for teaching  mathematics with understanding. Today we showed our elementary preservice teachers a video where an interviewer was asking young students what the answer to 5 / 0 was. The    students in the video consistently responded that the answer was 0, and when asked how they knew this, many responded: \"my teacher taught me.\" (Contains 3 tables.)",

The purpose of this basic qualitative study was to explore Danish 0-9 school leader perceptions and experiences of the role of school leadership during the shift from face-to-face to online learning during the 2020-2021 COVID-19 pandemic as guided by the seven fields of school leadership. Edmondson's psychological safety theory offered a framework for this study. Twelve Danish 0-9 school leaders participated in semi-structured interviews, including three top leaders, three principals, three vice principals, and three teachers who managed collaboration or cooperation of teacher groups during the school lockdowns. Results of inductive coding indicated the lack of a guiding model to support leaders during the crisis, and the value of interpersonal interaction in support of well-being and productive outcomes. Recommendations emphasize leadership engagement on teaching and collaboration. Findings may guide Danish 0-9 school leadership support during periods of institutional change and may endorse an alignment of school leadership competencies.

Method: Three materially linear and 3 materially nonlinear models were created and stretched up to 10 mm in 1-mm increments. Phonation onset pressure (P[subscript on]) and F[subscript 0] at P[subscript on] were recorded for each length. Measurements were repeated as the models were relaxed in 1-mm increments back to their resting lengths, and tensile tests were conducted to determine the stress-strain responses of linear versus nonlinear models. Results: Nonlinear models demonstrated a more substantial frequency response than did linear models and a more predictable pattern of F[subscript 0] increase with respect to increasing length (although range was inconsistent across models). P[subscript on] generally increased with increasing vocal fold length for nonlinear models, whereas for linear models, P[subscript on] decreased with increasing length. Conclusion: Nonlinear synthetic models appear to more accurately represent the human vocal folds than do linear models, especially with respect to F[subscript 0] response.",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to conduct an acoustic examination of the obstruent stops produced by Korean-English bilingual children in connection with the question of whether bilinguals establish distinct categories of speech sounds across languages. Stop productions were obtained from ninety children in two age ranges, five and ten years: thirty Korean-English bilinguals, thirty monolingual Koreans and thirty monolingual English speakers. Voice-Onset-Time (VOT) lag at word-initial stop and fundamental frequency (f[subscript 0]) in the following vowel (hereafter vowel-onset f[subscript 0]) were measured. The bilingual children showed different patterns of VOT in comparison to both English and Korean monolinguals, with longer VOT in their production of Korean stop consonants and shorter VOT for English. Moreover, the ten-year-old bilinguals distinguished all stop categories using both VOT and vowel-onset f[subscript 0], whereas the five-year-olds tended to make stop distinctions based on VOT but not vowel-onset f[subscript 0]. The results of this study suggest that bilingual children at around five years of age do not yet have fully separate stop systems, and that the systems continue to evolve during the developmental period.",

Eighty 4- and 5-year-olds at risk for school failure were randomly assigned to (a) structured discovery of the n+0/0+n=n pattern and the n+1/1+n = the number after n relation; (b) structured discovery with explicit instruction; (c) blocked practice of (zero, one, and number-after) items; and (d) haphazard practice. Analyses with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test of follow-up Test of Early Mathematics Ability-Third Edition and mental-arithmetic testing indicated that general achievement and fluency with n+0/0+n combinations improved significantly. Significant improvement for n+1/1+n combinations was evident only if success included slow or counted answers.

        "description":"In the target article, Xing and colleagues (2021) claimed that 6- to 8-year-olds who spontaneously referenced the midpoint of 0-100 number lines made more accurate magnitude estimates and scored higher on a standardized math achievement test than other children. Unlike previous studies, however, the authors found no relation between accuracy on the number line estimation task and a dot discrimination task used to assess the Approximate Number System (ANS). These findings, the authors claim, constitute evidence against the idea that children's numerical magnitude understanding entails representational change. We disagree. In the literature on the development of numerical magnitude understanding, the &quot;gold standard&quot; assessment is the number-line estimation task (Schneider et al., 2018, Siegler and Opfer, 2003, Siegler et al., 2009). Unlike numerical comparisons (&quot;Which is larger--N1 or N2?&quot;) or numerical orderings (&quot;Can you put N1, N2, and N3 in order from smallest to largest?&quot;), number-line estimates tell us how much larger the person understands the numbers to be. For example, when placing 15 on a 0-100 number line, the child's estimate tells us how large they think 15 is in comparison to 0 and 100. Proponents of the representational change approach (e.g., Opfer et al., 2011, Siegler and Opfer, 2003) argue that number-line estimation reflects understanding of how numerical magnitudes relate to one another. In contrast, proponents of the proportion judgment approach (e.g., Barth &amp; Paladino, 2011; Slusser, Santiago, &amp; Barth, 2013) argue that number-line estimation performance reflects children's ability to place estimates on a number line relative to the 0 endpoint (i.e., unbounded model)1, the 0 and right-most endpoint (i.e., 1-cycle model), or the endpoints and the midpoint of the number line (i.e., 2-cycle model). Proponents of both approaches agree that estimates improve over the course of development, becoming less variable and more accurate. However, they disagree on how best to interpret patterns of data arising from number-line estimation. Are young children's estimates best fit by a mixed log-linear model (representational change approach; Opfer, Thompson, &amp; Kim, 2016; Kim and Opfer, 2017, Kim and Opfer, 2020) or one of several cyclical power functions (proportion judgment approach; Barth &amp; Paladino, 2011; Slusser et al., 2013) when model complexity (e.g., number of free parameters) is taken into consideration? In this rebuttal to Xing et al.'s target article, Numerical estimation strategies are correlated with math ability in school-age children, we argue that: 1. Number-line estimates reflect numerical magnitude representations, some task-specific features, and strategic behavior. 2. Proportional reasoning and representational change accounts must be compared head-to-head. 3. Whole numbers are ratios, too. Therefore, research on fractions can clarify mechanisms of developmental change in number-line estimation. [This paper was published in &quot;Cognitive Development&quot; v62 2022.]",

To obtain data, a sample of 100 institutions was selected from the 698 regionally accredited junior colleges. Percentage representation in the sample was based on the number of accredited junior colleges in a state compared with the number of all states. Larger institutions were purposely over-represented (subsequent data analysis indicated no significant relationship between institutional enrollment and its academic policy on this matter). Under these conditions, 100 institutions were randomly selected and mailed a policy and attitude questionnaire. A response rate of 97 per cent was achieved.  Analysis of study data indicated that: (1) 17 per cent of the junior colleges in the sample had eliminated academic dismissal and/or failing grades, while 26 per cent were considering it; (2) percentage distribution by region of institutions accepting or considering this policy was: Far West (33 per cent/33 per cent), Southwest (0 per cent/33 per cent), Rocky Mountain (60 per cent/50 per cent), Plains (43 per cent/25 per cent), Great Lakes (8 per cent/40 per cent), Southeast (12 per cent/28 per cent), Mideast (0 per cent/20 per cent), and New England (0 per cent/43 per cent); and (3) extending sample results to accredited junior colleges nationwide indicated that between 33 per cent and 50 per cent have either abolished or are considering abolishment of academic dismissal and/or failing  grades as an academic policy.

        "description":"This paper examines the impact on small rural school districts of school choice programs available in Minnesota. An opening section traces the history of school choice in Minnesota since 1983, focusing on two programs enacted in 1990: enrollment options (EO), which allows students to attend any public school without cost, and postsecondary enrollment options (PSEO), which allows academically qualified 11th- and 12th-graders to enroll full- or part-time in state public or private postsecondary institutions. In both programs, state aid follows the student to the institution selected. Program impact was investigated in 17 contiguous small rural districts in southern Minnesota. Data consisted of interviews with superintendents and principals, financial and enrollment figures,  information from postsecondary institutions, and local newspaper articles. In 1990-91, the 17 districts had enrollments of 271-958 students. Student participation was not high in either plan. Under PSEO, 3.7 percent of eligible students participated, compared to 5 percent statewide. District participation ranged from 0 to 18 students and was related to proximity to a postsecondary institution. EO participation of districts involved 0-45 entering students and 0-45 departing students. Most administrators had doubts about choice programs but only four had a completely negative attitude. For districts losing students, the threat of school closure and consolidation was a great concern. Also discussed are parents' and students' apparent reasons for participation in the programs, interdistrict  tensions due to competition and &quot;advertising,&quot; and shifts in power relations between parents and professional educators.

However, recent meta-analysis identified very few studies in developing countries. The authors report on the evaluation impact of a low-cost, community-based parent training program for early child development (ECD) implemented in four states across Mexico. This research study explored: (1) The impact of this low-cost, parent-focused ECD program on the physical, cognitive, and socio-emotional development of children 0-4 years?; (2) The impact of the program on the knowledge and behaviors of parents of children 0-4?; and (3) The differential impact of the program in communities with other significant ECD initiatives? The program, implemented by the government, provided out-of-school training for parents and caregivers of children aged 0-4, to improve their competencies and practices in caring for children and contribute to the children's comprehensive development and school readiness. The results showed participating children had higher scores in all five areas of child development. Also the low-cost, community-based parenting program for parents of young children had significant impacts both on child development and on observed parent behavior. Because parent behaviors affect child development throughout the development process, these changes have a particular potential to translate into long-term, sustained gains in child development.",

        "description":"Although statistical practices to evaluate intervention effects in SCEDs have gained prominence in the recent times, models are yet to incorporate and investigate all their analytic complexities. Most of these statistical models incorporate slopes and autocorrelations both of which contribute to trend in the data. The question that arises is whether in SCED data that show trend, there is indeterminacy between estimating slope and autocorrelation because both contribute to trend and the data have limited number of observations. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we compared the performance of four Bayesian change-point models: (a) intercepts only (IO), (b) slopes but no autocorrelations (SI), (c) autocorrelations but no slopes (NS), and (d) both autocorrelations and slopes (SA). Weakly informative priors were used to remain agnostic about the parameters. Coverage rates showed that for the SA model either the slope effect size or the autocorrelation credible interval almost always erroneously contained 0 and the Type II errors were prohibitively large. Considering the 0-coverage and coverage rates of slope effect size, intercept effect size, mean relative bias, and second phase intercept relative bias, the SI model outperformed all other models. Therefore, it is recommended that researchers favour the SI model over the other three models. Research studies that develop slope effect sizes for SCEDs should consider the performance of the statistic by taking into account coverage and 0-coverage rates. These helped uncover patterns that were not realized in other simulation studies. We underline the need for investigating the use of informative priors in SCEDs.

To determine how well test objectives matched the curriculum, their teachers estimated how many of the four items per objective a randomly selected student would answer correctly. Because chi square test comparisons of teacher estimates with actual responses were statistically questionable, a probability model was applied instead. The probability of obtaining 0, 1-2, or 3-4 correct answers by chance alone for the four items per objective was calculated, to obtain a validity coefficient. Results were presented by a 3 by 3 contingency table. Two applications of the model yielded validity coefficients of .78 and .98. An objective was considered invalid only when a  large number of teachers predicted 0-1 correct and many students achieved at that level. (CP)",

High expectancy led to both more favorable attitudes toward the toy and increased persistence at an isoluble task to win the toy, suggesting that in some situations dissonance theory may be more appropriate than achievement motivation theory in understanding how expectancy affects attitudes and motivated behavior. Compared to 0 commercials, one commercial produced a more favorable attitude and increased persistence at the task. There was no significant difference  between the effects of 1 and 3 commercials. Lack of interaction suggested that expectancy and value may be additive rather than multiplicative. (Author/GO)",

Several classes of images of the limit concept have been identified and described, according to their main foci: neighborhoods, graph approaching, values approaching, being defined at x[subscript 0], limit of f atx[subscript 0] equals f(x[subscript 0]), and algorithms.",

Spontaneous vocalizations of twenty-four infants aged 0;7 to 1;6 were recorded in 45-minute sessions. The speech production of twenty-four caregivers was also audio-recorded during caregiver-infant natural daily interactions at home. All recordings were transcribed using broad prosodic patterns. Analysis revealed four major findings: (1) falling f[subscript 0] contours were more prominently produced than level and rising contours; (2) high prosodic patterns occurred more frequently than mid and low prosodic patterns; (3) these distribution patterns of f[subscript 0] contours showed significant similarities in babbling and early words; and (4) these distribution patterns were also similar in infants' and their caregivers' data.",

Participants produced isometric force to targets with predictable demands (constant and sinusoidal) and 1/f noise waveforms (white, pink, brown, and black) that also varied in the frequency bandwidth represented in the force signal (0-4 Hz, 0-8 Hz, and 0-12 Hz). The range of within-trial 1/f force dynamics produced was between darker than pink noise and lighter than black noise according to task conditions. The exponent of the respective 1/f force dynamics decreased as the frequency bandwidth of the force signal increased. The findings reveal an adaptive though restricted range of 1/f force variation that is modulated by the dynamics of the task constraints. (Contains 6 figures.)",

This study evaluated the benefit of clear speech in school-age children and adults with normal hearing for speech-in-noise and speech-in-speech recognition. Method: Masked sentence recognition thresholds were estimated for school-age children and adults using an adaptive procedure. In Experiment 1, the target and masker were summed and presented over a loudspeaker located directly in front of the listener. The masker was either speech-shaped noise or two-talker speech, and target sentences were produced using a clear or conversational speaking style. In Experiment 2, stimuli were presented over headphones. The two-talker speech masker was diotic (M[subscript 0]). Clear and conversational target sentences were presented either in-phase (T[subscript 0]) or out-of-phase (T[subscript [pi]]) between the two ears. The M[subscript 0]T[subscript [pi]] condition introduces a segregation cue that was expected to improve performance. Results: For speech presented over a single loudspeaker (Experiment 1), the clear-speech benefit was independent of age for the noise masker, but it increased with age for the two-talker masker. Similar age effects for the two-talker speech masker were seen under headphones with diotic presentation (M[subscript 0]T[subscript 0]), but comparable clear-speech benefit as a function of age was observed with a binaural cue to facilitate segregation (M[subscript 0]T[subscript [pi]]). Conclusions: Consistent with prior research, children showed a robust clear-speech benefit for speech-in-noise recognition. Immaturity in the ability to segregate target from masker speech may limit young children's ability to benefit from clear-speech modifications for speech-in-speech recognition under some conditions. When provided with a cue that facilitates segregation, children as young as 4-7 years of age derived a clear-speech benefit in a two-talker masker that was similar to the benefit experienced by adults.",

In this note, the case in which the equation has a forcing term on the right-hand side is considered. This forcing term is selected in such a manner that, given appropriate initial conditions, a particular solution will result that matches a finite portion of the infinite series homogenous solution, and at the same time, annihilates this infinite series homogeneous solution. The result of these initial conditions and this right-hand side is a solution that is a polynomial. The results obtained apply to the classical equations of Hermite, Legendre and Chebyshev with appropriate forcing terms and initial conditions.",

Results: A significant, independent association was found between the number and magnitude of febrile episodes during the 0 to 4 years and the probability of a later diagnosis of ADHD. Children who never had a measured temperature &gt;37.5°C had a significantly lower rate of ADHD (OR = 0.834, 95% CI [0.802, 0.866], p &lt; 0.0001).

        "author":["Richard A. Gayle"],
        "description":"In 2013, roughly 7% of college graduates under 25 could not find employment, and about 37% were underemployed. Public university tuition costs increased by 42% between 1999 and 2012, and 71% of college graduates have an average of $29,400 in outstanding student debt. Employers for several decades have complained about how higher educational institutions have failed to deliver graduates with developed nontechnical skills comprising (a) work ethic, (b) communication, (c) organization, (d) problem solving, and (e) teamwork. The purpose of this qualitative archival study was to assess and explore integrating the nontechnical skills that businesses require to hire graduates immediately after graduation. The samples were from 24 public and 24 private nonprofit 4-year business school curricular programs selected from 12 states within three of the six regional accrediting commissions in the United States. The research question focused on how education contributes to increased skills, productivity, and earnings, applying the human capital theory as the conceptual framework. Data gathering involved public access curriculum publications and digital advertisements. Finding 25 showed soft skills (6%), nontechnical (2%), and work ethic (0%) results for all regions. Finding 26 Region 1 showed soft skills (0%) and nontechnical (0%) results. Finding 27 Region 2 showed soft skills (6%) and nontechnical (0%) results. Finding 28 Region 3 showed soft skills (6%) and nontechnical (0%) results. Therefore, 4-year business schools did not prioritize soft and nontechnical skills with decades of complaints. The results of this research may contribute to positive social change by encouraging curriculum developers to restructure business schools' curriculum development.

The five- and four-factor model yielded acceptable fit to the data. Information-theory-based indices of relative fit (i.e., AIC[subscript 0], BCC[subscript 0], and BIC[subscript 0]) indicated that the TEES-T four-factor model yielded superior fit to either the five-factor or one-factor models.

        "description":"The call for more &quot;brave&quot; male early years practitioners and primary classroom teachers remains prevalent as boys' underachievement continues to dominate education agendas. There is a recognised need, backed by government policy and public discourse in England, for more men to work in settings and schools (0-11) and act as &quot;role models&quot;. This article reports on the complexities of this as a term by presenting select findings from the author's doctoral research. Through an investigation into the thoughts and perceptions of men who actively work with children in the 0-8 sector, research findings suggest that there is a general lack of clarity with regard to how the 'role model' is actually defined. The significance of this will be considered.",

The diagnostic classification for children 0-5 (DC: 0-5) affords a wider range of diagnoses that allowed for inferences of clinician certainty of diagnosis. Use of full criteria diagnoses was significantly lower from telehealth evaluations during the pandemic, and was less certain for younger children, some non-English speakers, and children reporting Native American/Alaska Native race. Higher Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) ASD subscale scores, lower CBCL total scores, and global developmental delay diagnoses predicted greater use of full ASD diagnoses.

Second, third, sixth graders, and adults (Experiment 1: N = 96, mean ages = 7.9, 9.23, 12.06, and 19.96 years, respectively) made number line estimates across 3 scales (0-1,000, 0-10,000, and 0-100,000). Generation of linear estimates increased with age but decreased with numerical scale. Therefore, the authors hypothesized highlighting commonalities between small and large scales (15:100::1500:10000) might prompt children to generalize their linear representations to ever-larger scales. Experiment 2 assigned second graders (N = 46, mean age = 7.78 years) to experimental groups differing in how commonalities of small and large numerical scales were highlighted. Only children experiencing progressive alignment of small and large scales successfully produced linear estimates on increasingly larger scales, suggesting analogies between numeric scales elicit broad generalization of linear representations.",

In this article, the author would like to take the opportunity to mount a defence in favour of the much maligned 1-100 square. His main criticism of the 0-99 square (apart from the linguistic and logical difficulty of having a 100 square that only goes as far as 99) is that it does not support the development of a particularly important concept in number understanding for young learners, namely, the relationship between cardinal and ordinal numbers. If children are going to make sense of number lines to the extent that they become confident with empty number lines they need to understand this relationship. He feels very strongly that the 0-99 square actually prevents children from making this important connection.",

          "Jacob, Valentina"],
        "description":"Background: Children who have reached the age of 2 years without having acquired a 50-word vocabulary and/or who use no word combinations are referred to in the literature as \"Late Talkers\". Research has not yet identified the factors that cause slow development of expressive language; in particular, relatively little research has been carried out on the  characteristics of the maternal linguistic input received by Late Talkers. In fact, the majority of studies in this area have focused principally on the mothers' semantic, pragmatic and interactive verbal behaviour. Aims: The objective was to verify whether the input addressed to a group of Late Talkers differs to that addressed to a group of typically developing peers. It was expected that there would be differences in the prosodic and structural/lexical properties of the input, which by creating a \"less than optimal environment\" for language acquisition processes, could affect the children's rate of linguistic development. Methods & Procedures: The spontaneous maternal speech of nine Italian-speaking mothers of late-talking toddlers (LT) at 20 months of age was examined and compared with that of nine mothers of age-matched children with typical language development (Late Starters). Data were collected during video-recorded play sessions, which were transcribed and coded based on the structural-lexical and acoustical characteristics of the mothers' speech. Group differences were tested for the following variables: number of utterances per minute, mean number of words per utterance (MLUw), number of nouns per minute, number of different nouns per minute, common nouns as a percentage of overall words, type/token ratio for common nouns, one-word utterances as a percentage of the total number of utterances, one-word utterances formed by a common noun as a percentage of the total number of utterances, mean syllable duration, duration of the final syllable of the utterance, F[0] maximum (the highest F[0] in the utterance), F[0] minimum (the lowest F[0] in the utterance) and F[0] range (by subtracting F[0 min] from F[0 max]). Outcomes & Results: The mothers of LT produced common nouns and mark nouns by a pitch peak with a significantly lower frequency than the mothers of the children with typical language development. The mothers of LT also used flat pitch contours more often than the mothers of the typically developing peers. Conclusions: The study provides evidence that maternal input addressed to Late Talkers can contribute to slowing the process of language acquisition. Based on these findings, additional investigations that examine the contribution of maternal verbal behaviour to the development of language delay are warranted.",

It makes it possible to differentiate schools with an &quot;inclusionary profile,&quot; (SIEE&gt;0), from those with an &quot;exclusionary profile,&quot; (SIEE&lt;0), depending on whether or not the school fosters educational inclusion, and therefore promoting social equity. I have analyzed 272 schools (N=11,732 students) of five urban contexts in Brazil and found behaviors markedly different for the two learning subjects; reading and mathematics, the mean SIEE yielding positive and negative values, respectively. I argue that the SIEE concept is relevant for the analysis of educational effectiveness and should be considered as such by educational researchers and policymakers.",

A review of the literature on PBL explored the pedagogy of play and the importance of the teacher within this learning environment. Through an anonymous online questionnaire, teachers of students in Years 0 to 2 who are currently implementing PBL, shared their experiences of the barriers and enablers towards the successful implementation of PBL. The research results highlighted that there is a need for sustained professional development on the implementation of PBL and the establishment of a mentoring partnership to further develop the competence and confidence of teachers working within a PBL environment.",

The project is a 2 semester program to train professional educators in the competencies that will enable them to work with handicapped children from birth to 6 years of age in a variety of service delivery settings, and employs faculty from five academic fields important to the education of young handicapped children: special education, elementary education, home economics, physical education, and psychology. Three issues are addressed by the program: state personnel needs, teacher preparation needs, and  handicapped children's needs. Participation based, the program provides the opportunity for the immediate testing and validation of theoretical constructs. Preliminary data indicate that the described model is providing project graduates the necessary skills to be effective teachers of young handicapped children. (DLS)",

        "description":"The use of characteristic coding (dummy coding) is made in showing solutions to four multivariate problems using canonical analysis. The canonical variates can be themselves analyzed by the use of multiple linear regression. When the canonical variates are used as criteria in a multiple linear regression, the R2 values are equal to 0, where 0 is the squared canonical correlation coefficient. Several different methods exist for testing multivariate hypotheses. Where the interest is in a two-way disproportionate multivariate analysis of variance, the trace criterion seems particularly applicable. Characteristic (dummy) coding has been used in multiple linear regression to analyze univariate analysis of variance problems; the same coding scheme can be extended to multiple criteria.  While the resulting data are analyzed through canonical analysis, the design matrix conforms to the usual multiple linear regression design matrices. Thus, the utilization of multiple criteria can be pursued in a logical sequence without necessitating continuosly changing the entire terminology. (Author/RC)",

The four groups of kindergarten children varied the number of periods of PPE per week which then met--0, 1, 2, and 3 times per week. The four groups of first-grade children varied the amount of time per period for the PPE program--0, 20, 30, and 40 minutes per period twice a week. After 15 weeks, each of the three first-grade PPE groups was found to be significantly better than the control group in perceptual-motor ability. A significant linear trend in the data was also found. No significant differences were found among the first-grade groups in academic ability. There were also no significant  differences among the kindergarten groups in either perceptual-motor ability or academic ability. (Author)",

The analysis showed that the variables which contributed most to discriminating between successes and failures were cumulative Miami-Dade GPA, Florida Twelfth Grade total score, FTG math score, and whether the student had made a career choice or not. A second discriminant analysis showed that the best prediction resulted from the  use of cumulative GPA as a single factor.

Several scores were compared, as follows: Scores obtained from cross-validated Guttman weights; Scores obtained by rounding the Guttman weights to one digit, ranging from 0 to 8; Scores obtained by approximating the Guttman weights by weights of 0, 1, and 2; Scores obtained by weighting a right answer 2, and a wrong answer 1; Scores obtained by weighting a right answer 1, and a wrong answer -- 1/4; Number right; Number wrong; and Number omitted. The reliabilities and intercorrelations of these scores are shown in tabular form. It is concluded that most of the advantages of Guttman weights come from weighting&quot;omits&quot; less than &quot;wrong&quot; answers. Because instructions in common use encourage people to omit items on a test, Guttman weighting is not recommended since with these weights the best strategy is to guess. (DB)",

Results of three experiments indicated that the more linear children's magnitude representations were, the more closely their memory of the numbers approximated the numbers presented. This relation was present for preschoolers and second graders, for children from low-income and middle-income backgrounds, for the ranges 0 through 20 and 0 through 1,000, and for four different tasks (number line, measurement, numerosity, and categorization) measuring numerical-magnitude representations. Other types of numerical knowledge--numeral identification and counting--were unrelated to recall of the same numerical information. The results also indicated that children's representations vary from trial to trial with the numbers they need to represent and remember and that general strategy-choice mechanisms may operate in selection of numerical representations, as in other domains.

        "description":"This study examined whether mean vocal fundamental frequency (\"F\"[subscript 0]) or speech sound pressure level (SPL) varies with changes in syllable repetition rate. Twenty-four young adults (12 M and 12 F) repeated the syllables/p[inverted v]/,/p[inverted v]t[schwa]/, and/p[inverted v]t[schwa]k[schwa]/at a modeled \"slow\" rate of approximately one syllable per second, at a self-selected \"comfortable\" rate, and at their maximum rate. For both male and female subjects there was a significant increase in \"F\"[subscript 0], but not SPL, between the \"slow\" and \"maximal\" and between the \"comfortable\" and \"maximal\" repetition rates. Conversely, there was no significant difference in mean \"F\"[subscript 0] associated with syllable type, whereas significant SPL differences were most likely due to differences in plosive aspiration, syllable stress, and juncture between the mono-, bi-, and tri-syllabic sequences. These results suggest that there is a laryngeal adjustment that attends an increase in speech rate, lending additional support for speech and voice treatment strategies that employ rate modification techniques. Learning outcomes: The reader will be able to: (1) outline the advantages and disadvantages of using a syllable-repetition task to evaluate speech rate; (2) describe how vocal \"F\"[subscript 0] and speech SPL are affected by changes in speech rate; and (3) describe the clinical and theoretical implications of the results from this study.

This study examined personality traits among 41 adolescents receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) during participation in a School Refusal Program in the Netherlands. Traits were examined via clinical scales and 2-point code types derived from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory--Adolescent. The influence of personality traits on treatment outcome was examined at post-treatment and 1-year follow-up. At pretreatment, eight of the 10 clinical scales were disproportionately skewed toward the &quot;high to very high&quot; range relative to a norm group. Social introversion and depressive symptomatology were significantly increased relative to the norm group, and nearly one-half of the adolescents were characterized by code type 2-3/3-2 (depression/hysteria) or 2-0/0-2 (depression/social introversion). Adolescents characterized by a 2-0/0-2 code type were almost twice as likely (odds ratio = 1.78) to be treatment responders at post-treatment. There was no relation between personality traits and treatment outcome at follow-up. The small sample size limits generalization of the study's findings. If the results are replicated, personality traits may provide useful indications for personalizing treatment when employing interventions recommended in CBT manuals for SR.",

Method: The target population of the study consisted of mothers with a child aged 0-5 years who were admitted to pediatrics ward of A County Hospital. The sample size was determined as 305 subjects by power analysis. Overall, 340 mothers were recruited. The data sheet developed by researchers and a questionnaire on parental attitudes about home accidents developed by Yalaki et al. were used for data collection. Before data collection, verbal consent was obtained from mothers. The study was approved by local Ethics Committee. Data were analyzed by using Kruskal-Wallis test, t test and chi-square test. Results: Mean age was 30.11 ± 5.8 years among mothers included. A significant association was detected between experiencing home accident and maternal age, maternal education level, number of child, number of person in the family and income of family (p&lt;0.05). In this study, it was found that wrong attitudes and behaviors were more common among mothers of children experienced home accident (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions: It was found that there is a significant association between home accident and maternal age, maternal education level, number of child, number of person in the family, residence and income level. In addition, it was found that mother of &quot;children&quot; experience home accident have inappropriate attitudes and behaviors regarding prevention of home accidents and that education is an important factor in prevention of home accidents.",

        "description":"This dissertation examines complementizer agreement (CA) phenomena in which phi-features appear on a complementizer, clause-linking marker, or otherwise, syntactically speaking, at the C[superscript 0] position. This dissertation will argue that CA is in fact a straightforward output of the syntax module under standard Minimalist assumptions, and that the analysis of CA requires that we simplify rather than complicate our understanding of the probe-goal relationship. CA may be the result of a uphi-probe at C[superscript 0] acting alone, agreeing with a closest goal in situ. More common are cases where CA in relative clauses results from the combination of Agree and movement into specC. An independent phi-probe at C[superscript 0] is both synchronically necessary, and also to be diachronically expected given the source constructions. I argue that the goals available for probes at C[superscript 0] are fed into the closest goal position by the lower structure and that argument structure--e.g., the placement and feature checking of subjects and objects--and information structure--e.g., the raising of Topics--may feed arguments and their phi-features into the path of C[superscript 0]'s probes and yield CA. Cross-linguistic differences in the ability of non-subjects to agree at C follow straightforwardly from differences in the reusability of phi-features in different languages (cf. Carstens 2003). Diachronically, having uphi probe at C[superscript 0] is the natural output of syntactic directionality (as argued for by, e.g., van Gelderen 2009). phi-features of source constructions influence the phi-features found in their descendants; upward- (Bantu) and downward- (Germanic) agreeing CA are the outputs of different diachronic developments. One has its source in the inherent phi-features of a pronoun (goal reanalyzed as probe), while the other is a reanalysis of a verb as a complementizer (T-to-C reanalysis). I propose that CA--while typologically exotic--is syntactically normal. Accounting for CA with a normal Agree relation solves several theoretical issues for the C-T relationship and provides valuable insight into the nature of probes and the behavior of Agree.

        "description":"Background and Context: In 2016, our team designed and implemented a cluster-randomized trial of a school-based empowerment training program, targeting adolescent girls in Nairobi, Kenya (Baiocchi et al., 2019; Rosenman et al., 2020). In that study, the primary outcome was the experience of sexual violence in the prior year. Participants disclosed their data via self-report in surveys. Despite the considerable size of the study (4,000 girls across nearly 100 schools over two years), we obtained a null result. When discussing our findings with stakeholders, a consistent point of contention was how to reason about the possibility of misreporting bias. Inaccurate reports provided by girls in the study -- e.g. due to hesitancy around disclosure of a traumatic experience -- were plausible (and understandable), but posed a challenge for causal inference. We lacked a coherent framework for characterizing the bias induced by misreporting, and for correcting experimental designs in future studies. Research Question: We consider statistical methods to address the problem of designing and analyzing a prospective randomized trial in which the outcome data will be self-reported and will involve sensitive topics. Our questions are twofold. First, if a (non-random) subset of participants in a study can be expected to misreport the outcome, how does that affect the bias and variance of the resulting causal estimate? Second, if we anticipate a certain amount of misreporting in the study, can we alter our experimental design to achieve a desired level of power, even in the presence of misreporting? Findings/Results: Our framework centers on two parallel characterizations of individuals in the super-population from which the study is drawn. For a given measurement instrument and intervention, we assume each individual is a member of one &quot;reporting class&quot;: a True-reporter, False-reporter, Never-reporter, or Always-reporter. True-reporters always report their outcome accurately; false-reporters always report their outcome as 1 if it is truly 0, and vice versa. Never-reporters always report a 0 and Always-reporters always report a 1. Because the outcome is binary, each individual also falls into one of four &quot;response classes&quot; (Hernán and Robins, 2010), based on the value of their potential outcomes. These response classes are termed the &quot;Increase&quot; (Y(0) = 0, Y(1) = 1), &quot;Decrease&quot; (Y(0) = 1, Y(1) = 0), &quot;Predisposed&quot; (Y(0) = Y(1) = 1) and &quot;Unsusceptible&quot; (Y(0) = Y(1) = 0) classes. We show that it is the joint distribution of reporting classes and response classes in the super-population that precisely characterizes the bias and variance of a standard causal estimate. This result exposes some subtle challenges in analyzing studies with misreporting bias. Contrary to an oft-cited heuristic, non-differential measurement error does not necessarily induce bias toward the null. Moreover, researchers need to consider whether individuals who are responsive to the treatment (those in the Decrease or Increase class) may be disproportionately likely to be Never-reporters or Always-reporters. Such results could easily emerge when considering studies in vulnerable populations. For example, in our Kenya study, it may be that girls most likely to benefit from the empowerment training program may also be the most disinclined to report an experience of sexual violence if they do not receive the training, e.g. due to feelings of shame. We conclude by proposing a novel procedure for determining adequate sample sizes under the worst-case power corresponding to a given level of misreporting. Our procedure is based in convex optimization: we show that the worst-case power under a posited confounding structure reduces to a quadratic fractional programming problem. We suggest a two-stage process for designing experiments surveying sensitive topics. First, we suggest a pilot study be used to ascertain key parameters about the frequency of misreporting. Next, we recommend researchers use our optimization procedure to design a larger experiment that is sufficiently powered in the presence of misreporting bias."},

        "description":"Purpose: Growing evidence supports the inclusion of perceptual tests that quantify the processing of temporal fine structure (TFS) in clinical hearing assessment. Many tasks have been used to evaluate TFS in the laboratory that vary greatly in the stimuli used and whether the judgments require monaural or binaural comparisons of TFS. The purpose of this study was to compare laboratory measures of TFS for inclusion in a battery of suprathreshold auditory tests. A subset of available TFS tasks were selected on the basis of potential clinical utility and were evaluated using metrics that focus on characteristics important for clinical use. Method: TFS measures were implemented in replication of studies that demonstrated clinical utility. Monaural, diotic, and dichotic measures were evaluated in 11 young listeners with normal hearing. Measures included frequency modulation (FM) tasks, harmonic frequency shift detection, interaural phase difference (TFS-low frequency), interaural time difference (ITD), monaural gap duration discrimination, and tone detection in noise with and without a difference in interaural phase (N[subscript 0]S[subscript 0], N[subscript 0]S[subscript Pi]). Data were compared with published results and evaluated with metrics of consistency and efficiency. Results: Thresholds obtained were consistent with published data. There was no evidence of predictive relationships among the measures consistent with a homogenous group. The most stable tasks across repeated testing were TFS-low frequency, diotic and dichotic FM, and N[subscript 0]S[subscript Pi]. Monaural and diotic FM had the lowest normalized variance and were the most efficient accounting for differences in total test duration, followed by ITD. Conclusions: Despite a long stimulus duration, FM tasks dominated comparisons of consistency and efficiency. Small differences separated the dichotic tasks FM, ITD, and N[subscript 0]S[subscript Pi]. Future comparisons following procedural optimization of the tasks will evaluate clinical efficiency in populations with impairment.",

        "description":"The concept of an &quot;entropic force&quot; can be introduced by considering a familiar setup, namely a horizontal cylinder enclosing an ideal monatomic gas by a piston of cross-sectional area &quot;A&quot; and mass &quot;m&quot; that can slide without friction. The surrounding atmospheric pressure P[subscript atm] keeps the piston from flying out of the cylinder. The cylinder and piston have negligible heat capacity (compared to the gas), but the gas is not thermally insulated from the surroundings at room temperature T[subscript R]. Ignore any viscosity or turbulence of the enclosed gas or surrounding air. Two specific and illustrative situations are analyzed here. In the first, the piston is massless, &quot;m&quot; = 0. The piston is temporarily held in place by a pin while the gas is quickly adjusted to initial pressure P[subscript i] = P[subscript atm] and temperature slightly larger than that of the room, say T[subscript i] = 1.1T[subscript R], using a heater and regulator. The piston is then released from rest, v[subscript i] = 0. In the second case, the piston has inertia, &quot;m&quot; &gt; 0, and the gas is initially in both mechanical and thermal equilibrium with the surroundings so that P[subscript i] = P[subscript atm] and T[subscript i] = T[subscript R]. The piston is now given a quick inward push, v[subscript i] &lt; 0. In both situations, the aim is the same: Describe the subsequent evolution of the system.",

At the end of the analysis of the collected data, we observed that males use the thinking styles more significantly than do females (p&lt;0, 05). In addition to this, it has been determined that there are significant differences in using the thinking styles among athletes, according to fields of study. It has been observed that while social sciences students are using a hierarchical thinking style, the science students are dominantly using legislative, and the sports science students are using the internal thinking style. It has been seen that males have significantly better creative styles than do females (p&lt;0, 05), and the sports science students are significantly better with creative styles than other fields of study (p&lt;0, 05). It has been determined that while some thinking styles are improving creativity, some others are decreasing it.

The self-evaluation MLQ form 5X for leaders will be used to determine principals' perception of their leadership qualities. The participants in this study consisted of elementary and middle principals in school districts in central Mississippi. Respondents were asked to decide the degree to which the listed leadership behaviors closely matches their own behavior by selecting from one of the five choices: Not at all, once in a while, sometimes, fairly often and frequently, if not always, a score from 0-4 was assessed for each item. Based on the participants' responses, a score ranging from 0 to 80 was assigned for transformational leadership; a score from 0 to 48 was assigned for transactional leadership; and a score ranging from 0 to 16 was assigned for passive-avoidant leadership. Principal response from the questionnaire were collected through Google Forms and exported into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Data then entered into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) program and analyzed using descriptive statistics to determine frequency of response, means, and standard deviation for each variable.

        "description":"In educational practice, a test assembly problem is formulated as a system of inequalities induced by test specifications. Each solution to the system is a test, represented by a 0-1 vector, where each element corresponds to an item included (1) or not included (0) into the test. Therefore, the size of a 0-1 vector equals the number of items \"n\" in a given item pool. All solutions form a feasible set--a subset of 2[superscript \"n\"] vertices of the unit cube in an \"n\"-dimensional vector space. Test assembly is uniform if each test from the feasible set has an equal probability of being assembled. This paper demonstrates several important applications of uniform test assembly for educational practice. Based on Slepian's inequality, a binary program was analytically studied as a candidate for uniform test assembly. The results of this study establish a connection between combinatorial optimization and probability inequalities. They identify combinatorial properties of the feasible set that control the uniformity of the binary programming test assembly. Computer experiments illustrating the concepts of this paper are presented.",

        "description":"The consistent, but often wrong, impressions people form of the size of unseen speakers are not random but rather point to a consistent misattribution bias, one that the advertising, broadcasting, and entertainment industries also routinely exploit. The authors report 3 experiments examining the perceptual basis of this bias. The results indicate that, under controlled experimental conditions, listeners can make relative size distinctions between male speakers using reliable cues carried in voice formant frequencies (resonant frequencies, or timbre) but that this ability can be perturbed by discordant voice fundamental frequency (F-sub-0, or pitch) differences between speakers. The authors introduce 3 accounts for the perceptual pull that voice F-sub-0 can exert on our routine (mis)attributions of speaker size and consider the role that voice F-sub-0 plays in additional voice-based attributions that may or may not be reliable but that have clear size connotations.",

Voice quality is affected by prosody, emotional state, and vocal pathologies. Psychogenic vocal pathology is particularly interesting. In the present case study, the speaker naturally presented a ventricular band voice whereas in a controlled production he was able to use a more normal phonation process. A small corpus was recorded which included sustained vowels and short sentences in both registers. A normal speaker was also recorded in similar tasks. Annotation and extraction of parameters were made using Praat's voice report function. Application of the Hoarseness Diagram to sustained productions situates this case in the pseudo-glottic phonation region. Analysis of several different parameters related to F[subscript 0], jitter, shimmer, and harmonicity revealed that the speaker with psychogenic voice was capable of controlling certain parameters (e.g. F[subscript 0] maximum) but was unable to correct others such as shimmer.

        "description":"Israel's early childhood education and care (ECEC) policy for ages 0-3 has evolved significantly, with the Ministry of Education now overseeing it. However, the policy still emphasizes settings over comprehensive child development, excluding centers with fewer than seven children, and many still need to be registered. This study examines Israel's ECEC policy evolution from 1948 to 2021, involving critical influencers like women's organizations, practitioners, academics, activists, and politicians. Recent reforms prioritize children's developmental needs over merely supporting working mothers. The challenge lies in integrating a private, unregistered 0-2 care sector with a centralized public 3-5 care system, leading to a unique organizational structure. It reflects a persisting practice divide, but municipalities increasingly recognize the importance of early childhood education and care. These trends align with global patterns in ECEC for ages 0-3, positioning Israel's experiences within an international context.",

For public colleges, a $0 state appropriation is a flag for a potential problem. Another flag occurs when the amount of the Pell Grants exceeds the amount of restricted federal grants and contracts, since the latter includes Pell Grants. A chart of potential errors in reporting on the FY 1983 Finance Survey indicates the name of the college, the state, the amount of potential error (state and local appropriations,  government grants and contracts, total revenue, and other), and comments about each potential error. A second chart of Pell Grant reporting errors shows for each college the amount of restricted federal government grants and contracts, and the amount of Pell grants.

After screening and diagnosis the IEP for each child is determined and a home-based (with caregiver as primary teacher) or classroom program is chosen according to age of the child (0-18 months at home, 18-36 months in the classroom). Program  effectiveness is assessed formally several times a year. Since the program inception eight other facilities have adopted the WISP model and it appears to work successfully in metropolitan as well as rural areas. A table describing components of the program and a section describing the materials used in the WISP program are appended. (Author/PHR)",

Married persons (N=52) competed in a complex reaction time task and set durations of 100 decibel punitive noise for either their spouse or an opposite-sex stranger. During pretrials (aggression escalation), males significantly increased settings when competing with their spouse but not when competing with an unfamiliar female. Women increased settings when competing with unfamiliar males but not when competing with their spouse. During experimental trials, four counteraggression reduction strategies were examined: passive withdrawal (0% counteraggression), minimum retaliation (10%), intermediate retaliation (50%), and incremental escalation (50%  + 5). Men reduced punitive settings under the 10% retaliation condition only. Women reduced punitive settings under 0%, 10%, and 50% conditions. When men were confronted with a passive strategy by a woman, a decrease in aggression was followed by an increase. Women did not show the same pattern. The relationship between these findings and others concerning wives' difficulties in reducing husbands' hostility is discussed. (Author)",

        "description":"Attendance at guest lectures, instructor lectures, and films in self-paced introductory psychology courses was examined in two experiments with 180 students in an introductory psychology class at Utah State University. In the first experiment, students were given no points, one point credit toward interviews, or one point credit toward the final examination for attendance. In the second experiment, students were given 0, 1, 3, or 5 points credit toward the final examination for attendance. Sixteen events were randomly scheduled in each study. Results showed that attendance was highest in the first experiment when points were applied to the final examination. Attendance in the second experiment was highest when point magnitude was 3 or 5 points compared with 0 or 1 point  magnitudes. A continuing reduction in attendance was seen as a function of the number of events regardless of the event class or the point magnitude. Concluded was that carefully selected point contingencies may be used to attract students to lectures and films in self-paced courses, but points gradually lose effectiveness in specific events after repeated exposure.

The alternatives are ranked on a scale from 0 to 5 in increasing levels of modifying a set instructional pattern: Level 0, typified by indifference to any consistent program in science; Level 1, a complete adherence to established conceptual scope, sequence, and instructional methods; Level 2, prescribed concepts and investigations are re-evaluated and re-structured against the pragmatism and parochialism of classroom experience; Level 3, prescribed conceptual systems and instructional strategies are evaluated against classroom experience and current conceptions of curriculum structure and cognitive development, involving, perhaps, the  reordering of the conceptual sequence along a Gagnean hierarchy; Level 4, similar to Level 3, except having additional flexibility by the structure being used as a basis for selecting activities which have been shown to represent valid ways of involving children; and Level 5, choice is maximized by instructional decisions being based, in part, on the general tone of the adopted framework or criteria statement rather than a text's prescribed content or methodologies.

Results suggest that: (1) this is an ecosystem which still operates in an integrated manner, but already shows signs of acculturation; (2) the lack of social support during  the severe droughts is contributing to family disintegration; (3) and the child is not expected to develop autonomy and the be capable of self-determined transformation actions, thus reproducing the parents' life conditions.

Child care is an important economic contributor for families since provision of non-parental child care is a necessity for some parents to engage in the labour market or to study. In addition, child care offers opportunities for child development and socialization. Results indicate that approximately 60% of children aged 0-5 years participate in some type of child care arrangement, be that formal (e.g., daycare centre, 52% of those in child care) or informal (e.g., care by a relative, 26% of those in child care). Some differences were found by province/territory in terms of participation, type of child care arrangement, and reasons for choosing the main child care arrangement. Approximately four in ten parents of children in child care had difficulty finding a child care arrangement. This article also provides estimates of the reasons that parents were not using any child care.",

Following initial conditioning treatment with CSs A and S, the experiment manipulated number of extinction trials with CS A alone (i.e., 0, 5, or 10 trials) prior to AS compound treatment. In addition, two control groups received either extinction trials with S alone or no extinction treatment with S. Conditions receiving either 0 or 10 extinction trials with CS A prior to nonreinforced exposures to AS showed results indicating that aversion elicited by CS S was protected from extinction, whereas a condition receiving 5 extinction trials with CS A prior to AS trials showed unprotected extinction of aversion elicited by CS S.

Study participants used the changing criterion design from single-case research models that consisted of 1 infant and 3 infants between 0-24 months old to ensure the social validity of the study. Age-appropriate informational and fiction picture books were given to the infant observed during the 0-24-month period. The results revealed that the single infant's conceptual knowledge in recipient and expressive language was improved more regularly and systematically compared with age-appropriate picture books under the guidance of parents. These findings provide evidence that infants' conceptual knowledge can be improved through age-appropriate picture books, as well as that both informational and fiction books can be used to effectively expose infants to different concepts. The findings of this study permit the examination of the concept development process in children belonging to different age groups.",

Method: The aim was to establish whether the prevalence of ID, defined as significant limitations in both intellectual (intelligence quotient below 70) and adaptive functioning among moderately preterm (MP; 32[superscript + 0]-33 [superscript + 6] weeks) and late preterm (LP; 34[superscript + 0]-36[superscript +6 weeks) infants, is increased compared with that in term infants (=37[superscript +0] weeks). Antenatal and neonatal risk factors for ID among gestational age groups were sought. The national register study included all live-born infants in Finland in 1991-2008, excluding those who died before one year age, or had any major congenital anomaly or missing data. A total of 1 018 256 infants (98.0%) were analysed: very preterm (VP; &lt;32[superscript +0] weeks, n = 6329), MP (n = 6796), LP (n = 39 928) and term (n = 965 203). Results: By the age of seven years, the prevalence of ID was 2.48% in the VP group, 0.81% in the MP group, 0.55% in the LP group and 0.35% in the term group. Intracranial haemorrhage increased the ID risk in all groups. Male sex and born small for gestational age predicted an increased risk in all but the MP group. Conclusions: The prevalence of ID decreased with increasing gestational age. Prevention of intracranial haemorrhages may have a beneficial effect on the neurodevelopmental outcomes of neonates.",

        "author":["Raff, Lionel M."],
        "description":"Necessary and sufficient criteria for reaction spontaneity in a given direction and for spontaneity of finite transformations in single-reaction, closed systems are developed. The criteria are general in that they hold for reactions conducted under either conditions of constant T and p or constant T and V. These results are illustrated using a simple, liquid-to-vapor phase transition as an example. Following this development, the paper investigates the source of the mathematical and logical errors contained in textbooks ca. 1950 to the present that led to the fallacious statements still present in most introductory chemistry textbooks and some more advanced texts that the conditions for spontaneity are ?G &lt; 0 at constant T and p and ?A &lt; 0 at constant T and V, whereas the corresponding conditions for equilibrium are ?G = 0 or ?A = 0. This investigation shows the principal errors to be (i) incorrect evaluation of definite integrals; (ii) failure to determine whether the results of such integrations produce criteria for spontaneity and equilibrium that are necessary conditions, sufficient conditions, both, or neither; and (iii) incorrect logical arguments related to equilibrium. The question of why such errors have been perpetuated in textbooks for over 50 years is also addressed. Some recommendations for revision of textbooks, for more frequent use of the concept of chemical force in discussing spontaneity and equilibrium, and for revision of the notation and nomenclature related to spontaneity and equilibrium are made.

Method: A retrospective chart review was conducted for 177 children, ages birth to 58 months, who were seen between 1982 and 1997. Presenting symptoms were identified. Subjects were given diagnoses using both DSM-IV and DC: 0-3. Presenting symptom variables were reduced using subjective and empirical determinants. Stepwise regression analyses were used to determine whether presenting symptoms and demographic variables predicted diagnoses. Results: Descriptive statistics on the distribution of current presenting symptoms and assigned diagnosis were compared with previous studies. The study demonstrated interrater reliability for diagnoses using both diagnostic systems, evidence of diagnostic validity via the regression analyses, and good concordance where DSM-IV and DC: 0-3 overlap. DSM-IV disruptive behavior disorders may be better conceptualized in DC: 0-3 as regulatory disorders, leading to alternative conceptualization of the disorder and a different course of treatment. Conclusions: This study clarifies a developmental progression of presenting symptoms and diagnoses and suggests the need for continued diagnostic re-evaluation in early childhood. Greater attention to relationship factors and consideration of trauma factors is encouraged. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2004;43(5):578-587.

        "description":"We've all seen (in movies, newscasts, or perhaps in person) the violent effect of the downwash that occurs when a helicopter hovers over the ground. Leaves, grass, and debris are dramatically blown about. We've also sat in front of circulating room fans and felt a large draft, whereas there seems to be very little air movement behind the fan. The cause of this is a delightful manifestation of Bernoulli's principle. The fan blades, or helicopter rotor blades, produce a pressure differential as air passes through them--let us say p[subscript 1] before and p[subscript 2] after, as shown in Fig. 1, with p[subscript 2] greater than p[subscript 1]. If p[subscript 0] is the ambient pressure, Bernoulli's equation gives p[subscript 0]=p[subscript 1]+(1/2)[rho]v[subscript 1][superscript 2] where v[subscript 1] is the velocity of the air entering the fan. Continuity requires that v[subscript 2] leaving the fan must equal v[subscript 1] entering the fan for an incompressible fluid, approximately true here (Av[subscript 1] = Av[subscript 2], where A is the area swept out by the blades, the \"rotor disk area\"). However, some distance below the rotor (or in front of the fan) the velocity is v[subscript d] (v[subscript downdraft] in the figure) and the pressure again p[subscript 0], so Bernoulli gives us p[subscript 2]+(1/2)[rho]v[[subscript 2][superscript 2]=(p[subscript 1]+[delta]p)+(1/2)[rho]v[[subscript 1][superscript 2]=[p[subscript 1]+(p[subscript 2]-p[subscript 1])]+(1/2)[rho]v[[subscript 1][superscript 2]=p[subscript 2]+(1/2)[rho]v[[subscript 1][superscript 2]=p[subscript 0]+(1/2)[rho]v[[subscript d][superscript 2].",

        "description":"This paper discusses a result of Li and Shen which proves the existence of a unique periodic solution for the differential equation x[dots above] + kx[dot above] + g(x,t) = [epsilon](t) where k is a constant; g is continuous, continuously differentiable with respect to x , and is periodic of period P in the variable t; [epsilon](t) is continuous and periodic of period P, and when [partial derivative of g with respect to x] satisfies some additional boundedness conditions. This means that there exist initial values x(0) = [alpha]* and x[dot above](0) = [beta]* so that the solution to the corresponding initial value problem is periodic of period P and is unique (up to a translation of the time variable) with this property. The proof of this result is constructive, so that starting with any initial conditions x(0) = [alpha] and x[dot above](0) = [beta], a path in the phase plane can be produced, starting at ([alpha], [beta]) and terminating at ([alpha]*, [beta]*). Both the theoretical proof and a constructive proof are discussed and a \"Mathematica\" implementation developed which yields an algorithm in the form of a Mathematica notebook (which is posted on the webpage http://pax.st.usm.edu/downloads). The algorithm is robust and can be used on differential equations whose terms do not satisfy Li and Shen's hypotheses. The ideas used reinforce concepts from beginning courses in ordinary differential equations, linear algebra, and numerical analysis. (Contains 7 figures.)",

        "description":"The problem highlighted in this research is the low pronunciation ability of Kindergarten students in Al-Irsyad Madiun that is caused by (1) the uninteresting activities in learning English; (2) the students' difficulties of English pronunciation; (3) the students' low motivation in learning. The theoretical review includes the young learners characteristics, games in language and games for young learners. The procedure of the research consists of identifying the problem, planning the action, implementing the action, observing the action, and reflecting the result of the research. In this research, the researcher acts as the teacher who conducts the action research in the classroom and she is helped by the classroom teacher and collaborator. In collecting the data, the researcher uses observational technique supported with tests. In analyzing the data, the researcher uses the field notes, teacher's diaries, students' work supported with the cassette recording and photograph, then also compares the result of the students' pre-test and post-test to answer the research questions. It indicates significant improvement in the result of pre-test and post-test of cycle 1 and 2. In cycle 1, t[subscript 0] (2.55734) is higher than t[subscript t] (1.73) and in cycle 2, t[subscript 0] (6.765738) is also higher than t[subscript t] (1.73). From these two results, therefore, h[subscript 0] is rejected and the alternative hypothesis (h[subscript a]) is accepted. They practice their pronunciation through asking each other for cards to match those they have in their hands, arranging a word and sticking the alphabets on the flannel board in order to arrange the parts of tree, pronouncing the word, giving the meaning and making a sentence such as &quot;Go Fish Game and Maze Game.&quot; By conducting these games, using interesting media, creating various interesting tasks and activities can increase the students' motivation in learning English and pronunciation ability.

The sample was divided into three groups. Students in grades 1 through 4 (n=655) were those with chronological ages (CAs) of 6 years 0 months to 9 years 11 months); students in grade 5 through 8 (n=716) were those with CAs of 10 years 0 months to 13 years 11 months); and students in grades 9 through 10 (n=218) were students with CAs of 14 years 0 months to 16 years 11 months). Students attended three rural county school systems in eastern Kentucky. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to ascertain which of the 10  WISC-R subtest scores would be the best tetrad for estimating the full-scale IQ in each age group. Only subtests that were significant at the 0.01 level or less were retained. Results indicate that the picture arrangement, information, block design, and comprehension subtests accounted for 90% of the variance associated with the Full-Scale IQ for grades 1 through 4. The subtests for vocabulary, object assembly, picture arrangement, and coding accounted for 88% of the variance associated with the Full-Scale IQ for grades 5 through 8. The vocabulary, picture arrangement, object assembly, and picture completion subtests accounted for 91% of the variance associated with the Full-Scale IQ for grades 9 through 10. The results indicate that a short version of the WISC-R would be practical,  economical, and reliable as a screening instrument for Appalachian students in grades 1 through 10. Three tables show the variables selected by stepwise regression for the age groups. (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"What is the role of \"zero\" in grading? According to several authors, giving students a zero lets them too easily off the hook, seldom serves as a motivator for them to do better and is not an accurate reflection of what has been learned. While students do need to be responsible and accountable for their work, assigning a zero skews the grade and it tends to be inaccurate. An equitable distribution would make the grade more appropriately representative of what a student had learned. Typically grade spans are 100-94=A, 93-84=B, 83-73=C, 72-64=D, 63-0=F. If using letter grades, an \"F\" equates to a 0. The literature suggests that it should be a 1.0 not a zero. According to several articles, each mark should have an appropriate influence on a student's grade. Some schools and districts are exploring recording a 50 or 60 in lieu of an \"F\" or \"0\" because then it helps make the spread more equitable. An example of scoring in the Olympics was cited where the high and low scores are thrown out so that one judge is not in control of the results (Policies work against standards). A zero plays the role of the judge that is in total control of the outcome of the grade. Faculty should discuss and agree upon the following when establishing a grading policy: (1) learning goals of the school; (2) the purposes of grades; (3) factors that should be included when grading; (4) the role of zero and how lack of achievement will be assessed and recorded; (5) weighting of grades; (6) ways in which to document student progress; (7) how feedback will inform the instructional program; (8) programs that will assist students and help them become responsible for their own learning; (9) communication with students and parents about the school's grading policy and expectations; (10) define and develop meaningful assessments; and (11) periodic reexamination, assessment and modification of the grading system.

Method: A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE (OVID), PsycINFO (EBSCO), ERIC (ProQuest), SCIELO (WOS), Teacher Reference Center (EBSCO), and Education Database (ProQuest), and studies on AAC interventions in children from 0 to 6 years old diagnosed with various disabilities were selected independently by two reviewers (A.L.-R. and N.I.M.) according to the purpose of the review. Results: Twenty-nine of 1,709 studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed, and the characteristics and results of the studies were extracted by a descriptive analysis (O.L.S. and M.O.-V.). Conclusion: This analysis revealed that children with different diagnoses show improvements in expressive and receptive communication, functional communication behaviors, communication participation skills, interaction strategies, and symbol and multisymbol production and comprehension by using various AAC systems.",

        "description":"This study explored child behaviours that enable mothers to perceive their child's minds. We administered the Mind Perception Questionnaire to 216 women with children aged between 0 and 24 months and 221 working women without children. Participants responded with mind perceptions for various entities, including for their children (a 0--2-year-old child). Further, to examine child-related behaviours that may influence mothers' perceptions of their children's minds, we asked them about which actions made them perceive what their babies had in mind. We found that mothers perceived their children as having minds similar to their own while working women without children perceived 0--2-year-old children as being different from themselves. Mothers' perceptions of their children's minds were associated with child-related behaviours that made communication possible. Thus, this study was able to identify important milestones of child development, by examining the mother's point of view regarding their children's minds.",

Results showed that the language-general -30- and +30-ms VOT boundaries are better discriminated than the 0-ms boundary in 4-month-olds, whereas 8-month-olds better discriminate the 0-ms boundary. These data support explanations of speech development stressing the effects of both language-general boundaries and linguistic environment (attunement theory and coupling theory). Results also suggest that the acquisition of the adult voicing boundary (at 0 ms VOT in French vs. +30 ms VOT in English) is faster and more linear in French than in English. This latter aspect of the results might be related to differences in the consistency of VOT distributions of voiced and voiceless stops between languages. (Contains 5 figures and 3 tables.)",

The typology of mathematical connections and the quality levels of mathematical connections were used. Interviews were conducted based on eight tasks applied to three case studies. The results showed that the quality of the intra-mathematical connections: different representations, procedural, implication, part-whole and meaning of the students, is found mostly at level 2 (consistent and argued mathematical connections) and only one student presented inconsistencies to find the correctness equation of the tangent line to the curve at a point (quality level 0 connection). Likewise, the metaphorical connection was identified when a student mentioned the metaphorical expression &quot;the graph has no holes&quot;, which suggests the conceptual metaphor &quot;the graph is a path&quot; referring to the continuity of a function. We believe that quality level 2 mathematical connections ensure understanding, and the quality level 0 mathematical connections are the reasons why students have difficulty understanding the derivative.",

        "description":"This paper explores the use of K. G. Joreskog's (1970) congeneric modeling approach to reliability using censored quantitative variables. Two Monte Carlo studies were conducted. The first explored the robustness of Normal Theory Generalized Least-Squares (NTGLS) estimates for a single-factor congeneric model across several sample sizes (N=25,50,100,400), model loading sizes, and different levels of censoring (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%). The second study compared alternate estimation procedures for different levels of variable censoring (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%) based on a single-factor large loading congeneric model. NTGLS, asymptotically distribution free (ADF), and latent TOBIT estimators were compared as to their efficiency in estimating model parameters. Results of the first study indicate  that convergence rate is inversely related to sample size and to the size of the model loadings. Censoring of variables produced the expected negative bias in estimates using NTGLS methods with the magnitude of the bias somewhat robust against sample size variation. Results from the second study indicate that the TOBIT estimates were robust with respect to model rejection and amount of parameter bias across various levels of variable censoring. Both NTGLS and ADF methods proved to be unsatisfactory both in model rejections and percent of bias. Thirteen graphs and three data tables conclude the document. (Author/TJH)",

        "description":"The presence of F in the ABCDF grading scale results from the struggle between authoritarian and egalitarian philosophies over how best to support the school work ethic. Authoritarian forces have favored the precise 0-100 scale that centralizes power clearly in the hands of the teacher. Egalitarian forces have supported less precise measures, such as the ABCDE scale. The current ABCDF system represents an informal compromise between these forces. The history of education shows the development of this compromise. As education became more complex, especially in the nineteenth century, it was rationalized and centralized into an age-stratified system wherein power was held by the instructor. High school expansion, parents' desires, college requirements, and the authoritarians' need  to motivate students toward the school work ethic led by 1900 to the general use of the 0-100 scale. However, studies during 1910-1915 discredited the claimed objectivity of this method, leading to an egalitarian shift toward more relative scales. During the 1930s the ABCDE scale became accepted, but F was substituted for E because authoritarian forces desired a more emphatic grade to punish failing students and symbolize teachers' power.

        "description":"The beta coefficient of an intermediate variable in a causal direction remains relatively constant as other system variables are introduced and controlled in stepped regression, whereas that in the acausal direction changes noticeably. Normalized random numbers (200x5) were generated and substituted in interdependent equations to produce five scores for each of 200 pseudo-people. Stepped-regression analysis was then applied on all possible three-variable paths. Beta differentials on a given intermediate variable were computed and compared for opposite directions. The resulting index persisted in yielding values between 0 and +1 in the one direction--the closer to 0, the stronger the direction--as other system variables were stepped in. But because some remaining three-variable  paths imitated the known causal paths, further study was conducted to find support for the known causal paths, and to eliminate the imitations. Conclusions were that the beta index, found wanting initially, had greater utility as a confirming device, by the addition of the two modifications, in that all but the originally designed causal paths were eliminated as lacking causal-direction consistency. The index procedure may well be confined to the computer presently. (Author/GO)",

In general, the literature reveals a liberalization of graduate language requirements. At the doctoral level, there are trends toward: increasing the number of acceptable languages, allowing other options to fulfill the requirements (such as proficiency in statistics or advanced mathematics), and allowing departmental control over requirements. At the master's level, the literature reveals conflicting reports, but there appears to be a gradual liberalization here also. Of the 19 New York schools that offered master's degrees, 11% had a university language requirement, 47%  allowed departmental discretion, and 42% had no language requirement at this level. Language use in writing doctoral dissertations ranged from 0% in some fields to 35% in others, and in later research from 0% to about 60%. In general, knowledge of foreign languages was deemed important in the physical sciences, economics, English, and history, and was considered unimportant in the social sciences (except economics), the applied sciences, business, and education.

A discrepancy score (D-score) was computed for each student as the absolute difference between the I-score and 0-score for each behavior. The data showed that I-score responses were variable among student respondents, but that the distribution of I-scores did not substantially vary with respect to either course content, course level, sex of student, anticipated grade, or overall evaluation of the teacher. The discrepancy hypothesis would predict  significant D-score vs. E-score correlations in the overall population and also for each I-score subpopulation (defined by their I-score response toward a given behavior). Correlations were significant for only those having an I-score at an extreme end of the frequency scale, suggesting that a strict discrepancy process is not being used by all student raters. Alternative hypotheses are discussed. (Author)",

It was necessary to define the components of the health manpower training network and to identify individuals responsible for its operation. A personal interview method of data-collection was used, loosely based upon a questionnaire. The Kansas City General Hopsital and Medical Center was the site for pilot-testing the interview procedure. Indicated refinements were made; then all institutions in Jackson and Clay Counties providing health manpower training programs were contacted. The private sector of health manpower utilization was represented by a random sampling of  private physicians in the Greater Kansas City Area to determine the types of personnel and training required for employment in that sector. The study determined that 55 health manpower training programs in 21 health occupations were operating at 53 0/0 of their projected capacity. Five recommendations were offered to improve the situation. (Tables and six appendixes, including a sample questionnaire, are provided.) (AG)",

Material and methods: Two male teams participated in the study: juniors (football; n = 9) aged 16-18 years and seniors (volleyball; n = 13) aged 20-32 years. The subjects were requested to assess the doping-related risk of losing every of 6 values: health, medals, ranking position, physical attractiveness, psycho-emotional balance, bonuses and respect of personages, in three modes: importance of losing given value (scale 1-6), general likelihood of a doping-related loss of given value (scale 0-100) and the doping-related risk of losing given value the subject would be ready to take (scale 0-100). Results: Seniors and juniors rated the importance of individual values and the doping-related general likelihood of losing them alike. As compared with senior athletes, the junior ones significantly underrated the risk of losing health and respect and overrated that of possible bonus. Conclusions: The emotional, cognitive and social maturation of young athletes throughout a decade have an impact on perceiving doping-related risks and the associated decisions.

Effect sizes were largest for students from the lowest SES group ($0 to $30,000) approximately 168 additional students enrolled per 2-year institution per year following Tennessee Promise program adoption. Findings controlled for year-to-year variations in unemployment and state price parities.

These results stand in opposition to the long-held assumption in the cognitive arithmetic literature that such simple addition problems normally are solved by fact retrieval from declarative memory. Here we tested a large sample of diversely skilled and culturally diverse men and women at the University of Saskatchewan and examined multiple categories of simple (1 digit plus 1 digit) addition problems for evidence of generalization of practice, a signature of procedure use. The procedure-based 0 + N = N problems presented clear evidence of generalization (i.e., practicing a subset of 0 + N problems lead to speed-up for a different subset of 0 + N problems), but there was no evidence of such generalization of practice for the nonzero problems, although the experiment had good power to detect small effects. Given that generalization of practice is a basic marker of procedure-based processing, its absence for the nonzero addition problems casts doubt on the compacted counting theory.",

After deriving that relationship, most general and physical chemistry textbooks set w[subscript additional] = 0 to arrive at the claim that ?H = qP, and nearly all further discussion of enthalpy assumes that ?H = qP. Setting w[subscript additional] = 0 is viable for spontaneous reactions, but for nonspontaneous reactions, wadditional ? 0 as a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics. Therefore, ?H ? qP for nonspontaneous reactions. Moreover, nonexpansion work is important for many interesting and important spontaneous reactions in biology (e.g., muscular movement, nerve signal transmission) and in modern society (e.g., batteries); incorporating w[subscript additional] into ?H allows for a more accurate discussion of the energy flow in these reactions. In this paper, I show that ?H ? qP for nonspontaneous reactions, and I discuss how ?H must be partitioned between qP and w[subscript additional] for several kinds of reactions according to the second law of thermodynamics.

        "description":"Computational thinking (CT) has emerged as an important method in the United States for helping children learn to solve complex problems and develop skills necessary for coding and other computer science-related endeavors. Research has revealed that CT can be encouraged with children as young as 3-4 years of age. While some preschools and schools are incorporating CT into their curriculum for young children, ages 0-8 years, it is important to understand how environments outside of schools are using CT with young children, particularly given that, in the United States, a large percent of young children, ages 0-5 years, are not in formal school settings. This study provides insight into this area through 20 interviews with educators in libraries and museums to understand how they incorporate CT into their work with young children, ages 0-8 years, and their families. The interviews reveal that library and museum educators are using a variety of developmentally-appropriate approaches, such as play, experimentation, and narrative, to design and offer a diverse array of engaging, hands-on CT activities that allow young children to practice CT in child-centered, meaningful ways.",

Each of these components lasted for 10 response-produced food deliveries, and components were separated by 10-s blackouts. We varied delays to food (signaled by blackout) between the two response alternatives in an experiment with three phases: In Phase 1, the delay on one alternative was 0 s, and the other was varied between 0 and 8 s; in Phase 2, both delays were equal and were varied from 0 to 4 s; in Phase 3, the two delays summed to 8 s, and each was varied from 1 to 7 s. The results showed that increasing delay affected local choice, measured by a pulse in preference, in the same way as decreasing magnitude, but we found also that increasing the delay at the other alternative increased local preference. This result casts doubt on the traditional view that a reinforcer strengthens a response depending only on the reinforcer's value discounted by any response-reinforcer delay. The results suggest that food guides, rather than strengthens, behavior. (Contains 2 tables and 19 figures.)",

        "description":"Purpose: The ability to detect a tone added to a random masker improves when a preview of the masker is provided. In 2 experiments, the authors explored the role that perceptual organization plays in this release from masking. Method: Detection thresholds were measured in informational masking studies. The maskers were drawn at random prior to each trial. Masker or signal-plus-masker precursors preceded the detection interval, and the time between the precursor and the detection interval was systematically altered. In Experiment 1, the signal frequency was either fixed or random. In Experiment 2, the random masker was composed of harmonics of a common fundamental frequency (F [subscript 0]), and the randomly chosen signal frequency was either harmonically related to, or mistuned from, the masker's F [subscript 0]. Results: For a masker precursor, the release from informational masking withstood longer precursor-detection interval delays (a) when the signal frequency was fixed versus random and (b) when the signal was mistuned relative to a harmonic of the masker's F [subscript 0]. Conclusion: These results suggest that listeners' ability to attend to the signal may contribute to the long-lived release from masking with a masker precursor.",

Both languages use mixed systems for indicating grammatical relations. In both languages ergative-absolutive case-marking indicates core arguments, but to different extents in each language. In Lajamanu Warlpiri, pronominal clitics in a nominative-accusative pattern also indicate core arguments, and in Light Warlpiri word order in a nominative-accusative pattern partially does so. The study asks which sentence interpretation strategies children rely on most, when they learn to rely on them and whether cross-linguistic influences are seen. Children aged 5 ; 0, 7 ; 0 and 9 ; 0 and adults saw paired, animated events simultaneously on video and heard a transitive sentence spoken. The participants pointed to the event depicted by the sentence heard. Adults used a case-marking strategy consistently in both languages. Children initially used both case-marking and word order strategies, but used case-marking more often as age increased.",

        "description":"Three experiments investigated perception of audio-visual (A-V) speech synchrony in 4- to 10-month-old infants. Experiments 1 and 2 used a convergent-operations approach by habituating infants to an audiovisually synchronous syllable (Experiment 1) and then testing for detection of increasing degrees of A-V asynchrony (366, 500, and 666 ms) or by habituating infants to a detectably asynchronous syllable (666 ms; Experiment 2) and then testing for detection of decreasing degrees of asynchrony (500, 366, and 0 ms). Following habituation to the synchronous syllable, infants detected only the largest A-V asynchrony (0 ms vs. 666 ms), whereas following habituation to the asynchronous syllable, infants detected the largest asynchrony (666 ms vs. 0 ms) as well as a smaller one (666 ms vs. 366 ms). Experiment 3 investigated the underlying mechanism of A-V asynchrony detection and indicated that responsiveness was based on a sensitivity to stimulus-energy onsets rather than the dynamic correlation between acoustic and visible utterance attributes. These findings demonstrated that infant perception of A-V speech synchrony is subject to the effects of short-term experience and that it is driven by a low-level, domain-general mechanism.

Both groups of REM-restricted rats eventually reached the same overall performance level as did nonrestricted controls, but 0-4 REMr animals were delayed in their improvement in the first few days and lagged behind controls in the middle portion of the training period. More importantly, performance gains of 0-4 REMr rats depended more on simple local cues throughout the 15-d study since, unlike control and 4-8 REMr animals, their error rate increased after daily disruption of the relationship between local (intramaze) cues and the food reward. Thus, although overall performance was only subtly and transiently impaired, due to the ability to use alternate, nonspatial behavioral strategies, complex associative (spatial) learning was persistently impaired by restricting REM for a short critical period each day.

This sequence came about as a solution to the famous rabbits' problem posed by Fibonacci in his landmark book, \"Liber abaci\" (1202). If the \"n\"th term of Fibonacci sequence is denoted by [f][subscript n], then it may be defined recursively by [f][subscript n+1] = [f][subscript n] + [f][subscript n-1], [f][subscript 0] = 0 and [f][subscript 1] = 1. Many people were fascinated by this sequence, among them the French mathematician Eduoard Lucas (1842-1891). He discovered significant results involving Fibonacci numbers. He also created his own sequence, which is considered a companion to Fibonacci sequence. Lucas sequence: 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, ... is defined recursively by [l][subscript n+1] = [l][subscript n] + [l][subscript n-1], [l][subscript 0] = 2, [l][subscript 1] = 1, where [l][subscript n] represents the \"n\"th Lucas number.

        "description":"We solve for the motion of an object with initial velocity v[subscript 0] and subject only to the combined drag of forces linear and quadratic in the velocity. This problem was treated briefly by Newton, after he developed a theoretical argument for the quadratic term, which we now know is characteristic of turbulent flow. Linear drag introduces a time [tau], and the two drag forces are equal at a critical velocity v[subscript c]; this defines a characteristic distance R = v[subscript c][tau]; details are discussed for spheres and for cylinders moving along their axis. For v[subscript 0]/v[subscript c] [approximately] 1 the role of quadratic drag is largely to reduce the velocity to v[subscript c], below which linear drag dominates. The penetration length is given by L[subscript N] = Rln(1 + v[subscript 0]/v[subscript c]). As noted by Gamow, L[subscript N] is relevant to the range of non-self-propelled projectiles, such as artillery shells, bullets, ground penetration bombs and spears shot from spearguns; it is also relevant to windmills and fans.

        "description":"Purpose: The aim of the study was to assess the susceptibility to energetic and informational masking in patients with single-sided deafness (SSD) with one normal-hearing (NH) ear and a cochlear implant (CI) in the contralateral ear, understand the effect on speech recognition when spatially separating noise and speech maskers, and investigate the influence of the CI in situations with energetic and informational masking. Method: Speech recognition was measured in the presence of either a modulated speech-shaped noise or one of two competing speech maskers in 11 SSD-CI listeners. The speech maskers were manipulated with respect to fundamental frequency to consider the effect of different voices. Measurements were conducted in the unaided (NH) and aided (NHCI) conditions. Spatial release from masking (SRM) was calculated for each masker type and both listening conditions (NH and NHCI) by subtracting scores of the colocated target and masker condition (S[subscript 0]N[subscript 0]) from the spatially separated target and masker conditions (S[subscript 0]N[subscript [not equal to]0]). Results: Speech recognition was highly variable depending on the type of masker. SRM occurred in the unaided (NH) and aided (NHCI) conditions when the speech masker had the same gender as the target talker. Adding the CI improved speech recognition when this speech masker was ipsilateral to the NH ear. Conclusions: The amount of informational masking is substantial in SSD-CI listeners with both colocated and spatially separated target and masker signals. The contribution of SRM to better speech recognition largely depends on the masker and is considerable when no differences in voices between the target and the competing talker occur. There is only a slight improvement in speech recognition by adding the CI.",

        "description":"Purpose: The elements of impaired swallowing biomechanics are visually assessed and scored by clinicians using a standardized and validated tool for assessing type and severity of physiological impairments using the Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile (MBSImP). However, the functional anatomical correlates that underly noted impairments using MBSImP scoring have not been measured. The purpose of this study was to determine whether differences in MBSImP component scores represent differences in underlying swallowing mechanics as measured by computational analysis of swallowing mechanics (CASM) to better define underlying mechanisms of impairment. Method: A retrospective analysis of modified barium swallow studies from physician-referred adult patients with dysphagia was scored using the MBSImP for laryngeal elevation, anterior hyoid excursion, epiglottic movement, pharyngoesophageal segment opening, and tongue base retraction. A canonical variate analysis (CVA) was performed to determine the movement of anatomical landmarks associated with MBSImP component scores using the CASM method. Mahalanobis distances (D) were then used to detect differences among MBSImP scores for each component assessed. Results: CVA showed significant differences (p &lt; 0.0001) in Mahalanobis distance (D &gt; 1) between MBSImP component scores of 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, or 0-4, as applicable, depending on the component. Discriminant function analyses revealed concomitant increase/worsening in MBSImP score with changes in anatomical positioning of structures. Conclusions: Ratings of swallowing impairment and physiology using the MBSImP have distinct biomechanical correlates with anatomical movements of swallowing. These data further demonstrate how swallowing mechanics are highly interrelated. Understanding these linkages between anatomical and physiological movement within impaired swallowing biomechanics is essential in more specific characterization and treatment of dysphagia.",

We analyzed service utilization of the developmentally delayed children based on data of governmental reported early intervention services from year 2003 to 2009 in Taiwan. Results show that, the utilization rate of early intervention services was 9.18%% (range = 6.96-12.09%%) of children in 0-5 years during the past 7 years. Mean utilization rate in age group of 0-2 years was 8.32%% (range = 5.73-10.93%%), and age group of 3-5 years was 9.92%% (range = 7.78-13.78%%). We found that the utilization rate in all children aged 0-5 years (R[superscript 2] = 0.93; p less than 0.001), boy group (R[superscript 2] = 0.93; p less than 0.001) and girl group (R[superscript 2] = 0.92; p = 0.001) were significant increased gradually. The higher utilization rate of early intervention services (aged 0-5 years) were more likely to locate in the north cities (Keelung City = 14.65%%; Taipei City = 13.49%%), east areas--Hualien County (14.03%%), Taitung County (11.76%%) and central or south counties such as, Chiayi City (14.05%%), Tainan City (12.47%%), and Miaoli County (12.38%%). Hsinchu County (5.97%%), Kaohsiung City (6.21%%), Taichung County (6.74%%), Taipei County (6.95%%) have lower utilization rates of early intervention in Taiwan. The study highlights that the health care system should close the gaps in geographic disparities of early intervention services for children with developmental delays, and respond timely to the needs of these vulnerable children and their families.

        "description":"The present series of 4 experiments investigated the probability of responding in accord with equivalence in adult human participants as a function of increasing or decreasing delays in a many-to-one (MTO) or comparison-as-node and one-to-many (OTM) or sample-as-node conditional discrimination procedure. In Experiment 1, 12 participants started with simultaneous matching, followed by 0-s, 2-s, and 4-s delayed matching, while the other 12 participants started with 4-s delayed matching, followed by the decreasing delays in a MTO training structure. Results suggested that the likelihood of responding in accord with equivalence is enhanced as a function of increasing delays during training, and also that starting with longer delays increases the probability of responding in accord with equivalence in simultaneous matching. In Experiment 2, 6 participants started with simultaneous matching, followed by 0-s, 2-s, and 4-s delayed matching in a OTM training structure. Results showed that 6 of 6 participants responded in accord with equivalence. In Experiment 3, 6 participants started with simultaneous matching, followed by 0-s, 3-s, and 9-s delayed matching in a OTM training structure. Results showed that 6 of 6 participants responded in accord with equivalence. In Experiment 4, 6 participants started with simultaneous matching, followed by 0-s and 3-s delayed matching with a restriction to engage in mediating behavior during testing. Results showed that none of the 6 participants responded in accord with equivalence during 3-s delay. It is argued that if delayed matching requires (or evokes) precurrent behavior (responses that increase the effectiveness of a subsequent current behavior in obtaining a reinforcer), precurrent behavior may in turn facilitate responding in accord with equivalence. Higher reaction times during initial testing may indicate precurrent problem-solving behavior prior to the selection of a comparison stimulus. (Contains 7 tables and 10 figures.)",

        "description":"This qualitative case study involved addressing rates of general education elementary school teachers with 0 to 5 years of teaching experience who referred students with disabilities to the office for their behavior, which were twice as often as nondisabled students. Based on the conceptual framework of Weiner's Attribution Theory, teacher's lack of knowledge of specific disabilities and strategies for modifying negative behaviors exhibited by students with disabilities were evident in their disciplinary procedures. This qualitative case study involved examining elementary-level general education teachers with 0 to 5 years of teaching experience, attitudes, and perceptions regarding disciplining students with disabilities. Research questions that guided this study involved factors that may have impacted increases in referrals among students with disabilities and the effectiveness of strategies used by teachers. Data were collected from 12 elementary general education teachers with 0 to 5 years of teaching experience using in-depth structured interviews, behavioral documentation, and reflective journals to answer research questions. Using an open coding system, findings indicated that general education teachers with 0 to 5 years of teaching experience, believed lack of teacher training was the main factor for the increase in behavior referrals. As a result of these findings, a 3-day professional development was created. Study results were used to address the disproportionality of discipline referrals among students with disabilities. Social change may occur as more rural school districts in Southwest Georgia begin to implement training that focuses on providing strategies that will lead to a decrease in behaviors and an increase in student achievement on the elementary level.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of English language teachers' perfectionism and self-efficacy perceptions on their professional motivation levels. The research was a relational survey model and causal comparison research. The study consisted of 450 English teachers working in official primary and secondary schools affiliated to the Ministry of National Education (MoNE) in Zonguldak province and its districts in the 2021-2022 academic year. &quot;Personal Information Form&quot;, &quot;Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale&quot;, &quot;Teacher Self-Efficacy Scale&quot; and &quot;Teacher Professional Motivation Scale&quot; were used as data collection tools. Frequency, percentage, arithmetic mean, t-test for independent groups, one-way analysis of variance, correlation analysis and regression analysis were used to analyse the data. As a result of the study, it was found that English language teachers' perfectionism varied in favour of teachers with 0-5 years of professional seniority according to professional seniority; it did not vary according to gender and institution of employment. It was seen that self-efficacy perceptions changed in favour of female teachers according to gender, in favour of teachers with 0-5 years of professional seniority according to professional seniority, and in favour of teachers working in primary schools according to the institution of employment. It was seen that professional motivation levels changed in favour of teachers with 0-5 years of professional seniority according to professional seniority, in favour of teachers working in primary schools according to the institution of employment; it did not change according to gender. There was no significant relationship between English teachers' professional motivation levels and their perfectionism, but there was a significant relationship between English teachers' professional motivation levels and their self-efficacy perceptions. A positive, significant and low level relationship was found between perfectionism and self-efficacy perception general scores. The variables &quot;order&quot;, &quot;parental criticism&quot;, &quot;parental expectations&quot; and &quot;effectiveness for classroom management&quot; were found to be predictors of English teachers' professional motivation levels.",

Approximately one-half of these students were assessed in music, and the other half were assessed in visual arts. The Music portion of the assessment measured student ability to respond to music in various ways. Students were asked to analyze and describe aspects of music they heard, critique instrumental and vocal performances, and demonstrate their knowledge of standard musical notation and music's role in society. The average responding score for music was reported on a NAEP scale of 0 to 300. Scores ranged from 105 for the lowest-performing students to 194 for the highest-performing students. The Visual Arts portion of the assessment included questions that measured student ability to respond to art as well as questions that measured their ability to create art. Responding questions asked students to analyze and describe works of art and design. The average responding score for visual arts was reported on a NAEP scale of 0 to 300 with scores ranging from 104 for the lowest-performing students to 193 for the highest-performing students. Creating questions required students to create works of art and design of their own. The average creating task score for visual arts was reported separately as the average percentage of the maximum possible score from 0 to 100 with a national average of 52. In general, students who performed well on the responding questions also performed well on the creating questions. Racial/ethnic and gender gaps were noted in both music and visual arts. Technical notes and data are appended. (Contains 16 figures and 4 tables.)

        "description":"A new index of item discrimination power (IDP), dimension-corrected Somers' D (D2) is proposed. Somers' D is one of the superior alternatives for item-total- (Rit) and item-rest correlation (Rir) in reflecting the real IDP with items with scales 0/1 and 0/1/2, that is, up to three categories. D also reaches the extreme value +1 and -1 correctly while Rit and Rir cannot reach the ultimate values in the real-life testing settings. However, when the item has four categories or more, Somers' D underestimates IDP more than Pearson correlation. A simple correction to Somers' D in the polytomous case seems to lead to be effective in item analysis settings. In the simulation with real-life items, D2 showed very few cases of obvious underestimation and practically no cases of obvious overestimation. With certain restrictions discussed in the article, D2 seems to be a good alternative for these classic estimators not only with dichotomous items but also with the polytomous ones. In general, the magnitudes of the estimates by D2 are higher than those by Rit, Rir, and polychoric correlation and they seem to be close of those of bi- and polyserial correlation coefficients without out-of-range values.",

        "description":"The construction of parallel tests from item response theory (IRT) based item banks is discussed. Tests are considered parallel whenever their information functions are identical. After the methods for constructing parallel tests are considered, the computational complexity of 0-1 linear programming and the heuristic procedure applied are discussed. Two methods for selecting parallel tests in succession (sequential test construction) are formulated. The first uses a non-partitioned item bank (Method 1), and the second uses a partitioned item bank (Method 2). Two methods are also reviewed for simultaneous test construction, one for non-partitioned item banks (Method 3) and one for partitioned item banks (Method 4). A heuristic procedure is used for solving these 0-1 linear  programming problems. A simulation study compared these methods using two item banks, each consisting of 100 items. Satisfactory results were obtained, both in terms of the amount of central processing unit time needed and the differences between the information functions of the parallel tests selected. It was concluded that when the Rasch model fits the items, sequential test construction methods are preferable. For the three-parameter model, the use of Method 1 is inappropriate. Three tables give the results by different methods. (SLD)",

        "description":"The presentation of a hand grasp facilitates the recognition of subsequent objects when the grasp is coherent with the object to be identified. This outcome is usually explained as the integration of two different processes: descriptive visual processes in ventral visual areas and processes in charge of the computations of action metrics in dorsal visual regions. With the aim to explore the temporal dynamics of this interaction, we conducted an experiment in which participants categorized objects preceded by congruent  and incongruent hand grasp gestures under different interstimulus interval (ISI) conditions. Hand grasp gestures and target objects were separated by five different interstimulus intervals (ISI): 0, 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 ms. Results showed significant shorter response times for congruent trials than for incongruent trials for ISI conditions of 250 and 500 ms. However, no effect was found for the other ISIs (0, 1,000 and 2,000). These results suggest that the contribution of automatically driven visuomotor dorsal areas in object recognition is stronger up to 500 ms after prime offset, and that object identification is facilitated by hand gesture primes just inside this  time window (250-500 ms).",

Five teachers who teach eighth grade were chosen from schools that obtained the highest and lowest TIMSS results in Zarqa City, Jordan. Textbook content analysis, teachers' classroom observation and exam questions were assessed according to the triadic classification of thinking levels (knowledge and understanding, application and inference). The findings concerning textbooks revealed that the knowledge and understanding level obtained the highest means (67.5%-81%), followed by the application level (14.3%-24.1%) and questions measuring inference level (analysis 4.7%-6.3%), composition (0%-1.5%), evaluation (0%). Questions prepared by the teachers in the exams that measured knowledge and understanding ranked first in both the highest- and lowest performance schools. Both categories of schools achieved roughly the same rate in terms of application level. Nevertheless, the inference average rate was higher in the higher-performance schools. In general, the focus of evaluative practices, classroom questions and discussions was on the lower thinking levels, with the lowest rates being achieved by the low-performing schools.",

Basic educational programs are defined as primarily classroom programs for children who are too severely handicapped to benefit from a regular classroom situation and who require a special teacher and/or other supportive services. Eligibility criteria for basic educational programs  are explained in terms of the following handicapping conditions: educable, trainable, and severely mentally handicapped; blind and partially sighted; deaf and hard of hearing; orthopedically handicapped: emotionally disturbed; and learning disabled. Supportive services are defined in terms of itinerant or non-classroom services for children in regular classes. The following are examples of some of the services mentioned: curriculum resource consultants; teacher counselors; school social workers; speech, physical and occupational therapists; special learning centers; and cooperative special education-vocational rehabilitation programs.

Because these devices have become an indispensable part of everyday life, they have a significant influence on children's entertainment and leisure, as well as their education. This study, therefore, examined the media environment in young children's homes (from 0 to 6 years of age), how early and how much they use television, computers, and tablet/smartphones, and the media environment in their homes and the parents' rules and regulations for their children's electronic media use. The sample for this study consisted of 412 parents of 0- to 6-year-old children who brought their children to the Social Paediatrics Department of the Faculty of Medicine in Ankara, Turkey, for developmental check-ups. The data for this study were collected through a questionnaire that was prepared by the researcher. The findings indicate that almost all children live in homes with different types of electronic media devices and they start to use them at an early age with longer time than recommended and parents try to use some rules in order to regulate their children's usage.",

Using Pearson r correlation, this study showed that no correlation in the respondents' achievement among the six types of Reid's learning style (the highest r-value is [less than or equal to] 0, 209 while the lowest is [greater than or equal to] - 0, 263). However, in contrast, the attitude and achievement in this study showed a positive correlation. Among the three aspects of attitude, the emotion and achievement are significantly correlated (r value: 0.487; p value: 0.005). Meanwhile, the cognitive and attitude is significantly correlated with the r value: 0,427 (p value: = 0.05). The weakest correlation with their attitude is behaviour where the r value is only 0.201 (p value = 0.269). Thus, students are aware of their own learning styles in learning new language.

The questionnaire included the Age-Universal Intrinsic-Extrinsic Scale; the Faith Maturity Scale; an 18-item Adventist orthodoxy scale; and scales measuring the frequency of use of alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco, and of shoplifting, fighting, and getting into trouble at schools. There was little variance across grades in the intrinsic (I), extrinsic (E), faith maturity, or orthodoxy scores, in the latter case largely due to ceiling effects. The I-E correlation began as positive for boys, but declined to 0, and then was -0.14 by 12th grade. For girls, the correlation was negative throughout, ranging from -0.06 in the 6th grade to -0.26 in 12th. When  correlated with the at-risk behaviors, all the I correlations were negative, with girls' correlations stronger than the boys', ranging in the teens and low twenties, and becoming stronger across the 6 years of schooling. This pattern was almost completely reversed for the E correlations, with correlations positive, and higher for boys, but then plummeting near 0 for both boys and girls in the 11th and 12th grades.

        "description":"This issue brief presents a plan to expand educational opportunities and care for children ages 0-5 years old by investing significant federal dollars to: (1) Make high-quality preschool universally accessible to all 3- and 4-year-old children; and (2) Enable more lower-income families to afford child care for children ages 0-3 years old. These policies would advance several important national priorities. First, expanding access to preschool and affordable child care would directly improve the lives of millions of mothers and fathers who are struggling to balance the demands of work and family. In addition to the increase in single-parent households, many more two-parent households now have two working spouses. Second, investing in young children will also help strengthen America's human capital. Years of research demonstrate that the first five years of a child's cognitive and emotional development establish the foundation for learning and achievement throughout life. Finally, early childhood investments will help address our growing economic inequality and diminishing rates of upward mobility. These trends have been exacerbated by the dramatic changes in America's family structure.",

Our main findings were: (a) MRT was maximal when C- T distance was 0[degree] and minimal when C-T distance was 180[degrees] and (b) besides an angular distance effect, there is a meridian effect. When C and T occurred in the same quadrant, MRT was longer than when T and C occurred at the same distance (45[degrees]) but on different sides of vertical or horizontal meridians.

Do gender differences also occur in people's confidence as they perform number-line estimation, a common spatial-numeric task predictive of math achievement? To investigate this question, we analyzed outcomes from six studies (N = 758 girls/women and boys/men with over 20,000 observations; grades 1-5 and adults) that involved a similar method: Participants estimated where a provided number (e.g., ¾, 37) was located on a bounded number line (e.g., 0-1; 0-100), then judged their confidence in that estimate. Boys/men were more precise (g = 0.52) and more confident (g = 0.30) in their estimates than were girls/women. Linear mixed model analyses of the trial-level data revealed that girls'/women's estimates had about 31% more error than did boys'/men's estimates, and even when controlling for precision, girls/women were about 7% less confident in their estimates than were boys/men. These outcomes should encourage researchers to consider gender differences for studies on math cognition and provide pathways for future research to address potential mechanisms underlying the present gender gaps.

        "description":"Across Arizona and the United States, there is widespread interest in how to successfully educate the growing number of English language learner students in K-12 schools. Research suggests that a school may face challenges in effectively teaching its English language learner students--and closing the achievement gap with native English speakers--when concentrations of English language learner students are high, especially in middle and high schools; when there are many socioeconomically disadvantaged students; and when the school is located in an urban or rural (as opposed to suburban) area. Research also suggests that open enrollment programs may increase the concentrations of English language learner students and socioeconomically disadvantaged students in some schools. This technical brief analyzes 2007/08 student-level data to determine how the number and percentage of English language learner students vary by public school in Arizona and how the percentage of English language learner students varies by school level (primary, middle, and high school), percentage of students eligible to receive free or reduced-price lunch (an indicator of socioeconomic disadvantage), school type (traditional, alternative, and charter), and school location. The study shows that statewide in 2007/08, 168,199 (16 percent) of Arizona public school students were classified as English language learner students. Their distribution throughout the 1,878 Arizona public schools in this study ranged from 0 to 853 students (0-87 percent) in individual schools. Schools and counties faced different levels of accountability and challenge in helping these students reach required levels of academic achievement, based on the number of English language learner students. Forty-one percent of Arizona public schools (those with 19 or fewer English language learner students) were not required to submit disaggregated adequate yearly progress reports for English language learner students or to implement the state English Language Development pull-out program. But 45 percent of schools (those with 40 or more English language learner students) were required to do both. Concentrations of English language learner students varied within and across schools and counties and by school characteristics. Schools with greater than 50 percent English language learner students were more prevalent among primary schools than among middle and high schools, among traditional public schools than among alternative and charter schools, and among schools with more than 75 percent eligibility for free or reduced-price lunch than among schools with smaller percentages of eligible students. Schools with no English language learner students were more prevalent in high schools, charter schools, and schools with less than 75 percent eligibility for free or reduced-price lunch. Differences were also evident by county. Maricopa and Pima Counties, with the largest total student enrollment among counties, had schools with 0 percent English language learner students close to schools with greater than 50 percent English language learner students. Of Arizona's 15 counties, the 6 with low student enrollment (1,000-50,000) had schools with 0 percent English language learner students and no schools with greater than 50 percent English language learner students.

Teacher-child interactions were observed and coded according to categories of negotiation strategies (NS) and shared experiences (SE). Ratings for NS ranged from Level 0, exercise of will, to Level 3, striving for mutual understanding. Ratings for SE ranged from Level 0, impulsive enthusiasm, to Level 3, mutual collaboration in sharing. Results indicated that the CON teacher had the most SE with children  and the DI teacher the least. The CON teacher had a higher percentage of Levels 2 and 3, and a lower percentage of Level 0, for NS and SE than did the DI and ECL teachers. The DI teacher exhibited an authoritarian orientation and an academic emphasis. The CON teacher exhibited a cooperative orientation and an emphasis on stimulation of reasoning. The ECL teacher was more similar to the DI teacher than to the CON teacher. A list of 34 references is included.

However, conceptualizations of the Home Literacy Environment (HLE) have not yet adapted to the implications of these comparatively new practices for young children's knowledge about literacy or the ways in which they negotiate affectively intense relationships in digital networks. Furthermore, the digital activity of very young children aged 0-3 years and the diversity of print and digital technologies they use remain under-researched. Reporting on detailed case studies of a two-year-old boy and a one-year-old girl in England, which formed part of an EU-wide qualitative study of 0-3-year-olds' digital literacy practices at home, we problematise the relevance of conventional definitions of the HLE for contemporary homes. Building on nascent research in this field, we argue for the need to reconceptualise the HLE as a digitally networked space, with porous boundaries that enable the very youngest children to negotiate affectively intense relationships and express meaning across diverse modes and media as they connect with distant others in a digitally mediated world.",

We aimed to discover if there was an interaction between parental use of smart technologies, parents' attitudes and the child's age that would predict young children's usage of smart devices. We also wanted to find out what kinds of devices are made available for 0-3-year olds, how frequently parents allow the child to use them, the activities children are engaged in on smart devices and which apps they use during their digital play. Parental mediation practices were also analysed. Our results provide evidence that parent screen time, parent attitudes and the child's age are all associated with touch screen use among infants and toddlers. Parents give three main reasons when rationalising their child's touch screen use, related to education, entertainment and behaviour regulation. Although parental mediation strategies are dependent on the age and gender of the child, the majority of parents combine different mediation strategies in order to fulfil their role as mediators of young children's digital play.",

        "description":"Optimal appropriateness indices, recently introduced by Levine and Drasgow (1984), provide the highest rates of detection of aberrant response patterns that can be obtained from item responses. These optimal appropriateness indices are used to study three important problems in appropriateness measurement. First, the maximum detection rates of two particular forms of aberrance are determined for a long unidimensional test. These detection rates are shown to be moderately high. Second, two versions of the standardized &quot;L sub 0&quot; appropriateness index are compared to optimal indices. At low false alarm rates one standardized &quot;L sub 0&quot; index has detection rates that are about 65 percent as large as optimal for spuriously high (cheating) test scores. However, for the spuriously low  scores expected from persons with ill-advised testing strategies or reading problems, both standardized &quot;L sub 0&quot; indices are far from optimal. Finally, detection rates for polychotomous and dichotomous scorings of the item responses are compared. It is shown that dichotomous scoring causes serious decreases in the detectability of some aberrant response patterns. Consequently, appropriateness measurement constitutes one practical testing problem where significant gains result from the use of a polychotomous item response model. (Author/LMO)",

        "description":"The molar entropy of mixing yields values that depend only on the number of mixing components rather than on their chemical nature. To explain this phenomenon using the logic of chemistry, this article considers mixing of distinguishable particles, thus complementing the well-known approach developed for nondistinguishable particles, for example, ideal gases and solutions. The result is a simple quantitative treatment based on the Boltzmann distribution using the Gibbs paradox as a case study to define a macroscopic thermodynamic criterion of distinguishability. It is the presence of nonzero, albeit often small, ?H(mixing) in a reversible process--due to a change in the energy of intermolecular interactions, ?e--that is responsible for the nonzero entropy. Temperature in the Clausius equation, dS[subscript system] = dq[subscript rev]/T, normalizes the heat--different in various processes--to yield the same entropy of mixing per mole, as long as this temperature, T = T'(mixing), that of the reversible process, is linked to the Boltzmann characteristic temperature, T = ?e/k = 2T' ln 2. For mixing exactly the same substances, dS[subscript system] = dq[subscript rev] = 0, and thus, T'(mixing) is undefined as a 0/0 uncertainty; the process can occur reversibly for any amount at any temperature. Two cases of negative entropy of mixing/expansion validate the suggested approach.",

        "description":"The goal of this research was to examine fifth graders' understanding of fractions on the number line. This case-study design focused on the various ways that students represented fractions on number lines. Students responded to task-based interview questions by identifying fractions as a number on the number line as well as equivalency and problem solving. The tasks were administered individually to 26 fifth-grade students over a 15-minute time frame in their respective schools. The two groups of 10-year-old students answered most questions in written form with pencil and paper and were often asked to explain how they arrived at an answer. Student performance was highest when instructed to plot one-half on a number line of 0 to 1 as well as naming a fraction less than one-half. The students performed lowest when they attempted to plot one-half, one-fourth, and 1 on a number line with a predetermined unit 0 to one-third. Other low performing concepts consisted of plotting one-fourth on a number line from 0-3, identifying one-fourth on a non-routine number line, and plotting a unit fraction with an equivalent fraction as well as an improper fraction on a common number line.",

Points O and A are assumed to be close enough to each other and the chain flexible enough that the radius of curvature r at the bottom point C can be taken to be negligibly small (compared to the length of the chain). The problem is to compare the speed of descent v(y) = dy/dt of the free end E of the chain to the speed v[subscript free] ( y ) = [crossed through square root 2gy] of a free-falling point mass that has descended the same distance y. If v(y) &gt; v[subscript free] (y) for all y &gt; 0, then, in a race to fall any arbitrary distance Y (where 0 &lt; Y &lt; L), the chain end E will always beat a simultaneously released point mass, because the fall time t for E will be shorter than t[subscript free] for the point ] ( y ) .

Forms had equal or unequal total test difficulty with and without confounding difficulty. The mean square errors and bias of estimated item and ability parameters were compared across the various confounding tests. The estimated discrimination parameters were influenced by the levels of correlation between dimensions. The mean square errors (MSEs) of the average of the true discrimination parameters with the estimated value were smallest when the correlation equaled 0; however, the MSEs of the multidimensional discrimination parameter were smallest when the correlation was larger than 0. The estimated difficulty parameters were highly affected by different amount of confounding difficulty within dimensions. Furthermore, the MSEs of the average of the true ability parameters on the first and second dimensions with the estimated ability were smaller than those from the ability parameter on each dimension for all conditions. The pattern varied according to the number of common items, and the measures of MSE and squared bias were relatively consistent across forms at the same level of correlation, except for the condition where the correlation was 0 and the number of common items was 8.",

        "description":"Two experiments with pigeons investigated the effects of contingencies between interresponse times (IRTs) and the transitions between the components of 2- and 4-component chained schedules (Experiments 1 and 2, respectively). The probability of component transitions varied directly with the most recent (Lag 0) IRT in some experimental conditions and with the 4th (Lag 4) IRT preceding the most recent one in others. Mean component durations were constant across conditions, so the reinforcing effect of stimulus change was dissociated from that of delay to food. IRTs were longer in the Lag-0 than in the Lag-4 conditions of both experiments, thus demonstrating that stimulus change functioned as a reinforcer. In the Lag-0 conditions of Experiment 2, the Component-1 IRTs increased more than the Component-2 IRTs, which in turn increased more than the Component-3 IRTs. This finding runs counter to the conditioned-positive-reinforcement account of chained-schedule responding, which holds that the reinforcing effect of stimulus change should vary in strength as an inverse function of the delay to the unconditioned reinforcer at the end of the chain because conditioned reinforcement is due to first- or higher- order classical conditioning. Therefore, we present other possible explanations for this effect. (Contains 6 figures and 2 tables.)",

Students who were medium in selective player style (spent 11-50 h) had significantly higher GPAs than students low on selective player style (spent 0-10 h). Students high on habitual playing style (7 or more hours a week) showed significantly lower levels of Conscientiousness compared to students low on habitual playing style (0-1 h a week). Students who were high on the diverse style (i.e., 7 or more games played a year) showed significantly higher Openness scores than students low on the diverse style (0-3 games a year).

However, this is a controversial issue, and given the level of functioning of persons with Rett syndrome, the autistic disorder is expected to be present in a comparable proportion as in people with the same level of functioning. To investigate, parents of 52 females with classical and atypical Rett syndrome (2.4-49.3 years) completed the Developmental Behavior Checklist (DBC), the Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders (DISCO) and the Dutch Vineland Screener 0-6 (VS 0-6). All participants had a severe to profound intellectual disability (ID) according to the VS 0-6. Behavior indicated an autistic disorder in 42 (DBC) to 58 percent (DISCO) of the Rett cases. Autistic behavior had decreased in 19 percent such that they no longer met the criteria for autistic disorder. Some participants were suspected of having a comorbid autistic disorder, though not more often than can be expected at their level of functioning. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of a comorbid autistic disorder as much as they should be in other people with this level of functioning. (Contains 2 tables.)",

Children at 2-0 showed no evidence of comprehending word order in either task with novel verbs; with familiar verbs they showed competence in the IPL task but not in the act-out task. The difference in performance for familiar and novel verbs from the same children at 2-0, on the IPL task, and at 2-9, on the act-out task, is consistent with the hypothesis that early linguistic/cognitive representations are graded in strength, with early representations still weak and very task dependent. However, these representations also become more abstract with development, as indicated by the familiarity effect even in the more sensitive IPL task. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"Conventional lesion methods have shown that damage to the rodent hippocampus can impair previously acquired spatial memory in tasks such as the water maze. In contrast, work with reversible lesion methods using a different spatial task has found remote memory to be spared. To determine whether the finding of spared remote spatial memory depends on the lesion method, we reversibly inactivated the hippocampus with lidocaine either immediately (0-DAY) or 1 mo (30-DAY) after training in a water maze. For both the 0-DAY and 30-DAY retention tests, rats that received lidocaine infusions exhibited impaired performance. In addition, when the 0-DAY group was retested 2 d later, (when the drug was no longer active), the effect was reversed. That is, rats that had previously received lidocaine performed as well as control rats did. These findings indicate that the rodent hippocampus is important for both recent and remote spatial memory, as assessed in the water maze. What determines whether remote spatial memory is preserved or impaired following disruption of hippocampal function appears to be the type of task used to assess spatial memory, not the method used to disrupt the hippocampus.

Neural networks in the form of self-organizing maps (SOMs; Kohonen, 1989, 1995) were used to simulate unsupervised learning of Mandarin tones. In Simulation 1, we trained the SOMs with syllable-sized continuous F[subscript 0] contours, produced by multiple speakers in connected speech, and with the corresponding velocity profiles (D1). No attempt was made to reduce the large amount of variability in the input or to add to the input any abstract features such as height and slope of the F[subscript 0] contours. In the testing phase, reasonably high categorization rate was achieved with F[subscript 0] profiles, but D1 profiles yielded almost perfect categorization of the four tones. Close inspection of the learned prototypical D1 profile clusters revealed that they had effectively eliminated surface variability and directly reflected articulatory movements toward the underlying targets of the four tones as proposed by Xu and Wang (2001). Additional simulations indicated that a further learning step was possible through which D1 prototypes with one-to-one correspondence to the tones were derived from the prototype clusters learned in Simulation 1. Implications of these findings for theories of language acquisition, speech perception and speech production are discussed.",

As EPs work across the 0 to 25 age range, the person giving consent may vary according to the needs of the individual service user and so it is necessary to be aware of relevant legislation and case law. This study explored what might be considered best practice for EPs in gaining consent across the 0 to 25 age range by conducting semi-structured interviews with six professionals as part of an expert reference group. The interviews were thematically analysed using a hybrid inductive-deductive approach. Six main themes were identified: ethical obligations; children's rights; legal obligations; partnership; informed consent; and, barriers to best practice. There was considerable overlap between some of the main themes, reflecting the complexity of the issue. The findings are discussed in relation to literature in other areas of psychological practice. Implications for practice for individual EPs and EP services are considered, such as the possibility of developing a guidance document for use across the profession, as well as directions for further research.",

Indeed, differential functional equations that are related to difference quotients in calculus are studied in this paper. In particular, two interesting observations are made in this article, namely, (1) it is possible to solve a differential functional equation just by some basic algebra; and (2) a certain class of smooth functions is characterized by imposing a simple condition on the value c, where c is guaranteed by the Mean Value Theorem for any smooth functions defined on any interval [a, b].",

Activities were designed to assure that public and private agencies, institutions, and organizations provide more effective early intervention, educational, transitional, vocational, early identification, and related services to children with deaf-blindness. The project provided preservice and inservice  training activities, individual and group consultation services, and statewide workshops and conferences where exemplary and effective strategies to work with the targeted population in the home environment, center-based settings, and the community were demonstrated. The project also provided technical assistance to families and service providers. Individual sections of the report provide information on the project's purpose, goals, and objectives; conceptual framework; accomplishments, outcomes, and contributions; problems and their resolutions; evaluation findings; and impact.

Trained interviewers conducted hour-long interviews with 1,492 Kentucky citizens between the ages of 16 and 65 who had been selected through a random sample that was stratified by region to produce a statewide sample drawn from the state's five geographic regions. Respondents completed a literacy skills assessment instrument and answered questions regarding their background characteristics. Respondents' levels of prose, document, and quantitative literacy were rated from 0 to 500 (with scores of 0-225, 226-275, 276-325, 326-375, and 376-500 corresponding to levels 1-5 of  literacy proficiency). The respective prose, document, and quantitative literacy proficiencies of all Kentucky adults averaged 286, 284, and 280 (versus average proficiency levels of 272, 267, and 271 measured by the NALS for the entire U.S. adult population, including senior citizens). Of those surveyed, approximately 14% had no or virtually no literacy skills. It was estimated that an additional 656,000 Kentucky adults have low literacy skill levels that are likely to impede their personal advancement. Literacy proficiencies were related to educational attainment, parental encouragement, and social background. (MN)",

Each participant received proficiency scores (0-500) on scales assessing prose, document, and quantitative literacy.

Older respondents were more likely than younger respondents to demonstrate poor literacy skills. The average scores of 19- to  24-year-olds were comparable to those of adults aged 35-44 years. African-American adults were more likely than white adults to perform in the two lowest levels and less likely to attain the two highest levels. Literacy scores were correlated with years of education, employment, economic status, and level of civic responsibility (as indicated by being a registered voter).

The GMIB is a theory-based generic in-basket simulation, designed to assess supervisory and management skills independent of any job classification. Three of the 15 in-basket items in the GMIB are critical and are scored on a 0-5 scale. The remaining 12 items are scored on a 0-4 scale. Using an item-by-item scoring format, total mean score interrater reliabilities across 4 studies have ranged from 0.86 to 0.95. The GMIB requires only 20 minutes to scores and needs only one rater. In a concurrent validation of the GMIB involving incumbents from 120 job classifications, an estimated true validity of 0.41 was found for predicting the composite of ratings by immediate supervisors on 6 job  performance dimensions (n=275). An estimated true validity of 0.44 was found for predicting the composite of ratings by second-level supervisors on the same performance dimensions (n=239). Factor analysis identified four factors for the GMIB, making it possible to retain the dimension format associated with traditional in-baskets. Automated candidate feedback can also be generated with the GMIB. Twelve tables present data from the studies, and an 11-item list of references is included. (SLD)",

Participants' ages varied from 48 months (4 years 0 months) to 539 months (44 years 11 months). Automated Item Selection Procedure (AISP) was applied for the assessment of unidimensionality under three different lower bounds as 0.30, 0.40, and 0.55. The items of all three subtests formed a unidimensional scale. Backward Item Selection (BIS) procedure detected seven items in the Matrices and 17 items in the Verbal Knowledge, while six items in the Riddles subtest violated the IIO criteria. KBIT-2: Reliability values obtained using MSA analysis show that all three subtests have a high degree of internal consistency.

A transcript/narrative analysis technique was used to identify all interpersonal negotiation strategies each child used within each session. Strategies were classified according to a coding system that simultaneously ordered them according to four developmental levels (0, impulsive-physicalistic; 1, unilateral-coercive; 2, reciprocal-influential; and 3, collaborative-mutual) and two interpersonal orientations (self- and other-transforming). With individual strategies as the basic unit of analysis, strategies in each weekly session were charted according to level and orientation, and summed to show total  distributions and trends over time. Results indicated that the predominant level of strategy used by both children was unilateral (level 1) followed for each child by reciprocal (level 2), impulsive (level 0), and collaborative (level 3) strategies. Across time, a trend toward increased use of reciprocal strategies was suggested, although there was wide oscillation in the percentage and absolute use of strategies coded at each level from one weekly session to the next. Different patterns of strategy use were identified for each child. Results were discussed with respect to their implications for using developmental methods and models for clinical purposes.

        "description":"The relationship between physical environment and child development was examined in five groups of moderately to severely handicapped children (hearing impaired, vision impaired, orthopedically impaired, speech impaired, mentally retarded). The 282 participating children comprised 89 infants (ages 0-3), 108 preschoolers (ages 3-6), and 85 elementary school children (ages 6-10). Each child's family was visited twice (18 months apart) at home and assessed using sociodemographic indices, the HOME Inventory, a parental coping scale, a social support inventory, the Family Inventory of Life Events, the Scales of Independent Behavior, and either the Bayley Scales of Infant Development or the Stanford-Binet Intelligence test. Results indicated that there was a high degree of specificity  between the type of handicap and age and the development of handicapped children. Availability of materials was only slightly related to behavioral development in infants but more significant in overall development of preschool and elementary school age children. Significant correlations were most frequent for orthopedically and speech impaired children's motor and social development, while no significant correlations appeared for the mentally retarded in any developmental area. Findings also indicated that general surroundings in which a child lives were essentially unrelated to behavioral development for handicapped children ages 0-10. (VW)",

        "author":["Madhere, Serge"],
        "description":"One of the most appropriate quasiexperimental approaches to compensatory education is the regression-discontinuity design. However, it remains underutilized, in part because of the need to clarify the link between the mathematical model and administrative decision-making. This paper explains the derivation of a program efficiency index congruent with the regression-discontinuity design. The efficiency index is based on a confidence interval calculated for expected mean posttest performance. If the observed posttest mean corresponds exactly to the upper limit of the confidence interval, the efficiency index is +1 (optimal efficiency). If the observed posttest mean falls at the lower confidence boundary, the index value is zero (minimal efficiency). Data from a remedial mathematics  program (grades 2, 3, 7, and 8) illustrate the possibilities for: (1) net growth (index above 1); (2) breakdown (index below 0); and (3) gradations of maintenance (index between 0 and 1). As conceived, the efficiency index is comparable to eta-square, the correlation ratio. Thus, its analytic context differs from that of the effect size coefficient commonly associated with classical control group design. A model is presented showing how variations in the size of the efficiency index may lead to different decision making options. (Author/LPG)",

        "description":"Meta-analysis is a technique for combining the summary statistics from previously conducted research studies to indicate the direction of results and provide an index of the magnitude of effect size. This paper focuses on the effect of the violation of the assumption of independence (that the value of any included statistic is in no way predictable from the value of any other included statistic) when combining correlation coefficients to determine effect size. A Monte Carlo simulation used the following four parameters and specified values: (1) the sample size within a study (20, 50, 100); (2) the number of predictors (1, 2, 3, 5); (3) the population intercorrelated among predictors (0, .3, .7); and (4) the population correlations between predictors and criterion (0, .3, .7).  Path diagrams are given for each predictor case. The means, medians, and standard deviations of the correlation coefficients and the Fisher's Z transformation of the correlation coefficients for all population correlations and population intercorrelation values for each sample size were calculated and the data is presented in table format. As all the standard deviations were very close to their expected values, it is concluded that nonindependence does not affect the estimation of either the measures of central tendency or the standard deviations when the same population parameter is being estimated.

The data of the study was collected from middle schools in the city center of Kutahya, 342 (113 woman, 198 man) students randomly recruited and voluntarily participate to the study, age range 11-15. The easy sampling method was preferred in the present study. As a data collection tool &quot;Depression Scale for Kids&quot; was used improved by Kovacs (1985) and adapted to Turkish by Öy (1991). In the evaluation of data first skewness and kurtosis values were evaluated and no skewness or kurtosis issues were found. Then reliability of the scale was assessed via Cronbach's alpha method and Cronbach's alpha calculated as 0.657. Lastly for definition of the data's Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal Wallis test used. Data analyses were conducted using SPSS version 21. For Windows. As a result there were not any significant difference between gender, age, sport involvement and depression level of the students (p&gt;0, 05). But, there were a significant difference between socioeconomic status and depression level of the students (p&lt;0, 05). The difference was between bad income and very good income.",

It examined the instructional virtual environment in teaching EFL at the University of Tabuk in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 crisis during the academic year 2019/2020. Sample consisted of 20 informants. Participants were selected randomly divided into two groups (experimental 10 and control 10). Experimental group used media tools such as blackboard, zoom, interactive board, the control group used the conventional method. Pre-and post-questionnaires were distributed to both groups after completing teaching units. Results showed that there are statistically significant differences at level (0, 05) for the means of achievement test for both groups in favor of the experimental group through the interactive board. The findings revealed that there are statistically significant differences at level (0, 05) in developing attitudes of teachers towards linguistic subjects due to the use of the interactive board. The research recommends that media; blackboard, zoom, and the interactive board should be activated in teaching all subjects not only the time of crisis but also in normal times since it has a positive effect on the achievement of teachers and increases their attitudes towards teaching EFL any time any place.",

On a scale of 0 to 5 (0 signifying not at all and 5 signifying great extent), the respondents were asked to rate 20 different intervention and remediation strategies regarding test preparation practices for the proficiency tests. The survey was divided into two identical parts: the first section addressed actual implementation of the specific strategies, and the second section addressed perceived importance to the success of the students. Group tutoring was found to be the most frequently used method of test preparation, while individual tutoring was the strategy ranked highest in importance  to testing success by all of those surveyed. Strategies linked to teacher in-service were perceived as important, but this importance was not necessarily linked to actual implementation. Reward incentives for students who pass the tests were not favored by the group surveyed, although they ranked these strategies higher in importance than in actual use.

This study also tested for disproportionate impacts of the proposed prerequisites on ethnicity, gender, and disability groups. For all courses except Fire Technology, success rates significantly dropped as we moved from level 0, those who met no prerequisites, to level 1, those who just met English 100 eligibility. Increases in success rates were observed in all courses for those who just met level 2, successful completion of English 100, over success rates for levels 0 and 1. To experience increased success rates, at least successful completion of English 100 would have to  be required. Unfortunately, this level of prerequisite would exclude one-third to one-half of all eligible students. A dramatic decline in enrollment would be the price of the modest increase in success rates achieved through an English 100 prerequisite. In addition, it appears that the imposition of a prerequisite at any level would exclude men, Hispanics, African-Americans, and Filipinos, and those with disabilities, especially learning disabilities, at higher rates than women, Whites, Asians, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, and mainstream students. This exclusion generally increases with prerequisite level. (VWC)",

        "description":"Linguistic prominence is defined as words or syllables perceived auditorily as standing out from their environment. It is explored through changes in pitch, duration and loudness. In this study, phonetic realization and perception of prominence among lexical tones in Mandarin Chinese was investigated in two experiments. Experiment 1 explored phonetic realization of prominence. The primary aim of this experiment was to compare and contrast acoustic characteristics of a target word produced under four conditions: (a) unaccented and unfocused; (b) accented but unfocused; (c) unaccented but focused; (d) accented and focused, among four tones. Ten native speakers of Chinese were recorded reading materials in a natural fashion with the target word appeared in the above four positions. The recorded data were segmented and acoustically measured for acoustic parameters: vowel duration; mean and maximum of intensity; mean, maximum, minimum and slope of F[subscript 0]. The results showed that vowel duration lengthening was the main acoustic parameter associated with accent while an increase in vowel duration, mean and maximum of intensity and F[subscript 0], and slope of F[subscript 0] was associated with focus realization. It was also found that acoustic parameters used to realize focus were varied from tone to tone: an increase in duration, F[subscript 0], and intensity was presented in focus realization for Tone 1 (high level tone) and Tone 4 (high falling tone); duration and F[subscript 0] were used to implement focus for Tone 2 (mid-high rising tone); while duration and intensity were used in Tone 3 (low falling-rising tone). Acoustic cues used to perceive prominence were investigated in Experiment 2. In this experiment, acoustic parameters found to have been used to realize focus in Experiment 1 were compared in pairs to test native speakers' preference in focus perception. Twenty native speakers of Chinese participated in the \"preference\" judgment. The results showed that duration, mean and maximum of intensity cues were selected more often than pitch cues in focus perception. These results suggested that phonetic realization of prominence in Mandarin Chinese was affected by category of prominence (i.e., focus or accent) and tonal contexts. Moreover, acoustic parameters used by native Mandarin Chinese to produce focus were different from those used in their perception of focus.

        "description":"Purpose: Spatially separating speech and background noise improves speech understanding in normal-hearing listeners, an effect referred to as spatial release from masking (SRM). In cochlear implant (CI) users, SRM has often been demonstrated using asymmetric noise configurations, which maximize benefit from head shadow and the potential availability of binaural cues. In contrast, SRM in symmetrical configurations has been minimal to absent in CI users. We examined the interaction between two types of maskers (informational and energetic) and SRM in bimodal and bilateral CI users. We hypothesized that SRM would be absent or &quot;negative&quot; using symmetrically separated noise maskers. Second, we hypothesized that bimodal listeners would exhibit greater release from informational masking due to access to acoustic information in the non-CI ear. Method: Participants included 10 bimodal and 10 bilateral CI users. Speech understanding in noise was tested in 24 conditions: 3 spatial configurations (S[subscript 0]N[subscript 0], S[subscript 0]N[subscript 45&amp;315], S[subscript 0]N[subscript 90&amp;270]) x 2 masker types (speech, signal-correlated noise) x 2 listening configurations (best-aided, CI-alone) x 2 talker gender conditions (different-gender, same-gender). Results: In support of our first hypothesis, both groups exhibited negative SRM with increasing spatial separation. In opposition to our second hypothesis, both groups exhibited similar magnitudes of release from informational masking. The magnitude of release was greater for bimodal listeners, though this difference failed to reach statistical significance. Conclusions: Both bimodal and bilateral CI recipients exhibited negative SRM. This finding is consistent with CI signal processing limitations, the audiologic factors associated with SRM, and known effects of behind-the-ear microphone technology. Though release from informational masking was not significantly different across groups, the magnitude of release was greater for bimodal listeners. This suggests that bimodal listeners may be at least marginally more susceptible to informational masking than bilateral CI users, though further research is warranted.",

This cluster-randomized trial included 204 communities (n = 1,113 children in final sample), stratified by community indigenous status, and assigned to receive either: (T[subscript 0]) CCT only; (T[subscript 1]) CCT plus availability of EI in the community; or (T[subscript 2]) [subscript 1] plus promotion of the EI program by the CCT program. Interviews were conducted with the mother or primary caregiver of each child at baseline (2008, children 0-18 months old), and at follow-up (2012, children 3-5 years old); the intervention began after baseline and continued for all eligible households. Cognitive development was assessed with the Extended Ages and Stages Questionnaire (baseline) and the McCarthy Scales of Children's Development (follow-up); assessors were blinded to treatment. All analyses were intention to treat. There were significant effects on child development when EI received support and promotion from the CCT program (T[subscript 2] vs. T[subscript 0]: General Cognitive Index, ß = 3.90; 95% CI [0.51, 7.30], Verbal Score, ß = 4.28; 95% CI [0.51, 8.05], and Memory Score, ß = 4.14; 95% CI [0.62, 7.66]), effects equivalent to 0.26-0.29 SD. There were no significant benefits when the programs operated independently (T[subscript 1] vs. T[subscript 0]). In stratified analyses, EI showed significant effects in indigenous communities only. We found consistent results in regressions controlling for covariates, with some reductions in magnitude of differences. Our findings suggest that group-based, parenting support programs can improve child outcomes within the context of a CCT, but only when the 2 programs are integrated and mutually supportive.",

        "description":"Contemporary homes are filled with digital technologies, and children are exposed to them almost since birth, initiating their first digital experiences at very early ages (Chaudron et al., [Chaudron, S., 2015], &quot;Young children (0-8)&quot;). This trend is expected to become stronger, as our future has been envisioned around the concept of the IoT (Internet of Things), and the first smart toys are arriving at the homes of digitally savvy families. This study focuses on the digital practices of young children, looking particularly at smart toys, aiming to: a) explore how smart toys are being adopted by families, considering the perceptions of children and parents about drivers and barriers to adoption; and b) understand the domestication of smart toys. Our research is exploratory and builds on the theoretical framework, methodological protocols and ethical guidelines of the international projects &quot;Young Children (0-8) and Digital Technologies&quot; (Chaudron et al., [Chaudron, S., 2015], Chaudron et al., &quot;Young children (0-8)&quot;; Dias and Brito, 2016, 2017, &quot;Crianças (0 a 8 anos)&quot;) and &quot;Media and Social Discourses around Young Children and IoToys&quot; (Mascheroni &amp; Holloway, 2017). Our methodology is qualitative, based on visits to families including interviews with children and parents and participant observation. We selected a purposive sample of 21 medium- or high-income and digitally savvy families in Portugal. Concerning drivers and barriers for adoption, most children identify several smart toys and express interest in having them. Parents are motivated by the amount of satisfaction that the toy will afford the children and the added-value in terms of learning or developing skills. However, most parents prefer mechanical toys, sports or outdoors activities and the high price is an obstacle. Concerning domestication, smart toys are still scarce in homes and perceived as novelty, thus being in a very early stage of domestication.",

We also examined the effect of parental nutritional knowledge and childhood food involvement on food insecurity in young adulthood. We used data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics Original Childhood Development Supplement. Our balanced panel (n=1,305) was comprised of individuals who were 0-12 years old in 1997, had data on SNAP and income from their year of birth through 2015, food insecurity data in 2015/2017, and had moved out of their parents' home and started their own household prior to 2015. We estimated logistic models using sample, cluster and strata weights to generate nationally representative results. We find a small, but non-statistically significant effect of SNAP and WIC participation during childhood on odds of being food insecure during young adulthood. When examining change in food security from 1999-2015, we find that participation in SNAP during ages 0-5 years (OR 2.36, 95% CI: 0.99, 5.61), and during ages 12-18 years (OR 2.68, 95% CI: 1.09, 6.57) is associated with a higher odds of being more secure in 2015 than in 1999 compared to low income children who were eligible for, but did not participate in SNAP. Participation in both SNAP and WIC during ages 0-5 predicts higher odds (OR: 4.47, 95% CI: 2.04, 9.78) of being more secure in young adulthood than in childhood compared to low income children who were eligible for, but did not participate in SNAP or WIC. Finally, we saw a statistically significant protective effect of high parental nutritional knowledge (in 1999) and child time spent preparing food (during ages 5-12) on food insecurity risk in 2015-2017. SNAP and WIC, as well as parental nutritional knowledge and childhood food involvement appear to have some protective effect on food insecurity in young adulthood. Future research should further investigate the effects of nutrition education, nutrition assistance program participation, and involvement in food preparation on food insecurity over the short- and long-term.",

The earliest relative clauses we found in the data occur in topicalization constructions that are only a little different from simple sentences: they contain a single proposition, express the actor prior to other participants, assert new information and often occur with main-clause word order. In the course of the development, more complex relative constructions emerge, in which the relative clause is embedded in a fully-fledged main clause. We argue that German relative clauses develop in an incremental fashion from  simple non-embedded sentences that gradually evolve into complex sentence constructions.",

        "description":"Einstein's relation between mass and energy is perhaps the most famous equation of Physics. Despite its simplicity, the meaning of E[subscript 0] = mc[superscript 2] is not easy to grasp. Furthermore, its traditional derivations rely either on the integral of &quot;momentum,&quot; on properties of electromagnetic radiation, or even on the expression for transformation of energy. In the present work, we provide a simple thought experiment with an inelastic collision between two particles observed from two inertial reference frames. We show that for the conservation of relativistic &quot;momentum&quot; to hold, the mass of the system must increase after the collision. We also show that the increase of mass relates to the loss of kinetic energy according to the equation [delta]K = -[delta]mc[superscript 2], which enables us to define the equation for relativistic energy (E = mc[superscript 2]/ [equation omitted]), rest energy (E[subscript 0] = mc[superscript 2]) and relativistic kinetic energy (K = E - E[subscript 0]). There are two main advantages in this presentation: first, it relies only on simple algebra, not depending on differential calculus and on any property of radiation; second, it leads directly to a comprehensible physical meaning of the relation of equivalence, which can sometimes be too obscure in more formal derivations.",

Methods: The analysis was conducted in a sample of 309 secondary schools using 2012 Minnesota School Health Profiles surveys and National Center for Educational Statistics Common Core Data. Scores for overall support addressed school health improvement coordination (range: 0-29), collaboration on health education activities (range: 0-5), and teachers' professional preparation (range: 0-7). Results: Mean overall scores for health improvement coordination (10.5 ± 7.3), collaboration on health education activities (3.0 ± 1.5) and professional preparation (4.0 ± 1.9) indicated supports are lacking in schools across city, suburban, and rural locations. Comparison of overall scores did not identify disparities; however, weaknesses and strengths of particular relevance for rural schools were identified in examining specific aspects of support. For example, the proportion of rural schools having a written school improvement plan was 54.8% compared to 84.6% of city schools and 64.3% of suburban schools (p = 0.01). Conclusions: Tailored training and technical assistance are needed to better support schools in implementing recommended wellness policies and practices.",

Participants learned directions of 8 remote cities centered to Beijing or Edmonton, where the experiments occurred, using a map or using direct pointing. The map and the environment were aligned, and participants faced north (0°). Participants also learned locations of 7 objects on a table. Participants faced north (0°) during learning but were instructed to learn the layout along the northwest-southeast (45°-225°) axis. Judgments of relative direction (imagine you are standing at X, facing Y, point to Z) were used to determine spatial reference directions in retrieval of bearings between 2 objects or 2 cities. The results showed that when the tested bearing and the imagined heading were within an array, participants used 0° as the reference direction in retrieving bearings between cities but used 45°-225° to retrieve bearings between objects. When the tested bearing and the imagined heading were across 2 arrays, participants used the reference direction of the array from which the tested bearing was. These results indicated that bearings between items within an array were represented only with respect to the reference directions of this array and the relationship between spatial reference directions in these 2 arrays was also represented.",

Method: Ten listeners used direct magnitude estimation procedures to judge the articulation rates of 7 boys with FXS only, 5 boys with FXS and a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and 12 CA boys during sentence repetition. Sentences had similar articulation rates in syllables per second as determined acoustically. Four segmental/prosodic factors were used to predict perceived rate: (a) percentage consonants correct, (b) overall fundamental frequency (F[subscript 0]) level, (c) sentence-final F[subscript 0] drop, and (d) acoustically determined articulation rate with the final word of the sentence excluded. Results: Boys with FXS and ASD were judged to talk faster than CA controls. Multiple linear regression indicated that articulation rate with the final word of the sentence excluded and sentence-final F[subscript 0] drop accounted for 91% of the variance for perceived rate. Conclusions: Descriptions of speakers with FXS as having fast and/or fluctuating articulation rates may be influenced by autism status. Also, atypical sentence-final prosody may be related to perceived rate in boys with FXS and ASD.",

        "description":"Purpose: Three experiments measured benefit of spatial separation, benefit of binaural listening, and masking-level differences (MLDs) to assess age-related differences in binaural advantage. Method: Participants were younger and older adults with normal hearing through 4.0 kHz. Experiment 1 compared spatial benefit with and without head shadow. Sentences were at 0 degree, and speech-shaped noise was at 0 degree, 90 degree, or plus or minus 90 degree. Experiment 2 measured binaural benefit with the near ear unplugged compared with plugged for sentences at 0 degree and masker at 90 degree. Experiment 3 measured MLDs under earphones for 0.5-kHz pure tones in Gaussian and low-noise noise, and spondees in speech-shaped noise. Results: Spatial-separation benefit for speech did not differ significantly for younger and older adults but was smaller than predicted by an audibility-based model for older adults and larger than predicted for younger adults. Binaural listening benefit was observed for younger participants only. Tonal MLDs suggested that listeners benefit from interaural difference cues during noise dips for signals out of phase. Neither tonal nor speech MLDs differed significantly between younger and older participants. Conclusion: Binaural processing of sentences revealed some age-related deficits in the use of interaural difference cues, whereas no deficits were observed for more simple detection or recognition tasks.",

The five FPC methods described are distinguished from each other by how many times they update the prior ability distribution and by how many EM cycles they use. Specifically, the five FPC methods included no prior weights updating and one EM cycle (NWU-OEM) or multiple EM cycles (NWU-MEM), one prior weights updating and one EM cycle (OWU-OEM) or multiple EM cycles (OWU-MEM), and multiple weights updating and multiple EM cycles (MWU-MEM) methods. All the five FPC methods were evaluated in terms of recovery of the underlying ability distribution and item parameters. An important factor in the simulation was three different ability (normal) distributions--N(0, 1), N(0.5, 1.2[squared]), and N(1, 1.4[squared])--for FPC groups, with the fixed item parameters obtained with a reference N(0, 1) group. Only the MWU-MEM method appeared to perform properly under all the three distributions. Under the N(0, 1) distribution, the NWU-MEM and OWU-MEM methods also appeared to perform properly. Under the N(0.5, 1.2[squared]), and N(1, 1.4[squared]) distributions, however, the four methods other than the MWU-MEM method resulted in some or severe under-estimation in the recovery.",

        "description":"The conceptual development of natural number in preschoolers is well-researched. However, less is known about the conceptual development of zero. Recent studies suggest that children develop an understanding of zero after learning to count. It remains unclear, when a conceptual understanding of &quot;zero&quot; as number word for an empty set emerges. This paper integrates numerical and language theories about how, where and when the concept of zero is formed and is integrated into the class of natural numbers. The counting skills of 107 preschoolers were assessed for the number range between zero and eight as well as for their ordinal understanding of zero. The results show that compared to the natural numbers, zero was substantially more difficult. Children are able to list zero in a number word sequence (0, 1, 2, 3 .... or 3, 2, 1, 0), but were unable to describe a set as having zero numbers. This latter conception contradicts findings regarding natural numbers, in that an empty set is counter intuitive. Zero could be correctly placed when consecutive order was required, but addition and subtraction by counting was more difficult. The results suggest that the conceptual development of zero differs qualitatively from the natural numbers. Based on the results, the ordinal understanding of zero as a predecessor to one, together with its matching linguistic concepts is proposed to be the key to the conceptual development of zero.",

        "description":"Thai government schools have become multicultural due to an increasing number of migrant students whose parents are from neighboring ASEAN countries. Although published English language teaching (ELT) materials have been researched extensively, supplementary materials that are integrated as additional resources for teachers and students such as workbooks or activity books used in Thai government schools are under-researched. This study investigated the cultural diversity content represented in six ELT activity books used in a primary school located in Samut Sakhon province in Thailand. Cortazzi and Jin's (1999) cultural concept was employed as a framework to analyze layers of cultural diversity represented in the selected ELT activity books. Drawing upon content analysis, the findings reveal six cultural sources ranked in the following order: international cultures (40%), target cultures (23%), global cultures (17%), Asian regional cultures (16%), unidentified sources (4%), source cultures (0%), and ASEAN regional cultures (0%). Diverse international cultures are frequently incorporated into these activity books; however, source cultures referring to students' sociocultural backgrounds and ASEAN regional cultures are under-represented. This study proposes pedagogical implications for teachers who use local ELT activity books provided by the government, with regard to adapting and designing culturally appropriate lessons and activities for students in multicultural primary schools in Thailand in order to meet UNESCO SDG 4 (Quality Education).",

A priori coding and content analysis were used to identify preservice teachers' demonstrations of combinations of TPACK constructs. Findings indicated that preservice teachers demonstrated TPACK (41%) and combined Technological Content Knowledge and Pedagogical Content Knowledge most frequently (42%), Pedagogical Content Knowledge less frequently (13%), and other patterns rarely, combined Technological Content Knowledge and Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (1%), Technological Content Knowledge (1%), Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (0%) and combined Pedagogical Content Knowledge and Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (0%). This study cohered with previous research that found just under half of teachers demonstrated TPACK. However, it differed from previous studies that did not show patterns of Pedagogical Content Knowledge but Technological Pedagogical Knowledge, as our data showed Pedagogical Content Knowledge but not Technological Pedagogical Knowledge. Finally, it extended previous research by identifying patterns of literacy preservice teachers' demonstrations of TPACK in their elementary literacy lesson plans. It also demonstrated new ways of combining TPACK constructs (i.e., Technological Content Knowledge and Pedagogical Content Knowledge, Technological Content Knowledge and Technological Pedagogical Knowledge, and Pedagogical Content Knowledge and Technological Pedagogical Knowledge), which when used to code the data resulted in a more comprehensive definition of TPACK. Only 2% of the lesson plans did not demonstrate any of the combinations.",

This research used quantitative descriptive explorative approach. Data were collected through document study of lesson plan made by TPE participants assessed by lecturers in a workshop. In the sample were 236 respondents selected by using purposive sampling technique. The data analysis was performed to estimate participants' skill using Item Response Theory through Partial Credit Model (PCM). The estimation result produced the interpretation of items with 5 categories of scoring 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and has 4 thresholds such as the threshold of category 0 to category 1, category 1 to category 2, category 2 to category 3, and from category 3 to category 4. Besides that the information function value of the instrument and Standard Error of Measurement based on the analysis obtained items in the instrument which have higher information function value compared to the mistakes of the measurement or the estimation of measurement which has relatively small errors, so it can be stated that learning model is using accurate partial scoring to estimate the ability of TPE participants in composing lesson plans.",

The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the universality of emotion metaphorical conceptualization and the dominant pattern in English and Persian based on Kovecses's (2003) model for Linguistic expression of Metaphor. The emotions under study were happiness, anger, sadness, fear, and love. Lakoff and Johnson's (1980) Conceptual Metaphor Theory was adopted as a model for the purpose of comparison. To do so, 782 emotive metaphorical expressions were compiled from different literary works and related articles on the field and Dictionaries in both languages. The study was conducted through two main phases of categorization and comparison. First expressions were categorized under their general and specific target and source domains. At the second phase, in each category, metaphorical expressions were compared with based on their conceptual metaphor and literal meaning. At this phase, three patterns of totally the same, partially the same, and totally different were identified. Also the results of Chi-Square applied to these three patterns demonstrate that anger (?[superscript 2]= 108.85, P&lt;0/000) was the most universal emotion, whereas sadness (?[superscript 2] = 31.40, P&lt; 0/000) was the least universal emotion during this study. In addition, the dominant pattern at the end of analysis was the pattern of totally the same.",

All day (458) and evening (128) students, entering February 1976 and registered for six units or more, were surveyed. The survey instrument tested students' general knowledge of the House Plan, asking about House membership, counselors, House advisors and presidents, and elicited information about students' involvement in campus activities, asking the number of hours students worked per week, the hours spent in classes or labs per week, where they ate lunch over a six-week period, and extra-curricular activities. The differences between day and evening students by House for each of the information  areas explored are discussed. Of day students, 325 identified their House advisors and 322 their House presidents incorrectly. Over 44% of day students worked from 0-5 hours per week, while nearly 15% worked from 16-20 hours compared to 44% of evening students working 36-40 hours and 25% working 0-5 hours weekly. Nearly 41% of day and over 67% of night students spent less than 2 hours on campus weekly aside from class or lab attendance, and 544 students from both groups reported participation in no extra-curricular activities.

Palomar contracted with SBRI, a California State University San Marcos research organization, to conduct the survey. SBRI conducted 51 telephone interviews with employers of Palomar alumni; 50% of the employers surveyed were female, and 50% male. The businesses surveyed were evenly distributed by size, ranging from small to medium and possible large. Employers were asked to rate the competency of a Palomar graduate employee on a variety of job-related  skills using a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being the lowest possible skill level. The mean score for job-related conceptual knowledge was 7.94, 8.00 for technical knowledge, 8.44 for quality of work, and 8.50 for quality of education as it relates to job requirements. Results indicated that (1) 93% of employers would use Palomar graduates for future hiring needs; (2) 51% of employers felt that Palomar graduates were better prepared than their non-Palomar graduate counterparts; and (3) nearly all of the employers thought that an AA degree or a certificate greatly increased an employee's chances for advancement.

The three sections that were the focus of the study were offered in 2002 and 2003 by the same instructor. The course was offered as a traditional face-to-face class using PowerPoint presentations during all of the lectures. All sections incorporated several quizzes, hands-on activities, and a 50-question multiple choice final examination. There were 44 participants for whom there was complete information, 35 females and 9 males. The assumptions for the dependent t-test and the Wilcoxon test could not be met, so a quantile (sign) test was run to compare the pretest and posttest scores. The assumption  that the measurement scale be at least ordinal was met since the data comprised frequency counts, but random selection was not possible since students are not randomly assigned to classes. However, the students did not exhibit any obviously exclusive characteristics. The test indicated that the null hypothesis of no statistically significant difference between the pretest and posttest scores could be rejected at the p=0/.00024 level (13 higher and 0 lower). It is concluded, then, that there were differences relative to the pretest and posttest scores, suggesting that the class was effective for learning the measurement topics introduced.

This paper looks at health issues, particularly during ages 0-8, that may affect the educational outcomes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. Chapter 1 discusses the importance of the early years of life in terms of brain development and future potential; the low educational attainment of Indigenous students and low Indigenous participation in early childhood services; population statistics; and the national policy context on Indigenous education, including national efforts to accelerate Indigenous progress and recommendations on interagency cooperation between the health and education sectors. Chapter 2 summarizes findings on  nine health issues of concern: the lower life expectancy at birth and higher mortality rates at all ages for Indigenous Australians; low birth weight and failure to thrive; malnutrition and poor quality diet; high rates of infectious diseases and high incidence of educationally significant hearing impairment due to otitis media; social and emotional well-being; substance abuse; adolescent pregnancy; childhood trauma, including that related to family violence and child abuse; and childhood injuries. Chapter 3 describes Indigenous conceptions of health and well-being as encompassing family and community, and current initiatives that link community development and capacity building to childhood health issues. The appendix presents the Adelaide Declaration on National Goals for Schooling in  the 21st Century. (Contains 43 references.) (SV)",

        "description":"Nearly 100 Mexican American children and adolescents in grades 2-12 were interviewed in central Texas to determine their understanding of ethnicity and their attitudes toward their own ethnicity. Their responses were interpreted in relation to a developmental model with five stages or &quot;perspectives&quot; in reasoning about ethnicity. The first level, Level 0 (ages up to 6-7 years), involves primarily a physical perspective on ethnicity, in which children use skin color or facial features to make racial/ethnic classifications. Children at this level tend to base ethnic pride in either a generalized pride in themselves or a pride specific to their physical characteristics. Level 1 (ages 6-10) involves literal conceptions of ethnicity--awareness of nonobservable aspects of ethnicity such  as ancestry, cultural heritage, and language. At Level 2 (ages 8-12), children become aware of subtle social aspects of ethnicity such as social class status and ethnic bias. Level 3 (adolescence to early adulthood) involves a group perspective on ethnicity, in which youth can generalize across individuals and discrete experiences. Level 4 involves a multicultural perspective on ethnicity. Levels 0-3 are illustrated by subjects' responses to why they like being Mexican American and why someone would not like being Mexican American. An appendix categorizes children's and high school students' responses by various themes and compares them to similar responses from African American children. (SV)",

        "description":"Young children often learn less from video than face-to-face presentations. Meta-regression models were used to examine the average size of this difference (video deficit) and investigate moderators. An average deficit of about half of a standard deviation was reported across 122 independent effect sizes from 59 reports, involving children ages 0-6 years. Moderator analyses suggested (a) the deficit decreased with age, (b) object retrieval studies showed larger deficits than other domains, and (c) there was no difference between studies using live versus prerecorded video. Results are consistent with a multiple-mechanism explanation for the deficit. However, the analyses highlighted potential quality and publication bias issues that may have resulted in overestimation of the effect and should be addressed by future researchers.",

But now even platforms that can measure in two directions are quite affordable. In this work we used the PASCO 2-Axis Force Platform. The analysis of the data can serve as a nice illustration of qualitative or quantitative use of the impulse-momentum theorem p - p[subscript 0] = [image omitted][subscript t[subscript 0][superscript t] Fdt = I. The most common use of force platforms is to study the force from the base during the push-off period of a vertical jump. I think this is an activity of great value, and I would recommend it. The use of force platforms in teaching is well documented in research literature. (Contains 3 figures.)",

Development of estimation in this age range on 0-to-100 number lines followed the pattern observed previously with older children on 0-to-1,000 lines. Between kindergarten and second grade (6 and 8 years), patterns of estimates progressed from consistently logarithmic to a mixture of logarithmic and linear to a primarily linear pattern. Individual differences in number-line estimation correlated strongly with math achievement test scores, improved estimation accuracy proved attributable to increased linearity of estimates, and exposure to relevant experience tended to improve estimation accuracy.",

This paper shows and verifies that the spring constant in the linear range is inversely proportional to the number of windings and to the cube of its effective spring diameter. The linear range is taken in the region of force greater than a minimum value which is referred to as the initial force F[subscript 0]. The relationship between initial force F[subscript 0] and spring constant is still unclear. Shear modulus and Young's modulus of the spring material can then be calculated using the spring constant.

No group differences were found for laugh duration, mean fundamental frequency (F[subscript 0]) values, change in F[subscript 0], or number of laughs per bout.

Methodology: The scale was designed to be both broader and deeper than existing instruments that neglect one or more of these significant domains involved in early language. Items were chosen by a group of specialists with clinical experience working with the age group and with attention to the developmental literature. Caregivers were tested individually by a trained person who asked the questions and provided examples. In addition to an extensive health questionnaire, caregivers answered questions in Mandarin about their child's behaviour using a scale of 'not yet', 'sometimes' or 'always' or listing out words and/or sounds understood or said by the child. The 476 participating caregivers were recruited at maternal and child healthcare clinics centred in Chengdu, China, 191 of whom were tested a second time seven months later. The children were sampled in three-month age-bands from 0 to 36 months. The sample was balanced for child gender by age band, and parental education was balanced. Caregivers of 0-24-month-old children and caregivers of 12-36 months were each asked a different set of questions, to determine the appropriate age range and cutoff points for each question, requiring the sample size to be doubled for children aged 12-24 months. Results: The results were subject to item-response theory analysis to remove outlying items, and the resulting internal reliability was high for each domain (average Cronbach's alpha=0.87). The final instrument (between 67 and 113 questions in total) was refined to include the least redundant questions that had the highest intercorrelations, with attention paid to coverage of all domains across the age range. Two scales were developed: one for children 0-18 months, the second for children aged 18-36 months. The longitudinal design permitted the creation of growth curves and norms for each domain for six-month intervals from 0 to 36 months. A small sample of 32 parents of children with Down syndrome aged 18-36 months provided validation that the scales are highly sensitive to developmental delay. Conclusion: The instrument shows considerable promise for detecting early communication problems in children in China.",

The children in the videotape range in age from 0 to 5 years. The video is introduced by scenes of children enjoying books while narration discussing the impact of reading to children at a very early age is heard. The remaining portion of the video is divided into segments by years: 0-1, 1-2, 3-4, and 4-5 years. The video covers the developmental stages and reading behaviors children go through in each of the growing periods. The video shows infants chewing books and learning how to open books, older infants naming pictures and holding books upside down or turning pages backwards, and still older children  gradually using books and listening to stories in a more traditional way. Interaction with the child is stressed in the video. A review of the entire footage is seen at the end of the video (about 1 minute in length) where it is easily observed that children who are read to early on go from &quot;chewing books&quot; to &quot;reading books.&quot; The video uses graphics to make developmental points for each year. The video shows clearly what to expect children to do with books at different ages and how parents can facilitate their children's language skills and love of books by reading to them. (NKA)",

Method: Twenty-seven kindergarten children with SLI participated in a preliminary clinical trial using interactive book reading to teach 30 new words. Word learning was assessed at 4 points during treatment through a picture naming test. Results: The results indicate that the following performance during treatment was cause for concern, indicating a need to modify the treatment: naming 0-1 treated words correctly at Naming Test 1; naming 0-2 treated words correctly at Naming Test 2; naming 0-3 treated words correctly at Naming Test 3. In addition, the results showed that encoding was the primary limiting factor in word learning, but memory evolution also contributed (albeit to a lesser degree) to word learning success. Conclusion: Case illustrations demonstrate how a clinician's understanding of a child's word learning strengths and weaknesses develop over the course of treatment, substantiating the importance of regular data collection and clinical decision-making to ensure the best possible outcomes for each individual child.",

        "description":"Number line estimation (NLE) tasks are widely used to investigate numerical cognition, learning, and development, and as an instructional tool. Interpretation of these tasks generally involves an implicit expectation that responses are driven by the overall magnitudes of target numerals, in the sense that the particular digits conveying those magnitudes are unimportant. However, recent evidence shows that numbers with similar magnitudes but different leftmost digits are estimated very differently. For example, &quot;798&quot; is placed systematically much too far to the left of &quot;801&quot; in a 0-1000 NLE task by children aged 7-11 and adults. Here we ask whether this left digit effect generalizes to two-digit numerals in a 0-100 NLE task and whether it emerges in younger children. Children aged 5-8 (Study 1, N = 73), adults (Study 2, N = 44), and children aged 9-11 (Study 3, N = 27) completed a standard 0-100 NLE task on a touchscreen tablet. We observed left digit effects for two-digit numerals in children aged 8-11 and adults, with large effect sizes, demonstrating that these effects generalize to smaller numerical ranges. Left digit effects were not apparent in 5- to 7-year-olds, suggesting that these effects do not emerge at younger ages for smaller, more familiar numerical ranges. We discuss developmental emergence of left digit effects in number line estimation and implications within and beyond the field of cognitive development.",

        "description":"A new, simple classroom technique helps cell biology students understand principles of Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics. A student mimics the enzyme and the student's hand represents the enzyme's active site. The catalytic event is the transfer of marbles (substrate molecules) by hand from one plastic container to another. As predicted, increases in marble concentration increase the number of marbles transferred per unit time (initial rate, V[subscript 0]) until the turnover number becomes rate limiting and V[subscript 0] approaches the maximum velocity (V[subscript max]), as described by the Michaelis-Menten equation. With this demonstration, students visualize an important concept: the turnover number is constant and independent of marble concentration. A student assessment of this exercise showed that it helped students visualize the turnover number and V[subscript max] but not K[subscript m], the marble concentration at which V[subscript 0] is one-half V[subscript max]. To address the concept of K[subscript m], we use supplemental laboratory and lecture exercises. This exercise with plastic containers and marbles is equally suited to demonstrate the kinetics of carrier-mediated membrane transport. We conclude that this exercise helps students visualize the turnover number and V[subscript max] and gives students important insights into the kinetic parameters used to characterize the catalytic activity of enzymes and membrane transporters.

Inclusion criteria was cross-sectional and prospective studies examining associations between a potential correlate and fundamental motor skills in typically developing, apparently healthy children aged 0-4 years. Two independent reviewers performed screening and methodological quality assessment. Results: Eighty-three studies met eligibility criteria and were included. Thirteen studies were of high methodological quality. In children aged &lt;1 year, we found no evidence for family income, breastfeeding-related, sleep-related, home environment, and socioeconomic variables. In children aged 1-2 years, we found no evidence for sex, growth-related variables, singleton birth, and family income. In children aged 2-4 years, we found no evidence for screen behavior, toxicity, parental education, family income, socioeconomic variables, and maternal depression/anxiety and moderate evidence for a positive association with early childhood education and care setting type. For other examined correlates, we found insufficient evidence (inconsistent findings or only one study available).

        "description":"This article reviews the Social Responsiveness Scale-Second Edition (SRS-2), a 65-item rating scale measuring deficits in social behavior associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), as outlined by the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (4th ed., text rev.; &quot;DSM-IV-TR&quot;; American Psychiatric Association, 2000). The scale can be completed by multiple raters who have at least 1 month of experience with the rated individual. An &quot;average reading ability&quot; is said to be necessary to complete the record forms (Constantino &amp; Gruber, 2012, p. 3). Materials include an examiner&apos;s manual and record forms. The scale takes approximately 15 to 20 minutes to complete. The SRS-2 consists of four rating forms across three age ranges. The original SRS, now termed the School-Age Form, covers ages 4-0 to 18-0. Age ranges were extended down through preschool and up through adulthood, including a self-report form for individuals age 19 and above. The Preschool Form covers ages 2-6 to 4-6, the School-Age Form ages 4-0 through 18-0, and the Adult Form ages 19 through 89 years. The Preschool Form and School-Age Form can be rated by teachers or parents. The Adult Form allows for ratings by parents, spouses, friends, and relatives and also includes a separate self-report form. The author evaluates SRS-2 in terms of internal consistency, test-retest reliability, interrater reliability, content validity, mean differences, predictive validity, concurrent validity, and construct validity. It is concluded that the SRS-2 makes a unique contribution toward a comprehensive assessment of ASD, because it focuses specifically on aspects of social reciprocity and social communication. However, use of the results for planning instruction and interpretation of treatment subscale results should be conducted with caution because there are so few items within each subscale and stability data are lacking. Thus, this instrument could be used as one component in a more comprehensive evaluation that also employs information from interviews, direct observation, direct assessment, and curriculum-based measures.",

        "description":"The aim of our study was to assess the effect of the frequency of home exercise program (HEP) performance on pain [10-point visual analog scale (VAS)] in patients with osteoarthritis of the spine or knee after more than 6 months discharge from physical therapy (PT). We performed a retrospective chart review of 48 adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of knee or spine osteoarthritis and had been discharged from PT of the spine or the knee for at least 6 months with provision of HEP from a physical therapist. Adult patients who were younger than 50 years of age, taking more than one medication to control pain, participating in worker's compensation, or had a history of drug abuse were excluded from the study. We recorded patient demographics, pain level (10-point VAS scale), and the number of days that a HEP was performed per week. The mean VAS score of patients who performed 0 days of HEP per week was 6.90. The mean VAS score of patients who performed HEP 1-3 times per week was 6.36. The mean VAS score of patients who performed HEP 4-7 times per week was 5.00. Single-factor analysis of variance analysis indicated a P-value of less than 0.01. Post-hoc comparison of the mean VAS using Fisher's least significant difference test showed a significant difference between the mean VAS score of 4-7 days per week of HEP versus 0 days per week (P less than 0.01) and 1-3 days per week (P less than 0.01) of HEP. There was no significant difference in the mean VAS score between 0 days of HEP and 1-3 days of HEP (P greater than 0.05). Patients who performed 4-7 days per week of HEP had statistically significant lower mean VAS scores than patients who performed 0 days per week of HEP and 1-3 days per week of HEP. Therefore, after 6 months of discharge from PT, patients should be encouraged to perform at least 4 days of HEP per week. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"This paper examines the current status of programs for preschool children in Chile. Section 1 of the paper provides an overview of the situation of preschool children in Chile. The country's population includes more than 1.6 million children between the ages of 0 and 5 years 11 months, and in urban areas, 18.4 percent of children between the ages of 0 and 6 years live in extreme poverty. Figures on child mortality; incidence of malnutrition; norms for sensory, psychomotor, and intellectual development; and participation rates in preschool programs are presented. These presentations particularly focus on poor children. Section 2 discusses the objectives of and differences between infant care programs, which focus on ensuring the healthy development of all children, and preschool  education programs, which emphasize cultural, psychomotor, affective, and social development. Sections 3 and 4 describe the major public, private, and community-based young child welfare programs currently existing in the country. These programs include those which focus on nutrition, parent and family involvement, cultural development, and intellectual growth. The final section offers recommendations regarding the expansion of school readiness programs; the incorporation of popular culture into the content of programs; the clarification of the responsibilities of different government agencies; the expansion of access to care programs to children in urban areas; the implementation of parent education programs in rural areas; the development of community programs; the development of  compensatory, remedial, and cultural programs; and ways to meet other needs.

The study consisted of two experiments. In the first, 32 third- and fourth-grade students and 32 college students were divided, within each age group, into four delay groups: 0-hour, 4-hour, 1-day, and 7-day. In the second experiment, conducted to clarify a question of visual presentation arising in the first experiment, 16 college students were divided into two delay groups, 0-hour and 1-day. In the first experiment, subjects were presented with a continuous series of 200 nouns, half seen and  half heard, and asked to judge whether each word was &quot;new&quot; or &quot;old,&quot; and if &quot;old,&quot; whether it had previously appeared in the same or a different modality. A second test was administered after the appropriate delay for the group. The second experiment was conducted similarly, with a change in the visual presentation and with only two delay groups. Results show that the forgetting rates for effortfully encoded information (word identification) and for automatically encoded information (presentation modality) do not vary from middle childhood to early adulthood. However, modality identification declines gradually with time, while word identification remains high initially and declines rapidly later. Information about input modes lasted at least 4 hours in both children and adults, with some  remaining in memory for 7 days. (MSE)",

Firstly, the scale was translated and reviewed for language and cultural appropriateness. Secondly, the Arabic Jordanian version of the scale was administrated to children diagnosed as developmental delay aged from birth to 48 months in the neurodevelopmental pediatric clinic in Jordan university hospital, and on children aged 48 to 71 months who were diagnosed as developmental delay in special education centers in Capital Amman. The scale was administrated also to normal development children aged 0 to 71 months who visited the Institute for family health--Noor al Hussein foundation and attended preschools in Capital Amman. Total of 310 children aged (0-71 months) were enrolled. Construct validity and discriminative validity were verified. Reliability was established through computing Kuder-Richardson Formula 20 (KR-20), test-retest, split half test methods.t-test showed that the scale discriminates between normally developed and developmentally delayed children. One-way ANOVA showed that age has significant effect on the performance of children favoring older age groups using Scheffé multiple comparisons test. Item efficacy was determined by calculating point-biserial correlation coefficients for all items in each domain. The results showed that the scale had good psychometric properties and was capable of detecting developmental delay in children aged from birth to 71 months in Jordan.",

        "description":"Purpose: This study aims to reveal effects of content balancing and item selection method on ability estimation in computerized adaptive tests by comparing Fisher's maximum information (FMI) and likelihood weighted information (LWI) methods. Research Methods: Four groups of examinees (250, 500, 750, 1000) and a bank of 500 items with 10 different content domains were generated through Monte Carlo simulations. Examinee ability was estimated by fixing all settings except for the item selection methods mentioned. True and estimated ability (?) values were compared by dividing examinees into six subgroups. Moreover, the average number of items used was compared. Findings: The correlations decreased steadily as examinee ? level increased among all examinee groups when LWI was used. FMI had the same trend with the 250 and 500 examinees. Correlations for 750 examinees decreased as ? level increased as well, but they were somewhat steady with FMI. For 1000 examinees, FMI was not successful in estimating examinee ? accurately after ? subgroup 4. Moreover, when FMI was used, ? estimates had less error than LWI. The figures regarding the average items used indicated that LWI used fewer items in subgroups 1, 2, 3 and that FMI used less items in subgroups 4, 5, and 6. Implications for Research and Practice: The findings indicated that when content balancing is put into use, LWI is more suitable to estimate examinee ? for examinees between -3 and 0 and that FMI is more stable when examinee ? is above 0. An item selection algorithm combining these two item selection methods is recommended.",

One of the most important of these approaches is called benchmarking in the international literature, which is called &quot;the best of the best&quot; in businesses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Benchmarking approach of management and science concepts of sports enterprises operating in Elazig. The universe of the research is the sports enterprises in Turkey and the sample is the sports enterprises in Elazig province. The research was evaluated as collecting and analyzing benchmarking information. In the qualitative survey, sports and social facilities benchmarking services, financial data collection tool and sports facility participants questionnaire were applied. The questionnaire developed by Peter Taylor was translated into Turkish and validated and credible, and Cronbach alpha value a = 0, 816. A significant difference was observed when participants' participation in sports facilities in Elazig was examined in terms of place of birth according to the AnovaTukey test. As a result; Although there was a significant difference between the expectations of the participants coming to sports facilities operating in Elazig province (p &lt;0, 05), there was no significant difference between their satisfaction (p&gt; 0,05). Compared to the sports facilities in Elazig, it can be considered that there are many deficiencies in all sports facilities and that no professional management is used.",

The International Project for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) had as its primary objective to relate certain social, economic and pedagogic characteristics of the different systems to the outcomes of instruction in terms of student achievement and attitudes. We limit ourselves here to problems related to the different systems and focus on the problem given in the slogan \"Does more mean worse?\" The IEA mathematics survey comprised of 12 countries and random samples of about 133,000 pupils from 5,450 schools. Four target populations at the 13 year and pre-university level were sampled and tested in all the countries. The Science survey comprised of  258,000 students from 9,700 schools in 19 countries. The students were sampled by random from four large populations. (1) Students aged 10:0-10:11, when they, in all countries, still were taught by one teacher in a self-contained classroom. (2) Students aged 14:0-14:11. (3) Students in the last grade of the compulsory school. (4) Students in the grade from which transfer to the university occurs. The mathematics investigations revealed a sharply fluctuating average level between countries among students in the senior, pre-university class. However, these comparisons of arithmetic means were not especially interesting unless allowance was also made for variations between countries in their recruitment bases or \"retentivity.\" If that was done and equal proportions of cohorts were compared,  the variations turned out to be considerably less on an average.

        "description":"The Nation's Report Card[TM], the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), is a nationally representative and continuing assessment of what America's students know and can do in various subject areas. NAEP is a sample-based survey assessment that provides periodic reports on student academic performance at the national and state levels. The Trial Urban District Assessment (TUDA), a special project in NAEP, began assessing performance at the district level in selected large urban districts in 2002 with reading and writing assessments, and continued in 2003 and 2005 with reading and mathematics. Eleven large urban school districts participated in the 2005 NAEP reading assessment. This report provides the 2005 NAEP reading results for the participating districts. The report compares results to public school students' performance in the nation and in large central cities, and to results for the previous assessments in 2002 and 2003, where applicable, using a .05 significance level. In this report, NAEP results are presented in two ways: as average scale scores and as the percentage of students performing at or above three standards called achievement levels. NAEP reading scores are reported for grades 4 and 8 on a 0-500 scale. Separate scales are created for other subjects, so even when a subject's scale has the same numerical range (0-500), average scores should not be compared across subjects. The report is divided into the following sections: (1) Executive Summary; (2) Introduction and  Overall Performance; (3) Student Group Results; (4) Performance Trends; (5) Framework and Sample Questions; and (6) Technical Notes and Data Appendix.",

        "description":"This paper presents the results of an empirical survey conducted in the winter of 1995-96 among 413 Danish Internet users (business people, higher education/research and students). Data from a recent Danish Mediacenter Internet survey (n=2981) are also included. Findings indicate that women tend to use the Internet to solve well-defined problems, while men are inclined to serf the net (called &quot;net watching&quot; by serious users). In terms of information retrieval, female Internet users seem to be more goal-directed and convergent; in most cases they stop when the information has been found, while male Internet users have adopted a more divergent/explorative attitude. In this survey, the average user sent 13.3 messages per week (ranging from 0 to 170) and received 21.3 messages per  week (ranging from 0 to 1000). Survey respondents subscribed to 5.2 electronic conferences on the average; 59%, however, did not subscribe at all and 24.3% had limited themselves to fewer than six conferences. Most of the respondents were using Internet resources for information retrieval, which, in their opinion has improved the quality of their reference work to some extent; very few respondents expressed negative expectations in terms of the quality of Internet information sources. A recent survey among British business librarians revealed some disadvantages, including a lack of: organized information, information quality, relevant information, and reliable information, as well as too much information. The inevitable &quot;virtualization&quot; of libraries will necessarily include: the  replacement of printed matter by electronic information; increasing use of computer-mediated communications; and universal access to information.

        "description":"A study examined whether number of years of teaching, number of grant proposals written, and level of funding received were distinguished among K-12 teachers in relationship to factors perceived as motivating grant writing; obstacles encountered in grant writing; and needed support for continued grant writing. Questionnaires were mailed to 121 teachers in northwest Louisiana who submitted grants to a statewide competitive grant funding program. Of these 121 teachers, 89 completed and returned the questionnaires, producing a 74% response rate. Teachers were categorized into groups by years of teaching, number of grants written, and funding level achieved. Results indicated: (1) on the motivating factor variable &quot;Recognition from the School District,&quot; teachers receiving between $0  and $1000 in previous funding needed assistance in locating funding sources, grant budgeting, and technical assistance, and teachers receiving between $1000 and $5000 needed increased recognition to continue grant writing; (2) on the obstacle variables &quot;Knowledge of Funding Opportunities,&quot;&quot;Lack of Budgeting Knowledge,&quot;&quot;Lack of Technical Assistance&quot; distinguished between groups of teachers, with teachers receiving between $0 and $1000 in previous funding perceiving these as greater obstacles. On the needed support variable &quot;Management Difficulties,&quot; teachers having had the greatest amount of funding perceived this as a greater obstacle than teachers having a smaller dollar amount of grants funded. Findings suggest a significant positive correlation between number of grants written and  level of funding.

        "description":"When developing curriculum materials for new contexts, designers feed forward work from similar projects. This customization process must attend to various influences to determine how features from previous efforts will be emphasized and combined. This paper discusses resources and ideas that influenced the design of the RiverWeb Water Quality Simulator (WQS), which has been used in biology and environmental science as well as in a special summer enrichment program emphasizing chemistry. Project staff investigated related materials, including various online notebook strategies and watershed modeling curricula from the University of Michigan. The paper describes how the WQS resulted from the combination of these ideas with the digital watershed concept developed at the National  Center for Supercomputing Applications. Teachers may customize materials to more closely match their circumstances. The customization process for a Web-based simulation dictates a flexible architecture providing direct teacher modification such as addition of notebook questions and reorganization of resource links. In the Maryland Virtual High School Core Models Project, teacher leaders spent countless hours helping teachers do this, developing together, a more robust conceptual and pedagogical framework for the topic. The paper describes the nature of teachers' customization, which often reflected class level and discipline and local environmental features. Appended are computer screen print outs of the following program elements: WQS Map Page; WQS Graph Page: Station 0 Shown; Question  Designated by &quot;Location&quot;; Question for Comparing Sediments within Stations 0 and 2; View of Question List by Teacher; and WQS Concept Map for Environmental Science.

The institutions were located in Utah, South Dakota, South Carolina, Nebraska, and Pennsylvania and enrolled less than 10,000 full-time undergraduate students. A 5-point Likert scale was used in the evaluation with 5 indicating complete congruence between a CEC standard and a handbook requirement, and 0 indicating no congruence between the two. There was little congruence between the handbooks and the CEC standards, with only one  standard in the handbooks, length of the student teaching experience, awarded a mean score higher than 3. The handbooks were awarded mean scores between 2 and 3 on four CEC standards that generally dealt with the structure of the student teaching experience. On five standards concerning the objectives of a student teaching experience, the handbooks were awarded scores between 1 and 2. Mean scores between 0 and 1 were awarded to the handbooks on five standards that addressed the qualifications of the professionals involved, the quality of the sites, and the placement of student teachers in the sites. Only two of the handbooks were written specifically for student teaching in special education. Appendices include CEC standards for clinical experiences and a demographic questionnaire  completed by the special education programs. Contains 11 references. (TD)",

The study used FLCAS--Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale that was developed by Horwitz, Horwitz and Cope (1986) and was made validity and reliability by Horwitz (1986) as a data collection instrument and was made Turkish version of the scale (Gülsün). Alpha reliability coefficient of this scale has been found as 0.97. The participants are 314 students (from 27 countries) who are learning Turkish in GIH High School in Kayseri-Turkey. 314 students' responses were studied. The data were analysed using means, standard deviation, Tukey and t-test. Also the success situation of the students was defined according to mean of marks in the Turkish Language at the end of semester. According to the space of 0-44 was accepted &quot;not successful&quot;; the space of 45-100 was accepted &quot;successful&quot;. According to the space of 0-54 (1), between 55-69 (2), between 70-84 (3), and between 85-100 (4) have been recorded and described as low, moderate, good, very good. This study showed that the anxiety of the students who learn Turkish as a foreign language does not change with student degree, and student success status in Turkish language, but that alters with the purpose of learning Turkish, and their nationality.",

Methods: Classroom-based physical activity (CBPA) programs were used as an example to describe the process. Our team selected an implementation science framework and reviewed relevant CBPA literature to guide the development of a list of CBPA-specific implementation factors and definitions, mapped to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Science (CFIR). CBPA programs were identified from Internet searches and a coding guide was developed to facilitate the coding of program resources. Most implementation factors were coded by two independent coders (0= not addressed, 1=addressed minimally, 2=addressed more than minimally). Inter-rater agreement was calculated using percent agreement and intraclass correlation coefficients. Results: The coding guide included 51 CBPA-specific factors. Twenty-five of the 28 implementation factors coded by two coders had good-to-excellent and moderate inter-rater agreement, respectively. Dichotomizing these codes as 0 (not addressed) or 1 (addressed) resulted in all 28 having at least moderate agreement. This methodology/process could be applied to other types of health promotion programs and organizational settings. Implications: The repository that was created can guide the selection and supplementation of programs based on users' individual needs. Consideration of real-world implementation factors in the development and dissemination of health promotion programs is likely needed for such programs to have an increased impact on public health.",

        "description":"Participation in adult education and training opportunities over the entire life-course is necessary in international and technologically advanced economies. However, there is a dearth of literature on equitable access to lifelong education opportunities, particularly for at risk and underserved adults in the labor force. Furthermore, opportunities for financing lifelong learning remain minimal for middle-age and older adult populations. The purpose of this research is to explore strategies or alternative models to fund lifelong education with attention to the Individual Learning Account (ILA) schemes. We explore initiatives across four countries--Canada, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This research uses a qualitative descriptive approach to compare strategies to financing lifelong education targeting adult learners. Data were collected from key informant interviews (N=14), government documents, and research reports. Two major themes emerged that are common across all key informant interviews and documentation: (1) ILA offers key lessons in informing the creation of effective lifelong learning funding; (2) Low-income and low-skilled adults are often excluded from participation in ILA schemes. The authors' findings move adult education beyond a focus on providers of education to considering additional strategies for financing individual learning. [This paper was published in: J. P.

        "description":"This publication presents the challenges and opportunities confronting early childhood development in vulnerable urban contexts, derived from specialised research by Arup and the Bernard van Leer Foundation (BvLF). The data is clear: vulnerable urban areas such as refugee and informal settlements house a growing population in critical need, and the number and size of these areas will only increase in the coming decades. Living in these contexts has particularly significant negative impacts on young children aged 0 to 5. At present, governments, development and humanitarian organisations, and urban practitioners devote little attention to the specific needs of the 0-5 age group in projects aimed at improving conditions in informal and refugee settlements. This age group's needs are different than those of older children but are often 'lumped in' with them from a planning and policy perspective, or worse, go entirely unrecognised. In addition, the complexity of vulnerability in these contexts makes it difficult to design and implement effective early childhood development solutions that consider the influence of the built environment. Arup and BvLF have partnered to help bridge this gap. The Proximity of Care approach was developed to better understand the needs and constraints faced by young children, their caregivers, and pregnant women in informal and refugee settlements; and to ultimately help improve their living conditions and well-being.

        "description":"Background: Early childhood development (ECD) practitioners are crucial to young children's motor milestone achievement, motor development and physical activity (PA) participation. Their role in helping young children reach appropriate PA levels and gross motor milestones has not received sufficient attention. Aim: This study examined the contribution of ECD practitioners to the acquisition of gross motor milestones and PA participation in children aged 0-4 years. Setting: A literature search was conducted using specified search terms. Search parameters were set between 1994 and 26 May 2021. Methods: The Manual for Evidence Synthesis was used for this scoping review. The mapping of evidence based on research about the contribution of ECD practitioners to the acquisition of gross motor milestones and sufficient PA levels, particularly in children aged 0-4 years, was performed using the nine stages of the scoping review approach. Results: Early childhood development practitioner-led PA interventions positively influence children's overall PA, especially when thoroughly executed by sufficiently trained practitioners. In addition, ECD practitioners' PA correlated positively with children's PA. Conclusion: Physical activity interventions presented by ECD practitioners might have a positive influence on children's overall PA levels, if interventions were thoroughly executed and ECD practitioners received sufficient training. Gaps identified in the current literature include a lack of longitudinal studies and research investigating ECD practitioners' contribution to young children acquiring gross motor milestones. Contribution: The study contributed to the limited information regarding practitioners' contribution to gross motor milestone acquisition and adequate PA, highlighting several gaps where research is required.",

The spreadsheet calculations circumvent the construction and diagonalization of the Fock matrix and thus can be accomplished by any undergraduate chemistry student with basic calculus skills. The wave functions of the S[subscript 0], S[subscript 1], and T[subscript 1] states of H[subscript 2] are constructed from the symmetry-adapted bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals (MO). All quantum mechanical integrals are estimated using the Monte Carlo integration method. Due to the stochastic nature of the spreadsheet calculations, 25 runs were carried out to obtain the mean energy of the S[subscript 0], S[subscript 1], and T[subscript 1] electronic states of H[subscript 2]. The accuracy of the spreadsheet calculations is comparable to that of the HF/STO-3G calculations. The atomic and molecular orbitals and the energy components can be easily calculated and plotted for better visualization and understanding of essential quantum chemical concepts. This spreadsheet can also be adapted to tackle a wider range of quantum chemistry problems with different levels of complexity.",

Method: Eight 3-year-old children were exposed to a total of 8 novel word-object pairs across 2 story books presented digitally. Each story contained 4 novel consonant-vowel-consonant nonwords. Children were exposed to both stories, one in quiet and one in the presence of 4-talker babble presented at 0-dB signal-to-noise ratio. After each story, children's learning was tested with a referent selection task and a verbal recall (naming) task. Children were exposed to and tested on the novel word-object pairs on 5 separate days within a 2-week span. Results: A significant main effect of session was found for both referent selection and verbal recall. There was also a significant main effect of exposure condition on referent selection performance, with more referents correctly selected for word-object pairs that were presented in quiet compared to pairs presented in speech babble. Finally, children's verbal recall of novel words was statistically better than baseline performance (i.e., 0%) on Sessions 3-5 for words exposed in quiet, but only on Session 5 for words exposed in speech babble. Conclusions: These findings suggest that background speech babble at 0-dB signal-to-noise ratio disrupts novel word learning in preschool-age children. As a result, children may need more time and more exposures of a novel word before they can recognize or verbally recall it.",

        "description":"Purpose: Relative fundamental frequency (RFF) is an acoustic measure that is sensitive to functional voice differences in adults. The aim of the current study was to evaluate RFF in children, as there are known structural and functional differences between the pediatric and adult vocal mechanisms. Method: RFF was analyzed in 28 children with vocal fold nodules (CwVN, M = 9.0 years) and 28 children with typical voices (CwTV, M = 8.9 years). RFF is the instantaneous fundamental frequency (f[subscript 0]) of the 10 vocalic cycles during devoicing (vocal offset) and 10 vocalic cycles during the revoicing (vocal onset) of the vowels that surround a voiceless consonant. Each cycle's f[subscript 0] was normalized to a steady-state portion of the vowel. RFF values for the cycles closest to the voiceless consonant, that is, Offset Cycle 10 and Onset Cycle 1, were examined. Results: Average RFF values for Offset Cycle 10 and Onset Cycle 1 did not differ between CwVN and CwTV; however, within-subject variability of Offset Cycle 10 was decreased in CwVN. Across both groups, male children had lower Offset Cycle 10 RFF values as compared to female children. Additionally, Onset Cycle 1 values were decreased in younger children as compared to those of older children. Conclusions: Unlike previous work with adults, CwVN did not have significantly different RFF values than CwTV. Younger children had lower RFF values for Onset Cycle 1 than older children, suggesting that vocal onset f[subscript 0] may provide information on the maturity of the laryngeal motor system.",

        "description":"Children display an early sensitivity to implicit proportions (e.g., 1 of 5 apples vs. 3 of 4 apples), but have considerable difficulty in learning the explicit, symbolic proportions denoted by fractions (e.g., &quot;1/5&quot; vs. &quot;3/4&quot;). Theoretically, reducing the gap between representations of implicit versus explicit proportions would improve understanding of fractions, but little is known about how the representations develop and interact with one another. To address this, we asked 177 third, fourth, and fifth graders (M = 9.85 years, 87 girls, 69% White, 19% low income) to estimate the position of proportionally equivalent integers and fractions on number lines (e.g., 3 on a 0-8 number line vs. 3/8 on a 0-1 number line, Study 1). With increasing age, children's estimates of implicit and explicit proportions became more coherent, such that a child's estimates of fractions on a 0-1 number-line was a linear function of the same child's estimates of equivalent integers. To further investigate whether preexisting integer knowledge can facilitate fraction learning through analogy, we assigned 100 third to fifth graders (M = 10.04 years, 55 girls, 76% White) to an Alignment condition, where children estimated fractions and integers on aligned number lines, or to a No Alignment condition (Study 2). Results showed that aligning integers and fractions on number lines facilitated a better understanding of fractional magnitudes, and increased children's fraction estimation accuracy to the level of college students'. Together, findings suggest that analogies can play an important role in building a coherent understanding of proportions.",

We hypothesized that fusion would decrease and identification performance would improve with increasing onset asynchrony. Additionally, we hypothesized that HI listeners would gain more benefit from onset asynchrony. Method: A total of 18 adult subjects (nine NH, nine HI) participated. Testing included dichotic presentation of synthetic vowels, /i/, /u/, /a/, and /ae/. Vowel pairs were presented with the same or different fundamental frequency (f[subscript o]; f[subscript o] = 106.9,151.2, or 201.8 Hz) across the two ears and one onset asynchrony of 0, 1, 2, 4,10, or 20 ms throughout a block (one block = 80 runs). Subjects identified the one or two vowels that they perceived on a touchscreen. Subjects were not informed that two vowels were always presented or that there was onset asynchrony. Results: The effect of onset asynchrony on fusion and vowel identification was greatest in both groups when [delta]f[subscript o] = 0 Hz. Mean fusion scores across increasing onset asynchronies differed significantly between the two groups with HI listeners exhibiting less fusion across pooled [delta]f[subscript o]. There was no significant difference with identification performance. Conclusions: As onset asynchrony increased, dichotic vowel fusion decreased and identification performance improved. Onset asynchrony exerted a greater effect on fusion and identification of vowels when [delta]f[subscript o] = 0, especially in HI listeners. Therefore, the temporal cue promotes segregation in both groups of listeners, especially in HI listeners when the f[subscript o] cue was unavailable.",

        "description":"Objectives: To understand the current status of intellectually disabled children and the prevalence of intellectual disability (ID) in children aged 0-6 years and its risk factors, and to provide scientific evidence to formulate relevant policies for helping intellectually disabled children. Methods: Multiphase, stratified, unequal proportional and cluster sampling was adopted to investigate 60-124 children aged 0-6 years. All the children investigated were screened for ID using the Denver Developmental Screening Test, and those with positive screening test would be further diagnosed by varied specialists using the Gesell Developmental Inventory. Results: In total, 560 of 60-124 children were diagnosed as intellectually disabled with an overall prevalence of 0.93%. Prevalence of ID was highest in children living in medium-developed areas with a prevalence of 1.20%, higher than in those living in developed areas (0.75%) and in underdeveloped areas (0.84%). It was higher in rural areas (1.03%) than in urban areas (0.83%), and higher in boys (1.01%) than in girls (0.84%). Prevalence of ID increased with the age of children and decreased with the educational level of their parents. Conclusions: The study suggested that ID is still prevalent in the children of China, and rehabilitation for them is lagging behind current needs. Early prevention of ID in children and pre-school education for them should be strengthened.",

        "description":"The typical trigonometry, precalculus, or calculus student might not agree that logarithms are hot stuff, but we drew motivation from chili peppers to help students get a better taste for logarithms. The Scoville scale, which ranges from 0 to 16,000,000, has been the sole quantitative metric to measure the pungency (spiciness) of peppers since its creation in 1912. With justification from the Weber-Fechner Law (perception is the logarithm of stimulus), students were challenged to create a more palatable rating scale for chili peppers. The first author devised a simple but effective 0-10 rating scale for peppers, calling this new rating system the &quot;Ferven scale.&quot; While the Weber-Fechner Law has been applied to the senses of touch, sight, and hearing, this paper presents the first known application of this law to the sense of taste.",

Subjects included 11 untrained, male college students with C5, C6, or C7 complete quadriplegia and 11 able-bodied reference subjects. Exercise was performed on a Monark cycle ergometer modified for arm-cranking in the sitting position. Open-circuit spirometry was used to measure oxygen uptake. Impedance cardiography and ECG were utilized to measure stroke volume, heart rate, and ejection fraction. Results indicated that in quadriplegics, increases in VO sub 2 appear to be controlled primarily by 0 sub 2 extraction by peripheral tissues with very limited 0 sub 2 delivery capability. These findings support the  hypothesis that the functional syndrome of quadriplegia produces a set of predictable &quot;hypokinetic&quot; circulatory responses to dynamic arm exercise.

Three systematic focal behavior partitions are examined: Across activities, across time, and across activities and time. A student's performance is focal if it ends in 0 or 5 for push-ups and 0 for curl-ups. Chi-square tests confirm that individual focal outcomes and systematic focal outcomes occur more frequently than random processes would suggest. In each instance, the only cell that is less populated than random processes would suggest is the one that exhibits no systematic focal behavior and the cell that exhibits the greatest deviation from expected is the full focal cell. Focal students outperform their peers on three activities at two assessments. Students with two-systematically focal outcomes have superior performance to students with no systematic focal outcomes but inferior performance to those with three or four focal outcomes.",

There is much variety in the wording and number of response options used, which limits comparability across surveys. To solve this problem, descriptive statistics of the discrete distribution in the sample are often transformed to a common discrete secondary scale, mostly ranging from 0 to 10. In an earlier publication we proposed a method for estimating statistics of the corresponding continuous distribution in the population (Kalmijn 2010). In the present paper we extend this method to questions using numerical response scales. The application of this \"continuum approach\" to results obtained using the often used 1-10 numerical scale can make these comparable to those obtained on the basis of verbal response scales.

In this article, I argue that Gaelic Early Years practitioners insufficiently understand the potential of song in relation to Gaelic language acquisition with young children and their families. Although it is common practice to integrate Gaelic translations of popular English children's songs into Gaelic playgroups, these songs often distort and misrepresent the Gaelic language's rhythms and grammar. With the connected aspects of phrasing, inflexion and rhythm, music and language are closely related. Shared singing activities hold great potential in advancing young children's growing linguistic skills in first and additional language acquisition. Maximising the benefit, however, requires a highly skilled, knowledgeable and responsive practitioner base and a clearly developed teaching strategy.",

In the current study, we ask whether infants aged 1 ; 0 store stress information in their representations of words even when it not required for the task. To this end, we taught infants novel, three-syllable word-object pairings. At test, we manipulated the word by presenting infants with forms that shared the stress pattern of the familiar words but differed in the segments, and forms that shared the segments of the familiar word but differed in the stress pattern. Our findings reveal that infants' representations of new words include word-level stress information and do not simply contain the information critical for distinguishing between different forms.",

Productivity under the 100% incentive condition was consistently higher than under the 10% condition for all participants.

        "description":"Background: Previous work has inconsistently reported difficulties with response reversal/extinction in children with psychopathic tendencies. Method: We tested the hypothesis that the degree of impairment seen in children with psychopathic tendencies is a function of the salience of contingency change. We investigated the performance of children with psychopathic tendencies on a novel probabilistic response reversal task involving four conditions with gradated reward-punishment contingencies (100-0, 90-10, 80-20 and 70-30; i.e., for the 100-0 contingency, responding to one object is always rewarded while responding to the other is always punished). Results: In line with predictions, the impairment seen in the children with psychopathic tendencies was an inverse function of the salience of the contingency change. Conclusions: We suggest that this data is consistent with suggestions of subtle orbital frontal cortex impairment in children with psychopathic tendencies.",

Children between kindergarten and 4th grade were asked to solve 4 types of numerical estimation problems: computational, numerosity, measurement, and number line. In Experiment 1, kindergartners and 1st, 2nd, and 3rd graders were presented problems involving the numbers 0-100; in Experiment 2, 2nd and 4th graders were presented problems involving the numbers 0-1,000. Parallel developmental trends, involving increasing reliance on linear representations of numbers and decreasing reliance on logarithmic ones, emerged across different types of estimation. Consistent individual differences across tasks were also apparent, and all types of estimation skill were positively related to math achievement test scores.

We show how straightforward use of the most obvious properties of the Airy function solutions and simple Taylor expansions gives closed form results for the Stark shifts in both systems. These exact results are then compared to other approximation techniques, such as perturbation theory and WKB methods.

Lobb discovered an interesting generalization of Catalan's parenthesization problem, namely: Find the number L(n, m) of arrangements of n + m positive ones and n - m negative ones such that every partial sum is nonnegative, where 0 = m = n. This article uses Lobb's formula, L(n, m) = (2m + 1)/(n + m + 1) C(2n, n + m), where C is the usual binomial coefficient, to prove that L(n, m) is odd for all m if and only if either n = 0 or n is a Mersenne number. It follows that L(n, m) and the Catalan number C[subscript n] have the same parity. We also show that L(n, m) = C(2n, n - m) - C(2n, n - m - 1), so every Lobb number can be read from Pascal's triangle. In addition to other interesting combinatorial identities, we establish that every Catalan number C[subscript 2n] is the sum of n + 1 squares.",

Data from 30 typically developing infants, aged 0-20 months, show that older infants attained higher developmental levels on the SAEVD-R than younger infants. Infants 0-2, 3-5, and 6-8 months of age primarily produced vocalizations from Levels 1 (Reflexive), 2 (Control of Phonation), and 3 (Expansion). Infants 9-20 months of age also produced vocalizations from Level 4 (Basic Canonical Syllables). Only infants from 16-20 months of age produced Level 5 (Advanced Forms) vocalizations in significant quantities. The outcomes indicate that the SAEVD-R is a valuable instrument for evaluating prelinguistic vocal development. (Contains 1 table and 2 figures.)",

In 2 cross-modal identity-priming experiments, participants heard prime words and nonwords beginning with voiced plosives with 12, 6, or 0 periods of prevoicing or matched items beginning with voiceless plosives and made lexical decisions to visual tokens of those items. Six-period primes had the same effect as 12-period primes. Zero-period primes had a different effect, but only when their voiceless counterparts were real words. Listeners could nevertheless discriminate the 6-period primes from the 12- and 0-period primes. Phonetic detail appears to influence lexical access only to the extent that it is useful: In Dutch, presence versus absence of prevoicing is more informative than amount of prevoicing.",

Newborns were able to extract from a face the visual information lying from 0 to 1 cpd (Experiment 1), but only a narrower 0-0.5 cpd spatial frequency range was successful to accomplish face recognition (Experiment 2).

In both studies, NWR accuracy was significantly related to vocabulary percentile and, furthermore, uniquely accounted for a substantial portion of the variance in vocabulary when real word repetition accuracy was held constant.

This article deals with the \"Level 0\" assessment of the draft plan. In this article, the author talks about involving stakeholders as critical friends in assessing the draft plan. She talks about organizing a process to scrutinize the draft. She also talks about some perspectives or tools to use in scrutinizing the draft plan: (1) the National Staff Development Council Standards (Revised 2001); (2) content area national standards and state frameworks; (3) underlying research; (4) alignment with student learning priorities; (5) timeline; (6) models of professional development; (7) formative assessment; (8) change and collaboration; (9) follow-up; (10) resources; and (11) own lessons learned.",

        "author":["Koretz, Daniel",
          "Kim, Young-Suk"],
        "description":"In a pair of recent studies, Fryer and Levitt (2004a, 2004b) analyzed the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study--Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) to explore the characteristics of the Black-White test score gap in young children. They found that the gap grew markedly between kindergarten and the third grade and that they could predict the gap from measured characteristics in kindergarten but not in the third grade. In addition, they found that the widening of the gap was differential across areas of knowledge and skill, with Blacks falling behind in all areas other than the most basic. They raised the possibility that Black and Whites may not be on \"parallel trajectories\" and that Blacks, as they go through school, may never master some skills mastered by Whites. This study re-analyzes the ECLS-K data to address this last question. We find that the scores used by Fryer and Levitt (proficiency probability scores, or PPS) do not support the hypothesis of differential growth of the gap. The patterns they found reflect the nonlinear relationships between overall proficiency, [0] , and the PPS variables, as well as ceiling effects in the PPS distributions. Moreover, [0] is a sufficient statistic for the PPS variables, and therefore, PPS variables merely re-express the overall mean difference between groups and contain no information about qualitative differences in performance between Black and White students at similar levels of [0] . We therefore carried out differential item functioning (DIF) analyses of all items in all rounds of the ECLS-K through grade 5 (Round 6), excluding only the fall of grade 1 (which was a very small sample) and subsamples in which there were too few Black students for reasonable  analysis. We found no relevant patterns in the distribution of the DIF statistics or in the  characteristics of the items showing DIF that support the notion of differential divergence, other than in kindergarten and the first grade, where DIF favoring Blacks tended to be on items tapping simple skills taught outside of school (e.g., number recognition), while DIF disfavoring Blacks tended to be on material taught more in school (e.g., arithmetic). However, there were exceptions to this. Moreover, because of its construction and reporting, the ECLS-K data were not ideal for addressing this question, and data better suited to the purpose might show differential divergence across areas of knowledge and skill. The paper concludes by advising secondary analysts examining this question to be wary of aspects of test design that may influence the results and to be sensitive to likely variations in findings across databases.

Bivariate and multivariate analyses of the data showed the overall 12-month prevalence estimate of bullying victimisation to be 55 · 1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 50% - 60%), but the estimates were comparable between females (52 · 0%) and males (57 · 0%). Whereas deaf adolescents with schoolwork problems were likely to report bullying victimisation, most of the key factors associated with bullying victimisation were adverse social events -- break-up, conflict with friends, and parental divorce.

This study aims to examine: (1) the general pattern for perceived intergenerational paternal involvement and fathers' own involvement; and (2) the influence of the perceived intergenerational paternal involvement on father's involvement in the lives of their 0-to-8-year-old children. 528 biological-resident fathers participated to the study. The descriptive and MANOVA analyses indicated that paternal involvement in the family of origin and current father involvement levels were high in terms of the provider role, yet low in terms of the availability. Moreover, the study indicated that perceived intergenerational paternal involvement is only influential for two types of father involvement.",

The qualitative data were collected from 31 students, who represent students across all competency levels, through semi-structured and clinical interviews. The results showed that main difficulties of students, whose competency was level-0 or below, were making sense of statements/questions, explaining ideas about the problem. The students, whose competency level was level-1 and level weighted-1, had challenges in explaining a mathematical result or presenting a verbal/written justification. Finally, self-efficacy, anxiety and openness to problem solving of students, whose competency was level-0 or below, differed significantly from other students.",

An initial difference in temperature of 3.2 °C enabled warmer water to reach 0 °C in 14% less time than colder water. Convection currents in the liquid generate a temperature gradient that causes more rapid heat loss by surface radiation and evaporation than obtains for uniform temperature. This more rapid cooling enables the initially warmer liquid to overtake the cooler liquid, reaching 0 °C earlier and freezing first. Liquid cooling under natural convection follows a five-fourths power law (temperature of liquid T, temperature of surroundings Ta, cooling constant k): dT divided by dt = k(T - T[subscript a])5 divided by 4. In this investigation we found that with evaporation this becomes a four-thirds power law: dT divided by dt = k(T - T[subscript a])4 divided by 3.",

Groups scored comparably low on the pre-test (p = 0.7113). Students in the mnemonic arm performed better on the Week 0 post-test than those using rote (p = 0.0055). By Week 4, there was evidence of knowledge decay, with both arms' having comparably low scores (mnemonic vs. rote, p = 0.3739). The mnemonic assists in rapid acquisition of knowledge but probably has to be reviewed iteratively over time to demonstrate its full potential over rote memorization.

If the ratings of the two raters do not show agreement but are not random, the current tests, some of which are based on Cohen's kappa, will often reject the null hypothesis, leading to the wrong conclusion that agreement is present. A new test of interrater agreement, applicable to nominal or ordinal categories, is presented. The test statistic can be expressed as a ratio (labeled Q[subscript A], ranging from 0 to infinity) or as a proportion (labeled P[subscript A], ranging from 0 to 1). This test weighs information supporting agreement with information supporting disagreement. This new test's effectiveness (power and specificity) is compared with five other tests of interrater agreement in a series of Monte Carlo simulations. The new test, although slightly less powerful than the other tests reviewed, is the only one sensitive to agreement only. We also introduce confidence intervals on the proportion of agreement.",

There are many possible ways of solving this problem, leading to the well-known answer of ? = p/4, producing a maximum range of D[subscript max] = v[superscript 2][subscript 0]/g, with &quot;g&quot; being the free-fall acceleration. Conceptually and calculationally more difficult problems have been suggested to improve student proficiency in projectile motion, with the most famous example being the Tarzan swing problem. The problem of determining the maximum distance of a point mass thrown from constant-speed circular motion is presented and analyzed in detail in this text. The calculational results confirm several conceptually derived conclusions regarding the initial throw position and provide some details on the angles and the way of throwing (underhand or overhand) that produce the maximum throw distance.",

        "description":"Although it has been often hypothesized that children learn to produce new sound patterns first in frequently heard words, the available evidence in support of this claim is inconclusive. To re-examine this question, we conducted a survival analysis of word-initial consonant clusters produced by three children in the Providence Corpus (0 ; 11-4 ; 0). The analysis took account of several lexical factors in addition to lexical input frequency, including the age of first production, production frequency, neighborhood density and number of phonemes. The results showed that lexical input frequency was a significant predictor of the age at which the accuracy level of cluster production in each word first reached 80%. The magnitude of the frequency effect differed across cluster types. Our findings indicate that some of the between-word variance found in the development of sound production can indeed be attributed to the frequency of words in the child&apos;s ambient language.",

After a short description of the procedures used in adapting the CDI to Norwegian and the selection of participants, we discuss the advantages and potential pitfalls of using web-based forms as a method of data collection. We found that use of web-based forms was far less time-consuming, and therefore also far less expensive than the traditional paper-based forms. The risk of coding errors was virtually eliminated with this method. We conclude that in a society with high access to the Internet, this is a method well worth pursuing.",

Associative structure (the probability that a word appears with its free associates), contextual diversity, word repetitions and frequency were compared longitudinally across six language corpora, with four corpora of language directed at children aged 1 ; 0 to 5 ; 0, and two adult-directed corpora representing spoken and written language. Statistics were adjusted relative to shuffled corpora. Child-directed language was found to be more associative, repetitive and consistent than adult-directed language. Moreover, these statistical properties of child-directed language better predicted word acquisition than the same statistics in adult-directed language. Word frequency and repetitions were the best predictors within word classes (nouns, verbs, adjectives and function words). For all word classes combined, associative structure, contextual diversity and word repetitions best predicted language acquisition. These results support the hypothesis that child-directed language is structured in ways that facilitate language acquisition.",

        "description":"This study investigated whether some factors regarding especially pregnancy and post-pregnancy and 0-36-month-old infants' exposure to digital screens played a role in the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) scores of 4-11-year-old children. The cross-sectional research method was used. The sample consisted of the mothers of 2835 (48.2%) daughters and 3042 (51.8%) sons. The children of the mothers in the sample were between 4 and 11 years old. The mothers were asked to fill in the personal information form about their children and the Conners Parent Rating Scale to determine the ADHD score of the child. The main results revealed associations between ADHD and digital screen exposure at 0-36 months. In conclusion, exposure to digital screen--whether much or little--for the purposes of feeding, silencing, distraction, language acquisition, and digital gaming might pose a serious risk for ADHD.",

In this paper the reliability of five commonly used measures is assessed using a large longitudinal corpus of spontaneous speech from forty infants (age 0 ; 6-2 ; 0). In a first experiment it is shown that establishing the onset of babbling with reasonable (95%) confidence is impossible when the measures are computed only once, and when the number of vocalizations are not equal for all children at all ages. In addition, each measure requires a different minimal sample size. In the second experiment a robust procedure is proposed and formally defined that permits the identification of the onset of babbling with 95% confidence. The bootstrapping procedure involves extensive resampling and requires relatively few data. (Contains 1 footnote.)",

The percentage of body fat (%BF) by anthropometry was significantly correlated (r = .896-. 929; p [is less than] .01) with DXA, but each equation underestimated %BF (3.2-5.6 %BF; p <. 01). The following DXA criterion (DC) equation was created: %BF= -6.40665 + 0.41946($3SF) - 0. 00126[(S38F).sup.2] + 0. 12515(hip) + 0.06473 (age); (S3SF= sum of triceps, suprailiac, thigh; hip = circumference in cm; age =years). The predicted residual sum of squares (PRESS) [R.sup.2] was high (0.86), and the PRESS standard error of estimate (SEE) was low (2.5 % BF) for our sample of 150 women. The DC equation was further crosschecked on a separate sample of women (n = 25) and again showed excellent agreement. The DC equation appears to be a more accurate estimation of %BF in women.",

Suprasegmental features of oral reading were measured in 2nd- and 3rd-grade children (N = 123) and 24 adults. Reading comprehension and word decoding skills were assessed. Children with faster decoding speed made shorter and less variable intersentential pauses, shorter intrasentential pauses, larger sentence-final fundamental frequency (F-sub-0) declinations, and better matched the adult prosodic F-sub-0 profile. Two structural equation models found evidence of a relationship between decoding speed and reading prosody as well as decoding speed and comprehension.

Korean obstruents are characterized by a three-way contrast among stops and affricates (i.e. fortis, aspirated and lenis) and a two-way fricative contrast (i.e. fortis and lenis). All these obstruents are voiceless word-initially. Cross-sectional data were collected from forty Korean children aged 2 ; 6 (year;month), 3 ; 0, 3 ; 6 and 4 ; 0, and the acquisition patterns of Korean obstruents were explored based on productions of mono- and multisyllabic words. Results confirm the universal patterns: stops were acquired before affricates and fricatives. In terms of order of acquisition across different laryngeal types, lenis stops were the last to be acquired. For Korean fricatives, in contrast, the lenis category appears to be acquired earlier than the fortis category. This study proposes that this order of acquisition may be explained by articulatory complexity associated with language-specific phonetic properties.",

Some interactions limit the applicability of an error pattern, and others extend it to more words. Theories predict that error patterns interact to their full potential. While specific interactions have been documented for certain pairs of processes, no developmental study has shown that the range of typologically predicted interactions occurs for those processes. To determine whether this anomaly is an accidental gap or a systematic peculiarity of particular error patterns, two commonly occurring processes were considered, namely Deaffrication and Consonant Harmony. Results are reported from a cross-sectional and longitudinal study of twelve children (age 3 ; 0-5 ; 0) with functional phonological delays. Three interaction types were attested to varying degrees. The longitudinal results further instantiated the typology and revealed a characteristic trajectory of change. Implications of these findings are explored.",

The research hypothesis was that academic outcome could be explained through an interdisciplinary model, by integrating proven theories from educational psychology (learning style) and anthropology (culture). The literature review included interdisciplinary and rival theories to make the research useful for global practitioners. Technical discussion was minimized, focusing on the pedagogical implications of a generalized least squares regression model, which was statistically significant (r[squared] = 0.87; chi[superscript 2] = 0, df = 0, p less than 0.0001; n = 715).

A known linear recurrence is then obtained and the m-th sum, S[subscript m], is expressed in terms of the preceding ones, S[subscript m]?1 , S[subscript m]?2,...., S[subscript 0]. This recurrence, which has been derived previously by methods other than the one used here, is solved explicitly for S[subscript m]. The final result is expressed in the form of a determinant of order (m + 1) by (m + 1). A comparison is made with other methods, including Inaba's recent approach in this journal.",

The distribution of prosodic patterns--the number of syllables and stress patterns--is analyzed across three lexical categories, distinguishing not only between open- and closed-class items, but also between these two categories and a third, innovative, class, referred to as between-class items. Results indicate that Hebrew CDS consists mainly of mono- and bisyllabic words, with differences between lexical categories; and that the most common stress pattern is word-final, with parallel distributions found for all categories. Additional analyses showed that verbs take word-final stress, but nouns are both trochaic and iambic. Finally, a developmental analysis indicates a significant increase in the number of iambic words in CDS. These findings have clear implications regarding the use of prosody for word segmentation and assignment of lexical class in infancy.",

We describe a dynamic field model for understanding this balance in infant perseverative reaching. The model predictions are tested with regard to the interaction of two aspects of the typical perseverative reaching task: the visual cue indicating the target and the memory demand created by the delay imposed between cueing and reaching. The memory demand was manipulated by imposing either a 0- or a 3-second delay, and the salience of the cue to reach was systematically varied. Infants demonstrated fewer perseverative errors at 0-delay versus 3-second delay based on the cue salience, such that a more salient visual cue was necessary to overcome a longer delay. These results have important implications for understanding both the basic perceptual-motor processes that produce reaching in infants and skilled flexible behavior in general.",

We provide the first evaluation of the relation between input frequency and age of acquisition for a large sample of words. The MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory provides norming data on age of acquisition for 562 individual words collected from the parents of children aged 0 ; 8 to 2 ; 6. The CHILDES database provides estimates of frequency with which parents use these words with their children (age: 0 ; 7-7 ; 5; mean age: 36 months). For production, across all words higher parental frequency is associated with later acquisition. Within lexical categories, however, higher frequency is related to earlier acquisition. For comprehension, parental frequency correlates significantly with the age of acquisition only for common nouns. Frequency effects change with development. Thus, frequency impacts vocabulary acquisition in a complex interaction with category, modality and developmental stage.",

Previous research indicates that preschoolers may have a fragile (i.e., unreliable or localized) understanding of the addition-subtraction inverse principle (e.g., 2 + 1 - 1 = 2). Recognition of a small collection's cardinal value and computational experience, particularly with subtractive negation, may play a key role in the construction of an understanding of inversion. Testing with eighty 3 to 7 year olds revealed that most children demonstrated a reliable and general understanding of subtractive negation and identity at 4 years of age. In contrast, such an understanding of the inverse principle was not achieved by most children until 6 years of age and was preceded by recognition of \"two\" and \"three\" and an understanding of subtractive negation and identity.

In particular, part of this research is focusing on misconceptions held by students. For instance, a set of misconceptions is associated with the concept of stationary states. In this paper, we argue that a possible way to remove these is to solve the Schrodinger equation using the evolution operator method (EOM), and stress the fact that to find stationary states is only the first step in solving that equation. The EOM consists in solving the Schrodinger equation by direct integration, i.e. [psi](x, t) = U(t)[psi](x, 0), where U(t) = e[superscript -itH/h] is the time evolution operator, and [psi](x, 0) is the initial state. We apply the evolution operator method in the case of the harmonic oscillator. (Contains 5 figures.)",

This typically leads to an overstatement of the precision of results and anticonservative conclusions about precision and statistical significance of treatment effects. This article gives a simple correction to the t statistic that would be computed if clustering were (incorrectly) ignored. The correction is a multiplicative factor depending on the total sample size, the cluster size, and the intraclass correlation [rho]. The corrected t statistic has Student's t distribution with reduced degrees of freedom. The corrected statistic reduces to the t statistic computed by ignoring clustering when [rho] = 0. It reduces to the t statistic computed using cluster means when [rho] = 1. If 0 [less than] [rho] [less than] 1, it lies between these two, and the degrees of freedom are in between those corresponding to these two extremes. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"A study was conducted at the Community College of Philadelphia (CCP) to examine characteristics and outcomes for 216 former students who had transferred to State System of Higher Education (SSHE) universities in fall 1993. The SSHE universities provided data on the students regarding major, credits transferred, current enrollment status, cumulative grade point average (GPA), gender, race, and age. In addition, CCP collected information from the institutional database on graduation status, number of semesters enrolled, and cumulative credits earned at CCP. Study findings included the following: (1) while females comprised approximately two-thirds of the student body at CCP, only 48.1% of the transfers were female; (2) 79.2% of the transfer students were between 18 and 25 years of  age, 9.3% were between 26 and 30, 7.3% were between 31 and 40, and 4.2% were 41 or older; (3) 48.4% of the students were White, while 45.6% were Black; (4) an average of 68 credits were transferred; (5) 62.8% earned a GPA between 2.0 and 2.99 at the transfer university, while 19.6% earned a GPA between 3.0 and 4.0, and 17.6% between 0 and 1.99; (6) at CCP, 55.5% of the transfers had earned a GPA between 2.0 and 2.99, 36.6% between 3.0 and 4.0, and 7.9% between 0 and 1.99; (7) over half of the students had enrolled at CCP for 4 to 8 semesters, and 30.1% had earned either an associate degree or certificate prior to transfer; and (8) the most common programs of study at SSHE universities were education, business, and social science programs.

The research was carried on second and third years in-service student teachers of mathematics pursuing a diploma programme by distance learning at Mufulira college of Education on the Copperbelt province of Zambia. The sample size was made up of 70 in-service student teachers comprising in terms of gender, 30 female and 40 male students.The research design used for the study was a mixed method involving survey and qualitative methods. Data collected were analyzed quantitatively using the Angel Gutierrez and Adela Jaime and the Van Hiele models. The SPSS software was used to find simple descriptive data such as the mean and standard deviations. A simple t- Test was also performed on the data.In-service mathematics students demonstrated limited understanding of the Van Hiele level 3 through to level 4. These findings raised questions about their ability and competency if questions and problems go a little bit beyond the text book questions. Difficulties encountered by in-service teachers in their learning of transformational geometry; reflection and rotation were: reflection of figure in other mirror lines apart from (x = 0, y = x, y = -x and y = 0), rotation of geometrical figures with different centres apart from the origin, describing or writing the equation of the line of reflection.",

        "description":"The surgical theatre educational environment measures STEEM, OREEM and mini-STEEM for students (student-STEEM) comprise an up to now disregarded systematic overestimation (OE) due to inaccurate percentage calculation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the magnitude of and suggest a correction for this systematic bias. After an initial theoretical exploration of the problem, published scores were retrieved from the literature and corrected using statistical theorems. Overestimations and differences between pseudo-percentages and real percentages were plotted against real percentages. Reported STEEM overall mean score of 74.4% (pseudopercentage) was corrected to 67.9% (real percentage), eliminating thus the 6.4% OE. Corresponding figures for OREEM and student-STEEM are 73.6%, 67.0%, 6.6% and 69.1%, 61.4%, 7.7% respectively. A total of 45 overestimated scores were retrieved and corrected. OE (range 2.8 to 13.6%, mean 7.3%) showed a complete (r = -1, p &lt; 0.001) negative linear regression of real percentages (RP), namely, OE = 20-0.2*RP. No uncorrected score can achieve less than 20%. The non-0-based 1-to-5 coding overestimates STEEM, OREEM and student-STEEM educational environment scores if expressed as percentages due to the &quot;1-to-5 bias&quot;, or rather 1-to-L bias, whereupon L correlates to the number of points in the Likert scale, the number of options. The worse the educational environment the greater the overestimation, reducing instruments' usefulness exactly then when alarm bells should be ringing. Hence, question coding should always be zero (0) based, as proposed by Likert. The 1-to-L bias applies to any questionnaire at any field of research.",

        "author":["Spaull, Nicholas"],
        "description":"The aim of this article is to exploit an unusual occurrence whereby a large group of South African grade 3 students were tested twice, 1 month apart, on the same test in different languages. Using a simplified difference-in-difference methodology, it becomes possible to identify the causal impact of writing a test in English when English is not a student's home language for 3402 students. The article aims to address the extent to which language factors (relative to nonlanguage factors) can explain the high levels of underperformance in reading and mathematics in South Africa. I find that the language of assessment effect is between 0.3 and 0.7 standard deviations in literacy and 0 and 0.3 standard deviations in numeracy. This is approximately 1-2 years worth of learning in literacy and 0-1 year worth of learning in numeracy. By contrast, the size of the composite effect of home background and school quality is roughly 4 years worth of learning for both numeracy (1.2 standard deviations) and literacy (1.15 standard deviations). These results clearly show that the 'language effect' should be seen within the broader context of a generally dysfunctional schooling system. They further stress the importance of the quality of instruction, not only the language of learning and assessment. The fact that the literacy and numeracy achievement of South African children is so low in grade 3 (prior to any language switch to English in grade 4) should give pause to those who argue that language is the most important factor in determining achievement, or lack thereof, in South Africa.",

This report describes first-year results of an ongoing project to generate and share information on core texts, supplemental materials, and benchmark assessments adopted by districts in the Mid-Atlantic Region states for specific elementary, middle, and high school grade levels in English language arts, math, and science. The report also describes the organization of the results in an online, searchable database (http://www.relmid-atlantic.org/ci). Potential users of the database include state and local policymakers, practitioners, parents, voters, and researchers. Several findings emerge from analysis of the database. These are: (1) Few districts reported having adopted district-developed core text materials (0-2 percent in each grade and content area) or no core text materials (0-3 percent); (2) Depending on the grade and content area, 34-64 percent of reporting districts provided both the title and publisher of a single commercially developed core text; (3) Districts were most likely to report both the title and publisher of a core text in grade 4 math (64 percent) and algebra 1 (55 percent); and (4) As of March 1, 2010, the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) had issued reports on studies of 15 of the instructional materials identified by districts in Mid-Atlantic Region states that had met WWC evidence standards with or without reservations.

Following a preface that discusses UNESCO's activities related to early childhood education, the two main sections of the manual discuss children's play between 0-2 years and 2-7 years. Each section includes information about play, suggestions for activities for teachers, and spaces for teachers to take notes. The first section discusses play from the development of reflexes up to the appearance of language, including play that involves the mouth; the senses of touch, sight, and hearing; movement; and natural objects. From 0-1 years, play uses objects to look at, touch, and hold; and objects that develop hand-eye coordination and that the  baby can chew on. This play also involves the baby's dropping objects; putting objects together; recognizing color, form, and sound; and carrying objects. Between 1-2 years, children's play helps them learn to talk and to develop a sense of equilibrium. The second section discusses symbolic play, which involves the representation of reality, language, and socialization. Between 2-4 years, play can support the learning of phrases and numbers, the ability to pretend to be somebody else, drawing and coloring, and general creativity. Between 4-7 years, play can support children's abilities to organize objects and their tendency to establish friendships. The manual's final section briefly considers children's play and games after age 7 or 8, which involve more social activity and reasoning.  (Contains 17 references.) (BC)",

        "description":"Do the positive effects of an intensive early childhood educational program extend into adulthood? FPG researchers used comprehensive longitudinal data from the Abecedarian Project to try to answer that important question. The Abecedarian Project was a prospective randomized trial involving primarily African-American families (98%) that began in 1972. The first phase of the intervention provided early childhood education within a high-quality child care setting from early infancy to kindergarten entry at age 5 for half the children while the others served as controls. A second phase of treatment randomly assigned half the children who had child care treatment and half those in the control group to receive the services of a special teacher for the first three years in public school. This teacher alternated bi-weekly visits between classroom and home and designed customized learning activities to reinforce at home skills being taught at school. Thus, the timing and duration of intervention varied from age 0-8 years, or from age 0-5 years, or from age 5-8 years, to no intervention at all, depending on the subgroup to which participants belonged. Because assignment to treatment groups was random, children's developmental outcomes can more fairly be attributed to treatment itself rather than to initial differences in family circumstances. Outcomes of the study showed that: (1) Abecedarian Project early childhood participants had significantly more years of education by age 30 than individuals in the control group; (2) Although the income-to-needs ratio was more favorable for those with early childhood treatment, the difference was not statistically significant; and (3) There were no treatment group differences in criminal activity, the primary outcome of interest.

        "description":"Math anxiety negatively predicts young children's math achievement. While some researchers have suggested that math anxiety may stem from poor math ability, others have argued that math anxiety occurs at all levels of math ability. An important question is whether math anxiety predicts math achievement over and above foundational math skills. We sought to address this issue by examining whether math anxiety predicts future math achievement, controlling for number line estimation, a foundational math skill that predicts future math achievement. We found that 1st graders' math anxiety predicts their math achievement in 1st through 3rd grade, controlling for their number line estimation at the beginning of 1st grade. This finding suggests that math anxiety contributes to future math learning over and above an important foundational math skill. Additionally, we examined whether there are age differences in the relation of first-grade math anxiety to number line estimation at various scales in order to test the hypothesis that the negative effect of early math anxiety on math performance depends on task difficulty. In support of this hypothesis, early math anxiety more closely related to the 0--100 number line task in 1st graders but to the 0-1000 number line task in 3rd graders, suggesting that math anxiety most strongly relates to math skills that are at the cusp of children's understanding at particular grade levels. Together, these findings underscore the importance of fostering young children's positive emotions toward math in addition to providing them with a strong cognitive foundation for math learning.

        "description":"Is there an optimal grading scheme? Do psychology instructors prefer one grading scheme over another? These questions were recently posted on the Society for the Teaching of Psychology Facebook page. After reading the responses, we realized that research in the domain of math cognition might help to shed light on an optimal grading scheme and put some of the posters' comments into context. Posters often mentioned 100-point and 1,000-point grading schemes because of the ease with which students could convert course points to percentages. In this Pedagogical Points to Ponder article, we describe the quick development of whole number understanding in the 0-100 and 0-1,000 range relative to the slow development across the lifespan of rational number understanding. Although people struggle to understand fractions, percentages might serve as an intuitive bridge between familiar whole numbers and less familiar fractions. We encourage readers to ponder the fact that grading schemes are inherently relational and people of all ages, expertise levels, and cultural backgrounds fall prey to a common mathematical misconception in which they think about the components of rational numbers--the numerators and denominators--like independent whole numbers. This misconception, known as the whole number bias, may make any grading scheme challenging for students to comprehend. There are many open empirical questions about the optimal grading scheme that college instructors should adopt. Findings from the domain of math cognition can inform empirical research designs that may lead to improvements in students' comprehension of the course grading scheme and motivation, and may even diminish student requests for end-of-term grade bumps.

        "author":["Kilickaya, Ferit"],
        "description":"Much has been written about the influence of various factors that affect learners' retention of course contents in various contexts and at various levels. However, few studies have focused on the factors that may both affect and indicate the organization of materials or contents presented to learners. This study aims to determine the effects of using different types of signaling on learners' retention in the post and delayed tests on the reduction of adverb clauses in an instructed online English grammar class. The quasi-experimental design recruited three groups, each of which included 20 pre-service language teachers. The control group was instructed on reducing adverb clauses with no use of signaling. However, visual signaling such as using texts in bold type was introduced into the materials for the Experimental Group 1, while the Experimental Group 2 used the materials supported with visual signaling in the form of graphic organizers as flowcharts. The scores from a researcher-developed assessment for the three groups were analyzed with a one-way ANOVA. The results of the study indicate that the participants in both experimental groups scored higher than the control group in the post and delayed retention tests; and the Experimental Group 2 scored relatively higher than the Experimental Group 1. Semi-structured interviews uncovered several advantages of using verbal and visual signaling in the materials used for grammar instruction.

        "description":"We investigated the dimensionality of various indicators of reading prosody, and the relations of word reading and listening comprehension to the identified dimension(s) of reading prosody, using longitudinal data from Grades 1 to 3. A total of 371 English-speaking children were assessed on oral text reading, word reading, and listening comprehension in the fall and spring of each year (i.e., 6 waves of data). From oral text reading, reading prosody was evaluated on pause structures (pause duration, pause frequency) and pitch (intonation contour, F[subscript 0] change) using spectrographic analysis, and on expressiveness, smoothness, phrasing, and pacing using the Multi-Dimensional Fluency Scale (MFS). A bifactor structure described the data best across the 6 waves, composed of (a) a ratings and pause &quot;general&quot; factor, which captured common variance among MFS, pause frequency, and pause duration; (b) ratings (MFS) and pause &quot;specific&quot; factors, which captured variance over and above the ratings and pause general factor; and (c) a separate pitch factor, which captured variance in intonation contour and F[subscript 0] change. Word reading and listening comprehension were related to the identified dimensions of reading prosody, but when they were in a model together, word reading, not listening comprehension, was uniquely related to reading prosody across the six waves. These results indicate that reading prosody is multidimensional and that a pitch factor is a dissociable skill from the general ratings and pause prosody. Furthermore, word reading is the primary driver for the development of various dimensions of reading prosody, at least for children in primary grades.

        "author":["Alexandria A. Viegut",

        "description":"Understanding fraction magnitudes is foundational for later math achievement. To represent a fraction &quot;x/y,&quot; children are often taught to use &quot;partitioning&quot;: break the whole into &quot;y&quot; parts, and shade in &quot;x&quot; parts. Past research has shown that partitioning on number lines supports children's fraction magnitude knowledge more than partitioning on area models. However, partitioning may not take full advantage of children's prior knowledge or the structure of the number line. We tested an alternative fraction number line lesson that leveraged children's pre-existing whole number knowledge using a domain-general learning tool: &quot;analogy.&quot; In a preregistered online experiment, 2nd and 3rd graders (N = 84, Mean = 8.83 years), were randomly assigned to an Analogy lesson (e.g., if I know how big 3 is on a 0-4 line, I know how big ¾ is on a 0-1 line), a Partitioning lesson on number lines, or a Control lesson using square area models. Results showed that the Analogy lesson was more effective for promoting fraction magnitude understanding than the Control lesson, and it was at least as effective as the Partitioning lesson. The analogy group, but not the partitioning group, significantly outperformed the control group with large-denominator fractions at retention (i.e., one-week delayed posttest) and on transfer tests (i.e., fraction comparison). We also replicated past findings that fraction partitioning lessons are more effective on number lines than on area models, and this advantage was partially sustained after a one-week delay. Overall, these findings highlight the power of domain-general analogy to support mathematical development. [This paper was published in &quot;Developmental Psychology&quot; 2023.]",

The 2I/EM describes the effects of students' math and verbal achievement levels and changes on their math and verbal self-concepts. The present research integrates these 2 approaches into the reciprocal 2I/EM (R2I/EM), which describes the effects of students' math and verbal achievement levels and changes on their math and verbal self-concepts and the effects of their math and verbal self-concept levels and changes on their math and verbal achievements. We tested this model in 3 empirical studies, including about 6,000 students between Grade 4 and Grade 11 from Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium, using grades and test scores as achievement indicators. Overall, we found strong support for the R2I/EM. In line with prior 2I/EM studies, students' achievement levels showed positive (negative) effects on their self-concepts within (between) subjects. The effects of students' achievement changes on their self-concepts within (between) subjects were usually positive (near 0). In line with prior RI/EM studies, students' self-concept levels showed positive (negative or near 0) effects on their achievements within (between) subjects. For the first time, we also examined the effects of students' self-concept changes on their achievements: These effects were usually positive (positive or near 0) within (between) subjects. Our findings have important theoretical and practical implications for the I/E model literature and for teachers aiming to foster their students' self-concepts and achievements.",

However, there is a lack of evidence about which targets stakeholders perceive to be most important. This study sought to obtain consensus on which outcomes are perceived to be most important. A total of 114 people with ADHD, educational professionals, parents of children with ADHD, clinicians and researchers participated in a Delphi survey with 3 rounds. The importance of 52 intervention targets was rated on a scale from 0 to 8 (8 being extremely important). Consensus was reached if &gt;70% of a stakeholder group rated a target as between 6-8 and &lt;15% rated it as 0-2. Targets were dropped from subsequent rounds if more than 50% of stakeholder groups rated it as 0-5. Targets that all four stakeholder groups reached consensus on in any round were automatically included in our final outcome set. Comments were analysed using Thematic Analysis. All four stakeholder groups reached consensus on the importance of seven targets: ability to pay attention, conflict with teachers and peers, executive functioning, global functioning and quality of life, inattention symptoms, organisation skills and self-esteem. Four overarching themes were identified: &quot;Complexity of ADHD, Relationships, School Context,&quot; and &quot;What ADHD means to me.&quot; School-based ADHD interventions should target outcomes identified as most important to those who stand to benefit from such interventions. Some outcomes prioritised by our participants have not yet been targeted in school-based ADHD interventions. Implications of our findings for intervention and research design are discussed.",

        "description":"Natural disasters create immense challenges for young children by exposing them to a high degree of adversity. Interventions designed to build resilience in the aftermath of a natural disaster may help buffer the negative consequences of these adverse experiences. In this article, we report the results of our quasi-experimental evaluations of two interventions designed by Save the Children to improve children's developmental outcomes and parental engagement during a critical period. These interventions provided resources across eco-developmental levels to young survivors of the 2015 earthquake in Nepal's Sindhupalchok district by targeting children's families, teachers, and communities. The first was a caregiver-focused intervention aimed at improving parents' and caregivers' ability to provide early stimulation and responsive, positive caregiving for children ages 0-3; the other was a facilitator-focused intervention at an early childhood development (ECD) center that aimed to improve the quality of learning environments, family engagement, and psychosocial supports for children ages 3-6. We found that the interventions had a mixed impact. The age 0-3 components had no detectable effect on developmental outcomes, whereas the age 3-6 components had a positive impact on children's early learning and development, particularly their pre-academic skills. Neither intervention improved parental engagement. We highlight the challenges of implementing family-focused interventions in emergency contexts and the importance of the delivery agents in ECD programs. Despite the null effects for the 0-3 group, these evaluations demonstrate that bolstering the quality of early learning environments and the skills of ECD facilitators can have a meaningful impact on child-level outcomes, even in postdisaster and emergency settings.",

        "description":"Purpose: Current models of speech development argue for an early link between speech production and perception in infants. Recent data show that young infants (at 4-6 months) preferentially attend to speech sounds (vowels) with infant vocal properties compared to those with adult vocal properties, suggesting the presence of special &quot;memory banks&quot; for one's own nascent speech-like productions. This study investigated whether the vocal resonances (formants) of the infant vocal tract are sufficient to elicit this preference and whether this perceptual bias changes with age and emerging vocal production skills. Method: We selectively manipulated the fundamental frequency (f[subscript 0]) of vowels synthesized with formants specifying either an infant or adult vocal tract, and then tested the effects of those manipulations on the listening preferences of infants who were slightly older than those previously tested (at 6-8 months). Results: Unlike findings with younger infants (at 4-6 months), slightly older infants in Experiment 1 displayed a robust preference for vowels with infant formants over adult formants when f[subscript 0] was matched. The strength of this preference was also positively correlated with age among infants between 4 and 8 months. In Experiment 2, this preference favoring infant over adult formants was maintained when f[subscript 0] values were modulated. Conclusions: Infants between 6 and 8 months of age displayed a robust and distinct preference for speech with resonances specifying a vocal tract that is similar in size and length to their own. This finding, together with data indicating that this preference is not present in younger infants and appears to increase with age, suggests that nascent knowledge of the motor schema of the vocal tract may play a role in shaping this perceptual bias, lending support to current models of speech development.",

        "description":"In recent times, a growing consensus has emerged, among researchers and policy-makers, that a well-educated, competent and adequately supported workforce is crucial for the quality of early childhood education and care (ECEC). Despite governmental initiatives aimed to enhance the professional preparation and continuing development of early years practitioners being high on the political agenda of many EU member states, very few studies are analysing professionalisation policy developments and their implications within the national contexts of ECEC. Against this background, the article describes the key features of ECEC policies in Italy and their current trends by focussing specifically on the professionalisation of early childhood practitioners working across 0-3 and 3-6 services. Drawing on the data collected from documentary sources and interviews with key informants, this paper will critically review policy discourses as well as recurring themes and tensions arising from the academic and political debate. The findings from our analysis highlight that the increasing discontinuity characterising professionalisation initiatives across the 0-3 and 3-6 sector might lead to widening the gap among professionals working in such services. The risks that are associated with this trend are, on the one side, to devalue the educational role of 0-3 services and, on the other, to produce the &quot;schoolification&quot; of educational practices in 3-6 services. In addition, our analysis identified inconsistencies between initial and continuing professional development policies, which are progressively creating a dichotomy between initial and in-service training. The consequences of this process might produce, on the long term, the fragmentation of the ECEC system across public and private not-for-profit provision with the subsequent risk of impoverishing the local culture of childhood on which the Italian ECEC system has traditionally built its strength.",

        "description":"Purpose: This study compared auditory-perceptual measures of presence/absence and severity of vocal tremor to acoustic markers of vocal tremor. The validity (both concurrent and diagnostic) of various acoustic markers of vocal tremor was also assessed. Method: Fifty-six midvowel sustained [a:] recordings were selected to yield a representative convenience sample of vocal tremor. After training with 10 synthesized samples, 4 female audiologists rated these samples on &quot;voice tremor severity&quot; on a continuous 10-cm scale. Afterward, 15 randomly selected recordings were presented a 2nd time for intrarater reliability assessment. Customized audio signal processing in Praat yielded 12 acoustic measures of rate, extent and perturbation of fundamental frequency (f[subscript 0]), and intensity level (IL) modulation. Enter-type multiple linear regression analysis was applied to weight and combine these acoustic variables into an acoustic model of vocal tremor severity. Results: After removing the vocal tremor severity ratings of 1 of the audiologists because of insufficient intra- and interrater reliability, mean single-measures consistency-type intraclass correlation coefficients equaled 0.83 within raters and 0.72 between raters. Correlation between mean ratings and the 12 acoustic markers ranged from 0.76 for median extent of f[subscript 0] modulation to 0.11 for rate of IL modulation. Correlation between mean ratings and the acoustic model was 0.89. Analysis of this model's receiver operating characteristics yielded an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93, denoting sensitivity of 0.87 and specificity of 0.91. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that auditory-perceptual ratings of vocal tremor severity are guided primarily by f[subscript 0] and IL modulation extent, less by modulation perturbation, and least by modulation rate. The acoustic model covering all these modulation properties yielded acceptable results in terms of both concurrent and diagnostic validity. However, external cross-validation of this model is warranted before applying it in clinical voice/speech assessment.",

        "description":"Fetal hearing experiences shape the linguistic and musical preferences of neonates. From the very first moment after birth, newborns prefer their native language, recognize their mother's voice, and show a greater responsiveness to lullabies presented during pregnancy. Yet, the neural underpinnings of this experience inducing plasticity have remained elusive. Here we recorded the frequency-following response (FFR), an auditory evoked potential elicited to periodic complex sounds, to show that prenatal music exposure is associated to enhanced neural encoding of speech stimuli periodicity, which relates to the perceptual experience of pitch. FFRs were recorded in a sample of 60 healthy neonates born at term and aged 12-72 hours. The sample was divided into two groups according to their prenatal musical exposure (29 daily musically exposed; 31 not-daily musically exposed). Prenatal exposure was assessed retrospectively by a questionnaire in which mothers reported how often they sang or listened to music through loudspeakers during the last trimester of pregnancy. The FFR was recorded to either a /da/ or an /oa/ speech-syllable stimulus. Analyses were centered on stimuli sections of identical duration (113 ms) and fundamental frequency (F[subscript 0] = 113 Hz). Neural encoding of stimuli periodicity was quantified as the FFR spectral amplitude at the stimulus F[subscript 0]. Data revealed that newborns exposed daily to music exhibit larger spectral amplitudes at F[subscript 0] as compared to not-daily musically-exposed newborns, regardless of the eliciting stimulus. Our results suggest that prenatal music exposure facilitates the tuning to human speech fundamental frequency, which may support early language processing and acquisition.",

        "author":["Aikens, Shontarius D."],
        "description":"The study examined the relationship between leader-member exchange (LMX) and individual objective performance. While the LMX literature suggests a positive correlation between LMX and performance, a closer look at the research examined showed that the performance measurements were based on subjective measurements rather than objective measurements. Literature examining the effect on objective measurements is lacking. To determine the effect LMX has on objective measures of performance and to expand the LMX research literature, this theory was applied in a freshmen business learning community within higher education. Literature from four areas (LMX, performance, learning communities, and mentoring) provided the theoretical framework. Individual objective performance measures were collected for each student of the study population (N = 593) from institutional records. Participants were asked to assess the relationship quality with the peer leaders assigned to them using a modified version of the LMX-MDM (Liden &amp; Maslyn, 1998). A correlational data analysis was run for the number of respondents (n = 88) in regard to peer leader-student LMX (independent variable) and three individual objective performance measures: Mid-term GPA (H[subscript 0] 1), Term GPA (H[subscript 0] 2), and first year grade exclusion, or FYGE (H[subscript 0] 3). No significant support was found establishing any correlation between the independent variable (LMX) and the dependent variables (individual objective performance measures). Overall, the findings of the study were inconclusive due to the small sample size, and recommendations regarding future replication studies and further advancement of LMX research literature is presented.

        "description":"Pitch processing is lateralized to the right hemisphere; linguistic pitch is further mediated by left cortical areas. This experiment investigates whether ear asymmetries vary in brainstem representation of pitch depending on linguistic status. Brainstem frequency-following responses (FFRs) were elicited by monaural stimulation of the left and right ear of 15 native speakers of Mandarin Chinese using two synthetic speech stimuli that differ in linguistic status of tone. One represented a native lexical tone (Tone 2: T2); the other, T2', a nonnative variant in which the pitch contour was a mirror image of T2 with the same starting and ending frequencies. Two 40-ms portions of f[subscript 0] contours were selected in order to compare two regions (R1, early; R2 late) differing in pitch acceleration rate and perceptual saliency. In R2, linguistic status effects revealed that T2 exhibited a larger degree of FFR rightward ear asymmetry as reflected in f[subscript 0] amplitude \"relative\" to T2'. Relative to midline (ear asymmetry = 0), the only ear asymmetry reaching significance was that favoring left ear stimulation elicited by T2'. By left- and right-ear stimulation separately, FFRs elicited by T2 were larger than T2' in the right ear only. Within T2', FFRs elicited by the earlier region were larger than the later in both ears. Within T2, no significant differences in FFRS were observed between regions in either ear. Collectively, these findings support the idea that origins of cortical processing preferences for perceptually-salient portions of pitch are rooted in early, preattentive stages of processing in the brainstem.

        "description":"The aim of this study was to validate an individualised measure of quality of life (WeDQoL-Goals-Thailand). Three hundred and sixty-nine Thai people completed the WeDQoL by interview. Respondents rated (0-2) the perceived necessity for wellbeing of 51 goals (goal necessity), then rated (0-3) their satisfaction with the same goals (goal satisfaction). Weighted goal attainment (possible range 0-6) was computed (necessity x satisfaction). Psychometric validation used frequency distributions, Principal Components Analysis (PCA), and Cronbach's alpha. Analysis of variance, t-tests, Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, Spearman's correlation and multiple regression explored socio-demographic, geographic and economic differences. Respondents were aged 15-89 (mean 45.7, SD 18.0); 169 men, 200 women. For weighted goal attainment scores, PCA found a 44-item scale (alpha = 0.91) and three subscales (&quot;community/social/health,&quot; alpha = 0.90; &quot;house and home,&quot; alpha = 0.80; &quot;nuclear family,&quot; alpha = 0.81). &quot;Thai Individualised Goal Attainment&quot; (&quot;TIGA&quot;) scale and the three subscales were computed as the mean of contributing weighted goal attainment scores, after excluding goals considered &quot;not necessary&quot; to each individual. Unweighted and individualised scores differed significantly with socio-demographic, geographic and economic indicators. In multiple regression, both &quot;Thai Unweighted Goal Satisfaction&quot; (&quot;TUGS&quot;) and &quot;TIGA&quot; scale scores were predicted by being married, living in the South and in a non-urban location. &quot;TIGA&quot; scores were also predicted by being over 25 years old. WeDQoL-Goals-Thailand has excellent psychometric properties. Individualised scores reflect each person's perspective on wellbeing and are sensitive to subgroup differences. However, unweighted satisfaction scores give a broadly similar picture and involve less complex computation.",

        "description":"Four rats responded under a \"self-control\" procedure designed to obtain delay- discount functions within sessions. Each session consisted of seven blocks, with seven trials within each block. Each block consisted of two initial forced- choice trials followed by five free-choice trials. On choice trials, the rats could press either of two retractable levers. A press on one lever was followed by presentation of a smaller reinforcer (a single dipper presentation of a sucrose solution); a press on the other lever was followed by presentation of a larger reinforcer (four consecutive dipper presentations). The delay associated with the smaller reinforcer always was 0 s, whereas the signaled delay associated with the larger reinforcer increased across blocks (from 0 to 50 s). Under these conditions, the percentage of choices of the larger reinforcer decreased across blocks, and relatively reliable delay-discount functions were obtained within sessions. Doses of methylphenidate (1.0 to 17.0 mg/kg) and morphine (0.3 to 17.0 mg/kg) were then administered prior to selected sessions. Typically, intermediate doses of methylphenidate shifted the discount functions to the right (increased choices of the larger reinforcer). For 2 of the rats, this effect was pronounced; for the other 2 rats, this effect occurred after the range of delays for the larger reinforcer was decreased (0 to 20 s). On the other hand, in most cases morphine produced a slight leftward shift in the discount function (decreased choices of the larger reinforcer). The present procedure appears to be a useful and efficient method to characterize drug effects on an entire delay-discount function. As with many procedures used to study self-control choices, however, sources of control other than reinforcement delay and amount may have been operating in the present study, and these sources must be considered when interpreting drug effects.

Method: Ninety-three adults with normal hearing (thresholds [less than or equal to] 25 dB HL, 250-4000 Hz) participated in one of four groups: 38 young adults, 23 young adults with TBI, 16 middle-age adults, and 16 middle-age adults with TBI. Self-perceived hearing difficulty was measured via questionnaires. Binaural processing was measured using dichotic word recognition, the Listening in Spatialized Noise--Sentences Test (LiSN-S), and the 500-Hz masking level difference (MLD). For each participant, a composite binaural processing (CBP) score was calculated to obtain a global metric of binaural processing performance. The CBP was composed of six measures from the three behavioral tests, including the S0N0 and SpN0 thresholds from the 500-Hz MLD, the low- and high-cue speech recognition thresholds from the LiSN-S, and the free and directed recall ear advantages from the dichotic word test. Results: The middle-age TBI group reported significantly greater degrees of self-perceived hearing difficulty than the other groups. On average, the middle-age TBI group performed poorer on the individual binaural processing tests; however, the differences were significant for the S[subscript 0]N[subscript 0] and S[subscript pi]N[subscript 0] MLD thresholds only. Results for the global metric of binaural processing revealed significantly poorer CBP scores for the middle-age TBI group compared to the other groups. Conclusions: Results demonstrate that both age and a positive history of TBI contributed to deficits in suprathreshold binaural processing. Middle-age adults with a history of TBI are at risk for experiencing presenescent deficits in suprathreshold binaural processing deficits, despite having clinically normal hearing.",

The Sharing Center, as created by the Macomb 0-3 Rural Project in Illinois, involves the family in the child's program, provides an additional environment in which to work toward the child's educational goals, and encourages interaction among the participants. The theoretical foundations for Sharing Centers are described, along with steps involved in setting up the program. Suggested inservice activities, needs assessment procedures, planning worksheets, and evaluation forms are included.  (JDD)",

The design assumes that the item pool is split into a set of blocks of items that are assigned to assessment booklets. This paper shows how the technique of 0-1 linear programming can be used to calculate a balanced incomplete block design. Several structural as well as practical constraints on this type of design are formulated as linear (in)equalities. In addition, possible objective functions to optimize the design are discussed. The technique is demonstrated using an item pool from the 1996 Grade 8 Mathematics National Assessment of Educational Progress Project. (Contains 2 tables and 16 references.) (Author/SLD)",

For the Year 2 sample, oral narrative and decoding contributed to oral reading and comprehension two years later.

Prevalence was calculated using 2005-2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data, a population-based, nationally representative sample. Using MEPS, two-part models estimated the cost of each condition for all children while controlling for sociodemographic categories. Prevalence rates varied by race and ethnicity across conditions. Females had higher prevalence of all chronic conditions, except epilepsy. An additional US$1,377.60-US$9,059.49 annually were spent on medical expenses for children aged 0-18 years, with asthma, diabetes, or epilepsy compared to children without these conditions. This is the first study to examine the costs and prevalence of chronic health conditions in children and adolescents using a single data set.

        "description":"Background: Stunting continues to affect young children as a global nutritional disorder. The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence, associated risk factors and spatial clustering for stunting in a disadvantaged South African District. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional weighted survey of households was conducted in the iLembe district, KwaZulu-Natal in 2014. Children aged 0-59 months were included in the study sample. Height for age Z scores were calculated for the children and the spatial clustering was assessed. Results: Of the 572 children included in the weighted analyses, 21.1% (95% confidence intervals (CI) 18.0-24.5) were classified as stunted and of these 7.5% (95% CI 5.3-10.4) were severely stunted. Conclusion: Stunting is a major public health burden in SA that requires intervention at a community level. A multi-sectoral approach is required to reduce stunting prevalence, focusing on child growth and development monitoring, nutrition education and household food security.",

Reviewers assigned a score of 0-2 (0: No Concern; 1: Some Concern; 2: Major Concern) for each note. Results: Eighty-nine notes (70%) were assessed as \"No Concern\" by both reviewers; 30 (23%) were of \"Some Concern;\" and 9 (7%) were of \"Major Concern;\" 92 (72%) were deemed of \"No Concern\" by a psychiatrist, as compared with 120 (94%) by the non-psychiatrist. Conclusions: Trainee EMR outpatient notes are not likely to cause major concerns for patients who read them. Psychiatrist-reviewers identified more concerns than non-psychiatrist-reviewers.

Based on clinical observations, 78 toddlers were classified into two groups: toddlers with RDSP (N = 18) and those with \"other diagnoses in Axis I/II of the DC:0-3R\" (OD3R; N = 60). The parents completed the Infant Toddler Sensory Profile and the Achenbach Checklist. The results revealed that the RDSP group had more severe sensory modulation deficits and specific behavioral symptoms; stronger, although not significant, associations between most sensory and behavioral symptoms; and a significant sensory modulation deficit effect.

Lower 95% confidence interval (CI) ICC ranged from 0.10 to 0.70. Lower 95%CI for kappa statistics ranged from -0.20 to 0.64 and p[subscript 0] ranged from 80.1% to 95.7%. Cronbach's alpha coefficients estimated internal consistency of the PANES (alpha = 0.58 for the paper version and alpha = 0.55 for the online version). Mean scores for the PANES Built Environment Index (BEI) significantly differed by neighborhood street pattern (p &lt; 0.05).

Participants: Key informants (N = 18) at four campuses in Kentucky without a SF/TF policy recruited April 2015. Methods: Cross-sectional design. The survey assessed six dimensions: knowledge about SF/TF policies; leadership for campus policy; resources for policy development; campus climate surrounding tobacco issues; existing tobacco policies; and political climate for campus policy development. Dimension raw scores were rescaled to range from 0-1 and summed to determine overall stage of readiness (0-6). Results: Political climate was highest dimension across all campuses (0.83-1.0). Knowledge dimension ranked lowest (0.0-0.50). Overall readiness scores ranged from 2.53-3.94; two campuses in preplanning and two in preparation. Conclusions: Development of the online measure is timely considering the impetus to implement SF/TF policies. Findings reinforce that campuses are at varying stages of implementing these policies, and stage-based interventions are necessary.",

Second, content validity was evaluated by having 12 early childhood experts align HELP items with their related strands (i.e., specific developmental areas) and rank the developmental order of items within each strand. The experts agreed with the HELP item-to-strand alignment and with the developmental order of items. Finally, convergent and discriminant validity evidence was provided by correlating HELP domain scores with Battelle Developmental Inventory--Second Edition (BDI-2) domain scores. Evidence for convergent validity was found between similar domains; discriminant validity was evidenced by low correlations between unrelated domains of HELP and BDI-2.",

A school nurse developed and implemented a school-wide, 2-week-long Activity and Nutrition Challenge (ANC) using the evidence-based 5-2-1-0 initiative to prevent and fight childhood obesity. Despite minimal promotion, nearly half of the students at two elementary schools participated and earned points by following the guidelines in the ANC. The amount of chocolate milk consumed by students dropped significantly during the ANC, showing that the healthy behavior of choosing beverages without added sugar had been positively impacted. Anecdotal evidence suggested positive changes in other healthy behaviors as well. This ANC was a new way for a school nurse to teach healthy habits to a large group of children in a short period of time, with limited extra work, and with promising results.",

This note determines whether the conclusion of Euler's theorem holds if the smoothness of &quot;f&quot; is not assumed. An example is given to show that if &quot;n&quot; = 2, a homogeneous function (of any degree) need not be differentiable (and so the conclusion of Euler's theorem would fail for such a function). By way of contrast, it is shown that if &quot;n&quot; = 1, a homogeneous function (of any degree) must be differentiable (and so Euler's theorem does not need to assume the smoothness of &quot;f&quot; if &quot;n&quot; = 1). Additional characterizations of homogeneous functions, remarks and examples illustrate the theory, emphasizing differences in behaviour between the contexts &quot;n&quot; = 2 and &quot;n&quot; = 1.

This quasi-experimental study was of pretest-posttest control group design. A total of 50 students of a primary school formed the intervention group, while 53 students from the same school formed the control group. Data were collected with a demographic form, a nail-biting follow-up form, and photographs of the fingernails. It was found that 68.9% of students were biting seven or more of their nails; 46.6% had damaged nail beds. In the intervention group, the rate of the children who were not biting their nails (baseline = 0%, 4th week = 56.0%, 8th week = 64.0%) increased significantly compared to the control group (baseline = 0%, 4th week = 15.1%, 8th week = 18.9%).

        "description":"In a crowded dynamic world, temporal expectations guide our attention in time. Prior investigations have consistently demonstrated that temporal expectations speed motor behavior. We explore effects of temporal expectation on &quot;perceptual&quot; speed in three nonspeeded, cued recognition paradigms. Different hazard rate functions for the cue-stimulus foreperiod were used to manipulate temporal expectations. By computational modeling we estimated two distinct components of visual attention: the temporal threshold of conscious perception (t[subscript 0] ms) and the speed of subsequent encoding into visual short-term memory (v items/s). Notably, these components were measured independently of any motor involvement. The threshold t[subscript 0] was unaffected by temporal expectation, but perceptual processing speed v increased with increasing expectation. By employing constant hazard rates to keep expectation constant over time, we further confirmed that the increase in perceptual speed was independent of the cue-stimulus duration. Thus, our results strongly suggest temporal expectations optimize perceptual performance by speeding information processing. (Contains 2 tables, 5 figures and 1 footnote.)",

        "description":"Psychological theories are statements of constraint. The role of hypothesis testing in psychology is to test whether specific theoretical constraints hold in data. Bayesian statistics is well suited to the task of finding supporting evidence for constraint, because it allows for comparing evidence for 2 hypotheses against each another. One issue in hypothesis testing is that constraints may hold only approximately rather than exactly, and the reason for small deviations may be trivial or uninteresting. In the large-sample limit, these uninteresting, small deviations lead to the rejection of a useful constraint. In this article, we develop several Bayes factor 1-sample tests for the assessment of approximate equality and ordinal constraints. In these tests, the null hypothesis covers a small interval of non-0 but negligible effect sizes around 0. These Bayes factors are alternatives to previously developed Bayes factors, which do not allow for interval null hypotheses, and may especially prove useful to researchers who use statistical equivalence testing. To facilitate adoption of these Bayes factor tests, we provide easy-to-use software. (Contains 9 figures and 3 footnotes.)",

        "description":"Prompt-fading procedures are ubiquitous in instructional interventions. Two prompt-fading procedures, prompt delay and simultaneous prompting, are consistently shown to be efficacious, although few studies have directly compared the two procedures. These comparisons are warranted as the training procedures in simultaneous prompting are procedurally identical to the conditions initially arranged in prompt delay procedures (i.e., 0-s prompt delay). Therefore, efficiency may be directly related to the number of 0-s prompts presented in prompt delay procedures. Past research has emphasized the necessity of fading prompts to avoid prompt dependence, yet prompt dependence is rarely described in the simultaneous prompting literature. The current systematic review synthesizes the findings of 11 articles comparing simultaneous and prompt delay procedures across seven behavior analytic and educational journals. Overall, the findings suggest that simultaneous prompting and prompt delay procedures are similarly efficient, although the former was associated with fewer errors to mastery in over 70% of instructional comparisons. Additional research is needed to better describe the conditions in which traditional prompt delay or prompt fading procedures are necessary to produce transfer of stimulus control.",

Using the Preferential Looking Procedure, we found that Dutch-learning children aged 1 ; 7 to 2 ; 0 use articles during sentence comprehension in a fashion comparable to similarly aged English learners. That is, Dutch learners' sentence processing was impaired when a nonsense (\"se\") as opposed to real article (\"de\", \"het\") preceded target words, much like English learners' sentence processing is disrupted by the use of a nonsense article. At the same time, however, gender cues did not help Dutch learners recognize target nouns more efficiently, indicating that gender has yet to be acquired.

The 1990 study of Matyas and Greenwood was also partially replicated and participant error rates were examined when responses were on a non-binary scale (no effect, uncertain, clear effect) in contrast to the binary scale used in the original study. Thirty postgraduate special education students rated intervention effects on 36 graphs. There was no substantive evidence that graphing conventions affected judgements. Type I errors, defined as a response of &quot;clear effect&quot; when no intervention effect was present, were very low (0-7%) and Type II errors were correspondingly high (0-100%), particularly with low intervention effects and high random error. Thus, judges were very conservative when using a non-binary response scale, in contrast with the results of Matyas and Greenwood. Several directions for further research are proposed.

        "description":"As a substance is heated at constant pressure from near 0 K to 298 K, each incremental enthalpy increase, dH, alters entropy by dH/T, bringing it from approximately zero to its standard molar entropy S degrees. Using heat capacity data for 32 solids and CODATA results for another 45, we found a roughly linear relationship between S degrees and deltaH degrees. The plot showing the relationship S degrees is approximately equal to (constant) deltaH degrees, with constant = 0.0066 K[superscript -1], for 77 solids can serve as an enlightening visualization of this relationship for students in general chemistry. The near-linearity can be understood qualitatively in terms of lattice vibrations and internal vibrations within polyatomic units, which are reflected by molar heat capacities and Debye temperatures. This study supports the thesis that thermodynamic entropy and stored internal energy in a solid are intimately related and that entropy can be usefully interpreted as a spreading function, as described in the text.

One definition combines information on outliers from scores on all the items in the test, and the other definition combines information from all pairs of item scores. For a particular item-score vector, an outlier score expresses the degree to which the item-score vector is unusual. For ten real-data sets, the distribution of each of the two outlier scores is inspected by means of Tukey's fences and the extreme studentized deviate procedure. It is investigated whether the outliers that are identified are influential with respect to the statistical analysis performed on these data.

        "description":"The gravitational redshift forms the central part of the majority of the classical tests for the general theory of relativity. It could be successfully checked even in laboratory experiments on the earth's surface. The standard derivation of this effect is based on the distortion of the local structure of spacetime induced by large masses. The resulting gravitational time dilation near these masses gives rise to a frequency change of any periodic process, including electromagnetic oscillations as the wave propagates across the gravitational field. This phenomenon can be tackled with classical electrodynamics assuming a curved spacetime background and Maxwell's equations in a generally covariant form. In this paper, we show that in a classical field theoretical context the gravitational redshift can be interpreted as the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a medium with corresponding conductivity [sigma] = g/([mu][subscript 0]c[cube]), where \"g\" is the gravitational acceleration and [mu][subscript 0] is the vacuum magnetic permeability. Moreover, the energy density of the wave remains proportional to its frequency in agreement with Planck's postulate. (Contains 2 figures.)",

        "description":"Job automation can undermine economic security for workers in general, and older workers, in particular. In this respect, consistently updating one's knowledge and skills is essential for being competitive in a technology-driven labor market. Older workers with lower adult literacy skills experience difficulties with continuous education and skills development, which can contribute to their economic uncertainty. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the correlation between adult literacy skills and job automation risk. We analyzed a nationally representative sample of middle-aged and older workers (age 50+ years; n = 1,880) from the 2012/2014/2017 Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) dataset. The survey-weighted linear regression results showed that lower job automation risks (0%-100%) were a function of higher adult literacy skills (score 0-500 points: b = -0.052, p &lt; 0.05), after adjusting for relevant covariates (R-squared = 0.19).

        "author":["Song, Minjune"],
        "description":"After the &quot;1994 Gun-Free School Act,&quot; schools expanded the use of zero-tolerance policies with all Connecticut private high schools implementing punitive drug and alcohol policies. Based on the criminological theory of deterrence, zero-tolerance policies deliver severe and certain punishments designed to deter rational actors from engaging in problem behaviors. Existing research suggests that adolescents perceive rewards more strongly around peers and lack impulse control, raising the possibility that peer pressure may override rational deterrence in an adolescents' decision-making process. An &quot;immune group&quot; of adolescents predisposed to ignore punitive deterrents may play a sizable role in inducing peer drug use. If peer influence supersedes deterrence in a significant number of cases, adolescents who are affected both by deterrents and peer pressure may be at a higher risk of following the example of the &quot;immune group.&quot; This study raises the question of whether Connecticut private high school students' drug use is correlated with perceptions of punishment mandated by school policy and contextual peer influences. A questionnaire that measured students' drug use on a scale of 1 to 4, perceived severity and likelihood of punishment from 0 to 10, and interaction with drug using peers from 0 to 10, was completed by 50 respondents. The study found no correlations between student drug use and perception of punishment likelihood and severity but found contextual peer influences to be positively associated with expected student drug use in the future. While the results of this study are limited to Connecticut private high school students, the observed tendency in students to disregard risks and pursue peer-involved drug use may be generalized in adolescents. Even in places where school discipline is not a wide issue, the impact of contextual factors like peer influence must be reconceptualized in thinking about school drug policies.",

        "description":"Year-to-year rater variation may result in constructed response (CR) parameter changes, making CR items inappropriate to use in anchor sets for linking or equating. This study demonstrates how rater severity affected the writing and reading scores. Rater adjustments were made to statewide results using an item response theory (IRT) methodology based on the work of Tate (1999, 2000). The common item equating design was used to place the second year scores to the first year scores after a re-score of the first year test in order to adjust for rater effects. Two samples of data from contiguous years, designated as Year 1 (n ~ 1,200) and Year 2 (n ~ 2,000), from the writing and reading portions of a statewide assessment were examined. The writing test consisted of 32, 36, and 40 selected-response items for grade 4, 6, and 8 and a single writing prompt scored on a six-point scale (0-5) scored by two raters whose scores are added for a composite. The reading test consists of 75, 93, and 91 selected-response items and 12, 14, and 16 constructed response items for grade 4, 6, and 8, respectively. All the CR items in reading were scored on a three-point scale (0-2.) The resulting item parameters were compared between year one and two, with and without rater adjustment. For writing, there were significant shifts in the parameters after rater adjustment. The p-values and TCCs shifted across years when adjusted for rater effects. The impact of the parameter shifts and TCCs manifested in the changes in the proficiency classification before and after adjustment. The results of the study suggests that raters were not consistently more severe or more lenient between grades or content areas, but the resulting rater error (severity or leniency) affected the scores and thereby produced misleading results if not taken into account.

        "author":["Shockey, Brenda P."],
        "description":"This study examined quantitatively the effects of varying retention intervals (RI) within a 4 X 4 block schedule on knowledge retention of Algebra 2 skills and concepts. Specifically, the study contrasted the mean scores of students having an RI of 0, 8, and 12 months on a pre-review, post-review, and end-of-course test in precalculus. The study also examined qualitatively the instructional strategies used by teachers to eliminate the effects of the retention interval for all students beginning a new course of mathematics study. This study was conducted in two suburban high schools with at least 4 years of experience using a 4 X 4 block schedule. The sample for the quantitative component included all students, honors and merit, enrolled in precalculus. The sample for the  qualitative component included precalculus teachers in both high schools. Initially on the pre-review test (multiple choice component), the mean score of students with an RI of 0 months was significantly higher than that of those with an RI of 8 or 12 months. Following a four-week review period, there was a significant difference in mean scores between students with an RI of zero months and 12 months. On the pre-review and post-review (performance-based assessment) there was no significant difference among the groups of students by RI. Notably, by the end course in precalculus, a final test administered to all three groups showed no significant difference among the students by RI on either the multiple choice or the performance-based assessment. In examining RI effects by different  ability levels, there was no significant difference in the mean scores for precalculus merit students on the measure used as was also noted for all students regardless of ability. The same was true for precalculus honors students. Instructional strategies employed by teachers in reviewing Algebra 2 skills and concepts were the same as those associated with a traditional high school schedule. Contains 90 references. (Author)",

        "author":["Wang, Jianjun"],
        "description":"Proposition 10, also known as the California Children and Families Act of 1998, is the legislation for creating Kern County Children and Families Commission (First 5 Kern). Over the past 15 years, First 5 Kern administered a trust fund from a $.50 per pack tax on cigarettes or equivalent tobacco products to support children ages 0-5 and their families in Kern County. Guided by its strategic plan, First 5 Kern has allocated more than $160 million since its inception to support early childhood services in local communities. In Fiscal Year 2013-14, First 5 Kern spent over $10 million to fund 40 programs in Child Health, Family Functioning, and Child Development. Approximate 7.5% of the annual budget was devoted to strengthening systems of care through service integration. Following a model of results-based accountability, this report summarizes multilevel evaluation findings to show what works, for whom, and in which context of early childhood development in Kern County. The report includes five chapters: Chapter 1: highlights features of First 5 Kern support; Chapter 2: provides program-specific findings that impact children ages 0-5 and their families; Chapter 3: describes results of partnership building to strengthen the capacity of service integration; Chapter 4: includes longitudinal results from the Core Data Elements (CDE) survey and Family Stability Rubric (FSR) to describe sustainable accomplishments through ongoing improvements. This report ends with Chapter 5: Conclusions and Future Directions to clarify recommendations for stakeholders across a region as large as the state of New Jersey. Quantitative and qualitative approaches have been taken to describe service outcomes in different communities, including the city of Bakersfield that has surpassed St. Louis in population size. The report follows the Statewide Evaluation Framework for Proposition 10 and conforms to the Utility, Feasibility, Propriety, and Accuracy standards for program evaluation. The report also includes appendices: (1) Index of Program Acronyms; and (2) Technical Advisory Committee served in FY 2013-14 and Current Year.",

        "description":"Background: In 2004, in an attempt to address the current obesity epidemic, the United States Department of Health and Human Services announced a strategy to focus on educating the public on the concept of energy balance. The premise of &quot;Calories Count&quot; was that energy balance is primarily a function of calories in (energy in food) versus calories out (energy for physical activity). Purpose: The purpose of this study was to gain further insight into the accuracy of perceived energy expenditure for various intensities of physical activity. Methods: Over 600 individuals (21- 64 years of age), identifying themselves as Hispanic, were recruited from sites of the Department of Motor Vehicles in Miami, Florida. Participants were surveyed in English by a Hispanic interviewer and asked to provide information on their age, education, leisure time physical activity, height and weight. Participants were also asked to report how many calories they used/expended for ten standard physical activities. Results: Overall, only 30% of the participants accurately assessed their energy expenditure. The range in estimated calories for sedentary and vigorous physical activity for one hour was 0 to 4,000, and 0 to 20,000 calories, respectively. A majority of the participants underestimated energy expenditure for most activities. There was a significant (p less than 0.001) relationship between education and accuracy. Discussion: These findings suggest that further efforts are needed to educate at-risk populations about the &quot;Calories Count&quot; approach and energy balance. Translation to Health Education Practice: Future efforts should be made in collaboration with community gatekeepers to determine culturally sensitive methods to teach the public about: (1) the caloric value of various daily physical activities based on the duration and intensity of the activity in reference to body weight; and (2) the concept of energy balance and the component of physical activity.

        "description":"The effect of using zeros in grading students is reviewed, focusing on the inordinate weight given to zeros due to unequal intervals. Several approaches are suggested as practical solutions that balance the statistical properties inherent in averaging unequal grade intervals with the teacher's desire to use zeros for academic work. These include raising the floor for grades from 0 to 60 or 65, using zeros only for a small portion of the grade or for borderline situations, ignoring zeros that deviate from other work, using the median rather than the mean, and allowing extra credit. A modest goal may be to help teachers clearly understand the effect of zeros on the average and on student effort and motivation. (Contains 12 references.) (Author/SLD)",

The data indicate that prospective teachers tended to regard f[prime](x)=0 and/or the location &quot;where the graph bends&quot; as necessary/sufficient conditions for inflection points. The solutions were based on previous investigations of functions and on daily images associated with driving a car, like &quot;where one has to turn the wheel when driving on a curved track... while still going in the same... general direction.&quot; These types of solutions were given even by participants who correctly defined the notion.

Two Ovid computer searches of the ERIC (Educational Resources and Information Center) database are used to provide the background research. Issues in and teaching methods of reading and writing larger numbers, particularly a language-symbol approach, are discussed. The paper finds that place value concepts are not essential to reading and writing numbers, and difficulty with those concepts should not prevent acquisition of reading and writing larger numbers in the hundreds of thousands, millions, and billions. Anyone who correctly reads and writes all of the numbers 0 to 999 can quickly and easily build on those skills to master numbers in the billions and trillions.  (ASK)",

One of the two sample stimuli then appeared randomly as a comparison stimulus (S+), along with two other comparison stimuli (S-). Higher levels of correct responding occurred under the larger observing-response requirement, and the proportion of errors related to one of the two sample stimuli decreased. Thus, stimulus overselectivity was reduced without requiring differential observing responses. (Contains 1 figure.)",

        "description":"Background: Maternal responsiveness has been shown to predict child language outcomes in clinical samples of children with language delay and non-representative samples of typically developing children. An effective and timely measure of maternal responsiveness for use at the population level has not yet been established. Aims: To determine whether a global rating of maternal responsiveness at age 2 years predicts language outcomes at ages 3 and 4 in a community sample of slow-to-talk toddlers. Methods &amp; Procedures: In an Australian population-based study, at child age 1:6 years, 301 slow-to-talk toddlers (scoring =20th percentile on a parent-reported expressive vocabulary checklist) were invited to take part in a 15-min free-play video of mother-child interaction at 2:0 years. Each free-play video was rated for maternal responsiveness using a five-point global rating scale, where 1 is &quot;very low&quot; responsiveness and 5 is &quot;very high&quot; responsiveness. Language skills were measured at 3:0 years using PLS-4 and at 4:0 years using the CELF-P2. Outcomes &amp; Results: In adjusted linear regression models (potential confounders: gender, maternal education, socioeconomic status) maternal responsiveness strongly predicted receptive, expressive and total language standard scores at ages 3 (coefficient = 5.9, p &lt; 0.001; coefficient = 5.4, p &lt; 0.001; coefficient = 6.2, p &lt; 0.001, respectively) and 4 years (coefficient = 4.6, p &lt; 0.001; coefficient = 3.1, p = 0.004; coefficient = 4.0, p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Conclusions &amp; Implications: Slow-to-talk toddlers of mothers with higher global ratings of responsiveness have higher language scores at 3 and 4 years of age. This global measure of maternal responsiveness could be further developed as a clinical tool for identifying which slow-to-talk toddlers are most in need of early intervention.",

Search strategy: In November 2016, we searched Medline (from 1946), Embase (from 1980), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed (from 1996) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (from 1982) for randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials including children aged 0-5 years. Outcomes included the decayed, missing and filled teeth (dmft) index or similar index; the number of children with reported pain or emergency dental visits because of pain; the number of children referred for dental care; plaque scores; the amount of oral debris present; change in parent/carer attitude or knowledge towards baby teeth; reported regular dental visits and adverse outcomes. Two authors independently screened for inclusion and assessed the risk of bias. Main results: Four trials reported in five papers with 2,311 participants were included. Interventions were fluoride varnish with counselling/health promotion, chlorhexidine varnish, and motivational interviewing techniques plus oral hygiene materials and a dental examination. Two trials showed fluoride varnish applied biannually over a 2-year period reduced caries prevalence (mean difference [MD]: -3.00; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -4.94 to -1.06; MD: -2.47; 95% CI: -2.57 to -2.37). Motivational interviewing with oral hygiene materials and a dental examination can reduce the number of carious lesions in children aged 30 months (d[subscript 2-4]efs &gt; 0 MD: -5.10; 95% CI: -8.74 to -1.46; d[subscript 3-4]efs &gt; 0; MD: -4.40; 95% CI: -7.55 to -1.25). Conclusion: Fluoride varnish applied biannually over 2 years is effective at reducing ECC in Indigenous children. Motivational interviewing has some benefit in caries prevention. Further research is required to test other preventive programmes.",

        "description":"This report presents findings from a systematic review of international reviews and meta-analyses, as well as Chinese empirical studies, on parent-child reading. Existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in English largely concern Western contexts -- especially the US and the UK -- yet few studies have reviewed articles in global south contexts including China. There is also no systematic review of Chinese empirical studies on parent-child reading published in either Chinese or English. Based on research evidence from the two groups of literature, this report aims to inform the effects of parent-child reading on young children's (0-6 years old) emergent literacy skills, the factors that enhance or constrain parent-child reading, and the characteristics of effective parent-child reading interventions. The authors conducted systematic searches of peer-reviewed literature databases in both English and China and identified 1,702 articles. After excluding non-relevant or low-quality articles, sixteen international reviews/meta-analyses and 16 Chinese empirical studies were selected for full and in-depth analysis (32 articles in total). Using thematic analysis, key themes that respond to the three research questions are identified. Regarding the effects of parent-child reading on young children's emergent literacy skills, there is strong evidence from international literature that parent-child reading has positive effects on young children's oral language skills, including expressive and receptive language abilities, listening comprehension, and vocabulary. Those positive effects are applicable to the Chinese language context and are relevant for the development of oral language skills among Chinese children aged 0-6 years old. Based on the findings, the report makes recommendations to parents, practitioners, policy makers, and researchers, as well as recommendations for future research.

        "description":"In Planck's model of the harmonic oscillator (HO) a century ago, both the energy and the phase space were quantized according to epsilon[subscript n] = nhv, n = 0, 1, 2..., and [double integral]dp[subscript x] dx = h. By referring to just these two relations, we show how the adoption of \"cycle-averaged phase-space states\" (CAPSSs) leads to the quantum mechanical energy spectrum of the HO, (E[subscript n]); = (n + 1/2)hv, n= 0, 1, 2,..., where E[subscript n] are the average energies, and to (J[subscript n]) = (n + 1/2)h/2pi, where (J[subscript n]) are the average actions. When anharmonicity to all orders is added in the form of the Morse oscillator (MO), the concept of CAPSS is implemented in terms of action-angle variables and it is shown that the use of (J[subscript n]) of each MO CAPSS also produces the correct discrete spectrum of the MO, again without applying quantum mechanics (QM). In addition, the concept of CAPSS leads to two well-known post-QM relations which are obtained in terms of time averages of the classical trajectories and of (J[subscript n]): (1) [contour integral] p dx = 2pi (J[subscript n]) = (n + 1/2)h, which is the quantum condition of the old quantum theory, albeit with half-integers (i.e. the result of the WKB approximation), and (2) ([delta]p[delta]x)[subscript n] greater than or equal to h/4[pi], which is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. It is shown via numerical computations that, for two MOs, one with intermediate anharmonicity, supporting 22 levels, and another with strong anharmonicity, with 5 levels, the quantities([delta]p[delta]x)[subscript n], n = 0, 1,..., 4, which are computed classically for the appropriately chosen trajectories agree very well with the results of computations that apply QM. The introduction of the CAPSS and the concomitant results underline the significance of the concept of the \"state of the system\" in physics, both classical and quantum.

This study was designed to explore a number of financially related issues on medically-oriented child protection teams specifically examining the team's staffing, funding sources, reimbursement, budgeting, perceived impact of managed health care and their perception of funding stability. Method: Mailed survey of medically-oriented child protection teams throughout the United States using a questionnaire that contained 28 items focused on a variety of financial issues; 14 items were drawn from a similar study done 6 years earlier, which allowed for comparison over time. Results: Responses were received from 320 out of 472 organizations, yielding a response rate of 68%. Inclusion criteria were met by 153 responses and were included in the analysis; 22 of these had also responded to the earlier survey. Median total budget was $300,000 and state and local government funding was the largest revenue source (Mdn=30%, range: 0-100%), followed by patient care generated revenue (Mdn=20%, range: 0-100%). The mean charge for an evaluation was $283 (SD=$196.11, range: $0-$800). Forty percent of teams indicated that managed care had no impact where as 49% saw a negative impact. Comparisons between the responses to this survey and the one done 1993 demonstrated that teams were seeing about the same number of patients and showed trends towards increased budget amounts and broader inclusion of various health care and non-health care disciplines on the teams. Conclusions: No single source of funds for such teams has emerged as the uniform solution for all teams. Creative patchworks composed of various funding sources remain the typical solution to the funding needs of medically-oriented child protection teams.",

        "author":["Casey N. Vaughan"],
        "description":"Colleges and Universities continuously attempt to increase enrollment each year; while prospective students struggle to gauge whether a degree offers a clear and articulable return on investment. The purpose of this action research study is to investigate influencing enrollment factors (hereinafter &quot;factors) that determine a prospective students college choice, and how school administration can increase the return on investment for each student. This research began with Cycle 0, which highlighted how various factors influence an average prospective student's choice to apply to specific university and, more importantly, complete registration. The findings of Cycle 0 shaped the specific research questions germane to each individual students' enrollment decisions. These questions formed the foundation for Cycle 1 and were used to determine how prospective students' career aspirations contribute to their matriculation decisions. Cycle 1 had four distinct groups: 1) marketing professionals; 2) enrollment counselors; 3) prospective students; and 4) current students &amp; alumni. Given the abovementioned diversity of participants, this research has substantial insight to determine both the key enrollment factors (i.e. Cycle 0) and how a students' career aspirations are apropos to their matriculation (i.e. Cycle 1). Essentially, Cycle 1 created a novel paradigm in which two perspectives primarily influence matriculation choices. The first perspective is that of the college marketing and enrollment professionals. That viewpoint is necessarily juxtaposed to, and potentially in competition with, the students' individual desires. Analyzing these possibly competing positions, helps higher education administrators optimize their marketing practices, while providing the students a conduit to achieving their individual goals. Cycle 2 explores typical marketing tactics and the factors most influential to a prospective student's matriculation. Action steps were designed and implemented to build a set of recommendations supporting post matriculation success for incoming college students.

The games have been categorized into the following eight types: (1) growing and learning games; (2) special bonding games; (3) kitchen games; (4) laughing and having fun games; (5) art and singing games; (6) finger and toe games; (7) bath and dressing games; and (8) going to sleep games. Within each category, different kinds of games are specified appropriate to four age levels: 0-3 months; 3-6 months; 6-9 months; and 9-12 months. The process of each game is explained and is followed by a statement of what the baby will learn from it. The purposes achieved by the different games at different ages range from developing observation, language,  listening, coordination, exploration, cognitive and problem solving skills to fostering trust, body awareness, social skills, and confidence. Prior to the description of games, guidelines for the growth of motor, auditory, visual, language, cognitive, and self-concept skills for babies from 0-6 months and from 6-12 months are provided.

However, results did provide additional evidence of convergent validity between SRSS-EC and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire scores. In Study 2, results of convergent validity studies with 90 preschool-age children offered evidence between SRSS-EC and (a) Social Skills Improvement System-Performance Screening Guide and (b) Caregiver-Teacher Report Form (C-TRF) scores. Results suggested the following cutting scores: SRSS-EC E7 (0-5 low, 6-7 moderate, 8-21 high risk) and SRSS-EC I4 (0-2 low, 3-4 moderate, and 5-12 high risk), with C-TRF scores as the criterion.

        "description":"In differential equations textbooks, the motion of a simple pendulum for small-amplitude oscillations is analyzed. This is due to the impossibility of expressing, in terms of simple elementary functions, the solutions of the nonlinear differential equation (NLDE) that models the pendulum, which is why the authors usually choose the linearized differential equation arising from the sin [theta] [approximately equal to] [theta] approximation for small angles [theta]. In this article, we use the computational power of &quot;Mathematica&quot; software and take advantage of its capacity to graphically show the solutions of the NLDE. In this manner, we determine approximations of the periods that result from varying the initial amplitude [theta][subscript 0], without assuming that it takes small values. From a comparison of the solutions of both types of modelling of a simple pendulum, a criterion for deciding how small [theta][subscript 0] must be for the linear equation to be adequate for modelling is obtained; this comparison includes an analysis of the pendulum's motion when the cable length and the gravitational acceleration constant are varied.",

Participants were 998 fifth- through eighth-grade students who completed self-reports and 76 fifth- and sixth-grade children with accelerometers. The Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) Research Protocol showed the higher frequency of days exceeding 60 minutes of MVPA than the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF). Larger proportions of children achieved the MVPA guidelines based on HBSC results (girls 16%, boys 29%), than IPAQ-SF (girls 5%, boys 11%), or accelerometers data (girls 0%, boys 0%). MVPA remained stable over 12 months on the basis of both self-report and accelerometer results. Both self-report scales presented should be used with discretion in population studies, whereas accelerometer-determined data can be more authentic when personal guidance is required.",

In Europe, the highest prevalence has been observed in Sweden, while the lowest in Croatia (115/10 000 and 2-3/10 000, respectively). There have been no epidemiological studies on the prevalence of ASD in Polish population. The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence of ASD in children aged 0-16 years, inhabitants of West Pomeranian and Pomeranian regions. Material and Methods: In total, 2514 children (2038 males, 81.1%) were included. The estimates were based on the government registries, whereas data were obtained from Provincial Disability Services Commissions. Results: The prevalence of ASD in children aged 0-16 years varies between two regions of Poland--2/10 000 in West Pomeranian and 38/10 000 in Pomeranian region. Conclusions: The average prevalence of ASD was 35/10 000 children and was about 4-fold higher in males (P &lt; 0.05). More studies are necessary.",

The following additional commands are then explained: PR#1, PR#0; FRE(0), and CHR$(X). A  discussion of editing with the Apple II microcomputer covers use of the cursor movement mode, editing, and deleting. The use of the command RND(1) to randomly select a word or number is also described. A reference chart displays commands and their functions.

The impact of IF/FL and their components are computed using a longitudinal corpus of interactions between thirty Dutch-speaking children (age range: 0 ; 6-2 ; 0) and their primary caretaker(s). The corpus study reveals significant correlations between IF/FL and acquisition order. The highest predictive values are found for the token frequency of segments, and for FL computed on minimally different word types in child-directed speech. Although IF and FL significantly correlate, they do have a different impact on the order of acquisition of word-initial consonants. When the impact of IF is partialed out, FL still has a significant correlation with acquisition order. The reverse is not true, suggesting that the acquisition of word-initial consonants is mainly influenced by their discriminating function.",

We aimed to examine the information sheets in research proposals submitted to an Australian HREC in one year, comparing the results with national recommendations and published data. Information sheets in all 86 research submissions were analysed using available software. The work of Flesch was used for Reading Ease or Readability and that of Flesch and Kincaid for the level of education required for comprehension, the Reading Grade Level. The mean length of 86 information sheets was 3110 words; many had more than 5000 words. Using the Flesch scale of 0 to 100, with 0 meaning most difficult and 100 very easy to read, the mean readability level was 47. The mean length of education needed to easily grasp the information was 11.6 years, equivalent to senior secondary school. Information sheets in research projects submitted to an HREC were often too long to be read in a reasonable time and too difficult to be easily understood. Recommended standards for information sheets were infrequently met.",

Surveys tallying dropouts and enrollment by grade, sex, ethnicity, and possible reasons for a student's decision to leave school were received from 152 schools in 86 districts. Districts reported dropout ranges from 13.6% to 0%; individual schools reported 19.1% to 0%; and alternative and evening high schools had rates from 59.6% to 10.2%. Data analysis indicated that American Indian students, who made up 7.5% of total enrollment but constituted 12.9% of total dropouts, were more than twice as likely to leave school as Anglo students. Percentages of total dropouts for other ethnic groups were: Spanish 43.7%; Anglo/Other 40.7%; Black 2.6%; and Oriental  0.1%. Dropout rates for grades 10 and 11 (62% of total dropouts) were significantly higher than for grades 9 and 12. The northwest and southeast regions had less than half of the state's enrollment but nearly two-thirds of the dropouts. Suggested revisions for subsequent reports included clarification of definitions and directions. (AW/MH)",

        "description":"Here, a relatively simple laboratory experiment of a physical pendulum, suitable for students of science and engineering in the first courses of university physics, is presented to illustrate its dynamic behavior and to determine its inertia moment. To this end, a long wooden rod of length L = 99.8 cm and cross-section radius R = 1.73 cm was used as the physical pendulum. The period of oscillation was measured as a function of the distance from the rotation axis to the center of mass. It is shown that the oscillation period is a superposition of two contributions, namely, a linear and a hyperbolic function, which has a minimum at the distance h[subscript min] = [square root] I[subscript 0]/M?, where I[subscript 0] is the moment of inertia of the rod about the rotation axis at its center of mass, and M is its mass. It is further shown that this quantity is independent of mass for all bodies of constant density, and a numerical method is applied to obtain the moment of inertia of the rod. Results obtained from a laboratory experiment agree with the expected one within 4%.",

This study aims to measure the impact of science and mathematics (S&amp;M) learning situations on certain perceptual variables, namely, self-efficacy (SE), interest, and perceived S&amp;M links, by comparing three experimental conditions: (0) &quot;control,&quot; (1) &quot;science,&quot; and (2) integration of &quot;S&amp;M.&quot; Multilevel linear regressions using data from the Science and Mathematics Integration Questionnaire (SMIQ) suggest that making mathematics explicit in science learning situations (2) or keeping mathematics instruction implicit (1) significantly increases SE in science and SE in mathematics compared to the control condition (0). Further analysis suggests that there were significant a posteriori differences between conditions in students' ability to perceive the links between science and mathematics, with the highest score being for &quot;S&amp;M&quot; and the lowest for &quot;control.&quot;",

The specific example chosen involves a solution of tris(dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium(0), Pd[subscript 2](dba)[subscript 3], in THF/H[subscript 2]O mixtures, which has the desired properties of high absorption in the visible range ([lambda][subscript max] = 528 nm) and significant difference in solubility in the two solvents THF and H[subscript 2]O. Pd[subscript 2](dba)[subscript 3] is readily available, safe, and commonly used in nanoparticle syntheses. The application of Flory-Huggins theory permits the fit of a quantitative model to data obtained from a straightforward laboratory experiment that can be conducted in less than 3 h. The absorbance of this compound is easily measured by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. The application of the Beer-Lambert law to the data in this experiment is a useful exercise for students because the absorbances span three orders of magnitude. (Contains 3 figures.)",

In the study, 45 children and 9 adults volunteered to copy two series of 13 ellipsoid shapes. These shapes were generated by manipulating the relative phase between 0 degree  and 180 degrees of two orthogonal oscillators in two orientations. Findings showed that although children from an early age onward and adults reproduced straight lines precisely (i.e., 0 degrees and 180 degrees), the former drew ellipsoid shapes in a less eccentric fashion than the latter (i.e., -90 degrees in all children rather than -60 degrees and 120 degrees in adults). This tendency to write in a rounder fashion persists until 11 years of age, suggesting that the coordination dynamics underlying graphomotor skills and tentatively shaping the coordinated activity involved in adult handwriting appears only later, probably due to increasing constraints on speed.

Repetitions occurred immediately (0-lag) or after one intervening face (1-lag). Face recognition continued to develop beyond 14-16 years, as shown with hit rates, d' scores and reaction times that all improved with age. Inversion and contrast-reversal effects were found in all subjects but were not more pronounced with increasing age, suggesting no increased reliance on configural processing and thus arguing against the expertise theory of Diamond and Carey (1986). Recognition improved with age in upright but also in inverted and contrast-reversed faces, suggesting a quantitative rather than a qualitative developmental change in face processing. For all age groups, performances decreased and reaction times increased from 0- to 1-lag conditions similarly, suggesting a similar memory component involved in adults' and children's processing. These data suggest gradual quantitative improvements in face processing with age, mainly due to increasing working memory processing capacity.",

        "description":"Using macroscopic thermodynamics, the general law for adiabatic processes carried out by an ideal gas was studied. It was shown that the process reversibility is characterized by the adiabatic reversibility coefficient r, in the range 0 [less than or equal] r [less than or equal] 1 for expansions and r [greater than or equal] 1 for compressions. The particular cases of free expansion and reversible adiabatic processes correspond to r = 0 and r = 1, respectively. To conclude the interpretation of r, the relation between r and the variation of the system entropy was also obtained. Comparison between this study and one restricted to expansions following a microscopic point of view showed not only equivalent interpretations but also that our approach is more general, since it also comprises compressions, provides an objective relation between r and entropy change and considers instantaneous varying values of the adiabatic reversibility coefficient. Finally, simulations of selected adiabatic processes are performed and numerical calculations of r are presented. This paper is intended primarily for the undergraduate student, although a comparison with the aforementioned work also requires a background in thermodynamics and kinetic theory.

        "description":"In the course of language development children must solve arbitrary form-to-meaning mappings, in which semantic components are encoded onto linguistic labels. Because sign languages describe motion and location of entities through iconic movements and placement of the hands in space, child signers may find spatial semantics-to-language mapping easier to learn than child speakers. This hypothesis was tested in two studies: a longitudinal analysis of a native signing child's use of British Sign Language to describe motion and location events between the ages 1-10 and 3-0, and performance of 18 native signing children between the ages of 3-0 and 4-11 on a motion and location sentence comprehension task. The results from both studies argue against a developmental advantage for sign language learners for the acquisition of motion and location forms. Early forms point towards gesture and embodied actions followed by protracted mastery of the use of signs in representational space. The understanding of relative spatial relations continues to be difficult, despite the iconicity of these forms in the language, beyond 5 years of age.",

Anecdotally, the authors find that students on their optional bioscience sandwich degrees benefit academically from placement experience but there is little supportive evidence of this in the literature. To investigate rigorously the link between sandwich placement and academic performance, two cohorts of bioscience students (n = 164) were described in terms of gender (male = 0, female = 1), pre-university qualifications (HESA score), academic performance (%) for each year of degree study (first, second, and final), and mode of study (non-placement = 0, placement = 1). Multiple regression analysis yielded the following predictive equation where all terms were significant: Final % = 28.80 + 2.97 (gender) + 0.14 (HESA score) + 0.44 (Second%) + 3.82 (mode). On average, placement students gain an advantage of nearly 4% in their final year performance. Given that the final year contributes 75% towards degree classification, over a quarter of placement students may benefit from the independent effect of mode of study by crossing a threshold into a higher degree class.

In this scoping review, we synthesized and evaluated 33 collected studies on children's digital use (ages 0-12) and their associated brain development published between January 2000 and April 2023. The synthesis of the evidence revealed that (1) digital experience does have positive and negative impacts on children's brains, structurally and functionally; (2) it could cause structural and functional changes in children's frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes, brain connectivity, and brain networks; and the most vulnerable area is the prefrontal cortex and its associated executive function, and (3) early digital experience has both positive and negative impacts on children's brain structure longitudinally. Practice or Policy: Educators and parents should be aware of the potential effects of digital experience on children's brain development and provide appropriate guidance, mediation, and support for children's digital use. Policymakers should establish and implement evidence-based policies and regulations to protect children's digital well-being.",

A pretest and a posttest were given consisting of (1) a NAEP item asking for the length of a line drawn next to a ruler, (2) a Piagetian unit-iteration task, and (3) the measurement of an object with a ruler that had the &quot;0&quot; mark away from its edge. It was found in the pretest that 86% of the children had constructed the logic of unit iteration but that most of them could not use a ruler correctly. The posttest revealed that, although there was progress, the problems found in the pretest persisted among a third to a fourth of the children. These problems were all related to the initial unit of measurement. (Author)",

The trilinear chart is used to portray three variables simultaneously expressed in the form of components of a total.

It is shown that one can see readily the trends in performance for different demographic groups for all of the 44 participating jurisdictions simultaneously.

The results from over 45,000 children revealed large variability in rates among school districts, as well as differences as a function of the child's sex. Referral rates ranged from 0% to 72.7%. The most frequent problems identified and referrals made were in the areas of cognitive development (specifically speech/language) and hearing. Yet, variability among school districts also existed in areas where most problems are identified and referrals made. Results pointed out the need for further study of reasons for discrepancies in rates for  males and females and for the wide variation found in both problem identification and referral rates.

The possible effects of the relationship between two species are that one or the other can benefit (+), lose (-), or neither benefit nor lose (0). By analogy, I have classified the behavioural relationships between students during group work. Different groups of students require different treatments. As a result, I propose a mixed approach to the formation of groups, careful observation of individuals, and the division of the work into smaller sections. In this way, low achievement of a group as a result of the uncooperative behaviour of some students can be prevented.",

Questionnaires were completed by adult proxies (usually mothers) in three generally healthy populations. Hypothesized multi-item scales were tested; reliability was estimated and preliminary attempts at validation were undertaken. Items in ten scales pertaining to mental health, general health and parental satisfaction with child development satisfied Likert-type and discriminant validity criteria. Because functional limitation items were endorsed for very few children, scales to measure physical health could not be tested. Almost all other scales were sufficiently reliable for group comparisions; reliability coefficients  were lower in the most disadvantaged population. Interrelationships among scales and validity variables generally supported their construct validity and supported a multi-component model of children's health status. (Author/RH)",

Subjects were children with reading levels equivalent to grades 4 to 6. Experiment 1 used repeated measurements with two modes of response and two kinds of cues; experiment 2 used acoustic similarity to produce interference with learning; experiment 3 presented word triads for short term retention. Results on the first two indicated that normal hearing subjects employed implicit acoustic features of printed materials while hearing handicapped subjects encoded the material using visual aspects. Also, the effects of auditory training were apparent, with its lack noted in the performance of children with very mild losses from 0 to 25 decibels.  (Author/JD)",

        "description":"Gilman and Ferry have shown that when the student's score on a multiple choice test is the total number of responses necessary to get all items correct, substantial increases in reliability can occur. In contrast, similar procedures giving partial credit on multiple choice items have resulted in relatively small gains in reliability. The analysis in this paper provides a possible explanation for this discrepancy. The reliability for SSM (self-scoring method) grading is compared to the reliability for conventional 0-1 grading by postulating a model for the conditional distributions of a correct response on the n-th try for an item, given an incorrect response on the first try. The results imply that for SSM grading, distractors should have different levels of attractiveness rather  than being equally attractive. (Author)",

        "description":"Background: For a majority of the world's children, despite substantial increases in primary school enrollment, academic learning is neither occurring at expected rates nor supplying the basic foundational skills necessary to succeed in the 21st century. The significant lag in academic achievement tells us that simply making formal education available does not fully meet children's needs for literacy development. Globally, many interventions are used to support children's literacy development through channels outside of the formal education system, in children's homes or communities. However, there is a lack of information regarding the effectiveness of these interventions. Objectives: The objective of this systematic review was to examine the effectiveness of parental, familial, and community support for children's literacy development in developing countries. This review provides information about the contextual influences of parental, familial, and community support on children's literacy development skills through the use of interventions that target those influences. We explored the following questions: (1) What models of reading and literacy learning programs have been implemented in homes and communities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)?; (2) What models of reading and literacy learning programs implemented in homes and communities in LMICs have empirical evidence regarding their level of effectiveness?; and (3) How effective are these models in improving children's literacy outcomes? Search Methods: Searches for academic literature were conducted in 15 online databases from across the disciplines of anthropology, economics, education, international relations, political science, psychology, and sociology. To capture gray literature, we searched the websites of United Nations agencies, multinational organizations that provide relevant programming, and governmental agencies. For example, we searched the websites of UNICEF, UNESCO, 3ie, J-PAL, USAID and others. Project staff and advisory panel members identified literature from their own organizations, and reached out to their contacts to ask for grey literature. The search was conducted from May to July, 2013. Selection Criteria: To be included in this review, studies had to have been published in 2003 or later and include a test of an intervention involving parents, families, or community members with the goal of improving children's literacy development; children ages 3 to 12 years (or &quot;preprimary&quot; or &quot;primary school&quot; age); a comparison group; and they had to take place in an LMIC (according to 2012 World Bank classification). Studies that addressed educational radio were eliminated from consideration because a systematic review of the impact of educational radio already exists (Ho &amp; Thukral, 2009). Data Collection and Analysis: Mendeley software was used to manage citations, abstracts, and documents. Abstracts from each database were initially screened by a single reviewer, but in fact many studies were cited in multiple databases and in turn were screened by two or more reviewers. For the studies that passed the screening, two researchers then independently reviewed each to ensure that it met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Thirteen studies were identified for this review. Information was extracted regarding the study setting, process used to form the control or comparison group, independence of the evaluation, outcome measures, attrition, baseline equivalence on child pre-literacy or literacy learning, descriptions of the treatment and comparison conditions, characteristics of participants and implementers, and statistics required for meta-analysis where available. Ten studies were included in meta-analyses. Eight of the studies were cluster randomized or quasi-experimental trials, where the level of assignment was at the school or district level. For these studies, effect sizes were computed using Hedges' (2007) d[subscript r2] effect size assuming equal cluster sample sizes. Results: The initial search of both the academic and gray literature yielded 10,430 study abstracts. Title and abstract screening resulted in the elimination of 10,357 studies, and 21 duplicate citations were removed. Of the remaining 52 studies, 3 were eliminated for addressing the topic of educational radio, and 36 for failure to meet our inclusion criteria. This left the 13 studies that were included in this review. These studies fell into three topic areas: educational television, interventions that help parents learn how to support their children's school readiness, and tutoring interventions delivered by peers or other community members. Most of these studies involved interventions to improve school readiness. The three areas of intervention were examined separately, and studies were combined for meta-analysis in cases where they used the same intervention approach, and had the required statistical information available. Five studies provided effect size estimates for interventions that help parents support their children learning. Three of the five studies reported significant differences in baseline literacy scores. For overall literacy immediately after the intervention, the effect sizes from five studies including a total of 864 children were heterogeneous, with a mean effect of 0.35 and a 95 percent confidence interval that included 0 [-0.07, 0.77]. Four studies including a total of 786 children provided information about overall literacy at one-year follow-up. These effect sizes were also heterogeneous, with a mean effect of 0.48 and a 95 percent confidence interval that included 0 [-0.35, 1.30]. Five studies of child-to-child tutoring were included in the meta-analysis. These studies all reported difficulties in data collection, raising questions about the quality of data included in the evaluation. For the total reading post-test, the effect sizes from four studies including a total of 1,779 children were heterogeneous, with a mean of 0.15, and a 95 percent confidence interval that included 0 [-0.27, 0.58]. For the beginning reading sub-test, four studies including 1,767 children were also heterogeneous, with a mean of -0.107 and a 95 percent confidence interval that included 0 [-0.40, 0.18]. For the letter identification posttest, effect sizes from five studies including 2,300 children were heterogeneous with a mean of 0.22, and a 95 percent confidence interval that included 0 [-0.13, 0.57]. For the writing post-test, five effect sizes including 1,993 children were heterogeneous, with a mean of 0.27 that was significantly different from 0 (95 percent confidence interval: [0.02, 0.51]). For the follow-up test of reading achievement, effect sizes from three studies including 1,407 children were heterogeneous, with a mean effect size of 0.07 and a 95 percent confidence interval that included 0 [-0.25, 0.39]. For the follow-up test of writing achievement, effect sizes from three studies including 1395 students were homogeneous with a mean of 0.033 that was not significantly different from zero (95 percent confidence interval: [-0.10, 0.17]. For the follow-up test of overall literacy, effect sizes from three studies including 1,397 children were homogeneous with a mean effect size of 0.06 that was not statistically different from zero (95 percent confidence interval: [-0.15, 0.26]. Authors' Conclusions: This review identified four areas where evidence was available regarding the effectiveness of an intervention approach: educational television, educational radio, interventions intended to support parents' ability to develop their children's school readiness, and tutoring (provided by older peers or community members). Educational radio has been addressed elsewhere (see Ho &amp; Thukral, 2009), so it was not considered in this review. Educational television had a positive impact on young children's literacy development if the child viewed the programming three to five times per week (but not at a lower dosage). Interventions intended to support parents' ability to develop their child's school readiness were not found to be effective overall, although they did have some positive effects in some countries. Peer-led tutoring was found to improve children's school readiness in writing, but not in other areas of literacy. However, this approach did have significant effects across multiple areas of literacy in some country contexts. A tutoring program led by community members resulted in increases in children's literacy. There were several limitations to this review based on the scarcity of empirical studies and their limited focus on just a few interventions. Numerous descriptions of interventions exist, but few contained a study of program effectiveness in reference to a comparison group. We found only one study that addressed an intervention for children ages 7 and older, and found no eligible studies from Latin America. Therefore, we are left with significant gaps in our understanding of what works in LMICs to improve children's literacy outcomes using interventions outside of the formal education system."},

        "description":"Environmental problems still require a lot of solutions that need to involve various groups including universities. Through effective environmental education learning, it can have an impact on awareness and achievement of student competencies in Environmental Science courses. The application of learning media by utilizing digital technology is expected to be effective in explaining material on global environmental issues related to human relations with the environment, environmental principles, pollution, utilization of natural resources. The objectives of this study were to: 1) obtain the level of student competence through video-based learning media in the Environmental Science course; 2) obtain the level of student competence with power point learning media; 3) obtain the effectiveness of student competency achievement between learning with video-based media and powerpoint media. This research is a descriptive quantitative study to determine the effectiveness of student competency achievement between video-based media learning and power point media learning. The object of research is video-based learning media and power point learning media in Environmental Science courses. The subjects of this study were a group of students with video-based media learning as many as 30 people and a group of students with power point media learning as many as 32 people. The research instrument is a student competency test (pre-test and post-test) to measure the effectiveness of video-based media compared to power point media after learning Environmental Science material. The test contains 25 multiple-choice questions with a per-item score of 0 or 1 and a score range of 0-100. The results showed: first, the final competence of all students after learning using video-based media was at a high level with an average score of 78.80 75. Second, the final competence of all students after learning using power point media was still at a moderate level, namely with an average score of 72.13 75. Third, the competence of students with learning using video-based media obtained an average score of 78.80 75. The average score of student competence with learning power point media is 72.13 75. That is, the effectiveness of learning using video-based media is higher than using power point media in Environmental Science courses.",

The TBLT applied is an adaptation of Willis's TBL Framework, while the ALTA applied is an adaptation of Sariçoban's dialogue memorisation. A quasi-experimental design was used in this study, with 21 students selected through convenience sampling for TBLT and 22 students for ALTA. Motivational Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) was employed. A descriptive analysis was conducted to compare if any changes in learning motivation and learning anxiety components for both groups before and after TBLT and ALTA were adopted in the learning interventions. The descriptive analysis showed that there were changes in the aspect of learning motivation and learning anxiety component. The result indicated that there was an increment in the number of students of the group with a very high level of learning motivation for TBLT. The result ranged from 8 students (38%) to 11 students (52%); the ALTA group remained unchanged as 11 students (50%) had a high level of learning motivation, and 11 students (50%) had a very high level of motivation. As for the learning anxiety component, the TBLT group showed a decrease in the number of students having very high anxiety, from 2 students (10%) dropped to 0 student (0%). Meanwhile, for the ALTA group, the results indicated that anxiety level for students had increased; the number of students who experienced a very high level of anxiety had increased from 2 students (9%) to 6 students (27%). The study indicates that TBLT has a positive effect on Mandarin learning motivation, which TBLT might help in reducing students' learning anxiety. Still, ALTA might, on the other hand, increase learning anxiety. The study implies that TBLT might be a better approach to learning Mandarin and might promote better performance among non-native speakers.",

        "description":"Problem Statement: Child abuse, defined by the World Health Organization as &quot;intentional or unintentional behavior by adults, society, or a country with negative consequences for the health and physical development of the child,&quot; is a social problem frequently encountered in all cultures and societies. It is need to this study because of parents in an important role about child abuse. Purpose of the Study: There are many studies on child abuse, and this article aims to contribute to the efforts of preventing such abuse by focusing on parents' abusive tendencies and examining the child abuse potential of parents using a number of variables. Method: Parents with children ages birth to six who reside in the province of Duzce constitute the population of this study. The sample group of the study consists of a total of 158 parents with children ages 0 to 6 and residing in the city center of Duzce, 96 of them mothers and 62 fathers. The child-abuse potential of the parents is the dependent variable of the study, while socio-demographic characteristics of the families and the children are the independent variables. Data collection instruments of the study are the Parents and Children Demographic Characteristics Form developed by the researchers, and the Child Abuse Potential Inventory (CAPI) developed by Milner (1976) and adapted to Turkish by Omer &amp; Sucuoglu (1994) with sufficient levels of reliability and validity. Findings and Results: It was found that child abuse potentials of the parents varied significantly by the number of residents in the house, by the place of residence, and by the income of the parents. Another finding was that the child-abuse potential of parents did not vary by gender and age. Conclusion and Recommendations: This study found that as the number of children increases, so does the child-abuse potential of parents. Therefore, in training and consultation sessions on family planning, the issue should also be discussed from the perspective of child abuse.",

        "author":["Ugurlu, Zeynep"],
        "description":"Problem Statement: Exchange programs offer communication channels created through student and instructor exchanges; a flow of information takes place through these channels. The Farabi Exchange Program (FEP) is a student and instructor exchange program between institutions of higher education. Through the use of social network analysis and techniques unique to it, an analysis of this structure will uncover how much universities and teacher training institutions as actors are affected by these student exchange programs and how much of their capacity they actually use. A literature review shows that exchange programs have been the focus of several studies, but there is almost no research using social network analysis on exchange program and teacher training programs. In the evaluation of student exchange programs, the social network approach brings a new point of view in the evaluation of complex and multiple relationships. Purpose of the study: The main purpose of this study is the mutual assessment of teacher training programs in universities which accept and send students through the exchange framework of the FEP. Methods: The study has been carried out a social network analysis approach. Social network analysis defined as the method of digital and/or graphic mapping of the type, direction and density of relationships between groups of actors. In this study, data was acquired from the lists of students who participated in the FEP at 18 universities, which have been selected through the cluster sampling method for the 2013-2014 educational year. It has been analyzed with the UCINET 6.0 software program. Findings and Results: According to the findings of the study, 822 connections in the whole network and 451 connections in the teacher training network have been identified in the FEP. It has been determined that 47% of maximum connection possible in the density analysis were made for the whole network (D = 0, 472), while 15% of maximum connections possible in the density analysis were made for the teacher training network (D = 0, 155). Conclusions and Recommendations: Results confirmed that, the networks between education faculties are relatively weaker. The high number of disconnected and isolated actors points to the necessity of strengthening connections between institutions which train teachers and education faculties.",

        "description":"Despite increasing accountability requirements and a national call for transparency in public policy, Mid-Atlantic Region state education agencies indicate that they have little information about what instructional materials districts adopt. This report describes first-year results of an ongoing project to generate and share information on core texts, supplemental materials, and benchmark assessments adopted by districts in the Mid-Atlantic Region states for specific elementary, middle, and high school grade levels in English language arts, math, and science. The report also describes the organization of the results in an online, searchable database (http://www.relmid-atlantic.org/ci). Potential users of the database include state and local policymakers, practitioners, parents, voters, and researchers. Several findings emerge from analysis of the database. These are: (1) Few districts reported having adopted district-developed core text materials (0-2 percent in each grade and content area) or no core text materials (0-3 percent); (2) Depending on the grade and content area, 34-64 percent of reporting districts provided both the title and publisher of a single commercially developed core text; (3) Districts were most likely to report both the title and publisher of a core text in grade 4 math (64 percent) and algebra 1 (55 percent); and (4) As of March 1, 2010, the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) had issued reports on studies of 15 of the instructional materials identified by districts in Mid-Atlantic Region states that had met WWC evidence standards with or without reservations. Appendices include: (1) Data sources and methods; (2) Sample introductory letter to chief school administrators; (3) Sample letter to curriculum directors, with enclosures; (4) Nonresponding districts; (5) Coding guide used by project team in year 1; (6) Revised coding guide for use in year 2; and (7) Database users guide.

        "description":"Background: The context is the new Texas STAAR end-of-course testing program. Purpose: The authors developed a logistic regression model to predict who would pass-or-fail the new Texas chemistry STAAR end-of-course exam. Setting: Robert E. Lee High School (5A) with an enrollment of 2700 students, Tyler, Texas. Date of the study was the 2011-2012 academic year. Study Sample: A sample of n = 100 students from the author's chemistry classes (32 high school sophomores and 68 high school juniors). Intervention: Developed a binary logistic regression prediction model (no control group applicable). Research Design: Statistical Modeling. Control or Comparison Condition: Control or comparison group--not applicable for the study. Data Collection and Analysis: The students' (n = 100) STAAR test scores from the new Texas end-of-course chemistry pilot test were analyzed in the 2011-2012 school year. Variables included in the logistic regression model were as follows:  Students' previous years science TAKS test scores (raw data); science TAKS scores and STAAR end-of-course scores coded pass (1) or fail (0) as categorical variables; and students' grade level coded sophomore (0) or junior (1) as  categorical variables. Findings: A binary logistic regression analysis was performed using the new Texas end-of-course pilot chemistry STAAR test scores as the dependent variable (DV) and the previous year's science TAKS scores and grade level as predictor variables. A total of n = 100 cases were analyzed, and the full model was significantly reliable (chi-square = 102.568, df = 2, p less than 0.000).  This model accounted for between 64.1% and 85.9% of the variance in STAAR status, with 92.9% of the students passing the STAAR test successfully predicted and 93.2% of students failing the STAAR test successfully predicted. Overall, 93.0% of the predictions were correct.  The Wald statistic showed that the TAKS raw score reliably predicted passing or failing the  STAAR end-of-course chemistry test. Conclusion: The binary logistic regression model was significantly reliable (chi-square = 102.568, df = 2, p less than 0.000). Overall, 93% of the predictions were correct. The model had a very high predictive outcome. Logistic Regression Variables are appended to this document.",

        "description":"In Fiscal Year 2015-16, the California Children and Families Act has appropriated an average of $440 per child from the state tobacco tax revenue to support early development of children ages 0-5. Based on the proportion of live births in each county, First 5 Kern administered over $10 million of the state funding to support 41 programs in Child Health, Family Functioning, and Child Development across Kern County. Due to reduction of tobacco consumption, this report is grounded on a model of result-based accountability to document outcomes of the local service delivery with less per-capital funding from the state. In the third largest county in California by land area, service providers have to spend more money on program outreach to address the need of nearly 900,000 residents across a region as large as the state of New Jersey. To justify the local spending and sustain the service improvement, a five-chapter structure has been incorporated in this report to evaluate the funding impact on child well-being this year: Chapter 1 highlights features of First 5 Kern support at the Commission level; Chapter 2 provides program-specific findings that impact children ages 0-5 and their families; Chapter 3 describes results of partnership collaboration to strengthen the system building for service integration; Chapter 4 includes longitudinal results from the Core Data Elements (CDE) survey and Family Stability Rubric (FSR) to describe sustainable accomplishments through the ongoing service improvements. This report ends with Chapter 5: Conclusions and Future Directions to review past recommendations and introduce new recommendations for next year. Altogether, qualitative and quantitative data were employed to address three key questions: (1) How much has been done in local child support; (2) How well did the programs perform this year? (3) Are any children and families better off? The report includes two appendices: (1) Index of Program Acronyms; and (2) Composition of Technical Advisory Committee.",

        "description":"Purpose: Phonations into a tube with the distal end either in the air or submerged in water are used for voice therapy. This study explores the effective mechanisms of these therapy methods. Method: The study applied a physical model complemented by calculations from a computational model, and the results were compared to those that have been reported for humans. The effects of tube phonation on vocal tract resonances and oral pressure variation were studied. The relationships of transglottic pressure variation in time P[subscript trans](t) versus glottal area variation in time GA(t) were constructed. Results: The physical model revealed that, for the phonation on [u:] vowel through a glass resonance tube ending in the air, the 1st formant frequency (F[subscript 1]) decreased by 67%, from 315 Hz to 105 Hz, thus slightly above the fundamental frequency (F[subscript 0]) that was set to 90-94 Hz. For phonation through the tube into water, F[subscript 1] decreased by 91%-92%, reaching 26-28 Hz, and the water bubbling frequency F[subscript b] ? 19-24 Hz was just below F[subscript 1]. The relationships of P[subscript trans](t) versus GA(t) clearly differentiate vowel phonation from both therapy methods, and show a physical background for voice therapy with tubes. It is shown that comparable results have been measured in humans during tube therapy. For the tube in air, F[subscript 1] descends closer to F[subscript 0], whereas for the tube in water, the frequency F[subscript b] occurs close to the acoustic-mechanical resonance of the human vocal tract. Conclusion: In both therapy methods, part of the airflow energy required for phonation is substituted by the acoustic energy utilizing the 1st acoustic resonance. Thus, less flow energy is needed for vocal fold vibration, which results in improved vocal efficiency. The effect can be stronger in water resistance therapy if the frequency F[subscript b] approaches the acoustic-mechanical resonance of the vocal tract, while simultaneously F[subscript 0] is voluntarily changed close to F[subscript 1].",

        "author":["Ning, Li-Hsin"],
        "description":"Purpose: Our audio--vocal system involves a negative feedback system that functions to correct for fundamental frequency (f[subscript 0]) errors in production. Therefore, automatic and opposing responses appear when an unexpected change in voice pitch is present in auditory feedback. This study explores following responses to pitch perturbation in auditory feedback in tonal language speakers, which have been commonly overlooked or discarded by past research. We examine whether the number of response types (opposing vs. following) and their dynamic f[subscript 0] contours in tone word production vary as a function of instruction (involuntary [&quot;to ignore&quot;] vs. volitional [&quot;to compensate&quot;]). Method: Twenty-four native speakers of Taiwanese Southern Min (TSM) produced three disyllabic TSM words while receiving pitch perturbation through headphones. The three disyllabic words were &quot;tsau&quot;[superscript 55]-&quot;im&quot;[subscript 55] (&quot;out of tune&quot;; HH), &quot;kau&quot;[superscript 33]-&quot;uann&quot;[superscript 33] (&quot;exchange&quot;; MM), and &quot;pan&quot;[superscript 11]-&quot;an&quot;[superscript 11] (&quot;handle a case&quot;; LL) that carry an identical high-, mid-, or low-level tone. The participants were instructed either &quot;to ignore&quot; or &quot;to compensate&quot; for the pitch shifts. Results: Results from a Bayesian Poisson regression show that the number of opposing and following responses were split nearly 50-50 for the &quot;ignore&quot; condition and 55%-35% for the &quot;compensate&quot; condition. The simulation results indicate that the speakers were able to switch between the feedback and the feedforward mode during the testing. On the other hand, f[subscript 0] contour analyses using generalized additive models show that pitch-increasing responses (i.e., oppose to downshifts or follow upshifts) were significantly larger than pitch-decreasing responses (i.e., oppose to upshifts or follow downshifts) for the MM and LL words, but not for the HH word. Conclusions: Our results provide support for the view that, for tone speakers, following responses are not uncommon. The magnitudes of pitch shift response trajectories have to do with the available pitch range for moving up or down in tone word production.",

        "description":"Despite abundant evidence of malleability in speech production, previous studies of the effects of late second-language learning on first-language production have been limited to advanced learners. This dissertation examines these effects in novice learners, finding that experience in a second language rapidly, and possibly inexorably, affects production of the native language. In a longitudinal study of Korean acquisition, native English-speaking adult learners (n = 19) produced the same English words at weekly intervals over the course of intensive elementary Korean classes. Results of two acoustic case studies indicate that experience with Korean rapidly influences the production of English, and that the effect is one of assimilation to phonetic properties of Korean. In case study 1, experience with Korean stop types is found to influence the production of English stop types in terms of voice onset time (VOT) and/or fundamental frequency (f [subscript 0) onset as early as the second week of Korean classes, resulting in the lengthening of VOT in English voiceless stops (in approximation to the longer VOT of the perceptually similar Korean aspirated stops) and the raising of f[subscript 0] onset following English voiced and voiceless stops (in approximation to the higher f[subscript 0] levels of Korean). Similarly, in case study 2, experience with the Korean vowel space is found to have a significant effect on production of the English vowel space, resulting in a general raising of females' English vowels in approximation to the overall higher Korean vowel space. These rapid effects of second-language experience on first-language production suggest that cross-language linkages are established from the onset of second-language learning, that they occur at multiple levels, and that they are based not on orthographic equivalence, but on phonetic and/or phonological proximity between languages. The findings are discussed with respect to current notions of cross-linguistic similarity, exemplar models of phonology, and language teaching and research practices.

        "description":"There is a need for a musical ensemble study that can describe the idiosyncratic, authentic movements that choral musicians make in a performance setting. In addition, it could benefit teachers to know whether those who score highest on a measure of expressive performance also tend to be strong performers. If this is the case, then the link between these two components can be highlighted in a systematic, strategic way. If there is little to no correlation between movement and performance, then teachers may help students more by sequencing these instructional issues separately. The purposes of the current study were the following: (1) to describe the expressive movements; and (2) to investigate the relationship between expressive movement and performance achievement for a group of high school choral musicians. The 23 participants were a convenience sample of female choral musicians in one Texas 5A high school. The females were sophomores (n = 5), juniors (n = 12) and seniors (n = 6) in a varsity women's choir. The current study measured performance achievement in a blind audition format, and measured expression in a contextual group format in a dress rehearsal situation. Three judges scored the audition using a 70-point rating scale that assessed tone, intonation, accuracy, musicianship, and technique; interjudge reliability across the judges was high (ICC = 0.97). For the movement measurement, individual participants were videotaped performing a dress rehearsal of a choral piece in a group women's choir setting. Videotaping was a normal part of the rehearsals for this choir and the students were not made aware that the purpose of the videotaping was to document movement. The videos were analyzed using a 70-point rating scale that assessed movement appropriateness, synchronization, and expression. The primary author adjudicated the 23 video performances, and an external judge evaluated a subgroup of the performances as a reliability assessment. Interjudge reliability with the summed scores of 10 of the movement performances for the primary author and an external judge documented acceptable reliability (r = 0.81). To answer research purpose one, the following descriptive questions were answered: (1) What body parts did the choir student move?; (2) How large were the movements; and (3) Where in the music were the movements made? To answer research purpose two, an interval-to-interval level bivariate correlation (Pearson) was calculated between the summed expression scores and the summed audition scores. For the three expressive movement subsections (appropriateness, synchronization, and expression), appropriateness scores ranged from 0 to 11 out of a possible 15 (M = 3.91, SD = 2.94), synchronization scores ranged from 0 to 15 out of a possible 15 (M = 6.57, SD = 4.61) and expression scores ranged from 0 to 33 out of a possible 40 (M = 7.04, SD = 8.19). Those students who scored high on appropriateness also tended to score high on synchronization (r = 0.94), and expression (r = 0.86). Those students who scored high on synchronization also had a tendency to score high on expression (r = 0.77). There was a small, positive, non-significant relationship between movement and audition scores (r = 0.12, p = 0.57, r[superscript 2] = 0.14). It needs to be cautioned that the findings of the current study may not be generalizable to other settings because the sample size was small, only females were measured, and only a rhythmic piece was used to document movement.

Methods: The point-by-point dataset of Men's single matches played in the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) tour from 2011 to 2015 is analyzed. A long-debated assumption on the &quot;iid&quot;-ness in the point winning probability of the server is statistically tested. A DTMC model is then developed to analyze the dataset further. Results: The statistical test results indicate that the identicality of point winning probabilities is not a valid assumption. For example, the server's point winning probability from scores 40:0, 30:15, 15:30, and 0:40 are significantly different. On the other hand, the independence is a generally valid assumption except for 40:15 where who won the previous point influences the point winning probability. Game winning probabilities and the importance of each point in winning a game are analyzed using the DTMC model by court surfaces and player groups of the different levels of serve effectiveness. Conclusion: Extensive empirical validation concludes unsealed debates over the stochastic models for tennis. The presented results reveal interesting properties in professional tennis matches.",

        "description":"The attentional boost effect refers to the observation that when simultaneously performing a scene memory task and a target detection task, participants better remember scenes that appear at the same time as the detection target than scenes that coincide with distractors. The attentional boost effect is thought to result from a transient increase in attention during an acute behaviorally relevant event, resulting from a temporal orienting response. But can endogenous orienting to predictable targets trigger this response in the same manner as exogenous orienting to unpredictable targets? Until now, the attentional boost effect has only been tested under conditions in which the target's appearance was unpredictable. Because of the distinction between exogenous and endogenous orienting, target predictability could attenuate the attentional boost effect, or it could increase temporal orienting efficiency and enhance the effect. To test the attentional boost effect under predictable conditions, participants memorized scenes while responding to a target digit, 0, among a stream of digits appearing in the center of those scenes. In some blocks, the 0 predictably followed the digit sequence 3-2-1. In these predictable blocks, participants showed a robust attentional boost effect. This shows that both endogenous orienting to temporally predictable targets and exogenous orienting to unpredictable targets enhance concurrent task processing.",

Students with BD (n = 11), their peers (n = 90), and general education teachers (n = 10) completed the Peer Relationship Survey (PRS), a non-anonymous measurement scale. The results of self-, peer-, and teacher-ratings each indicate that students with BD were seldom, if ever, identified as bullies (0%, 9%, and 0%, respectively) and that they are more often identified as victims (64%, 55%, and 55%, respectively) and bully/victims (23%, 12%, and 19%, respectively) than their peers. The level of agreement between self-, peer-, and teacher-ratings of bullying and related behaviors was generally significant for peers (students without BD). However, agreement between self-ratings and ratings of other informants for the behaviors of students with BD was limited or nonexistent.

To test this, we examined how well a mixed log-linear model accounted for 86 5- to 9-year-olds' estimates on bounded and unbounded number-line tasks and how well it predicted mathematical performance. Compared with mixtures of 4 alternative models, the mixed log-linear model better predicted 76% of individual children's estimates on bounded number lines and 100% of children's estimates on unbounded number lines. Furthermore, the distribution of estimates was fit better by a Bayesian log-linear model than by a Bayesian distributional model that depicted estimates as being anchored to varying number of reference points. Finally, estimates were generally more logarithmic on unbounded than bounded number lines, but logarithmicity scores on both tasks predicted addition and subtraction skills, whereas model parameters of alternative models failed to do so. Results suggest that the logarithmic-to-linear shift theory provides a simple, unified framework for numerical estimation with high descriptive adequacy and yields uniquely accurate predictions for children's early math proficiency.",

        "description":"When learning is taking place, students test their hypotheses and evaluate them, and modify their current theories on the basis of new information. This phenomenon is known as &quot;hypothesis testing view&quot; or &quot;theory changes.&quot; Many students change their rules to another while they are taking a test. This study introduced a new concept called &quot;slip probabilities&quot; that quantifies to what extent a students' scores on an item deviates from the pure scores of his/her original rule. Algebraic relationships between this new slip-random variable and the traditional item score variable are discussed. Then, the indices to measure the stability of rule application and to compute the probability of having the perfect application of the rule are introduced and illustrated with a 64-item signed  number test, which was given to 153 eighth graders. Thirty-nine erroneous rules of operations were represented by a set of response patterns on 32 items. A new random variable &quot;u&quot; that represents deviations from a pure rule by having a slip of 1 to 0 or 0 to 1 on an item helps explain the volatile cognitive activities that occur while a test is taken. Six data tables and seven graphs complement the text. (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"Researchers sought to compare the perceptions of school administrators who had from 0 to 5 years of experience with management by objectives (MBO), using a survey of 374 administrators in 22 Pennsylvania school districts. A literature review on MBO and management evaluation indicated the need for more longitudinal studies. To compare the attitude changes over time, the researchers divided the administrators into five groups with 0, 1, 3, 4, and 5 years of experience with an MBO system called Administrative Management by Objectives Appraisal System (AMOAS). A 27-item Likert-scale questionnaire was used, with 5 subscales that measured perceptions of (1) the work itself, including responsibilities and work relationships; (2) integration of personal and institutional goals; (3)  evaluation fairness, usefulness, and followup; (4) effectiveness of objectives planning; and (5) MBO's effect on personal advancement. Analysis using the Tukey multiple range test and one-way analysis of variance indicated that the more years of MBO, the less positive the attitudes toward MBO; that those with no MBO experience had more negative attitudes about MBO and evaluation but more positive attitudes about MBO and advancement; and that those with 5 years of experience had more negative attitudes about MBO and goal integration.

The model is an extension of Rasch's dichotomous model to formats which provide more than two levels of response to items. The model contains one parameter for each person and one parameter for each &quot;step&quot; in an item. A dichotomously-scored item provides only one step from fail to pass so only one item parameter is estimated. An item with three ordered performance levels (0, 1, and 2), provides two steps. For this item two parameters are estimated: the first governs the model probability of scoring 1 rather than 0, and the second governs the probability of scoring 2 rather than 1. The model probability of completing the k'th step in an item is described by a simple logistic ogive of slope one  and is governed by the person's ability and the difficulties of the step. This &quot;Partial Credit&quot; model's procedures for estimating the parameters are unconditional maximum likelihood. Both the effects of individual differences in response style and variations in the fit of items are examined, including items with large positive or large negative standardized mean squares. (CM)",

The program provided an intensive, short-term, full day, comprehensive academic program during the summer agricultural season, and an individualized, supplemental tutorial program during the regular school year. Summer projects included a preschool component for ages 0-5 and an elementary component for ages 5-21. Nine projects included a secondary evening component for ages 12-21. Summer projects emphasized oral language development and individualized instruction in reading and mathematics.  Secondary evening programs allowed students to earn credit or accumulate hours toward partial credit for coursework completed during the summer in order to fulfill high school graduation requirements. Focusing on the activities and achievements of the summer and regular school year projects, this report lists the national and state goals for migrant education and presents information on identification and recruitment; staff development and project personnel; student academic achievement; parental involvement; interagency, interstate, and intrastate cooperation; information dissemination activities; and special projects.

So, it is important to measure whether individuals have disciplined mind or not. Based on this idea, it is aimed to evaluate the reliability of answer key used in determining the 7th grade students' levels of disciplined mind in terms of generalizability (G) theory in this research. It is possible to calculate reliability both for the relative decisions (G coefficient) and the absolute decisions (0 coefficient) in the G theory. The calculated G and the 0 coefficients with six tasks and three raters in this research were found as 0.86 and 0.79 respectively. In the G study, attempts are mad to predict the situations where error can be reduced to the minimum for specific purposes through the D study. According to D study results, it was found that increasing the number of raters would not bring any benefits to the similar studies to be performed in the future; and it would not be a practical way in cases where it is difficult to find competent raters.",

This paper describes the health status and medication use of adults with ID in Western Australia. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional survey by interview of 328 adults with ID (M age = 37 years, range: 18-82) and their families/support persons (79% proxy or joint informants). Results: Although 90% of participants reported long-term health conditions (M = 2.6, range: 0-10), including epilepsy, allergies, eczema, asthma, and mental health problems, three quarters of the participants (77%) described their health as good or very good. Younger participants (18-44 years) reported osteoporosis and stroke, conditions commonly associated with ageing, more often than the general population at those ages. Medication use was high, with 70% taking one or more medications (Mdn = 3 medications, range: 0-21). Conclusions: Many participants reported that health problems affected their daily lives, yet the majority reported good health. Long-term health conditions were common and many people used several types of medications. Participants had poorer health than the Western Australian population overall. Careful monitoring of health conditions and regular review of medications are recommended to improve health outcomes for adults with ID.",

There is growing evidence of children's use of tablets, but limited knowledge of the use of apps by children of children of this age. This ESRC-funded study undertook research that identified how UK children aged from 0 to 5 use apps, and how far the use of apps promotes play and creativity, given the importance of these for learning and development. A survey was conducted with 2000 parents of under 5s in the UK, using a random, stratified sample, and ethnographic case studies of children in six families were undertaken. Over 17 hours of video films of children using apps were analysed. Findings indicate that children of this age are using a variety of apps, some of which are not aimed at their age range. The design features of such apps can lead to the support or inhibition of play and creativity. The study makes an original contribution to the field in that it offers an account of how apps contribute to the play and creativity of children aged five and under.",

A questionnaire survey was conducted in 1972 on a sample of 636 superintendents in the public school systems in Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The study was designed as a follow-up to a 1969 Civil Rights Commission survey of 538 superintendents in districts with at least 10 0/0 Mexican American enrollment and of 1,166 schools within these districts. A subsample of &quot;Anglo&quot; districts was added in the 1972 survey to estimate the extent of inequalities among districts of different ethnic enrollments. Quantity and quality of educational services were found to be highly related to the ethnic composition of district enrollment and to residents' income. Even after controlling  state and district size, the relationships remained. Inequalities in educational resources and services based on ethnic composition of the district were also found among schools surveyed in 1969. Another dimension of the 1972 survey involved an analysis of superintendents' opinions on a variety of issues related to the central question of equality of educational opportunity. The findings have important implications for further litigation, legislation, and policy-making vis-a-vis the Mexican American student. (Author/KM)",

Affective reactions are present in young infants, but still to be explored is how the stable adult factor structure develops from these reactions. Three questions are investigated in this study: (1) is this factor structure present in 3- and 4-year-olds; (2) does it occur initially verbally or non-verbally; and (3) is it an age-related or a stage-related development? Nineteen subjects ranging in age from 3:0 to 5:1 years, with a mean age of 4:0, were given the task of rating concepts both verbally and non-verbally. With adults, factor analysis reliably divides scales into three factor groups: evaluation, potency, and activity. Factor analysis of the present data, however, found no  structure at all, rather great variability among children in their use both of words and pictographs. Though each child must learn the adult factor structure for himself, the similarity between children's strategies for word concatenation increases with age. Appropriate use of graphic scales appears sooner than that of verbal scales, providing evidence that language is perhaps not a system separate from other cognitive systems. (CLK)",

Through two freestanding but related case studies in London and San Miniato, the article explores the current professional learning and development for educators working with children aged 0-3 in the UK and 0-5 in Italy, focusing on the ways in which educators develop and conceptualise their professional identities. Through data collected using interviews and activity-based focus groups and analysed with Clarke's situational analysis, I have found two systems of professional learning not in contact with educators' everyday realities. Educators expressed the need to be more actively involved with the design and delivery of professional learning courses. The findings point to the need for educators to be given more opportunities for self-reflection to confront their knowledge with others. It is important to provide educators with adequate support to help them buffer against the extreme mental and emotional demands of the job with an offer of professional learning that is flexible and shaped around their needs.",

Parents are often missing in the debate, while they are confronted with experiences of exclusion and discrimination. Our aim was to hear the parents' voices on high-quality childcare for children with disabilities between 0 and 3 years old. As part of the evaluation of inclusive childcare practices by the Flemish government, we undertook interviews with 20 parents of children with disabilities (0-6 years). Some families are still in the early childcare centre and others are looking back, while already in preschool. We elaborated on what support parents find valuable and how this can be embedded in inclusive early childcare. We came to four themes: deciding on the childcare type parents prefer, negotiating power with professionals, exploring lived experiences in early child care and finally the evaluation of inclusion by parents in early care.

Method: Eight children in their first year of schooling (aged 5 years 0 months to 5 years 8 months) and 10 children in their second year of schooling (aged 6 years 0 months to 7 years 2 months) generated story retell, personal, and script narratives. These were analysed using the Child Language Analysis (MacWhinney, 2008) program. Results: Several words occurred with high frequency across all tasks. Other words were more specific to particular tasks and topics. In the story-retelling task, the majority of the unique words used were from the original story. However, of the total words available in the original story, only a small proportion was used. Conclusions: Some of the high frequency words overlapped with those included in existing wordlists. However, other words were unique to this study. The wordlists generated will provide a useful resource that can be used alongside existing wordlists to guide decision making around vocabulary selection for children with complex communication needs.

Methods: This study investigated differences in the severity of challenging behaviors (CBs) among individuals with IDs at varying life stages. Data were collected from parents' retrospective interviews. Surveys were completed by 47 parents whose child with IDs was 19 years or older and had made use of welfare services for individuals who exhibit CBs. Results: The final study sample consisted of 28 parents. Findings showed that: (a) parents gave the lowest total scores for severity of CBs for their adult children when at the pre-school stage compared to other stages (elementary school, junior high school, high school, and post-high school), (b) differences between life stages appear to depend on the type of CB, and (c) the most common CB recorded for children between 0 and 2 years old was extreme hyperactivity, followed by severe sleep disturbances. Conclusions: The results of the study show that domain ratings for stereotypic/restricted behaviors, sleep disturbance problems, feeding problems, and problems with elimination often remain stable throughout the life stages. Moreover, parents frequently reported that CBs often occurred in children aged 0-2 years.",

        "description":"Giant freshwater prawn (&quot;Macrobrachium rosenbergii&quot; De Man) embryos can be cultured &quot;in vitro&quot; to hatching in 15% (v/v) artificial seawater (ASW). This technique can be applied as a bioassay for testing toxicity or for the effects of various substances on embryo development and can be used as a simple and low-cost model for studying embryo development. The technique has been implemented for undergraduate biology laboratory investigations in a developmental biology course at Mahidol University, Thailand. To study the effects of salinity and age of embryo at culture initiation on embryo development, survival and hatching, embryos at 3.5 days and 6.5 days old were cultured in 0%, 15%, 30%, and 45% (v/v) of ASW. Embryos survived and developed normally in 15% or 30% ASW but not in 0% or 45% ASW. Likewise, hatching occurred normally at 18.5-19.5 days old in 15% or 30% ASW. Embryos introduced to culture at 3.5 days old were more sensitive to salinity than those started at 6.5 days old. Students in the class showed enthusiasm in laboratory activities, increased interest in developmental biology and positive attitudes towards further study. (Contains 3 figures and 1 table.)",

        "description":"Previous research has shown that in different languages ironic speech is acoustically modulated compared to literal speech, and these modulations are assumed to aid the listener in the comprehension process by acting as cues that mark utterances as ironic. The present study was conducted to identify paraverbal features of German &quot;ironic criticism&quot; that may possibly act as irony cues by comparing acoustic measures of ironic and literal speech. For this purpose, samples of scripted ironic and literal target utterances produced by 14 female speakers were recorded and acoustically analyzed. Results showed that in contrast to literal remarks, ironic criticism was characterized by a decreased mean fundamental frequency (F[subscript 0]), raised energy levels and increased vowel duration, whereas F[subscript 0]-contours differed only marginally between both speech types. Furthermore, we found ironic speech to be characterized by vowel hyperarticulation, an acoustic feature which has so far not been considered as a possible irony cue. Contrary to our expectations, voice modulations in ironic speech were applied independently from the availability of additional, visual irony cues. The results are discussed in light of previous findings on acoustic features of irony yielded for other languages. (Contains 2 notes, 5 figures, and 3 tables.)",

        "description":"Various normalization techniques to transform journal impact factors (JIFs) into a standard scale or range of values have been reported a number of times in the literature, but have seldom been part of collection development librarians' tool kits. In this paper, JIFs as reported in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) database are converted to percentiles (0%-100%) using Microsoft Excel's PERCENTRANK function. This permits a more intuitive evaluation of journal ranking within JCR subject categories and broader disciplines. The top journal by impact factor in any category is set to 100% while the lowest impact factor journal is set to 0% with all other journals on the list scaled according to their rank. Percentile-based impact factors (PIFs) also allow valid cross-disciplinary comparisons of impact factors, something not possible using JIFs. Finally, since a given journal title is often assigned to multiple subject categories, the relative impact of the same journal title can be compared and evaluated across each of those categories. This paper argues that PIFs should become a standard component of journal collection evaluation projects. The history, use, and misuse of impact factors are also discussed. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"This study used the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) with the aim of characterizing motor acquisition rate in 70 healthy 0-6-month-old Brazilian infants, as well as comparing both emergence (initial age) and establishment (final age) of each skill between the study sample and the AIMS normative data. New motor skills were continuously acquired from 0 to 6 months of age by the Brazilian infants, but their acquisition rate was non-linear. When compared to the AIMS sample, Brazilian infants achieved lower percentiles, and their initial age to acquire skills requiring greater antigravity demand was higher. In contrast, Brazilian infants stopped exhibiting primitive patterns earlier, and their final age to acquire antigravity skills was lower. These differences in motor development are suggested to be a consequence of different parental practices and not necessarily indicate motor delay. Thus, the AIMS normative values should be adapted to cultural particularities so as to avoid that infants are misclassified as at risk for motor delay. Furthermore, an adequate assessment of motor development should consider not only the age at which a skill is emerged, but also the age at which such a skill is established in the infant's motor repertoire.

It was hypothesized that the continuous change in subglottal pressure and flow rate alone (pressure-flow sweep [PFS]) can trigger a mode change in the canine larynx. Method: Ten canine larynges were each mounted over a tapered tube that supplied pressurized, heated, and humidified air. Glottographic signals were recorded during each PFS experiment, during which airflow was increased in a gradual manner for a period of 20-30 s. Results: Abrupt changes in fundamental frequency (F[subscript 0]) and mode of vibration occurred during the PFS in the passive larynx without any change in adduction or elongation. The lower frequency mode of oscillation of the vocal folds, perceptually identified as the chest register, had relatively large amplitude oscillation, significant vocal fold contact, a rich spectral content, and a relatively loud audio signal. The higher frequency mode of oscillation, perceptually identified as falsetto, had little or no vocal fold contact and a dominant first partial. Relatively abrupt F[subscript 0] changes also occurred for gradual adduction changes, with the chest register corresponding to greater adduction, falsetto to less adduction.",

Each condition used 1 of 12 response formats, differing in (1) \"polarity\" (\"bipolar\" versus \"unipolar\"), (2) \"orientation\" (\"horizontal\" versus \"vertical\"), and (3) \"anchoring\" (-5 to +5, \"Not Numbered,\" and 0 \"to\" 10). Results: For satisfaction ratings, a negative skew was found for all response formats, but, a higher percentage of respondents scored in the upper part (Midpoint to top) of the scale with anchor points (-5 to +5) than on the scales with other anchor points (Not Numbered and 0 to 10). Our results indicate that, satisfaction ratings obtained with either a \"unipolar\" or a \"bipolar\" response scale were similar, but, participants experienced some difficulty in rating life dissatisfaction using the \"bipolar\" dissatisfaction-satisfaction response scale. Moreover, this study has found that life satisfaction and dissatisfaction show a reciprocal relation, especially when assessed with two independent unipolar rating scales. These results support the inclusion of one-way unipolar response scales in the assessment of satisfaction and dissatisfaction.

Attributions concerning medication taking were manipulated by further randomly assigning participants in the exposure-based treatment plus pill condition to 1 of 3 instructional sets immediately following treatment completion and posttreatment assessment: (1) The pill was described as a sedating herb that likely made exposure treatment easier; (2) the pill was described as a stimulating herb that likely made exposure treatment more difficult; or (3) the pill was described as a placebo that had no effect on exposure treatment. Return of fear rates for the 3 conditions were 39%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. Moreover, the deleterious effects of the sedation instructions were mediated by reduced self-efficacy.

        "description":"Prior research has found gender differences in spatial tasks in which men perform better, and are more confident, than women. Do gender differences also occur in people's confidence as they perform number-line estimation, a common spatial-numeric task predictive of math achievement? To investigate this question, we analyzed outcomes from six studies (N = 758 girls/women and boys/men with over 20,000 observations; grades 1-5 and adults) that involved a similar method: Participants estimated where a provided number (e.g., ¾, 37) was located on a bounded number line (e.g., 0-1; 0-100), then judged their confidence in that estimate. Boys/men were more precise (g = 0.52) and more confident (g = 0.30) in their estimates than were girls/women. Linear mixed model analyses of the trial-level data revealed that girls'/women's estimates had about 31% more error than did boys'/men's estimates, and even when controlling for precision, girls/women were about 7% less confident in their estimates than were boys/men. These outcomes should encourage researchers to consider gender differences for studies on math cognition and provide pathways for future research to address potential mechanisms underlying the present gender gaps.",

To understand why reading practices may (or may not) relate to language outcomes, a necessary step to understand what occurs in the home. The goal of this work is to better understand the frequency and nature of picture book reading at home with children between the ages of 0 and 30 months in the United States. In an online survey, 282 caregivers answered questions about their picture book reading habits. Book reading was overall very common. Over 90% of families reported reading at least weekly to their child and nearly 70% reported reading daily, with caregivers of older children reporting reading slightly more frequently than caregivers of younger children. Caregivers also reported reading picture book text as well as a range of extra-textual activities. These textual and extra-textual behaviors varied across families and varied with child age and language skills. This study provides insight into how much, and what kind of linguistic input children encounter during picture book reading, and how this input may vary with age.",

This paper critically explores the perceived qualities/characteristics of men who seemingly serve as &quot;male role models&quot; by reporting on select doctoral research findings which sought to investigate the ambiguities of the male role model from the perspective of men who work in the 0-8 sector. Research participants were asked to identify the qualities/characteristics that they felt &quot;male role models&quot; should exhibit for young boys in the early years (0-8). The qualities/characteristics identified were categorised by research participants as being &quot;masculine&quot; (e.g. diplomatic), &quot;feminine&quot; (e.g. caring) or &quot;natural&quot; (meaning authentic). Whilst research evidence suggests that male role models will present a diverse range of personal and professional qualities/characteristics, it is argued that these are likely to be shaped by not only the needs and circumstances of the children that the &quot;male role model&quot; comes into contact with, but also the expectations of others, e.g. parents/carers and staff. This paper argues that there is a real tension between those qualities/characteristics of the male role model that are created as a result of their personality/individual beliefs and those which are anticipated or enforced by others.",

        "author":["Shu, Chih-hsiang"],
        "description":"This dissertation offers a novel account of the syntax of sentence adverbs. The need for a new account is clear from the lack of descriptive coverage and theoretical coherence in current work on adverbial syntax. Descriptively, the majority of work has so far neglected the fact that sentence adverbs behave syntactically like typical focusing adverbs. There has been no coherent and let alone comprehensive syntactic analysis of various focus-sensitive adverbs in generative grammar.    The main proposal I make is that sentence adverbs, as well as focusing adverbs in general, are \"inflectional affixes writ large\". In other words, sentence adverbs are derived in the same way as inflectional affixes are derived in syntax. In the current Minimalist framework (Chomsky 2000 et seq. ), this parallelism implies that both involve the Agree operation. More specifically, I propose that sentence adverbs merge with a verbal or a nominal expression as a result of (i) Match between valued interpretable Mood features (\"the probe\") on C[superscript 0] and unvalued uninterpretable Mood features (\"the goal\") on a lower functional or lexical head, and (ii) Valuation, where the valued interpretable Mood feature assigns a value to the \"goal\". In order to realize the Valuation, sentence adverbs merge with the lower head that is the locus of the \"goal,\" or with the projection of the head, as a result of pied-piping, to some extent similar to the way inflectional affixes are spelled out as affixes in order to realize feature valuation (Chomsky 2001 et seq ). This merge operation is \"delayed- Merge\", since this kind of merge applies after regular set-Merge that involves the head containing the \"goal\".    Support for this analysis comes from three sources. First, there is extensive evidence that sentence adverbs behave like C[superscript 0] elements, although their surface syntactic positions are usually lower. This suggests some kind of syntactic dependency between C[superscript 0] and lower functional or lexical heads. These preliminary but fundamental facts are discussed in chapter 2. Second, in-depth scrutiny of focus-sensitivity based on the notion of alternatives, and the role focus plays in the syntactic positions of sentence adverbs, provide compelling evidence that sentence adverbs are focus-sensitive adverbs. This property, as discussed in chapter 3, is crucial in determining which constituent enters a syntactic dependency relationship with the C[superscript 0]. Third, based on the Chomsky's (2001 et seq.) current developments of the generative grammar, inflectional affixes are derived by the Agree operation, which include Match, Valuation, and realization of the Valuation. Our treatment of sentence adverbs as \"inflectional affixes writ large\" is not only compatible with the theory, but also provides further support for it. These issues are discussed in chapter 4.    The major consequence of this work is to have shown that the theory of sentence adverbs and focusing adverbs is closely connected with the architecture of grammar in general, including the syntax-morphology interface, the syntax-semantics interface, and the Agree operation. There should be much to be gained if we seriously explore the consequences of our findings for the syntax of various other expressions not currently considered to form a natural class with sentence adverbs and focusing adverbs, such as inflectional affixes and clitics.

        "description":"An optimization model is presented that allows test assemblers to control the shape of the observed-score distribution on a test for a population with a known ability distribution. An obvious application is for item response theory-based test assembly in programs where observed scores are reported and operational test forms are required to produce the same observed-score distributions as long as the population of examinees remains stable. The model belongs to the class of 0-1 linear programming models and constrains the characteristic function of the test. The model can be solved using the heuristic presented in Luecht and T. M. Hirsch (1992). An empirical example with item parameters from the ACT Assessment Program Mathematics Test illustrates the use of the model. (Contains 6  figures and 23 references.) (Author)",

It concludes that the infants and children enrolled (2,740 in 1991) are making substantial gains in all areas assessed. These gains occur across age groups, type of program, severity of disability, and level of integration. It recommends review and revision of the Oregon Preschool Assessment System (OPAS). This measure assesses the child's social, communication, cognitive, academic, self-help, and motor skill areas. Demographic information is based on 1991 OPAS data sheets and is analyzed in terms of age groups, type of program, level of integration, and determination  of eligibility. Statistics showing student gains are provided for each skill area, for both 1990 and 1991, for each age (0-6), and by type of program. (DB)",

First, public policy educators have richer and more complicated discussions about the relative benefits of advocacy and objectivity in policy education. Second, public policy educators and community developers are moving toward a genuine merger of content and process, their respective strengths. Third, a richer and more complicated picture is developing of how public policy education impacts public understanding and the policy formation process. Fourth, educators are finding better language to talk about educational objectives and impacts. Interviews with citizens show that they are dissatisfied with politics, yet they are not apathetic to issues and they desire fair solutions. Interviews with  policymakers reveal a similar degree of dissatisfaction with politics, but many of them have only limited views of how relationships with citizens could be different. The emerging public policy education concept resonates with a widely-recognized societal need for better ways to practice politics. (KS)",

Summary statistics for the first four tests are presented for both groups; the Mexican-Americans scored slightly below the Anglos on the first three tests. Correlations between test scores were computed for both groups. None of the correlations were significantly different from 0 for the Mexican-American group, while all but one were positive for the Anglo group.

Considered are the healthy child, some of the deviant functioning of the impaired child, and identification and educational remediation, particularly in language and perception. Speeches and panel reports discuss the following topics: reasons for a special study institute, contemporary perspectives on the education of the deaf, acceptance and understanding in child growth and development, deviant functioning of the young child, language disorders in preschool children, and the dynamics of sensory motor experiences from infancy to 6  years. A summation is given of the conference proceedings. (WW)",

Administrator salaries are adjusted for performance and/or reclassification reasons. Judgments of performance are based on the extent to which an administrator achieves meaningful performance objectives and on comprehensive feedback from relevant reference groups. Reclassification is based on the scope and function of the position. Evaluation of administrators is coordinated and finally determined by the superintendent after careful analysis of extensive input from other appropriate administrators who, in turn, utilize information generated by relevant reference groups. For the 1974-75 school year, salary  percentage changes for administrators vary from 0 to nine percent. These percentages, the basic salary ranges, and other specifics of the performance evaluation components for administrators are reviewed and updated periodically. (Appendixes may reproduce poorly.)

The bilabial stop consonants generated had voice onset times of 0, 20, 40, 60, and 80 milliseconds. Each consonant was followed by the vowel \"a.\" Each subject was tested individually in a sound dampened room. Subjects were seated at a table facing two speakers, one located 90 inches from the subject, the other located 6 inches directly behind the first. A response key was positioned directly in front of the subject. The results replicated  those of Liberman and other researchers (1967) which demonstrated that although voice onset time is a continuum, adult perception along that continuum appears categorical.

Survey respondents--all members of USIA priority audience occupations--indicated their interest in a series of magazine article titles by using the Haskins 0-100 Reading Interest Scale. The results show that public affairs titles were of greater interest generally than those dealing with human affairs; interest in public affairs information was largely unrelated to demographic characteristics and mass media use; international lifestyle and personal contact with the United States seemed to hold promise as  useful explanatory variables; and interactions between the two categories of reading interest, as shown in the segmentation analysis, suggested insights into interests of the USIA magazine readers that simple analysis did not detect.

Although several logics account for sponsorship of student evaluation schemes, the ultimate product of student evaluation ought to be improved instruction. The purpose of this paper is to investigate relationships between student evaluating and better teaching. A mandatory system of student assessment of teaching skills employed at Bowling Green University is the frame of reference. If student ratings contribute to better teaching, ratings should improve over time. Regression equations and standards tests were employed to determine the existence of trend increments. Findings reveal that regression coefficients of regression equations were as low as 0. By inference, student evaluation had not contributed to  better teaching. Shortcomings in the administration of the evaluation scheme and faculty attitudes and capabilities account for apparent failures of the scheme to result in improved teaching.

The number of target words (1, 2, or 4) was combined factorially with the number of occurrences (0, 1, 2, or 4) in a within-subjects design. In both experiments, reading speed was affected only by the number of words in the target list. Neither of the variables had any effect on comprehension. The results indicated that central memory load limits reading speed, but scanning and decoding  processes are so automated that they are unaffected by the additional tallying operation required of the subjects in this task.

Three university mathematics pre-service teachers volunteered participating in this study. Collective notes were taken as data to present the ways that PSTs used a rope in the research meeting for children understanding of counting numbers. Data was analyzed using Bruner's (1966) work on cognitive development. The results show that using a rope, it was found that counting numbers (0, 1, 2, ….,9) were formed, represented visually and symbolically, and read. The finding has implications in teaching and learning counting numbers, including teachers can use a rope to teach the concept of counting numbers among children in elementary schools for a relational understanding of the concept.",

We find that immobile pupils in year-groups (a la US &quot;grades&quot;) that experience high pupil entry rates progress less well academically between ages 8 and 11 than pupils in low-mobility year groups (grades), even within the same school. The disruptive externalities of mobility are statistically significant, but actually very small in terms of their educational impact. An increase in annual entry rates from 0 to 10% (a 4 standard deviation change) would set the average incumbent pupil back by between 1 and 2 weeks, or about 4% of one standard deviation of the gain in pupil achievement between ages 7 and 11.

After a brief description of the general procedure in sampling inspection, we offer what we did call here as \"personalized procedures\": this means that we take into consideration the specific statistical law for time-to-failure. The original part refers to the construction of (n, 0) sampling plans and the use of ISO standard 2859 (MILSTD 105 E, the American original) in order to derive sampling plans by linking the AQL indicator (a defective fraction, in fact) to the hazard rate function.

The relative reinforcing effects of smoking were assessed in a 3-hr session on the final study day, when participants made 20 choices between smoking or money. The reinforcement contingencies exerted robust control over smoking, and programmed smoking lapses produced few discernible effects. These results further illustrate the robust control that reinforcement contingencies can exert over cigarette smoking and suggest that any effects of lapses on the relative reinforcing effects of smoking are modest under conditions involving abstinence-contingent reinforcement contingencies.

        "description":"This article reports a mixed-methods study that investigates academic success in English Medium Instruction (EMI) at a Chinese state university. Questionnaire, exam score (n = 100), and semi-structured interview data (n = 29) was collected from second-year undergraduate students majoring in Business Management. Content-related language proficiency, perceived success, and motivation were explored as possible significant predictors of academic success in EMI. Business English proficiency was a statistically significant predictor, highlighting that students with a lower level of proficiency need supplementary linguistic support in order to fully succeed in their EMI studies. Language learning motivation did not predict academic success, echoing previous findings (Rose, H., S. Curle, I. Aizawa, and G. Thompson. 2019. &quot;What drives success in English medium taught courses?&quot; The interplay between language proficiency, academic skills, and motivation. &quot;Studies in Higher Education&quot; 0 (0): 1-13. doi:10.1080/03075079.2019.1590690). &quot;Perceived success&quot; in EMI did predict &quot;actual success&quot; in EMI, highlighting the need to enhance students' perceptions of their own ability to succeed in EMI. Qualitative data revealed that students' perceptions of success in EMI centred around content knowledge acquisition, improved English proficiency, knowledge application and transformation, and forming new modes of thinking. Practical implications for pedagogy are discussed.",

The study investigated parental practices, views and perspectives related to children's digital practices and explored these in relation to wider cultural discourses around early childhood in the participant countries. The study adopted Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory to inform the questionnaire and interpretative data analysis of how parents' views and experiences are influenced by a wide range of social, cultural and personal factors. The findings demonstrate some coherence between beliefs among parents regarding very young children's use of touchscreen technologies and their place in the children's home lives. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight that the respondents from all countries expressed the need for further guidance regarding technology use, and better communication with early education and care centres. The study findings are discussed in relation to the reported uses of touchscreen technologies in the three different cultural contexts, parents' views on the benefits and/or disadvantages of children's touchscreen technology use, and the potential influences of dominant cultural discourses on parents' perceptions, views and practices.",

While the involvement of the PFC in this task has been established, limited information exists regarding the recruitment of broader circuitry, especially under the low- versus high-WM load. We sought to address this question by using a variable-delay operant DMS task. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained and tested to determine their baseline WM performance across all (0- to 24-sec) delays. Next, rats were tested in a single DMS test with either 0- or 24-sec fixed delay, to assess low-/high-load WM performance. &quot;c-Fos&quot; mRNA expression was quantified within cortical and subcortical regions and correlated with WM performance. High WM load up-regulated overall &quot;c-Fos&quot; mRNA expression within the PrL, as well as within a subset of mGlu5+ cells, with load-dependent, local activation of protein kinase C (PKC) as the proposed underlying molecular mechanism. The PrL activity negatively correlated with choice accuracy during high load WM performance. A broader circuitry, including several subcortical regions, was found to be activated under low and/or high load conditions. These findings highlight the role of mGlu5- and/or PKC-dependent signaling within the PrL, and corresponding recruitment of subcortical regions during high-load WM performance.",

Method: A study of speech perception was conducted using speech samples from 6 adult speakers with typical voice and 6 adult speakers with dysphonia. Speech samples were presented to 30 listeners with typical hearing in 3 noise conditions: quiet, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)+5, and SNR+0. Intelligibility scores were obtained via orthographic transcription as the percentage of correctly identified words. Speech samples were acoustically analyzed using CPP, and the correlation between the CPP measurements and intelligibility scores was examined. Results: The intelligibility of both typical and dysphonic speech was reduced as the level of background noise increased. The reduction was significantly greater in dysphonic speech. A strong correlation was noted between CPP and intelligibility score at SNR+0. Conclusions: Dysphonic speech is relatively harder to understand in the presence of background noise as compared with typical speech. CPP may be a useful predictor of this intelligibility deficit. Future work is needed to confirm these findings with a larger number of speakers and speech materials with known predictability.",

To solve a quadratic inequality in the form of ax[superscript 2] + bx + c &lt; 0 or in the equivalent form cx[superscript 2] + dx + e &lt; Ax + B most of the college algebra text books use either the sign chart for the left-hand side of the first inequality or graphs both functions which appear in each side of the second inequality (e.g., Swokowski &amp; Jeffery, 2000). In both approaches the solution is rather long. Some text books, for example Sullivan (2012), simplify the graphing approach to picture the graph of the quadratic function, locate the real zeros, if any, decide whether the graph of the function lies above or below the real line (x-axis) and finally obtain the interval solution of the first inequality. In this article, we present an algebraic approach to solve the above quadratic inequality. The proof can be taught to the students using algebraic results introduced earlier in the course. The approach and its proof do not use the sign chart, graphing functions or the simplified graphing approach as mentioned above.",

        "description":"The present study tested the &quot;interference hypothesis&quot;-that learning and using more advanced representations and strategies requires the inhibition of prior, less advanced ones. Specifically, it examined the relation between inhibitory control and number line estimation performance. Experiment 1 compared the accuracy of adults' (N = 53) estimates on 2 number line tasks, 1 with standard (power of 10) endpoints (0-1,000) and the other with nonstandard endpoints (364-1,364). Inhibition, as measured by Stroop task performance, predicted the accuracy of estimation on the nonstandard number line task, above and beyond estimation on the standard task. In Experiment 2, changes in kindergartners' (N = 42) 0-100 number line estimation were elicited through randomized training conditions, which involved playing a numerical board game. Stroop task performance was related to the rate of improvement in estimation, controlling for pretest number line task performance. The results provide a potential explanation for the relation between inhibitory control and mathematics achievement: Individuals with better inhibitory control may be better able to suppress the activation of prior knowledge and may be less vulnerable to interference from such knowledge. Potential implications for instructional design are discussed.",

Section 1 contains definitions, an explanation of the severity classification (a 5 point scale ranging from 0 for normal to 4 or 4+ for disorder), and a brief description of the severity rating scales. Section 2 consists of the severity rating scales common to all ages in the areas of attending skills, fluency, voice, and environmental factors. Sections 3 and 4 offer severity rating scales for the 4 to 5 and 3 to 4 year old child respectively and cover the areas of receptive language, expressive language, and articulation. Sections 5 and 6 offer  rating scales in expressive language for the 2.5 to 3 year old and 2 to 2.5 year old child. Scales for each area list the characteristics necessary to obtain each rating between 0 and 5. It is explained that a rating in excess of 4 can be achieved if the child displays problems in more than one parameter. For example, if a child receives a rating of 4 (disorder) in articulation and a 3 (deviation) in language, there would be a possible total rating of 7 indicating a higher priority for service. (SW)",

Major program emphases were designated as interstate coordination, expansion of secondary programs, and parental involvement. The program provided an intensive, short-term, full day, comprehensive academic program during the summer agricultural season, and an individualized, supplemental tutorial program during the regular school year. Summer projects included a preschool component for ages 0-5 and an elementary component for ages 5-21. Four projects offered a junior high curriculum for the older students who attended the day program. Nine projects included a secondary evening component for ages 12-21. Summer projects  emphasized oral language development and individualized instruction in reading and mathematics. Secondary evening programs allowed students to earn credit or accumulate hours toward partial credit for coursework completed during the summer in order to fulfill high school graduation requirements. Focusing on the activities and achievements of the summer and regular school year projects, this report lists the national and state goals for migrant education and presents information on identification and recruitment of eligible migrant families; staff development and project personnel; student academic achievement; parental involvement; interagency, interstate, and intrastate cooperation; information dissemination activities; and special projects.

        "description":"Over the past decade, computer games and other interactive technologies have shown great potential when used in innovative ways to enhance learning. It is now known that learning is associated not only with cognitive ability but also with affect. The incorporation of affective embodied pedagogical agents (EPAs) in computer programs for learning can significantly influence learner beliefs and efficacy. However, there have been a number of criticisms and contradictory empirical findings calling into question earlier results and theoretical claims on the effectiveness of using EPAs. Therefore, this paper reviewed studies that evaluated the effectiveness of affect in EPAs in a computer-based learning environment (CLE). The statistical meta-analytic review (k = 30, n = 2,150) found that the use of affect in EPAs has a significant and moderate impact (r = 0?.35) on students' learning motivation and a relatively smaller impact on knowledge retention (r =?0.29) and knowledge transfer (r?= 0?.26). The effect sizes of the three outcome variables in this review are stronger compared with previous meta-analysis on the impact of the embodiment level of EPAs, indicating that the use of affect is more desirable and effective in CLEs. Finally, implications for both designers and researchers of using affective EPAs in CLEs are discussed.",

We describe changes in elementary school cafeteria lunch sales patterns resulting from nutritional improvements in menu offerings that were part of a community-wide focus on health. Methods: Elementary school lunch sales data were collected for 1 week in each of 7 years in a district serving a predominantly poor, rural, and Caucasian student population, with high rates of obesity. &quot;Post hoc&quot; data analyses described lunch sales patterns and related food service costs over the project years. Results: The percentage of high calorie/low nutrition foods sold decreased from 22% of all sales in 2005 to 0% in 2011. High-calorie snack purchases decreased from 535 items to 0 items. The sale of fresh fruits increased by 12%. There was only a slight decline in the percentage of children who purchased cafeteria lunches over the years and a 15.2% cost increase for purchasing healthier food supplies. Conclusions: Elementary school children purchased healthier lunches when healthier menu items were offered and when less healthy foods were eliminated from the menu. There was no significant decline in the number of students who purchased lunches as nutritional improvements were made.",

They used a frame rate of 25 ms with a frame advance of 12.5 ms. Cepstral-based acoustic analysis proceeded in 2 phases, computing frame-level data and then organizing and summarizing this information within cry utterances. Using signal detection methods, the authors evaluated the accuracy of the automated system to determine voicing and to detect fundamental frequency (F[subscript 0]) as compared to voiced segments and pitch periods manually coded from spectrogram displays. Results: The system detected F[subscript 0] with 88% to 95% accuracy, depending on tolerances set at 10 to 20 Hz. Receiver operating characteristic analyses demonstrated very high accuracy at detecting voicing characteristics in the cry samples. Conclusions: This article describes an automated infant cry analyzer with high accuracy to detect important acoustic features of cry. A unique and important aspect of this work is the rigorous testing of the system&apos;s accuracy as compared to ground-truth manual coding. The resulting system has implications for basic and applied research on infant cry development.",

The results of the first study demonstrate that German-learning children frequently omit the initial &quot;wh&quot;-word. A lexical analysis of &quot;wh&quot;-less questions revealed that children are more likely to omit the &quot;wh&quot;-word &quot;was&quot; (&quot;what&quot;) than other &quot;wh&quot;-words (e.g. &quot;wo&quot; &quot;where&quot;). In the second study, we performed an acoustic analysis of sixty &quot;wh&quot;-questions that one mother produced during her child&apos;s third year of life. The results show that the &quot;wh&quot;-word &quot;was&quot; is much less likely to be accented than the &quot;wh&quot;-word &quot;wo&quot;, indicating a  relationship between children&apos;s omission of &quot;wh&quot;-words and the stress patterns associated with &quot;wh&quot;-questions.

Thirty-four experienced elementary school teachers and 26 undergraduate elementary education majors were the participants in the study. The range for teaching experience was from 0 to 36 years and range of teacher concern level was from 0 to 6 on a 7-point scale. The subjects participated in a computer-assisted instructional (CAI) program (INOBJ) designed to teach the identification and use of behavioral objectives in science. Each subject was given a pretest and posttest. Results indicated that students were generally  successful in learning the identification and use of behavioral objectives when taught by the CAI program INOBJ. Results indicated that teaching experience was inversely related to achievement, suggesting that content being taught was of less importance to experienced teachers who possibly tended to screen out material they felt irrelevant to post experience. Significant correlations between experience and concern level supported the inference that teacher concern level was a natural outgrowth of teaching experience. As a set these two variables were not useful in predicting achievement. (Author/EB)",

Magnitude representations of decimals became accurate earlier, improved more rapidly, and reached a higher asymptotic accuracy than magnitude representations of fractions. Analyses of individual differences revealed positive relations between the accuracy of decimal and fraction magnitude representations at all ages. In Experiment 2, we presented an additional set of 24 fourth graders (14 girls and 10 boys) with the same tasks but with the decimals that were being compared varying in the number of decimal digits. The decimal advantage continued to be present for both magnitude comparison and estimation tasks, indicating that the greater accuracy with decimals was not limited to decimals with equal numbers of decimal digits, though unequal numbers of decimal digits did impact performance with decimals on both magnitude comparison and number line estimation tasks.

The report provides information on trends in youth firearm deaths and finds the statistics alarming, despite recent decline. The first of three tables in the report delineates 1979-1999 statistics on firearm deaths of children and teens ages 0-19 nationwide, differentiating deaths due to homicide, suicide, accident, and unknown intent. The second table delineates 1997-1999 statistics on firearm deaths of children and teens ages 0-19 for each state and nationwide, differentiating deaths due to homicide, suicide, accident, and unknown intent. The final table provides information on firearm deaths in 1999 by age, race, and  manner. It is argued that despite recent declines, the number remains one of America's silent tragedies. The report finds that: (1) children and youths in rural states are more likely to be victims of gun suicides and accidents than those in more urban states; (2) children in large urban areas are more likely to be victims of gun homicides; and (3) 1.4 million homes, which house 2.6 million children, had firearms that were stored unlocked and loaded, or unlocked and unloaded but stored with ammunition. The report concludes by asserting that it is time to protect children instead of guns. (SD)",

        "description":"Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) is discussed at the level of an advanced course of statistical thermodynamics, clarifying some formal and physical aspects that are usually not covered by the standard pedagogical literature. The non-conventional approach adopted starts by showing that the continuum limit, in certain cases, cancels out the crucial role of the bosonic ground level. If so, a correct treatment of the problem, including the ground level population \"N[subscript 0]\" by construction, leads to BEC in a straightforward way. For a density of states of the form G([image omitted])[image omitted], the chemical potential [mu] is explicitly calculated as a function of the temperature \"T\" and of the number \"N\" of bosons, for various significant values of the positive exponent y. In the thermodynamic limit, in which the boson number \"N\" diverges and BEC is a sharp process, the chemical potential [mu] is a singular function of \"T\" at the critical temperature TB, determined by an appropriate critical exponent. The condensate population \"N[subscript 0]\" is studied analytically and numerically as a function of the temperature, for various values of \"N\" and for different y. This provides an accurate description of the way BEC approaches the character of a sharp phase transition. Some aspects of the real experiments on BEC, involving a finite number of bosons, are also illustrated. (Contains 2 figures and 5 footnotes.)",

        "description":"Domestic hens responded under multiple fixed-ratio fixed-ratio schedules with equal fixed ratios. One component provided immediate reinforcement and the other provided reinforcement after a delay, signaled by the offset of the key light. The components were presented quasi-randomly so that all four possible transitions occurred in each session. The delay was varied over 0, 4, 8, 16, and 32 s with fixed-ratio 5 schedules, and over 0, 8 and 32 s with fixed-ratio 1, 15 and 40 schedules. Main effects of fixed-ratio value and delay duration were detected on between-ratio pauses. Pauses were longer when the multiple-schedule stimulus correlated with a delayed-reinforcer component was presented, with the longest pauses occurring at the transition from a component with an immediate reinforcer to one with a delayed reinforcer. Pause durations were shortest during immediate components. Overall, both the presence or absence of a delay in the upcoming component and the presence or absence of a delay in the preceding component affected pause length but the upcoming delay had the larger effect. Thus changes in delay had similar effects to past reports of the effects of changes in response force, response requirement, and reinforcer magnitude in multiple fixed-ratio fixed-ratio schedules.

        "description":"Decimal numbers are generally assumed to be a straightforward extension of the base-ten system for whole numbers given their shared place value structure. However, in decimal notation, unlike whole numbers, the same magnitude can be expressed in multiple ways (e.g., 0.8, 0.80, 0.800, etc.). Here, we used a number line task with carefully selected stimuli to investigate how equivalent decimals (e.g., 0.8 and 0.80 on a 0-1 number line) and proportionally equivalent whole numbers (e.g., 80 on a 0-100 number line) are estimated. We find that young adults (n = 88, M[subscript age] = 20.22 years, SD = 1.65, 57 female) have a linear response pattern for both decimals and whole numbers, but those double-digit decimals (e.g., 0.08, 0.82, 0.80) are systematically underestimated relative to proportionally equivalent whole numbers (e.g., 8, 82, 80). Moreover, decimal string length worsens the underestimation, such that single-digit decimals (e.g., 0.8) are perceived as smaller than their equivalent double-digit decimals (e.g., 0.80). Finally, we find that exposing participants to whole number stimuli before decimal stimuli induces magnitude-based underestimation, that is, greater underestimation for larger decimals. Together, these results suggest a small but persistent underestimation bias for decimals less than one, and further that decimal magnitude estimation is fragile and subject to greater underestimation when exposed to whole numbers.",

Data comes from four sequentially offered sessions of a graduate education course. Students engaged in two to three online activities in groups of three or four. Students (n = 53) contributed from 0 to 56 labels (M = 12.42, SD = 13.50) and 18 to 114 messages (M = 39.70, SD = 18.04). Groups (n = 17) contributed from 0 to 109 labels, and 57 to 227 messages. Field-notes and descriptive statistics suggested there were seven labelling groups, seven non-labelling groups, and three groups difficult to categorize. None of the individual characteristics hypothesized to predict labelling did. Still, categories of users and non-users emerged from qualitative analyses: strategists, trusters, and techies contrasting with fringe participants, surface coasters, techie-shy, and fluid writers/thinkers/readers. Labelling appeared to be largely a family affair--which group a student belonged to correlated to how much he/she labelled. MANOVA gives for labelling usage F(16, 36) = 2.697, p less than 0.01.

Method: The authors used National Center for Voice and Speech voice dosimetry databank to calculate voicing percentage per hour as well as average dB SPL and fundamental frequency (F[subscript 0]). Occupational voice use (9:00 a.m.-3:00 p.m., weekdays) and nonoccupational voice use (4:00 p.m.-10:00 p.m., weekends) were compared (57 teachers, 2 weeks each). Results: Five key findings were uncovered: (1) Similar to previous studies, occupational voicing percentage per hour is more than twice that of nonoccupational voicing; (2) teachers experienced a wide range of occupational voicing percentages per hour (30 plus or minus 11% per hr); (3) average occupational voice was about 1 dB SPL louder than the nonoccupational voice and remained constant throughout the day; (4) occupational voice exhibited an increased pitch and trended upward throughout the day; and (5) some apparent gender differences were shown. Conclusions: Data regarding voicing percentages, F[subscript 0], and dB SPL provide critical insight into teachers' vocal health. Further, because nonoccupational voice use is added to an already overloaded voice, it may add key insights into recovery patterns and should be the focus of future studies.",

        "description":"A common mistake in analysis of cluster randomized experiments is to ignore the effect of clustering and analyze the data as if each treatment group were a simple random sample. This typically leads to an overstatement of the precision of results and anticonservative conclusions about precision and statistical significance of treatment effects. This article gives a simple adjustment to the \"t\" statistic that would be computed if clustering were (incorrectly) ignored in an experiment with two levels of nesting (e.g., classrooms and schools) where treatment assignment is made at the highest (e.g., school) level. The adjustment is a multiplicative factor depending on the number of clusters and subclusters, the cluster and subcluster sample sizes, and the cluster and subcluster intraclass correlations rho[subscript S] and rho[subscript C]. The adjusted \"t\" statistic has Student's \"t\" distribution with reduced degrees of freedom. The adjusted statistic reduces to the \"t\" statistic computed by ignoring clustering when rho[subscript S] = rho[subscript C] = 0. It reduces to the \"t\" statistic computed using cluster means when rho[subscript S] = 1. rho[subscript S] and rho[subscript C] are between 0 and 1, the adjusted \"t\" statistic lies between these two and the degrees of freedom are in between those corresponding to these two extremes.

        "description":"The early development of vocalic and consonantal production in Mandarin-learning infants was studied at the transition from babbling to producing first words. Spontaneous vocalizations were recorded for 24 infants grouped by age: G1 (0 ; 7 to 1 ; 0) and G2 (1 ; 1 to 1 ; 6). Additionally, the infant-directed speech of 24 caregivers was recorded during natural infant-adult interactions to infer language-specific effects. Data were phonetically transcribed according to broad categories of vowels and consonants. Vocalic development, in comparison with reports for children of other linguistic environments, exhibited two universal patterns: the prominence of [epsilon] and [schwa], and the predominance of low and mid vowels over high vowels. Language-specific patterns were also found, e.g. the early appearance and acquisition of low vowels [a]. Vowel production was similar in G1 and G2, and a continuum of developmental changes brought infants' vocalization closer to the adult model. Consonantal development showed two universal patterns: labials and alveolars occurred more frequently than velars; and nasals developed earlier than fricatives, affricates and liquids. We also found two language-specific patterns: alveolars were more prominent than labials and affricates developed early. Universal and language-specific characteristics in G1 continued to be prominent in G2. These data indicate that infants are sensitive to the ambient language at an early age, and this sensitivity influences the nature of their vocalizations.",

Furthermore, we investigate how Piracetam could potentially enhance learning, with specific focus on brain areas. However, even though Piracetam may enhance learning, the question that arises is how safe it is at a cellular level. Therefore the effect of Piracetam at a cellular level was determined. To achieve this purpose the effect of a 24-hour exposure to 0-70 mM Piracetam on the growth of the L929 cell line and chick embryonic neurons \"in vitro\" was investigated. No statistically significant changes in cell viability or number was observed at 0-7 mM Piracetam in both cell types, although at 70 mM cell viability in the L929 cell line was significantly reduced when compared with the control. Initial studies indicate that Piacetam is only toxic at concentrations greater than 70 mM; however, the effects of repeated dosages over long periods still need to be investigated.",

        "description":"The recently observed acceleration of the expansion of the universe is a topic of intense interest. The favoured causes are the \"cosmological constant\" or \"dark energy\". The former, which appears in the Einstein equations as the term [lambda]g[subscript [mu]v], provides an extremely simple, well-defined mechanism for the acceleration. However, there is a school of thought that suggests that the cosmological constant is inadequate to explain fully the evolution of the universe and should be replaced by a slowly varying scalar field--the aforementioned dark energy. The situation is complicated by the circumstance that the expression for the cosmological constant is precisely that of the zero-point energy of a quantum field, [epsilon][subscript 0]g[subscript [mu]v]. This strongly suggests the two are related. There are several problems here. The \"calculated\" value of the various contributions to [epsilon][subscript 0] may be as much as 120 orders of magnitude greater than the \"observed\" value of [lambda]. How these contributions add up to so minute a quantity is a major part of what is commonly termed \"the cosmological constant problem\". Traces of dark energy have yet to be found. We review some of the history and problems associated with the concepts of the cosmological constant and dark energy, provide a brief review of the relevant cosmology and review possible candidates for dark energy.

        "author":["Kermond, John"],
        "description":"In this paper, the author investigates the algebraic curve defined by the relation y[superscript 3] - 3y + 2x = 0. Treating this relation as a reduced cubic in the variable y, he uses a procedure first discovered by the mathematician Scipione del Ferro (Nahin, 1998, pp. 8-10) to obtain an expression for y in terms of x, namely y = (-x + [square root](x[superscript 2]-1))[superscript 1/3] - (x + [square root](x[squared]-1))[superscript 1/3]. By applying de Moivre's theorem to each term on the right hand side of the second equation, he obtains three different branches of y and uses them to show that the domain of the curve is the set of all real numbers. He finds the derivative using implicit differentiation and uses it to determine additional properties and features of these branches. Although it might seem that a graphics calculator can be used to draw a graph of the curve from the second equation, there is a problem in that such graphs have a break over the interval -1 less than x less than 1. This suggests (incorrectly) that the interval -1 less than x less than 1 is not in the domain of the curve. He explains the reason for this problem in the last part of the paper.

Results showed that infants and toddlers with secure attachment relationships lived in higher quality home environments than did children with insecure attachment relationships. In particular, children with insecure-resistant attachment relationships lived in more unsafe and less organized homes with less play material available. For preschoolers, a lower quality home environment predicted more negativity and noncompliance toward their mothers in a play setting outside the home. With regard to the caregiving context, the socioeconomic status of the family was strongly related to the quality of preschoolers' home environment. Scores on the HOME Inventory for Infants/Toddlers and the HOME Inventory for Early Childhood were related to other culture-specific contextual characteristics for 0- to 6-year old Indonesian children as well. As a whole, the HOME was a good indicator of the general quality of the Sundanese Indonesian home environment.",

        "description":"Background: Virtual reality technology is increasingly used in medical education to facilitate immersive experiences allowing users to interact with a simulated environment to foster learning. However, the potential barriers to this experience from a user perspective have not been fully explored. Methods: Twenty final-year medical students participated in answering a pre- and post-simulation questionnaire as part of a facilitated virtual reality simulation session. The questionnaire explored participants' expectations and experiences of virtual reality, in relation to adverse effects, interest and usefulness through 0-10 rating scales. Free-text questioning was used for further discussion. Results: Ratings of all assessed adverse symptoms experienced by students were significantly lower than their expected ratings (p &lt; 0.01), and ratings of reported usefulness and interest in virtual reality significantly increased post-simulation (p &lt; 0.01). The median ratings given for all symptoms experienced by students were either 0 or 1/10 (none/minimal). Free-text comments raised problems of visual focussing in those who wear glasses. Discussion: Our results suggest that virtual reality is an appropriate simulation modality which is acceptable to students. Potential barriers such as cybersickness and discomfort were minimally experienced and did not impact reported usefulness. We promote the generalisability of these findings by demonstrating them on commonly used consumer equipment and a common use case.",

This cross-sectional study analyzes parental competences, perception of efficacy and parenting satisfaction, among Spanish fathers and mothers with young children aged 0-3 years, and examines their relationship with socio-familial variables (parents' age, gender, and education level) and children's characteristics (age, gender, disability, chronic illness, premature birth, and early care). Participants included 868 parents. Results show that all dimensions of parental competences were associated with socio-familial variables and/or the children's characteristics. Among others, mothers had significantly higher scores than fathers in most of the competences, with the exception monitoring of their parental activity, self-care and parental satisfaction. Regression analyses showed that the variables analyzed in this study explained 25% of the variance in the total parental competence score. Specifically, the associated variables were being a mother, younger age, having fewer children, male gender of the children, satisfaction, and sense of parenting efficacy. These results reinforce the need to offer preventive and supportive strategies for positive parenting in Spanish families, taking into consideration their socio-familial characteristics and those of their children.",

A total of 562 studies were identified, and after applying the eligibility criteria, 73 articles were included in the synthesis of this scoping review. The mean decayed, lost, and restored teeth index (DMFT/dfmt) ranged from 0 to 12.37; the mean DMFT index (permanent dentition) from 0.06 to 6.2; and the average dmft index (deciduous dentition) ranged from 0.29 to 9.91. The mean simplified oral hygiene index (OHIS) ranged from 0 to 3.4; gingival index (GI) from 0.29 to 2; and plaque index (PI) from 0.005 to 3.15. Plaque prevalence was 25.9% to 90%; dental calculus from 4.7% to 59.41%; gingivitis from 36.7% to 100%. Bruxism was 10.3% to 73%, and dental trauma was 4.7% to 100%. This disparity in the results shows the heterogeneity of this population, with different degrees of socio-behavioral impairment, which can directly influence oral hygiene and the consequent accumulation of biofilm.",

Method: Fifty-five adults with Down syndrome (19-58 years) participated in this observational study. &quot;Dementia&quot; and &quot;Alzheimer's dementia&quot; (Alzheimer's disease) were diagnosed clinically and operationalised CAMDEX-ICD-10 criteria were applied to evaluate criterion validity. Validity and reliability of the CAMCOG-DS were analysed. Results: Specificity of the interview was 69-93%; sensitivity 0-80% for &quot;dementia&quot;; and 0-20% for Alzheimer's disease. A complete CAMCOG-DS score was obtained in 85% (item difficulty 0.11-0.96). Construct validity and retest-reliability were low to moderate ([tau] = 0.04-0.79), inter-rater reliability excellent ([tau] = 0.70-0.89), internal consistency and selectivity acceptable to excellent. Conclusions: Currently, the CAMDEX-DS including the CAMCOG-DS are the outcome assessments for assessing dementia in Down syndrome with the best psychometric properties; however, revision is recommended.",

        "description":"Recently, to evaluate dynamic balance ability, a stipulated tempo step test has been developed, and a step error between tempo and contact time of feet has been used as an evaluation variable. The step error, postural sway, and their relationships may differ between the slow tempo (40 bpm) and fast tempo (120 bpm). This study aimed to examine the aforementioned problem with 62 participant children (30 boys and 32 girls). The step error and postural sway variables (X-axis path length, Y-axis path length, total path length, peripheral area, and rectangular area) during stepping while matching both tempos were measured. Means of one minute and three intervals (0-20 sec, 20-40 sec, and 40-60 sec) for each variable were calculated in both tempos. The results of the paired t-test showed that means of all variables were larger in the 40 bpm tempo than in the 120 bpm tempo. In the multiple comparison tests after the results of the two-way repeated measures ANOVA, the means of three intervals in all variables were larger in the 40 bpm tempo than in the 120 bpm tempo; the means of the sway variables, excluding that of the X-axis path length, in the 40 bpm tempo were larger in the 0-20 sec interval than in the 20-40 sec interval or the 40-60 sec interval. Correlations between step errors and those between the step error and sway variables of both tempos were insignificant or under moderation. The correlations between the step error and sway variables in both tempos were insignificant or significant but low, and those among sway variables were high, except between the X- and Y-axis path lengths. The relationship between both axis path lengths differed according to the tempo. In conclusion, in the case of the stipulated tempo step test targeting children, the slow tempo has a greater step error and postural sway than the fast tempo, and the sway in the early step stage is greater in the slow tempo. The relationships between step errors and between the step error and sway variables of both tempos are low; hence, the ability related to the test may differ in both tempos. The relationships among sway variables in both tempos are high, except between the X- and Y-axis path lengths.",

        "description":"Background/Context: Regression discontinuity (RD) designs are used for policy and program evaluation where subjects' eligibility into a program or policy is determined by whether an assignment variable (i.e., running variable) exceeds a pre-defined cutoff. Under a standard RD design with a continuous assignment variable, the average treatment effect (ATE) at the cutoff can be non-parametrically identified and can be estimated by comparing the average outcomes among subjects &quot;just below&quot; and &quot;just above&quot; the cutoff (Hahn, Todd, &amp; van der Klaauw, 2001; Imbens &amp; Lemieux, 2008; Lee &amp; Lemieux, 2010). However, often in practice, the running variable that determines subjects' eligibility into the program is based on discrete or ordinal variables. For example, to evaluate the effectiveness of extended time accommodations (ETA) on test scores, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) assessment used students' ELL English proficiency categories, an ordinal variable with six levels (No Proficiency, ELL Beginning, ELL Intermediate, ELL Advanced, Formerly ELL, and Never ELL) as the eligibility criterion. Specifically, students with ELL Advanced (i.e., the cutoff) or lower level were eligible to receive ETA. Due to the ordinal running variable, the ATE at the cutoff cannot be identified with traditional techniques because the notion of &quot;just below&quot; and &quot;just above&quot; does not exist for discrete variables. Purpose/Objective/Research Question: This paper provides a framework to use RD with an ordinal running variable by adapting the identification and estimation strategy proposed by Lee and Card (2008) to ordinal, discrete variables. The primary strategy maps the ordinal running variable onto a numeric scale based on a scaling function and uses mixed effects regression models to extrapolate near the cutoff. We also present sensitivity analyses to check the conclusions' robustness to (i) the choice of the scaling function, (ii) the choice of the cutoff value, and (iii) an unobserved confounder. We use our approach to assess the effects of ETA on students' math proficiency in the 2017 NAEP study. The NAEP Assessment/Setting/Population/Program/Research Design/Data Analysis: We briefly provide background information on the program (ETA) and the NAEP study. Setting: The NAEP assessment is the largest nationally representative and continuing assessment (Oranje &amp; Kolstad, 2019), and the 2017 NAEP assessment was conducted for grades 4 and 8 in mathematics, reading, and writing. Population: Our target population is 4th grade students whose English proficiency level is at the Advanced ELL category, but do not have disabilities. Program: ETA is available only to ELL or students with disabilities (SD). It provides them with up to 3 times of the regular time, i.e., 90 minutes per block in the NAEP assessment (Kim &amp; Circi, 2018, 2019). In the 2017 NAEP Grade-4 data, about 8.7% of the original reporting sample was ELL only, 11.7% was SD only, and 1.5% had both ELL and SD status. About 10.6% of the sample received ETA. Research Design: We use the aforementioned RD design to evaluate ETA's effects and we use ELL English proficiency categories as an ordinal running variable. Data Collection and Analysis: Our final analysis sample consisted of 116,910 students from 7,450 schools (78.2% of the original sample). Note that numbers are rounded to nearest tens. Our proposed analysis is based on using an RD design with an ordinal running variable. The outline of our identification and estimation plan is summarized above. We also conduct sensitivity analyses to assess the sensitivity of our conclusions to design-related features. Findings/Results: In this section, we formalize the key identifying assumptions for RD designs with an ordinal running variable and we highlight our estimation strategy. Let A[subscript ij] [element-of] {0, 1} be a binary treatment variable for student &quot;i&quot; from school &quot;j.&quot; Treatment status is determined by ordinal running variable X[subscript ij] where each category [omega subscript 1],..., [omega subscript K] is assigned to a numerical scaling function S([omega subscript k]) = x[subscript k](k=1,..., K); for our study, A[subscript ij] = 1 if X[subscript ij] [less than or equal to] x[subscript c] and A[subscript ij] = 0 if X[subscript ij] &gt; x[subscript c] where a cutoff score x[subscript c] is the scale value of the Advanced ELL category. Let Z[subscript ij] [element-of] {0, 1} be a binary treatment received variable where Z[subscript ij] = 1 if student &quot;ij&quot; received ETA and otherwise, Z[subscript ij] = 0. Let Y[subscript ij] be the observed outcome. We make the following assumption on the outcome: (A1) Outcome Regression Function: E[Y[subscript ij]|X[subscript ij] = x[subscript k]] = A[subscript ij][tau](x[subscript c]) + h[subscript S](x[subscript k]) with h[subscript S](x[subscript c])=E[Y[subscript ij](0)|X[subscript ij] = x[subscript c]] Here, h[subscript S](x[subscript k]) is a continuous parametric function with respect to the chosen scaling function S([omega subscript k]) = x[subscript k]. The requirement h[subscript S](x[subscript c])=E[Y[subscript ij](0)|X[subscript ij] = x[subscript c]] guarantees that the expected potential control outcome Y[subscript ij](0) at the cutoff score is predicted by h[subscript S](x[subscript c]). The parameter [tau](x[subscript c]) is the ATE (i.e., ITT) at the cutoff x[subscript c]. To identify the LATE, we make the following assumption on the treatment received variable: (A2) Treatment Regression Function: E[Z[subscript ij]|X[subscript ij] = x[subscript k]] = A[subscript ij][alpha] + g[subscript S](x[subscript k]) with g[subscript S](x[subscript c])=E[Z[subscript ij](0)|X[subscript ij] = x[subscript c]] Here, g[subscript S](x[subscript k]) is a continuous parametric function with respect to the scaling function S([omega subscript k]) = x[subscript k]. The term [alpha] represents the discontinuity in treatment probabilities at the cutoff and is used to estimate LATE at the cutoff. Under the assumptions above, we estimated the ITT and LATE of ETA on math scores at the cutoff. We found that among ETA-eligible students (i.e., ELL), about 32.5% actually received ETA. We also found that there is no evidence of an ITT (i.e., the effect of ETA eligibility) on math scores at the cutoff, whereas there is strong evidence of a LATE (i.e., the effect of receiving ETA among complier students) on math scores at the cutoff. Also, our sensitivity analyses revealed that our ITT estimate was sensitive to the choice of the cutoff value. But the LATE estimate was insensitive to the choices of the scaling function and the cutoff value, and an unmeasured confounder. Conclusions: In this paper, we proposed to use an RD design with an ordinal running variable. Despite the additional assumptions necessary to identify the ATE (i.e., ITT) and the LATE, our proposed approach yields insights about the effectiveness of ETA on test scores and can be a useful tool to evaluate the effects of testing accommodations in educational studies."},

        "author":["Raff, Lionel M."],
        "description":"The thermodynamic criteria for spontaneity and equilibrium in multireaction systems are developed and discussed. When N reactions are occurring simultaneously, it is shown that G and A will depend upon N independent reaction coordinates, ?a (a = 1,2, ..., N), in addition to T and p for G or T and V for A. The general criteria for spontaneity and equilibrium are the same as those for a single-reaction system, dG = 0 (T and p constant) or dA = 0 (T and V constant). However, dG and dA are now the sum of N terms. It is shown that this sum has the form dG = dA = ?[subscript a=1][superscript N] ?[subscript r]µ[subscript a] d?[subscript a], where ?[subscript r]µ[subscript a] is the reaction chemical potential for reaction a, (?G/??a)[subscript T,p,?j]. Consequently, the result that dG &lt; 0 at a particular composition provides no information about which of the N reactions are proceeding spontaneously and which are nonspontaneous. At most compositions, there exist an infinite number of both spontaneous and nonspontaneous pathways for the system. Equilibrium in a multireaction system exists at a single composition point, as is the case for a single-reaction system. Determination of this point requires the simultaneous solution of N algebraic equations, which are often nonlinear. Although there exists an infinite number of possible, spontaneous paths, the thermodynamically most probable path is shown to be along the negative gradient of the thermodynamic potential. This path corresponds to that for the maximum chemical force. It is also shown to correspond to the statistically most-probable reaction path. The analysis demonstrates that the direction cosines for the negative gradient vector at each composition point are given by the reaction chemical potentials. The equations yielding the gradient vector comprise a set of N, coupled, first-order differential equations involving the reaction chemical potentials whose solution depends upon the initial state of the system. The calculation is, therefore, analogous to the computation of a trajectory in a molecular dynamics study. The analysis clearly shows that the reaction chemical potentials determine spontaneity, equilibrium, and the thermodynamically expected reaction path, not G, A, ?G, or ?A. The principles resulting from the analysis are illustrated by application to a simple reaction system involving unimolecular isomerization along two pathways.",

Data from one administration of four mixed-format Advanced Placement (AP) Exams were used to create pseudo old and new forms sharing common items. Population invariance analyses were conducted based on levels of examinee parental education using a single group (SG) equating design. Old and new form groups with common item effect sizes (ESs) ranging from 0 to 0.75 were created by sampling examinees based on their level of parental education. Equating was conducted for four common item nonequivalent group (CINEG) design equating methods: frequency estimation, chained equipercentile, item response theory (IRT) true score, and IRT observed score. Groups with ESs greater than zero were matched using matching techniques including exact matching on parental education level and propensity score matching including other background variables. The accuracy of equating results was evaluated by comparing differences between comparison (ES greater than 0) and criterion equating (ES=0) relationships using the root expected mean squared difference statistic, classification consistency for AP grades, and standard errors of equating. The accuracy of equating results and the adequacy of statistical equating assumptions was compared for unmatched and matched samples.    There was relatively little population dependence of equating results, despite large subgroup performance differences. As ES increased, CINEG equating results tended to become less accurate and less consistent. Large differences between criterion and comparison equating relationships appeared to be caused by violations of equating assumptions. As group differences increased, the degree to which frequency estimation and chained equipercentile statistical assumptions held decreased. All exams showed some evidence of multidimensionality. The matching methods that included parental education appeared to improve equating accuracy and the degree to which equating assumptions held for very large ESs.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to explore what proportion of staff development as measured by the National Staff Development Council's Standard Assessment Inventory (SAI) contributes to campus success as measured by the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS). Two exploratory null hypotheses were generated and tested in an attempt to explore outcomes using the SAI and TAKS scores.    H[subscript 0] Campus Success (Y) based on the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills is not a function of implementation of the National Staff Development Council Standards (X) based on Standard Assessment Inventory.    H[subscript 0] Campus success (Y) is not a function of the context (X[subscript 1]), process (X[subscript 2]), or content (X[subscript 3]) components of staff development.    The responding population (n = 81 teachers; n = 23 campuses) completed surveys which were then analyzed along with campus TAKS averages. An exploratory linear regression analysis in the investigation of the first null hypothesis revealed a regression coefficient, (R) 0.668 (R[superscript 2] = 0.447, adjusted R[superscript 2] = 0.420), p less than 0.05. Additionally, the full model of the second hypothesis revealed a regression coefficient (R) of 0.684 (R[superscript 2] = 0.468, adjusted R[superscript 2] = 0.384). A backward elimination model, where independent variables were removed, was used to get each component's unique variance.    When context (X[subscript 1]), was removed it yielded a unique variance of 0.5%. When process (X[subscript 2]) was removed it yielded a unique variance of 0%. Lastly, when content (X[subscript 3]) was removed it yielded a unique variance of 2.9%. Similarly, using a step-wise regression analysis yielded a regression coefficient, (R) of 0.678 (R[superscript 2] = 0.46, and adjusted R[superscript 2] = 0.434, p less than 0.05). Based on the exploratory status of this study, the researcher believes the consistency of findings of those with the pilot studies contributes to the greater body of knowledge with data supporting a relationship among staff development and campus success. Evidence also supports more research is needed to find unique variance among the three components and 12 subcomponents of the SAI.

        "description":"In this study, we investigated how empirical indicators of test-taking engagement can be defined, empirically validated, and used to describe group differences in the context of the Programme of International Assessment of Adult Competences (PIAAC). The approach was to distinguish between disengaged and engaged response behavior by means of response time thresholds. Constant thresholds of 3000 ms and 5000 ms were considered, as well as item-specific thresholds based on the visual inspection of (bimodal) response time distributions (VI method) and the proportion correct conditional on response time (P+&gt;0% method). Overall, the validity checks comparing the proportion correct of engaged and disengaged response behavior by domain and by item showed that the P+&gt;0% method performed slightly better than the VI method and the methods assuming constant thresholds. The results for Literacy and Numeracy by module revealed that there was an increase from Module 1 to Module 2 in the proportion of disengaged responses, suggesting a drop in test-taking engagement. The investigation of country differences in test-taking engagement by domain using the P+&gt;0% method showed that the proportion of responses classified as disengaged was quite low. For Literacy, the proportion was well below 5% for the majority of countries; in Numeracy, the proportion was even smaller than 1% for almost all countries; while for Problem solving, the proportion of disengaged responses was more than 5% but usually well below 10%. There were significant differences in test-taking engagement between countries; the obtained effect sizes were small to medium. Population differences in test-taking engagement were highly correlated between the three domains, suggesting that test-taking engagement can be conceived as a consistent characteristic. Furthermore, there was a clear negative association between test-taking disengagement and proficiency in Literacy, Numeracy and Problem solving, respectively. Finally, subgroup differences for gender, age, educational attainment, and language proved to be insignificant or very small. Results suggest that males tend to be more disengaged, that disengagement increases with age in Problem solving, with lower educational attainment and when the test language is not the same as a testee's native language. Appended are: (1) Country differences in test-taking engagement; and (2) Subgroup differences in test-taking engagement.",

        "description":"The primary purpose of this study was to determine potential future research priorities for the Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service. The Delphi method of forecasting was determined to be the most appropriate for use in this study. Having a knowledge of, and a current relationship with, the Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service (LCES) was the initial criteria for selecting panelists for this study. The final panel consisted of forty LCES personnel. Three rounds of questionnaires were used in this study. The Round 0 questionnaire was open-ended and was used to generate a list of perceived research items most in need of research solutions by the LCES. It generated 165 perceived research items. A compiled list of all the research priorities obtained from Round 0 was included in the Round 1 instrument. The Round 1 questionnaire requested the participants to rate each identified item on a 7-point Likert-type scale. The scale ranged from &quot;1 = Strongly Agree&quot; to &quot;7 = Strongly Disagree.&quot; The Round 2 questionnaire again consisted of the research priorities identified by the Round 0 questionnaire. The Round 2 questionnaire requested the participants to again rate each identified item on the same 7-point Likert-type scale. The group rating (median) from Round 1 was given for each item. Consensus was considered to have been reached on an item if 60% of the respondents fell within one rating above or below the median for that item in Round 2. Consensus was reached on 162 of the 165 research items. The item rated the highest by the panel was: &quot;Research to develop an agent evaluation instrument that will give a true picture of the kind of job each individual agent is really doing.&quot; The third objective of this study was to determine if a difference existed between state level personnel (n = 22) and field staff (n = 18) in their rating of the research items. The results of the t-tests indicated that there was no significant difference in the responses of state level personnel and field staff in either their overall ratings or their ratings by category in Round 2.

        "description":"Objectives: The majority of children born preterm, with low birth weight, or small for gestational age are born with low-to-moderate risk (LTM), yet most research focuses on the high-risk group. Little is known about whether children with LTM perinatal risk are at greater risk for mental health problems, or what the role of early maternal parenting is in determining these outcomes. Method: Longitudinal data were from a large nationally representative Australian cohort of 5,000 children, aged 0 to 1, 2 to 3, and 4 to 5 years of age. Participants were 354 children with LTM perinatal risk born at 33 to 36 weeks, with birth weight 1,501 to 2,499 grams, or born between the first and 10th percentiles for gestational age; and 2,461 children in the normal birth weight, term comparison group. Child mental health was measured by mother-report on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Parenting irritability, warmth, self-efficacy, maternal separation anxiety, and overprotective parenting were measured when children were 0 to 1 and 2 to 3 years of age. Results: Parents in the LTM perinatal risk group were more likely to experience parenting difficulties on one of eight parenting measures (irritable parenting at age 0-1 year) when adjusting for socio-demographic differences (odds ratio = 1.43; 95% confidence interval = 1.05, 1.95, p less than 0.02). This group difference was no longer apparent by age 2 to 3 years. Compared with healthy-term peers, there were small increases in Emotional Symptoms and Total Difficulties on the SDQ for the LTM perinatal risk group at age 4 to 5 years. When accounting for maternal-specific and socio-demographic factors, LTM perinatal risk group continued to predict Emotional Symptoms but not Total Difficulties at age 4 to 5 years. Conclusions: Children with LTM perinatal risk were at a small increased risk for emotional difficulties but did not differ significantly from other children of similar social backgrounds in their risk for generalized mental health problems. These findings support a biological and socio-economic, rather than parenting, pathway to psychological risk in children born with LTM perinatal risk. (Contains 4 tables.)",

        "description":"Background: Efficacy trials in education often possess a motivating theory of change: how and why should the desired improvement in outcomes occur as a consequence of the intervention? In scenarios with repeated measurements, certain subgroups may be more or less likely to manifest a treatment effect; the theory of change (TOC) provides guidance as to which are best situated to benefit. Our method, Power-maximizing Weighting for Repeated-measurements with Delayed-effects (PWRD aggregation) converts the TOC into a test statistic with greater asymptotic relative efficiency and thus, greater statistical power than extant alternatives when the TOC proves true. We illustrate the benefit of our method through its application on a cluster randomized trial testing the efficacy of BURST[R]: Reading (BURST), a program designed to assist elementary students falling behind in reading ability. The TOC behind BURST holds program benefits to be delayed and non-uniform, experienced only after a student's performance stalls. As a result, the treatment effect should not be constant. Rather, its effects should be greatest following points when student learning has stalled. Accordingly, beginning from separate estimates of the average treatment effect for different subgroups and occasions of follow-up, PWRD aggregation combines these effect estimates with attention to both their expected sizes and their mutual correlations with one another, which are deduced from the intervention's environing TOC. Purpose: The objective behind PWRD aggregation is to increase the asymptotic relative efficiency and thus, improve the statistical power in primary outcome analysis compared to extant alternatives when the governing theory of change is accurate. Research Design: In education settings, students often enter and exit the study at various points so researchers frequently have different numbers of observations on each student. For example, BURST examined a reading intervention for early elementary students across four years. Table 1 illustrates our design for the first of four cohorts. Data sources for similarly structured efficacy trials will incorporate a similar design, with varying numbers of observations on any given student. Thus, the method chosen to handle repeated measurements is of great importance not only in BURST but in other longitudinal settings as well. Perhaps the simplest way to make use of repeated measurements is to fit a linear model predicting student-year observations from independent variables identifying the cohort and time of follow-up; if we assume these observations are independent, then each observation receives equal weight. Thus, we refer to this method as &quot;flat weighting&quot;. While simple, flat weighting is inefficient because student-year observations are not independent. Instead, many education researchers fit a mixed effects model, allowing for clustering within students, classrooms, or schools. But despite the ensuing improvement in efficiency, the mixed effects model fails to take into account which subgroups and occasions of follow-up are best situated to exhibit a treatment effect. This is especially true when effects are delayed rather than instantaneous so students only receive the intervention once their reading performance stalls. We see this phenomenon arise in Table 2 for the first cohort of students participating in BURST. We observe larger differences between treatment and control means as students participate in the study for longer. In later years, students have had a greater opportunity to require supplemental instruction and thus, to benefit. PWRD aggregation looks to use the TOC to deduce which subgroups are most likely to benefit and then weights the separate effect estimates for each subgroup in a manner that will best allow a researcher to detect an effect of the intervention using the aggregated statistic. PWRD Aggregation: Define [delta subscript gt] as the parameter representing the intention-to-treat (ITT) effect for cohort g during year of follow-up t: [delta subscript gt] = E(Y[subscript gt(Z=1)] - Y[subscript gt(Z=0)]|G=g,T=t), where Z=1 and Z=0 denote assignment to the treatment and control respectively. Now take some hypothesis test of no-effect such that [delta subscript agg]=[sigma subscript g,t] [omega subscript gt][delta subscript gt] is zero or negative against the alternative that [delta subscript agg]&gt;0. Here, [omega subscript gt] represents the aggregation weight attached to [delta subscript gt]. If the following assumptions about the theory of change hold, PWRD aggregation will improve power to detect an effect compared to common alternatives: Individuals who receive supplemental instruction as a result of the intervention at time j receive an effect [tau] [greater than or equal to] 0 at some point between j and when they exit the study. Individuals who do not receive supplemental instruction are unaffected. Effect [tau] received by individual i at time j is retained in full throughout the duration of the study. Under these conditions, the following weights [omega] maximize the asymptotic relative efficiency of the aggregated test statistic: [omega] [direct proportionality] p[sigma superscript -1], where p[subscript gt] = P(An individual in cohort g is eligible to receive the supplemental instruction by year of follow-up t) and [sigma] denotes the expected relative covariances between the ITT estimates. For more details, see the appendix. Results: We use a simulation design mirroring BURST to compare power under PWRD aggregation with power under flat weighting, a mixed model with school-level random effects, and a method that solely analyzes students when they exit the study. Initial effects are generated for all students as follows: Y[subscript ijk] = [beta subscript 0] + [beta subscript 1]Grade[subscript ijk] + [mu subscript k] + [epsilon subscript ijk] [mu subscript k] = [gamma subscript 0] + ?[subscript k], with ?[subscript k] ~ N(0,[xi]). The outcome Y[subscript ijk] of student i in year of follow-up j at school k is a function of the grade of the student and the random intercept of the school at which the student is enrolled, [mu subscript k]. Then we impose artificial treatment effects on students assigned to treatment schools in a manner consistent with BURST's TOC. Figure 1 presents our findings. It is apparent that PWRD aggregation provides far greater power than other methods while maintaining proper Type I error rates. This holds across both small and large effect sizes. Under relaxed conditions allowing for interference within schools, PWRD aggregation provides similar gains in power. Conclusion: In this paper, we present an aggregation scheme that maximizes power when the theory of change holds. We demonstrate this through a simulation study mirroring a large-scale randomized trial for a reading intervention."},

        "description":"Background/Context: Observational studies often employ regression discontinuity (RD) designs and multiple control-group designs to explore the causal quantities of interest. RD designs assess policy and program effectiveness by assigning subjects to treatment based on whether they exceed a pre-defined cutoff. RD designs are classified into two types depending on subjects' compliance with the assigned treatment status. In particular, when compliance is not complete, fuzzy RD designs are used to estimate the local average treatment effect (LATE) at the cutoff (Imbens &amp; Lemieux, 2008). Multiple control groups arise when there are various reasons for students' non-participation in treatment, and their value depends on the availability of supplementary information about unobserved biases. For example, when one control group produces positive unobserved bias and the other produces negative bias, the two control groups can yield consistent and unbiased estimates of bounds on the treatment effect (Rosenbaum, 1987). However, despite the potential benefits of using multiple control groups, there has been limited research on their utilization in RD designs. Purpose/Objective: This paper aims to combine fuzzy RD designs and multiple control-group designs to evaluate the effect of extended time accommodations (ETA) on student performance. Two control groups are formed in ETA settings, one for students who did not receive ETA and another for students who received ETA but did not use it. Our approach enables causal identification and estimation of the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) at the cutoff from the fuzzy RD design, along with its bounds formed by utilizing the two control groups, which serves as a sensitivity analysis. We also propose flexible estimators based on machine learning (ML) to construct the bounds on the ATT at the cutoff. The NAEP Assessment/Setting/Population/Program/Research Design/Data Analysis: Setting: The NAEP assessment used in this paper is the largest continuing and nationally representative assessment in the United States (Oranje &amp; Kolstad, 2019). Population: Our study focuses on 8-th grade students with the advanced English language learner (ELL) proficiency who do not have disabilities. Program: The ETA program is designed to provide ELL or students with disabilities, up to three times the regular testing time during the NAEP assessment. Research Design: We employ our proposed RD design with multiple control groups to evaluate the effect of ETA on student achievement. We use ELL English proficiency categories as the running variable in the RD design. Data Analysis: We analyze data from the 2017 NAEP assessment for grade 8, along with process data containing approximately 28,000 students. Using process data, we identify students who made use of ETA during the test. Findings/Results: We present the key identifying assumptions for a fuzzy RD design and outline our estimation strategy for constructing causal bounds using multiple control groups. We define a binary treatment variable A[subscript ij] [element of] {0, 1} for student &quot;I&quot; from school &quot;j,&quot; which is determined by a discrete running variable X[subscript ij]; specifically, A[subscript ij] = 1 if X[subscript ij] [less than or equal to] x[subscript c] and A[subscript ij] = 0 if X[subscript ij] &gt; x[subscript c] where x[subscript c] is a cutoff score. We also define T[subscript ij] = 1 if student &quot;ij&quot; used ETA and T[subscript ij] = 0 otherwise, and define the observed outcome Y[subscript ij]. In addition to the four identifying assumptions for a fuzzy RD design with a discrete running variable (i.e., outcome regression function, treatment regression function, local monotonicity, and local exclusion restriction) (Lee &amp; Card, 2008; Suk et al., 2022), we require another identifying assumption as: (A5) Local Absence of Always-Takers: Pr(T[subscript ij](1) = T[subscript ij](0) = 1 | X[subscript ij] = x[subscript c]) = 0. Assumption (A5) ensures that the LATE at the cutoff is equivalent to the ATT at the cutoff (denoted as [tau subscript ATT](x[subscript c])) because all the treated cases are compliers, rather than a mixture of compliers and always-takers. This indicates one-sided noncompliance. In our ETA context, students ineligible for ETA are highly unlikely to use ETA, and it renders the existence of always-takers impossible in our setting. To construct the bounds on the ATT at the cutoff, we employ two control groups in the ETA setting. We use T[subscript ij] [element of]{C[subscript 0], C[subscript 1], C[subscript 2]} to indicate the combined ETA receipt and use statuses where ETA users are denoted as C[subscript 0], ETA nonusers (though offered) denoted as C[subscript 1], and ETA non-receivers denoted as C[subscript 2]. We assume that in our ETA context, the first control group (C[subscript 1]) yields positive unobserved bias, whereas the second control group (C[subscript 2]) yields negative unobserved bias; see Figure 1 for a graphical representation of multiple control groups in the ETA setting. Using this information, we derive lower and upper bounds on the ATT at the cutoff as: [equation omitted]. Moreover, we propose utilizing flexible ML-based estimators to construct bounds on [tau subscript ATT](x[subscript c]) to prevent bias from model misspecification. To achieve this, we employ &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; ML-based causal inference methods, notably Bayesian additive regression trees (Hill, 2011), the targeted maximum likelihood estimator (van der Laan &amp; Rubin, 2006) with ensemble learning, and causal forest (Wager &amp; Athey, 2018), to obtain the conditional average treatment effects on the treated. With our causal assumptions in place, we estimate the ATT of ETA on math scores at the cutoff using the two-stage least square estimator and its bounds using the ML-based bound estimators based on the 2017 NAEP assessment and process data. Conclusions: This paper proposed a novel approach that utilizes a fuzzy RD design with multiple control groups to evaluate the ATT at the cutoff along with its bounds. In particular, the use of multiple control groups, identified through process data, enables the construction of the bounds that provide a useful sensitivity check. The proposed approach offers theoretical and practical insights into evaluating the effects of testing accommodations in education research."},

Specifically the project provided training at 17 sites to over 900 individuals. Training protocols were developed on a variety of topics including a language enriched environment model. A model for inservice training was developed and implemented using a needs assessment technique called, \"build a model.\" Using a case study approach to analyze each program system, the project developed a working model to classify program needs according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs and to identify critical factors which influence the success or failure of  staff development efforts. Project participants evaluated the program as extremely effective and useful. Individual sections of the report address: goals and objectives; conceptual framework; training model activities and participants; project evaluation; need for continuing inservice training opportunities; and products.

This paper reviews the literature on optimal test assembly and introduces the contributions to this report on the topic. Four different approaches to computerized test assembly are discussed: heuristic-based test assembly; 0-1 linear programming; network-flow programming; and an optimal design approach. In addition, applications of these methods to a large variety of problems are examined, including: (1) item response theory-based test assembly; (2) classical test assembly; (3) assembling multiple test forms; (4) item matching; (5) observed-score equating; (6) constrained adaptive testing; (7) assembling tests with item sets; (8)  item pool design; and (9) assembling tests with multiple traits.

Two classes of elementary female students were assigned as an experimental or a control group. The study used a quasi-experimental method for the evaluation and comparison of cooperation development and administered the Measurement of Competitive-Cooperative Attitudes (Martin &amp; Larsen, 1976) to gather data. A T-test was done to examine the hypothesis. A pre-test was performed to measure cooperation skills development and see whether they are comparable. Then, the experimental group played the selected group games, while the control group continued the previous curriculum. A middle test was conducted after 6 weeks. There were no meaningful differences between the groups. As it was predicted that time would be a factor that affected the results, the program continued for another 6 weeks. Finally, a post-test was conducted, revealing that group games can increase cooperation skills (p&lt; 0/05).",

The purpose of this study is to help provide counselors with better knowledge so that they can offer future students courses corresponding to their profile. The second objective is to allow the teaching staff to propose training courses adapted to students by anticipating their possible difficulties. This is possible thanks to a machine learning algorithm called Random Forest, allowing for the classification of the students depending on their results. We had to process data, generate models using our algorithm, and cross the results obtained to have a better final prediction. We tested our method on different use cases, from two classes to five classes. These sets of classes represent the different intervals with an average ranging from 0 to 20. Thus, an accuracy of 75% was achieved with a set of five classes and up to 85% for sets of two and three classes.",

Roughly 35% of the teachers had majored in early childhood education, and 63% held at least a Child Development Associate (CDA) credential. In addition, approximately 66% of the sample had taken enough coursework in early childhood education to obtain a permit to work with young children. The results of this study show that beliefs are predictive of intentions. The results also indicate that depth of training influences intentions. It appears that those with the least and most training feel that they are interacting with children most appropriately. Job title was related to perceived ability to practice beliefs. Teacher aides felt more able to practice their beliefs than did teachers.",

        "description":"The training of teachers of West Africa is carried out by the Academy of Rouen (France) and organized around an annual training plan approved by the AEFE. Each trainer only supervises twenty teachers for 5 days. Teachers from eight countries (Mauritania, Cape Verde, Senegal, Gambia, Mali, Guinea, Côte d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso), come to Dakar for a week. We have been asked four times tn Dakar (Senegal) to provide training for teachers of West Africa. It is all about being trained in order to resolve reading difficulties for students using our scientific research. This paper presents the theoretical framework of phonological awareness and letter names and the 0 phase and the beginning of Phase 1 of our research. We use these predictors as remedial reading difficulties among students aged 8 to 11 years. We present the first results.",

        "description":"This study compared cardio-respiratory and perceived exertion responses for four cranking rates (50, 60, 70 and 80 rpm) during a continuous maximal arm ergometry protocol in order to determine the most efficient cranking rate for maximal testing. Fifteen male volunteers from 18-30 years of age performed a continuous arm ergometry stress test in the sitting position using a Modified Schwinn Ergometric Model EX2-0 ergometer modified for arm work. After completion of the tests, subjects were asked to compare overall rates as to which were easiest and most difficult. Analysis of the resulting data indicated that the majority of subjects ranked slower cranking rate within a given comparison as the most difficult rate; the fastest cranking rate was rated as being the easiest overall.  Since higher metabolic data was obtained at 80 rpm, it was concluded that in testing, the higher cranking rates should be used. Details of the instruments used in the study are discussed and test results are displayed on tables. (JD)",

        "description":"A heuristic for solving large-scale zero-one programming problems is provided. The heuristic is based on the modifications made by H. Crowder et al. (1983) to the standard branch-and-bound strategy. First, the initialization is modified. The modification is only useful if the objective function values for the continuous and the zero-one programming problems are close to each other. Given the initialization, the branch-and-bound method is stopped when a feasible solution to the problem is found. The heuristic also uses the reduced costs to fix non-basic variables to 1 or 0. An example taken from achievement test construction illustrates the efficiency of the proposed heuristic. Several test construction problems were implemented and solved by the proposed heuristic for item banks  with 400 items. Modifications were introduced in the LANDO computer program. A table illustrates that the central processing unit times for solving the zero-one programming problem were close to the times needed to solve the continuous problem. (SLD)",

In part 1, the authors estimate the impact of collective bargaining through regression analysis of factors other than unions that affect teachers' salaries. Findings indicate that the impact of collective bargaining on salaries is in the 0-5 percent range, and that collective bargaining reduces the number of steps in the BA and MA tracks. Part 2 derives an interstate index of pension benefits based on data for 39 states. Regression analysis is used to explain interstate  variations in pension benefits and employee contributions. Findings indicate that teachers' organizations have successfully increased pensions for teachers with 25 years service, but have had little impact on pensions for teachers with longer service.

The 3 measurement waves of NELS:88 (base year, first follow-up, and second follow-up) represented 3 dimensions.The inquiry aimed to improve modeling performance growth based on examinees' responses to the test items in each wave, with item location parameters set to be invariant across the 3 waves (instead of using item changes) and the latent mean of the first wave set to 0. The yielded scores of 3 waves were thus placed on approximately the same scale; the changes of the scores across waves could be measured. Moreover, the growth models for longitudinal data were improved by using auxiliary information such as gender, race, school location, and parents' education. In the study, the results of the growth pattern were compared with those yielded by the Embretson models.",

However, although Piaget (1948) suggests angles lead to the discovery of lines, angles are typically taught later in schools, after points, lines, and planes (Charles, 2011). Therefore, the way in which angles are taught can affect how students conceptualize angles. This study investigates such phenomena by using APOS theory and a preliminary genetic decomposition. Data was collected from a fifth grade student, a seventh grade student, and a twelfth grade student. Results show: the fifth grader developed a 2- and 1-line schema for angles; the seventh grader developed a 2-line schema; and the twelfth grader developed a 2-, 1-, and 0-line schema. Overall, the students contradicted the genetic decomposition model due to the fluidity of their thinking. This study provides teaching implications as well as areas for future research.",

After completion of this program the student should be able to: (1) convert to a percentage from a fraction of the form a/b, where 0 is less than (a,b) and these are less than 1,000, (2) convert from a percent to a fraction, (3) convert from a decimal to a percentage, (4) convert from a percent to a decimal, and (5) solve percentage problems of the form A=% x Base for A, %, or Base given the other  two factors. The material is to be used by individual students under teacher supervision. Twenty-six other programed texts and an introductory volume are available as VT 006 882-VT 006 909, and VT 006 975. (EM)",

        "description":"Presented is a theory of learning handicaps based on psychoeducational and developmental considerations. Identified are five of the author's biases about remediation such as the tendency for teachers to continue remediation beyond the point of usefulness. Proposed is the existence of five task requirements such as attending to the task, attaching labels to the task, and expressing the task activity. Discussed in terms of normal age ranges and remediation are the following developmental functions: sensory orientation (0-3 years), memory (3-7 years), re-cognition with a vocabulary emphasis (8 to 11 years), synthesis (11-13 years), and communication (14 years and up). The author suggests that remediation is most effective when the function disability is diagnosed within the critical  age range. Also defined is a term, dyssymbolia, to be used to describe a handicap in dealing with symbols. The condition is defined in terms of four criteria: deviance, the possibility of normal achievement, the presence of the handicap into maturity, and an etiology found within developmental dysfunctions.

Followup evaluation (which took place when Ss' school placement ranged from beginning kindergarten to grade 5) included the following: achievement test percentiles, grade placement or special education status, and teacher ratings on the School Behavior Check List. Based on the above data, Ss were classified as having school problems if they met one or more of four criteria  (which included achievement test percentiles of ten or less). Results indicated that the majority of Ss categorized as non-normal had later school problems and that prediction became more accurate with increasing age of screening in abnormals. (SB)",

Skinnerian insistence on student-constructed overt responses and on presenting the &quot;key answer&quot; after each frame were contrasted with covert responses and key answer frequencies less than 100 percent. The effects of combinations of overt or covert response requirements and 100, 50 or 0 percent key answers were also studied. It was concluded that in programs of less than 100 frames, response requirement and key answer frequency have very little influence on learning; that in programs over 200 frames, overt response without key answers or covert response leads to better learning. Overt response is most effective when the program demands learning unfamiliar response terms. Covert response leads to considerably shorter working time and greater learning efficiency. The Skinnerian model is held not superior to other alternatives studied. (SK)",

During the school year, community coordinators visit the homes of program children and give the parents learning activity packets designed to provide children with needed developmental activities. Every six weeks a reading party is held for program children and their parents in order to provide group learning experiences for the children and allow parents to discuss instructional ideas and techniques with the project staff. In addition, parents  serve on curriculum committees that meet every three months. The locally developed curriculum is based on 38 instructional objectives and is divided into 48 activity packets and a summer activity packet.

Two important properties of additive difference metrics are decomposability and intradimensional subtractivity. A prediction was derived from these properties and tested experimentally. Eleven non-psychology students were used as subjects. Rectangles varying in area and shape served as stimuli. Two types of dissimilarity judgments were obtained: rating scale judgment and pair comparison. In the rating scale experiment two stimuli at a time were shown and the students were asked to judge the overall difference on a scale running from 0 for \"no difference\" to 8 for \"very great difference.\" In the pair comparisons, slides showed two pairs and the subjects had to judge which of the two pairs  showed the larger overall difference. The decomposability and intradimensional subtractivity assumptions of the model were violated by most students due to an apparent interaction between area and shape. The experiment failed to confirm the model and it is suggested that the model be rejected or modified. (Author/LR)",

The task slides were pictures of geometric figures that were rotated at different angles from the sample orientation of 0 degrees.

High-quality interactions with adults result in positive developmental outcomes for infants. Adults involved in day care should focus on providing an environment of stimulating experiences, which help infants to develop satisfactorily. Other critical factors in adult behavior are values and attitudes, particulary interpretations of good and bad behavior, methods of discipline, use of materials, and the degree to which daily housekeeping chores interfere with constructive adult-infant interaction. Tips for teaching infants are provided along with an outline of appropriate developmental tasks for infancy. Important aspects of physical layouts for centers concern safety  precautions and the division of the facility into interest areas. Daily schedules are discussed; strong organization and planning are stressed. Continuity of care is vital and may be facilitated by having few caregivers for each child, encouraging caregiver-parent communication, and maintaining a low level of staff turnover. (DP)",

Seventy-four college presidents (87% of those contacted) responded to the questionnaire.

Some conclusions were: (1) of the 50 colleges reporting data for 1966-1971, only four had a smaller evening enrollment in 1971; (2) the enrollment at small colleges generally increased at a faster rate than large colleges; (3) the reasons for enrollment increase most often given were growth due to normal expansion and increased off-campus offerings; (4) about  one-third of the colleges charge a &quot;defined adult&quot; fee, the majority charging $3.00 per unit; and (5) new types of recruitment procedures have been initiated by 25 colleges, the most effective was publishing special class offering schedules in the local press.

Students were placed in 5 equally weighted groups: (1) reinforcement by community supervisors only; (2) half of the reinforcement from community supervisors and half from college faculty; (3) all reinforcement from college faculty; (4) only peer group reinforcement; and (5) no reinforcement (control group). The most striking result was that the control group with no reinforcement completed 0% of their assignments on time for the first semester. The faculty group represented the lower parameter of 30%, and the peer group achieved the highest score, 70%. Overall, students  performed as well with peer group reinforcement as with faculty reinforcement. To be substantiated this finding would require isolation of personality, convenience, and other unknown factors. Further research is recommended because of the cost-effective and learning enrichment potential represented by wider roles for students. (Author/HS)",

Parent-child classes are held weekly in which the teacher models specific therapy activities or interaction games, trains the parent, and encourages the parent to elaborate activities to fit his particular interaction style. The day care center program combines elements of &quot;good mothering&quot;, traditional preschool  activities, and a structured prescriptive approach. Results from evaluations for 1973-74 and 1974-75 show that there were positive qualitative changes in children's behaviors; that children, on the whole, made excellent progress at the preschool level; and that parents' responses were overwhelmingly positive to the program.

Out of one hundred books, only thirty-six books show differing abilities with all of them depicting visual impairment (e.g., glasses) and four depicting a mobility impairment (e.g., wheelchair) in addition to the visual impairment. Understanding that children's literature influences children's attitudes, it is vital to find opportunities to engage children in books depicting children with disabilities as children begin to develop their understanding and attitudes at a young age.

Data analysis indicated that low income explained a much larger percentage of the variance in academic achievement than did ethnicity. Ethnicity explained between 0-6 percent of the variance in academic achievement, after controlling for the contribution of low income. Low income, by contrast, explained between 12-29 percent of the variance in academic achievement. Combined with the finding that ethnicity explains approximately  32.7 percent of the variance in low income, the results suggest that the relationship between ethnicity and academic achievement is mostly indirect.

Data were collected from 104 principals and 254 assistant principals in elementary schools located in the borders of metropolitan Ankara. Information compiled included gender, level of education, job title, seniority, and level of adoption (using a scale of 0 to 4) of personal values such as money, power, family, aesthetics, creativity, and social dimensions. Statistical analysis of the data shows that elementary school administrators adopt personal values in descending order of importance starting with family, social relations, creativity, power, aesthetic, and money. Two conclusions are that personal values of elementary school administrators are consistent with the dominant values of Turkish  society, and that educational organizations do not show the level of success in creating and developing new values as they do in promulgating traditional values. It is proposed that school administrators' personal values be analyzed and redefined and that the number of female administrators be increased because their values are more harmonious with the position than men's.

Some reasons that could be classified into these 3 categories were identified in 130 interviews with students from the Teaching College of the University of the West Indies. Approximately one third of the students at Jamaican colleges of education (n=1,444) were asked to rate their agreement with each of the 19 reasons on a scale from 0 to 9. Results indicate that extrinsic, intrinsic, and altruistic consideration were three distinct motivations teacher trainees had for choosing the profession.

        "description":"By noting that a Rasch or two parameter logistic (2PL) item belongs to the exponential family of random variables and that the probability density function (pdf) of the correct response (X=1) and the incorrect response (X=0) are symmetric with respect to the vertical line at the item location, it is shown that the conjugate prior for ability is proportional to [I(theta)]superscript alpha where I(theta) is the item information and alpha is a positive constant. When the above prior is applied to a three parameter logistic (3PL) item, the requirement that item selection rules are bound to the traditional formula for correction for random guessing implies that the constant alpha must be 1. Thus, maximum information selection rules for 3PL items are the only rules that are consistent  with a Bayesian analysis based on the family of conjugate priors and with the use of the correction-for-guessing formula.

It uses a sample of 635 children age 0-12 years drawn from the Albuquerque Men Study 1990-93, which involved interviews that examined marital, reproductive, and employment histories and expenditures on children. This article also examines selection efforts by restricting the sample to men with children in more than one category (e.g., men with both genetic children and stepchildren in current unions), explaining that selection effects are important. Results indicate that men with both genetic offspring and step-offspring in current relationships invest  similarly in children, but the differences between offspring from current and previous unions are greater when comparing men with children in both categories. The results are consistent with the biosocial model advanced in the paper. (Contains 73 references.) (SM)",

Fifty-one education systems administered the collaborative problem solving assessment, including 32 of 35 OECD-member education systems. Students were assessed on their ability to solve a problem by sharing the understanding and effort required to come to a solution, and pooling their knowledge, skills and effort to reach that solution (OECD 2017). Assessment results are reported on a scale of 0-1,000, and also in terms of the percentage of students performing at four proficiency levels.

Though many sources noted that inquiry-based learning activities are the natural domain of young children, very few studies or articles refer specifically to engineering or design-based processes and terms. In addition to the literature review, CSAI also conducted a scan of states' early learning standards to determine which states were incorporating more detailed recommendations in science for their early learners.

The approach adopted provides a numeric score between 0 and 1 for each learning outcome with respect to each assessment tool and a combined score be calculated for each learning outcome from the tools associated with that outcome. The proposed methodology also provides insights into the consistency of the various assessment tools used to measure the achievement of a particular course learning outcome.

The plan's limitations include its risk-focused approach, its unsystematic response to 0-2 year-olds in difficult care-giving circumstances, and its lack of reference to adolescent girls with emotional issues who can contribute to the next generation of antisocial young people. As well, the plan might have considered the role of social systems in regard to conduct problems like the school, the neighbourhood, and community values.

This effect was independent of the food-stimulus correlation. These results differ from results previously obtained in a frequently changing environment. We attribute this difference in results to differences in the information value of response-contingent stimuli in frequently changing versus relatively constant environments, as well as to differences between forward pairing and simultaneous pairing of the stimuli with food.

        "description":"The notion of &quot;professional&quot; is built on a concept of traditionally male professions and patriarchal social orders. ECEC (early childhood education and care), however, is a female-dominated field characterised by its unique caring practice. This study investigated how a group of Australian early childhood preservice teachers presented themselves professionally on social media, in relation to respective infant (0-2) and kindergarten (3-5) practica. Data were drawn from focus group discussions about how the participants shared their practicum experiences on Instagram. The paper is guided by Foucault's concepts of self writing. Findings are organised around four themes of self-writing processes: collecting, selecting, annotating, and managing time and tasks. Two narratives are revealed. In the context of the kindergarten placement, the posts constituted a journey of continuous improvement against all odds. In contrast, the infant placement experiences evoked a sense of struggle and renunciation. The paper concludes with implications for further study beyond the Australian context.",

Individual interaction with digital devices in infancy and early childhood posits both benefits and risks in gaining informal learning experiences. The lack of relevant studies on the issue brings forward the aim of the research, which is to explore digital devices use for learning in infancy and early childhood as parents report it. 93 parents of 113 children aged 0-8 years old participated in an online survey to find out peculiarities of the children using digital devices for learning, frequency of using them, and parents' mediation in this process. For each aspect, Cramér's V and Somers' D were employed to make statistical differences between three age groups: 0-3, 4-5, 6-8 years old. The findings showed that the number of children using digital devices for learning increased with their age. Devices with the touch screen were especially popular for viewing videos, self-development, and gaming. The parents restricted content and learning time of their children using digital devices, which still required careful regulation and control. It is recommended that parents select learning applications and games appropriate for their children's age since digital devices impact on the children's health and development.",

In phase-1 of quantitative investigation, 2-level growth curve models were fitted using online repeated measures survey data collected from 68 pre-service teachers doing their student teaching. The results revealed significant progress in readiness for technology integration during student teaching and significant variability in individual change trajectories of readiness for technology integration. Two dummy variables, &quot;prior-teaching&quot; (0 = &quot;having no prior teaching experience&quot;; 1 = &quot;having prior teaching experience&quot;) and &quot;grade-level&quot; (0 = &quot;elementary level&quot;; 1 = &quot;secondary level&quot;), were identified as significant in predicting the shape of individual change trajectories of readiness for technology integration. In phase-2 of qualitative investigation, follow-up interview data were collected from 11 pre-service teachers among those who participated in the online surveys. The interview data was analyzed both deductively and inductively yielding clues and insights for interpreting and understanding the quantitative results from phase-1. Based on its quantitative and qualitative results, this study made recommendations for future technology integration research and for improving pre-service teachers' technology use experience during student teaching.",

Methods: All participants (N = 20) were trained using a lower-body resistance-training program for 30 min twice per week from Week 0 to Week 6. At the end of the program, they were randomly assigned to a control group that performed no further training or a WBV group that performed a progressive static WBV program. Data for the 5-repetition-maximum (5RM) squat and extensors and flexors of the knee and ankle were collected at Weeks 0, 6, 8, 10, and 12 for all participants. Results: Two-way (condition vs. time) analysis of variance revealed that although the WBV group maintained strength in the 5RM from Week 6 through Week 8 and the control group had a lower 5RM in Week 8 from Week 6, no differences in the 5RM squat existed between the groups at Week 8. Two-way factorial multivariate analysis of variance revealed no differences between the groups at any of the time for torque of knee flexion, dorsiflexion, or plantar flexion. Conclusion: Static WBV of 2.56 &quot;g&quot; to 7.68 &quot;g&quot; did not attenuate detraining of the flexors and extensors of the knee and ankle.",

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine school-based interventions involving nurses in a role beyond anthropometric measurement for effect on change in body measures. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of these papers. Results: The literature search produced 2412 articles. Eleven met inclusion criteria for the systematic review (4 randomized controlled trail [RCT], 7 quasi-experimental) and 8 for the meta-analysis. None have been included in prior meta-analyses. Four studies restricted eligibility to overweight and/or obese children; 7 included all children regardless of body weight. Random effects meta-analytic models represent data from 6050 (body mass index [BMI]), 5863 (BMIz), and 416 (BMI percentile) children, respectively. Pooled analyses demonstrated statistically significant decreases in BMI (6 studies: -0.48 [95% CI -0.84, -0.12]; I[superscript 2] = 91.2%, Q=68.1), BMIz (5 studies: -0.10 [95% CI: -0.15, -0.05]; I[superscript 2] = 0, Q = 2.3), and BMI percentile (3 studies: -0.41 [95% CI: -0.60, -0.21]; I[superscript 2] = 0, Q = 2.0). Conclusions: These findings are similar to those of other meta-analyses of school-based interventions and suggest that school nurses can play a key role in implementing sustainable, effective school-based obesity interventions.",

In this procedure expert judges estimate the probable score of a minimally competent examinee. The technique does not refer to the students' performance data. The purposes of this paper are: (1) to introduce a modification to the Nedelsky procedure that includes both absolute and relative standard setting procedures through the use of subjective probabilities; and (2) to compare these two procedures. The modified Nedelsky method (i.e., the Bayes Subjective Probability method) uses the students' response patterns on each test item and estimates the minimal item value by taking both the students' performance and the experts' judgments into consideration. The Nedelsky  procedure has only discrete probabilities ranging from 0 to 1.0; however, the Bayes Subjective Probability procedure has a continuous distribution ranging from 0 to 1.0. Analysis of variance based reliabilities are both high (0.96 for Nedelsky and 0.94 for Bayes Subjective Probability method). For the Nedelsky method, a higher cutting score value emerges and a higher variability index is found. Data for this study were collected from 186 Indiana University students who took the Spanish version of the Foreign Language Placement Examination and from seven Spanish Department faculty members who judged the test items. Examples of comparative data for five test items are appended. (Author/JAZ)",

        "description":"This study was conducted to determine whether the traditional classroom approach to instruction involving the addition and subtraction of number facts (digits 0-6) is more or less effective than the traditional classroom approach plus a commercially-prepared computer game. A pretest-posttest control group design was used with two groups of first grade students--N=15 for the experimental group and N=14 for the control group--and their relative gains in achievement were compared. The computer game used by the experimental group in addition to regular classroom instruction was Alligator Mix, which is designed to help students increase their skills in both adding and subtracting numbers 0-9 by feeding alligators in the swamp. Since the game has the ability to establish increasingly  more difficult levels for mastery, students are required to memorize and recall the number facts without stopping to determine the answers. The study lasted 20 school days and a t-test was used to measure the significance of difference between the mean gains of the two groups. Six data tables display the findings of the study, and conclusions indicate there were no significant differences between the experimental and control group in mathematical gains involving the addition and subtraction of number facts; however, both groups did show significant gain.

Method: Using an online survey, practioners reported their EBP training experiences, resources available in their workplaces, and the frequency with which they engage in specific EBP activities, as well as their resource needs and future training format preferences. Results: A total of 2,762 SLPs in 28 states participated in the online survey, 85% of whom reported holding the Certificate of Clinical Competence in Speech-Language Pathology credential. Results revealed that one quarter of survey respondents had no formal training in EBP, 11% of SLPs worked in school districts with official EBP procedural guidelines, and 91% had no scheduled time to support EBP activities. The majority of SLPs posed and researched 0 to 2 EBP questions per year and read 0 to 4 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) journal articles per year on either assessment or intervention topics. Conclusion: Use of ASHA online resources and engagement in EBP activities were documented to be low. However, results also revealed that school-based SLPs have high interest in additional training and resources to support scientifically based practices. Suggestions for enhancing EBP support in public schools and augmenting knowledge transfer are provided. (Contains 5 tables, 3 figures, and 1 footnote.)",

Here, we focus on arguably the most complex basic form, denial, and how young children understand denial, when it is expressed in response to a question with gesture, single word, or sentence. One hundred twenty-six children in 3 age groups (Ms = 1 year 9 months, 2 years 0 months, and 2 years 4 months) witnessed an adult look into 1 of 2 buckets and then, in response to a question about whether the toy was in there, communicate either something positive (positive head nod, &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;it is in this bucket&quot;) or negative (negative head shake, &quot;No,&quot; &quot;It's not in this bucket&quot;). The youngest children did not search differently in response to any of the communicative cues (nor in response to an additional cue using both gesture and single word). Children at 2 years 0 months searched at above-chance levels only in response to the negative word and negative sentence. Children at 2 years 4 months were successful with all 3 types of cues in both positive and negative modalities, with the exception of the positive sentence. Young children thus seem to understand the denial of a statement before they understand its affirmation, and they understand linguistic means of expressing denial before they understand gestural means.",

        "description":"Web-based testing has become a ubiquitous self-assessment method for online learning. One useful feature that is missing from today's web-based testing systems is the reliable capability to fulfill different assessment requirements of students based on a large-scale question data set. A promising approach for supporting large-scale web-based testing is static test generation (STG), which generates a test paper automatically according to user specification based on multiple assessment criteria. And the generated test paper can then be attempted over the web by users for assessment purpose. Generating high-quality test papers under multiobjective constraints is a challenging task. It is a 0-1 integer linear programming (ILP) that is not only NP-hard but also need to be solved efficiently. Current popular optimization software and heuristic-based intelligent techniques are ineffective for STG, as they generally do not have guarantee for high-quality solutions of solving the large-scale 0-1 ILP of STG. To that end, we propose an efficient ILP approach for STG, called branch-and-cut for static test generation (BAC-STG). Our experimental study on various data sets and a user evaluation on generated test paper quality have shown that the BAC-STG approach is more effective and efficient than the current STG techniques.",

        "description":"We conducted two experiments to evaluate the effects of errors of omission and commission during alternative reinforcement of compliance in young children. In Experiment 1, we evaluated errors of omission by examining two levels of integrity during alternative reinforcement (20 and 60%) for child compliance following no treatment (baseline) versus treatment at full (i.e., 100%) integrity. Results indicated that compliance varied according to the level of integrity in place. In addition, compliance in the 60% integrity condition was high and stable when it followed baseline, but was substantially lower for one participant and slightly lower for a second participant when it followed the full integrity condition. In Experiment 2, we evaluated errors of commission. For three participants, we compared treatment at full integrity to a condition in which errors of commission were made on every trial (i.e., 0% integrity). For one of these three participants, we also compared treatment at full integrity to baseline and to a condition in which errors of commission were made on 50% of trials. Results of all four evaluations again indicate that compliance varied according to the level of integrity in place: compliance was low in both the 0 and 50% integrity conditions, regardless of the preceding condition. These results suggest that during alternative reinforcement of compliance, the effect of occasional errors of omission may depend on the immediately preceding context but that errors of commission are more detrimental.",

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the proportion of these parents who experience clinically significant psychopathology. Articles reporting proportions of psychological disorders in a sample of parents of children with autism spectrum disorder were located. The initial search returned 25,988 articles. Thirty-one studies with a total sample of 9208 parents were included in the final review. The median meta-analytic proportions were 31% (95% confidence interval = [24%, 38%]) for depressive disorders, 33% (95% confidence interval = [20%, 48%]) for anxiety disorders, 10% (95% confidence interval = [1%, 41%]) for obsessive-compulsive disorder, 4% (95% confidence interval = [0%, 22%]) for personality disorders, 2% (95% confidence interval = [1%, 4%]) for alcohol and substance use disorders and 1% (95% confidence interval = [0%, 5%]) for schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Significant heterogeneity was detected in these categories. Further research is needed to gain more insight into variables that may moderate parental psychopathology. This review and meta-analysis is the first to provide prevalence estimates of psychological disorders in parents of children with autism spectrum disorder.",

Method: Clinical characteristics of ASD patients who presented to the ED between 1 January 2015 and 15 November 2020 were obtained by retrospective file review. The caregivers of the patients who had presented to the ED in 2020 were interviewed by a phone call. Results: There were 740 applications of 224 patients (192 boys, 32 girls). Almost half of the patients were between 0 and 5 years old. Respiratory problems were the most common cause of admissions in all age groups. The second common reasons for ED visits were gastrointestinal problems in 0-5 years old, traumatic injuries/poisoning in 6-12 years old, and epilepsy/syncope in 13-17 years old. Psychiatric problems were less common (2.7%) than other reasons for admission. The most challenging issue for children was &quot;the crowded waiting area, and the long waiting period&quot; and followed by &quot;physical restraint imposed on the child,&quot; &quot;noise,&quot; and &quot;bright light.&quot; Conclusion: As the clinicians' awareness and use of more accurate diagnostic tools have increased, the ASD prevalence has gradually increased. To increase the quality of healthcare services for these patients, awareness studies and new interventions are needed.",

Data came from the 2020 Bangkok Behaviour Surveillance Survey (BBSS). Multivariate logistic regression analyses examined associations between ACEs and health conditions overall, and for adolescents with low versus high resilience on the Grotberg's Resilience Scale. Overall, 54.9% of adolescents reported 0 ACEs. Compared to adolescents with no ACEs, it was found that those with [greater than or equal to] 1 ACE were more likely to experience insomnia, sadness, suicide attempt, depression, and excess alcohol consumption. Those with a history of four or more ACEs had worse mental health, higher total undesirable behaviour, and lower academic achievement. When the sample was divided into high resilience (60.2%) and low resilience (39.8%), having at least 1 ACEs (vs. 0 ACEs) was associated with worse mental health and undesirable behaviour in adolescents with low resilience. History of ACEs can predict adverse health conditions and undesirable behaviour among adolescents, and the strongest correlation is among adolescents with low resilience. Future studies are needed to develop strategies and interventions to increase adolescent resilience, and test whether improvements in resilience reduce the adverse impact of ACEs on adolescent mental/behavioural health.",

In-depth phenomenological interviewing combined with document analysis were the methods utilized. This exploration used a purposive/snowball sample of low-SES mothers who were making satisfactory progress toward a degree. Participants were screened using the following inclusion criteria: enrolled at least half-time, degree-seeking, minimum 2.5 G.P.A., Pell eligible and first-generation, had one or more children ages 0-10 living in the home. There were seven total participants in the study. Five themes emerged from the participant data: support systems, lack of college preparation, family as a priority, education as self-fulfillment, and balance. The themes were consistent with the findings in the literature. Each of the participants had full and busy lives with multiple responsibilities necessitating, for the most part, a part-time schedule as a student. None of them had entered community college directly out of high school and if they had attempted higher education immediately following high school at another institution, they were unsuccessful.

It draws from a broader analysis the Migration Policy Institute's (MPI's) National Center on Immigrant Integration Policy (NCIIP) conducted on immigrant and U.S.-born parents with children under age 18. Given the needs of parents differ depending on their children's age, and many service systems align their efforts to particular age groups, the overarching analysis segments data on parent characteristics to reflect those with children between ages 0 to 4, 5 to 10, 11 to 13, and 14 to 17. The information presented in this fact sheet aims to inform efforts to better understand and more equitably address the integration needs of the country's immigrant families--and more specifically, the efforts of early childhood, health and social services, K-12, postsecondary, and adult education systems. In each of these systems, a two-generation lens is critical both to create more effective service designs and to realize the heightened returns of two-generation-focused investments that lift parents' trajectories and empower them to support their children's school readiness and long-term educational success.",

A hierarchical linear multiple regression model was applied to test the hypotheses. The statement of the omnibus null hypothesis (H[subscript 0]) was that the Emotional Stability dimension of the Big Five factor model of personality traits theory did not have the ability to predict EOC. Main hypotheses stated that there was not a statistically significant relationship between the moderated independent variable (IV) and the dependent variable (DV). Results of the full model showed that the theory-testing null hypothesis (H[subscript 0]) was not supported (p &lt; 0.05), and the Boomer generation contributed most to the DV (Beta = -0.511).

        "description":"Of great importance for achieving science education reform may be teachers' interest in science and enjoyment of science. This study explores the motivational qualities (rated for \"interest,\" \"fun,\" and \"learning\" value) of different levels of inquiry of hands-on class activities. The participants, 53 preservice teachers in two sections of a science methods course, rated the activities at the end of each class. At the end of the course, these activities were categorized by level of inquiry (levels 0-3), with 30% rated as level 0 (no inquiry), 40% as level 1, 22% as level 2, and 8% as level 3, according to how much choice was given for posing questions and designing investigations. Ratings of each hands-on activity indicated that participants perceived activities of higher levels of inquiry to be more fun and more interesting. They also perceived that they had learned more. These findings suggest that course instructors should determine level of inquiry when planning course activities, and degree of participant input into course activities may be important in the development of interest in science. A focus on hands-on learning especially at higher levels of inquiry may serve both to capture the interest of teachers and to model how they can make science more authentic and engaging for children.

Phonation pressure range (PPR) was also proposed for assessing the pressure range of normal vocal fold vibrations. Method: The authors first introduced the concept of bifurcation on the basis of a symmetric vocal fold model and then applied the bifurcation analysis to data from excised larynges. By recording acoustic signals from 10 excised larynges, the authors measured phonation threshold pressure (PTP), PIP, and PPR at the bifurcation pressure points from the spectrograms as subglottal pressure was progressively increased. Furthermore, to investigate the effects of vocal fold elongation on PTP, PIP, and PPR, the authors manipulated the elongation of the vocal folds at 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15% of the resting vocal fold length. Results: The authors found that PTP, PIP, and PPR were effectively determined using the bifurcation analysis. When vocal fold elongation was increased from 0% to 15%, PTP was significantly increased (p less than 0.001), PIP was not significantly changed (p = 0.54), and PPR was significantly decreased (p = 0.003). Conclusion: PIP and PPR represent important parameters to assess phonation instability. Bifurcation analysis represents a valuable procedure for revealing the mechanisms behind PTP, PIP, and PPR and for investigating the effects of vocal fold biomechanical parameters on these 3 pressure parameters.",

All children were assessed with DL for three times: Interictally (t[superscript 0]), postictally 5' (t[superscript 1]) and 1 h (t[superscript 2]). At t[superscript 0], all groups revealed a right ear advantage (REA), indicating a left-hemisphere speech dominance. There was a continuous increase in right correct score (REC) over the trials for normal controls. Five minutes postictally, there was an abrupt decrease in REC with a sustained left ear correct score (LEC) for children with epilepsy, independent of which side suffered from seizures. This effect was maintained even after 1 h. Thus, in children with left-hemisphere speech dominance the epileptic discharges caused a suppression of REC regardless of origin. The seizures may have a prolonged impact on attention and auditory perception for a considerable time after consciousness has been regained. (Contains 2 tables and 2 figures.)",

        "description":"The objective is to examine school-level program and policy characteristics and student-level behavioural characteristics associated with being overweight. Multilevel logistic regression analysis were used to examine the school- and student-level characteristics associated with the odds of a student being overweight among 1264 Grade 5-8 students attending 30 elementary schools in Ontario, Canada. Data were derived from the Physical Activity of Youth in Ontario Schools host study. Significant between-school random variation in overweight was identified [[sigma][subscript [mu]O][squared]=0:187 (0:084), P less than 0.001]; school-level differences accounted for 5.4% of the variability in the odds of a student being overweight versus a normal weight. A student attending a school that was in the action phase for the school-level construct &quot;Availability and use of interschool programs&quot; was significantly less likely to be overweight than a similar student attending a school that was in the initiation phase for this construct. Important student-level characteristics included physical activity (PA) and gender. Developing a better understanding of the school- and student-level characteristics associated with overweight among youth is critical for informing school-based prevention policies. Future research should evaluate if implementing and promoting interschool PA programming, and which types of interschool activities, are effective in preventing or reducing overweight.",

        "description":"Fear conditioning is a popular model for investigating physiological and cellular mechanisms of memory formation. In this paradigm, a footshock is either systematically associated to a tone (paired conditioning) or is pseudorandomly distributed (unpaired conditioning). In the former procedure, the tone/shock association is acquired, whereas in the latter procedure, the context/shock association will prevail. Animals with chronically implanted recording electrodes show enhanced amplitude of the extracellularly recorded field EPSP in CA1 pyramidal cells for up to 24 h after unpaired, but not paired, fear conditioning. This is paralleled by a differential activation of the ERK/CREB pathway in CA1, which is monophasic in paired conditioning (0-15 min post-conditioning), but biphasic (0-1 h and 9-12 h post-conditioning) in unpaired conditioning as revealed by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting. Intrahippocampal injection of the MEK inhibitor U0126 prior to each phase prevents the activation of both ERK1/2 and CREB after unpaired conditioning. Block of any activation phase leads to memory impairment. We finally reveal that the biphasic activation of ERK/CREB activity is independently regulated, yet both phases are critically required for the consolidation of long-term memories following unpaired fear conditioning. These data provide compelling evidence that CA1 serves different forms of memory by expressing differential cellular mechanisms that are dependent on the training regime. (Contains 5 figures.)",

        "description":"Although an increasing proportion of researchers have addressed the issue of social and emotional competencies (SEC) and stress, only a few have focused on urban elementary public schools. With the Transactional Theory of Stress and Coping as the theoretical framework, we gathered information from 199 elementary teachers (49.75% response rate) on the &quot;Determination Rating Scale of Teachers' SEC and Stress,&quot; consisting of 52 Likert-scale responses on SEC (0 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree), and 10 items on stress (0 = never to 4 = very often). We used descriptive statistics, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients, and open-ended coding. Quantitative findings yielded responsible decision-making as the highest competency for novice and veteran teachers and social awareness as the lowest. These two constructs were moderately correlated (r = -0.46), indicating that teachers with stronger SEC are less stressed. Implications from this urban study offered include flexible, professional development to increase teachers' SEC. Future research recommendations involve including secondary teachers in urban schools to afford a broader perspective of SEC and stress at diverse educational levels.

Using the sample from 13 elementary schools across three U.S. states with 195 K-5 students, we replicated the initial data analytic plan used to determine initial cutting scores. Results from logistic regression and receiver operator characteristic curves suggested the following preliminary SRSS-I4 risk categories: 0-1 low, 2 moderate, and 3-12 high risk for internalizing behavior patterns relative to the TRF internalizing subscale score. Results yielded adequate levels of sensitivity and specificity for the first cut, and questionable sensitivity for the upper cut. We planned to conduct subsequent analysis to address the nested nature of the data. Yet, most teachers completed the TRF for one student making this not possible. We discuss limitations and directions for future research, calling for replication with larger samples to facilitate nesting given schoolwide screening practices involve teachers screening multiple students. We also encourage consideration of two risk categories: 0-1 for low and 2+ for a risk category, not distinguishing between moderate- and high-risk categories.",

        "author":["Jacinda Smith"],
        "description":"This study examined Indiana public school educators' perceptions of self-efficacy in three instructional practices: setting clear and high expectations, fostering collaborative inquiry, and providing feedback. Using a quantitative approach, it explored whether these perceptions varied by teaching experience (0-5, 6-15, 16+ years), school location (urban, rural, suburban), grade level (PK-2, Intermediate 3-5, Middle School 6-8, High School 9-12), and socioeconomic status of the student population (0-25%, 26-50%, 51-75%, 76%+). Findings revealed significant differences, with veteran teachers and those in rural schools reporting higher efficacy levels than peers in urban settings or with fewer years of experience. These results suggest the need for targeted professional development to enhance teacher efficacy in fostering clear expectations, collaborative inquiry, and delivering feedback, as well as mentorship programs and strategic support for novice educators. Future research should explore the longitudinal effects of leadership capacity and professional development on teacher efficacy and investigate barriers faced by educators in under-resourced schools. This study contributes to understanding teacher self-efficacy and its critical role in effective instructional practices across diverse contexts.

Thirty volunteering players from Antalya Muratpasa High School Boys' Basketball and Football Teams participated in the study. Fifteen of the participants were from the Basketball Team and 15 were from Football Team. The mean age of the Football Team was 16,3 ± 0,9 years; mean body weight was 65,6 ± 9,4 kg, mean height was 170,3 ± 6,7 cm; and the mean age of the Basketball Team was 15,5 ± 0,74 years, mean body weight was 64,8 ± 11,7 kg, mean height was 178,6 ± 6,1 cm. As well as the height, weight, age values of the 15 Basketballer and 15 Footballer Boys', the right and left grip force, back force, sprint tests, leg force, free vertical jump, subcutaneous fat measurements from 8 different points, and circumference measurements from 7 different points were taken. As a result of the comparison between some biomotoric properties, a significant difference was found between the vertical jump test values of the Basketball Team and Football Team (p&lt;0, 05). When the Basketball and Football teams participating in the study were compared, it was determined that there was a statistically significant difference between the calf area sub-cutaneous fat measurement values (p&lt;0, 05). No statistically significant differences were found in the measurements of shoulder, chest inspiration, chest expiration, arm, forearm, thigh circumference, calf circumference, hip circumferences of the Boys' Basketball and Football players who participated in our study (p&lt;0,05). A statistically significant difference was found in the 10-m speed run tests of the Boys' Basketball Team and Football Team Players (p&lt;0,05). The data of the study were analyzed in Independent Samples T Test (p&lt;0,05) according to statistical significance levels. Nobody should doubt that positive science is affecting all sports disciplines in the light of technological developments in our present age and it will continue even more in the future with more efficient and faster use to serve sports and sportsmen. In this context, it was aimed in the present study to determine how young sportsmen are suitable for their branches, and also to determine the missing and full aspects of their present biomotoric and physical statuses, supplement the missing aspects, and improve the full ones.",

        "description":"In recent decades, there has been an increasing emphasis placed on college graduation rates and reducing attrition due to the social and economic benefits, at both the individual and national levels, proposed to accrue from a more highly educated population (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2011). In the United States in particular, there is a concern that declining college graduation rates relative to the rest of the world's population will reduce economic competitiveness (Callan, 2008). As such, in addition to research on how to increase educational performance in elementary and secondary schools, educational researchers are also interested in the determinants of performance and persistence at the collegiate level. One method hypothesized to promote increased college graduation rates is to raise the standards in the nation's high schools in order to better prepare students for college. Indeed, data from many converging sources suggests high school graduates are not prepared for higher-level college curriculum (Achieve, 2005). As such, many state institutions have attempted to set standards for rigor in order to ensure students are prepared for college study. Against this backdrop, the College Board has recently developed a measure of academic rigor, termed the Academic Rigor Index (ARI), for the purpose of examining how well a student is prepared for college study both within and across broad content domains (Wiley, Wyatt, &amp; Camara, 2010). The ARI awards 0 to 5 points in each of five areas (English, mathematics, science, social science/history, and foreign/classical languages) based on students' self-reported course-taking and sums these to create an overall index on a 0-25-point scale. The 25 credited activities are drawn from a larger set of course-taking variables. Each individual credited activity's inclusion in the index is empirically supported by links to subsequent collegiate performance. The decisions to award an equal number of possible points in each of the five areas, and to weight each area equally in computing the total score, were not empirically based, and thus the degree to which relaxing the equal point per area and equal weight per area constraints could improve the predictive power of the ARI is not known. The purpose of the present paper is to compare the ARI with alternative scoring procedures that remove these constraints. An appendix contains supplemental tables.",

        "description":"Background: The Scandinavian countries have a long history of implementing social interventions, but the interventions have not been examined using randomised controlled trials until relatively recently compared with countries like the United States and the United Kingdom. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the history of randomised controlled trials in Scandinavian compulsory schools (grades 0-10; pupil ages 6-15). Specifically, we investigate drivers and barriers for randomised controlled trials in educational research and the differences between the three Scandinavian countries Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Methods: To locate relevant trials, we performed a systematic search of four bibliographic databases and a search for grey literature. Results were combined with trials located through direct contact with researchers and government officials. A trial was included if one or more interventions were randomly assigned to groups of students and carried out in a school setting with the primary aim of improving the academic performance of children aged 6-15 in grades 0-10 in Denmark, Norway, or Sweden. We included both conducted and ongoing trials. Publications that seemed relevant were screened based on full-text versions. Data extraction included information from the included studies on grade level, study period, sample size (N), project owner, funding source, and theme. In addition, we conducted two semi-structured interviews by phone or in person with central employees in funding agencies and ministries and 25 correspondences with researchers and policymakers. Findings and conclusion: RCTs in grades 0-10 were few in all of Scandinavia until about 2011, after which there was an increase in all three countries, although at different rates. The largest number of trials has been conducted in Denmark, and the increase is more marked in Denmark and Norway compared with Sweden. International trends towards more impact evaluations and results from international comparisons such as PISA have likely affected the development in all countries, but while many trials in Denmark and Norway are the result of policy initiatives, only one such example in Sweden was identified. We believe the lack of government initiatives to promote RCTs in Sweden is the most likely explanation for the differences across the Scandinavian countries. Funding and coordination from the government are often crucial for the implementation of RCTs and are likely more important in smaller countries such as the Scandinavian ones. Supporting institutions have now been established in all three countries, and we believe that the use of RCTs in Scandinavian educational research is likely to continue.",

        "author":["Rocky Christensen"],
        "description":"This study applies demand theory to investigate how college discounting practices impact student enrollment across income categories for members and affiliates of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities. The dependent variable for this study, student enrollment by income category, comes from the Student Financial Aid and Net Price Survey in IPEDS. The independent variables fall into several key categories that form the foundation for demand theory including institutional cost, taste and preferences, competitors prices, institution level covariates, and year effects covariates. The study presents three models that all used log-log fixed effects regression to understand how control variables, and competitors' prices provide greater explanatory power. The results indicate that the third model, which had both control variables and competitors' prices, provided the highest R[superscript 2] value and the most statistically significant results. The results from the regression demonstrated that students form different income categories had varying elasticities in response to price paid and the decision to enroll. Students who are inelastic have a result number that is less than 0 and are more likely to enroll as price increases. Students who are elastic have a result number that is greater than 0 and are less likely to enroll at the colleges in this sample. The results from this study show that students from families with incomes less than $110,000 were inelastic, whereas the highest income category of students with incomes greater than $110,000 were elastic. This showed that families with less than $110,00 of total family income would continue to enroll at increase rates as price increased opposed to higher income peers who would choose to enroll at another college if the average net price increased for the. These elasticity values show a difference from 0 either positive or negative that never exceeded 0.37. These values are moderate, and indicate a less pronounced sensitivity to price fluctuations. The findings from this study provide insight that can equip researchers with future research on topics like Strategic enrollment management, tuition discounting, demand theory, College enrollment by income categories, CCCU student enrollment behavior. Before the initiation of this research project, no studies had been conducted on IPEDS data categorized by income, using net price as a metric to gauge price responsiveness at CCCUs.

        "description":"Guiding principles for using sliding fee scales are presented in this paper in an effort to help states plan new child care initiatives, coordinate or strengthen existing programs, and improve sliding fee scales for current programs. Introductory comments urge states to adopt a single sliding fee scale for all their child care programs. The report then discusses the benefits of good sliding fee scales for children, parents, providers, and states. The Children's Defense Fund (CDF) model for sliding scales is discussed next. This model calls for: (1) fully subsidized care, with no copayment, for families with incomes less than 34% of the state median income (SMI) whenever possible; (2) the gradual increase of copayments from 0% to 8.2% of income for families with incomes between  34% and 75% of SMI with only 1 child in care; (3) the increase of copayments by 25% for families with 2 or more children in care, with copayments gradually rising from 0 to 10.3% of income for families with incomes between 34% and 75% of SMI; (4) gradual increases in the copayment as income rises; and (5) the creation of a sliding scale for families with school-age children in part-time care. Guidelines for determining family size and income, certifying eligibility and copayments, and family income reporting are presented. The final section discusses questions related to fee exemptions for poor families, the income level at which parents should absorb full child care costs, and guidelines for children in protective services. The bulk of the report consists of charts showing family  copayments under the CDF model, depending on income, family size, and state of residence. (AC)",

Methods: administrator survey (N = 756 schools; 24/24 districts) included 6 classrooms LWP best-practice items (fully/not fully implemented: restricting food celebrations or rewards, incorporating PA breaks or integrating PA in curricula, restricting withholding or using PA as punishment). A sum score (alpha = .71; elementary and middle/high examined separately) was used to examine associations with student body income (free-and-reduced priced meals (FARMS): [less than or equal to] 40%, 41-75%, [greater than or equal to] 75%), race/ethnicity, and school location (rural/urban/suburban), accounting for district-level clustering, with moderation examined. Results: Classroom implementation scores were: elementary = 3.1 ± 1.8 (range: 0-6/6 items) and middle/high = 2.3 ± 1.6 (range:0-5/5 items). Among elementary and middle/high schools, 65% and 55% had &gt;40% FARMS, 39% and 46% had [greater than or equal to] 50% white student body, and 24% and 23% were urban, respectively.

        "description":"Meta-analyzing count data can be challenging when follow-up time varies across studies. Simply pooling aggregate data over time-periods would result in biased estimates, which may erroneously inform clinical decision-making. In this study, we exploit the convolution property of the Poisson distribution to develop a likelihood for observed cumulative counts over varying follow-up periods, where different Poisson distributions are used to represent the data generating processes for the latent counts in pre-defined successive intervals of follow-up. We illustrate this approach using an example of poststroke seizures, a case in which risk may change over time, and mimic its survival duration with time-varying hazard. Data were extracted from observational studies (1997-2016) reporting poststroke seizures over a maximum of 10 years of follow-up. Three clinically meaningful follow-up time intervals were considered: 0 to 7 days, 8 to 365 days, and 1 to 10 years poststroke. External validation was performed using claims data. Results suggest the incidence rate of seizures was 0.0452 (95% confidence interval: 0.0429, 0.0475), 0.0001 (0, 0.016), and 0.0647 (0.0441, 0.0941) for the three time intervals, respectively, indicating that the risk of seizures changes over time poststroke. We found that the model performed well against the incidence rate of seizures among actual retrospective cohort from claims data. The piecewise Poisson model presents a flexible way to meta-analyze count data over time and mimic survival curves. The results of the piecewise Poisson model are readily interpretable and may spur meaningful clinical action. The method may also be applied to other diseases.",

        "description":"The application of the Study and Research Path (SRP) methodology for learning general chemistry, a fundamental course often found in the first-year curriculum of many technical degrees, is investigated. In recent years, SRPs have emerged as interesting inquiry and project-based teaching formats. In an SRP, the search for an answer to a generating question (Q[subscript 0]) triggers an arborescent scheme of derived questions and answers, that are summarized in a Q-A map. In our study case, we designed, implemented, and analyzed an SRP for a first-year course in Engineering. The SRP revolved around the Q[subscript 0] question, &quot;what is the quality of tap water in your city?&quot;, which led students to become familiar with standards and learn different chemical analysis techniques to determine water quality parameters (hardness, pH, dry residue, sulfates, chlorides). Results of the first edition evidence that SRP enriched the learning of chemistry and expanded the media and milieu with respect to the traditional course. The specific design of the SRP helped overcome the didactic problems of the previous organization, by integrating the theoretical and experimental contents, improving the students' lab skills and providing a &quot;sense&quot; for the course, thus increasing the students' motivation. Both students and teachers adapted easily to the new instruction format. The results of this work open new opportunities for the application of SRPs in other chemistry courses in the future.",

Occupational therapy practitioners are critical members of early intervention, education, and healthcare teams. Practitioners are distinctly qualified to address cognitive functioning within the context of occupational performance by providing evidence-based interventions to children and their families as well as training caregivers and teams to enhance cognitive and executive functioning (EF) performance. The purpose of this review was to update the previous systematic review on this topic. The focused question guiding the selection of research studies was: &quot;What is the evidence for the effectiveness for interventions within the scope of occupational therapy practice to promote cognitive development and prevent further delay for children 0-5 and their families?&quot; Due to the breadth of the review, the results were divided into two articles. This article (Part 1) focuses on cognitive interventions for children birth to 5 years with known conditions while Part 2, also in this issue, will address findings on interventions for children at risk due to environmental factors and promoting cognitive development for children birth to 5 years.

This study investigated the names of scientists and other people mentioned in four commonly used textbooks in the three education systems in the UK and Republic of Ireland (England, Wales, and Northern Ireland using the A Level system; Scotland using the Curriculum for Excellence Highers system; Republic of Ireland using the Leaving Certificate system) and characterised them by gender. We found an overwhelming bias towards naming of famous men in three of the four textbooks (1 man and 0 women in the A Level textbook; 8 men and 0 women in the first, and 48 men and 2 women in the second Curriculum for Excellence textbooks, and 45 men and 1 woman in the Leaving Certificate). We subsequently analysed images and again found a dominance of images representing men in three of the four textbooks including only 4 women in a total of 68 images in the Leaving Certificate textbook. These images were analysed by role (scientist or not), and by activity according to UNESCO criteria. There was a tendency to show men in scientific and other occupational roles while women were less well represented in scientific roles and were pictured in domestic and buying activities. This work aims to raise awareness of these representations and prompt action for reform in line with UN Strategic Development goals.",

        "description":"Education, health and care (EHC) plans were introduced in England in 2014, as a replacement for statements of special educational needs. Unexpectedly, the number of children and young people in receipt of an EHC plan rose by 49% during the 5 years up to 2019. Whilst most of the increase has been due to the extension of the age range up to age 25, there has still been a notable rise of 20% in the 0-15-year range. This study explores the trends and variations in EHC plans and tribunals within English local authorities (LAs) for children and young people with special educational needs and disability (SEND) by interrogating the latest full set of data from 2013 to 2018. Two quintile groups (n = 30) are used for comparing LAs with high and low levels of EHC plans and LA case studies are also presented for further inspection of the data. Wide variations across LAs still exist for EHC plans (5.2% to 1.0%) and tribunal appeals (43 to 0 per 10,000). LAs with low EHC plans have more appealable decisions at tribunals and are financed at significantly lower levels than LAs with high EHC plans, largely due to an historic spend factor of 50% in the national funding formula. There are also clear differences between the English regions for both EHC plans and tribunals, with high increases for both in the South East. The implications of the findings are discussed within the framework of LA critical self-reviews, benchmarking, fiscal constraints and inclusion.",

        "description":"Math anxiety negatively predicts young children's math achievement. While some researchers have suggested that math anxiety may stem from poor math ability, others have argued that math anxiety occurs at all levels of math ability. An important question is whether math anxiety predicts math achievement over and above foundational math skills. We sought to address this issue by examining whether math anxiety predicts future math achievement, controlling for number line estimation, a foundational math skill that predicts future math achievement. We found that 1st graders' math anxiety predicts their math achievement in 1st through 3rd grade, controlling for their number line estimation at the beginning of 1st grade. This finding suggests that math anxiety contributes to future math learning over and above an important foundational math skill. Additionally, we examined whether there are age differences in the relation of first-grade math anxiety to number line estimation at various scales in order to test the hypothesis that the negative effect of early math anxiety on math performance depends on task difficulty. In support of this hypothesis, early math anxiety more closely related to the 0-100 number line task in 1st graders but to the 0-1000 number line task in 3rd graders, suggesting that math anxiety most strongly relates to math skills that are at the cusp of children's understanding at particular grade levels. Together, these findings underscore the importance of fostering young children's positive emotions toward math in addition to providing them with a strong cognitive foundation for math learning.",

        "description":"Effortful retrieval produces greater long-term recall of information when compared to studying (i.e., reading), as do learning sessions that are distributed (i.e., spaced apart) when compared to those that are massed together. Although the retrieval and distributed practice effects are well-established in the cognitive science literature, no studies have examined their additive effect with regard to learning anatomy information. The aim of this study was to determine how the benefits of retrieval practice vary with massed versus distributed learning. Participants used the following strategies to learn sets of skeletal muscle anatomy: (1) studying on three different days over a seven day period (SSSS[subscript 7,2,0]), (2) studying and retrieving on three different days over a seven day period (SRSR[subscript 7,2,0]), (3) studying on two different days over a two day period (SSSSSS[subscript 2,0]), (4) studying and retrieving on two separate days over a two day period (SRSRSR[subscript 2,0]), and (5) studying and retrieving on one day (SRx6[subscript 0]). All strategies consisted of 12 learning phases and lasted exactly 24 minutes. Muscle information retention was assessed via free recall and using repeated measures ANOVAs. A week after learning, the recall scores were 24.72 ± 3.12, 33.88 ± 3.48, 15.51 ± 2.48, 20.72 ± 2.94, and 12.86 ± 2.05 for the SSSS[subscript 7,2,0], SRSR[subscript 7,2,0], SSSSSS[subscript 2,0], STSTST[subscript 2,0], and SRx6[subscript 0] strategies, respectively. In conclusion, the distributed strategies produced significantly better recall than the massed strategies, the retrieval-based strategies produced significantly better recall than the studying strategies, and the combination of distributed and retrieval practice generated the greatest recall of anatomy information.",

        "description":"When placing numbers along a number line with endpoints 0 and 1000, children generally space numbers logarithmically until around the age of 7, when they shift to a predominantly linear pattern of responding. This developmental shift of responding on the number placement task has been argued to be indicative of a shift in the format of the underlying representation of number (Siegler &amp; Opfer, [Siegler, R., 2003]). In the current study, we provide evidence from both child and adult participants to suggest that performance on the number placement task may not reflect the structure of the mental number line, but instead is a function of the fluency (i.e. ease) with which the individual can work with the values in the sequence. In Experiment 1, adult participants respond logarithmically when placing numbers on a line with less familiar anchors (1639 to 2897), despite linear responding on control tasks with standard anchors involving a similar range (0 to 1287) and a similar numerical magnitude (2000 to 3000). In Experiment 2, we show a similar developmental shift in childhood from logarithmic to linear responding for a non-numerical sequence with no inherent magnitude (the alphabet). In conclusion, we argue that the developmental trend towards linear behavior on the number line task is a product of successful strategy use and mental fluency with the values of the sequence, resulting from familiarity with endpoints and increased knowledge about general ordering principles of the sequence.

Recently, an analogy of &quot;waves at sea&quot; was shown to be effective in modulating fundamental frequency (F[subscript 0]) variation. Perceptions of intonation were not examined, as the primary aim of the work was to determine whether analogy instruction had a negative impact on other parameters of the speech signal compared with explicit instruction. The purpose of this study was (a) to determine whether changes in the standard deviation of F[subscript 0], acoustically, resulted in similar changes in the perception of pitch variability and (b) to determine the perceptual influence of analogy vs. explicit instructions on speech naturalness, loudness, and rate. Method: Ten speech-language pathologists were asked to listen to and rate pitch variation, speech naturalness, loudness, and rate for 74 Cantonese speech samples using a visual analogue scale, which allowed raters to indicate their subjective perceptions of each parameter. Results: It is revealed that listeners perceived pitch variation to be greater and speech to be more natural in analogy-instructed, rather than explicitly instructed, speech. No differences were perceived for ratings of speech loudness or speech rate. Conclusion: It is concluded that analogy instruction has a less negative impact on the naturalness of speech than explicit instruction and may provide a better method by which to manipulate desired pitch variation.

        "description":"Although simple architectural structures like bridges, catwalks, cantilevers, and Stonehenge have been integral in human societies for millennia, as have levers and other simple tools, modern students of introductory physics continue to grapple with Newton&apos;s conditions for static equilibrium. As formulated in typical introductory physics textbooks, these two conditions appear as SF=0 (1) and St=0, (2) where each torque t is defined as the cross product between the lever arm vector r and the corresponding applied force F, t=r×F, (3) having magnitude, t=Frsin?. (4) The angle ? here is between the two vectors F and r. In Eq. (1), upward (downward) forces are considered positive (negative). In Eq. (2), counterclockwise (clockwise) torques are considered positive (negative). Equation (1) holds that the vector sum of the external forces acting on an object must be zero to prevent linear accelerations; Eq. (2) states that the vector sum of torques due to &quot;external forces about any axis&quot; must be zero to prevent angular accelerations. In our view these conditions can be problematic for students because a) the equations contain the unfamiliar summation notation S, b) students are uncertain of the role of torques in causing rotations, and c) it is not clear why the sum of torques is zero regardless of the choice of axis. Gianino describes an experiment using MBL and a force sensor to convey the meaning of torque as applied to a rigid-body lever system without exploring quantitative aspects of the conditions for static equilibrium.",

        "description":"Introductory physics textbooks consider interference to be a process of redistribution of energy from the wave sources in the surrounding space resulting in constructive and destructive interferences. As one can expect, the total energy flux is conserved. However, one case of apparent non-conservation energy attracts great attention. Imagine that a pair of coherent, point-like wave sources (located at the same position) radiates sinusoidal waves of amplitude &quot;A,&quot; spreading in a uniform medium. Assume also that radiation of the two sources is in phase. Since the energy of oscillation, &quot;E,&quot; is proportional to amplitude squared, one quickly arrives at an apparent paradox. That is, the energy of oscillation in every point due to only one source is E[subscript 0] = CA[superscript 2] (C is the coefficient of proportionality), while according to the linear superposition principle, the combined amplitude of oscillations from the two sources is 2A and the energy of oscillations is E = C(2A)[superscript 2] = 4CA[superscript 2] = 4[superscript E][subscript 0], i.e., four (not two) times greater than the energy of oscillation of one isolated source in the absence of the second. In the general case, superposition of two waves with identical amplitudes and wavelengths produces a wave with an intensity somewhere between zero and four times the intensity of a single wave source (depending on relative phase of the two waves). This leads to the obvious question: how can we account for the &quot;extra&quot; (or missing) energy that necessarily results from in-phase (or anti-phase) wave interference? This &quot;apparent&quot; violation of the principle of conservation energy, due to the superposition of &quot;waves,&quot; is the primary topic of this paper.",

The Caregiver Interaction Profile (CIP) scales were used to rate the quality of caregiver-child interactions. Results showed a significant and substantial decline in quality compared to 2005, with 49% of the groups now scoring below the minimal level. The CIP scales showed relatively high scores for the basic caregiver interactive skills of sensitive responsiveness, respect for autonomy, and structuring and limit setting but much lower scores for the more educational skills of verbal communication, developmental stimulation, and fostering positive peer interactions. Caregiver sensitive responsiveness was significantly lower in infant groups (0-2 years) than in preschool groups (2-4 years); caregiver respect for autonomy, verbal communication, developmental stimulation, and fostering positive peer interactions were significantly lower in infant groups than in preschool groups and mixed-age groups (0-4 years). Practice or Policy: Quality of child care is not stable across the years, and regular quality assessments are therefore needed to monitor child care quality. The low scores on the more educational versus the more basic caregiver interactive skills indicate that these skills deserve more attention in caregiver education and training. Training programs should be attuned to the individual interaction skill profile of caregivers.",

        "description":"Nearly 100 years ago de Donder introduced the term &quot;extent of reaction&quot;, ?. We build on that work by defining the concept of reagent extrema for an arbitrary chemical reaction, aA + bB [reversible reaction] yY + zZ. The central equation is ?^[subscript i] = -n[subscript i,0]/?[subscript i]. The symbol ?^[subscript i] represents the reagent extremum for the chemical entity i; n[subscript i,0] represents the initial molar amount of entity i, and ?[subscript i] is its stoichiometric number, which is positive for products and negative for reactants. A reagent extremum exists for each reactant and each product; those of reactants are zero or positive, and the least positive of these is the reaction extremum to the right, ?[subscript max]; those of products are zero or negative, and the least negative is the reaction extremum to the left, ?[subscript min]. These two boundary values, called reaction extrema, indicate the maximum extent to which the reaction can progress in the forward or reverse direction, respectively. The ?[subscript max] and ?[subscript min] values are an important pedagogical tool for a quantitative understanding of chemical reaction stoichiometry. A graphical presentation in which the amounts of reagents are depicted versus extent of reaction is useful for helping general chemistry students understand intuitively the extent to which chemical reactions can progress. The Supporting Information includes a student handout, a student exercise, and a Web-enhanced object, &quot;Reaction Progress,&quot; which can be used to help students understand the concept of extent of reaction and reaction extrema.",

It is necessary to investigate factors beyond the school campus and into the neighborhoods that surround schools. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between the density of tobacco retailers and the illegal tobacco sales rate within school neighborhoods and smoking behaviors among students. Methods: This study utilized secondary data from the baseline of the Youth Tobacco Access Project. Data were collected from 10,662 students attending 21 middle schools and 19 high schools, in addition to 512 tobacco retailers, all within 24 towns in Illinois during 2002. A random-effects regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between the density of tobacco retailers and illegal tobacco sales rates on current smoking and lifetime smoking prevalence. Results: Schools had a range between 0 and 9 tobacco retailers within their neighborhood with a mean of 2.76 retailers (SD?=?2.45). The illegal sales rate varied from 0% to 100%, with a mean of 13%. The density of tobacco retailers was significantly related to the prevalence of ever smoking among students (b?=?0.09, t(29)?=?2.03, p?=?0.051, OR?=?1.10), but not to current smoking (p?greater than?0.05); the illegal tobacco sales rate was not related to current smoking or lifetime smoking prevalence (p?greater than 0.05). Conclusion: Results indicate that tobacco retailer density may impact smoking experimentation/initiation. (Contains 3 tables.)",

Method: Ten vocally healthy participants (M = 22.0 years; 6 cisgender females, 4 cisgender males) produced a sustained /?/, creating an input signal. This input signal was processed in near real time by the Eventide Eclipse to create an output signal that was either not shifted (0 cents), shifted +100 cents, or shifted -100 cents. Shifts occurred either throughout the entire vocalization or for a 200-ms period after vocal onset. Results: Input signals were compared to output signals to examine potential changes. Average pitch-shift magnitudes were within 1 cent of the intended pitch shift. Measured pitch-shift length for intended 200-ms shifts was between 5.9% and 21.7% less than expected, based on the portion of shift selected for measurement. The delay between input and output signals was an average of 11.1 ms. Trials shifted +100 cents had a longer delay than trials shifted -100 or 0 cents. The first 2 formants (F1, F2) shifted in the direction of the pitch shift, with F1 shifting 6.5% and F2 shifting 6.0%. Conclusions: The Eventide Eclipse is an accurate pitch-shifting hardware that can be used to explore voice and vocal motor control. The pitch-shifting algorithm shifts all frequencies, resulting in a subsequent change in F1 and F2 during pitch-shifted trials. Researchers using this device should be mindful of stimuli selection to avoid confusion during data interpretation.",

        "description":"The use of locative prepositions in the spontaneous speech of 30 Hebrew speaking children two to three years old was studied. The rank order of locative prepositions is determined according to the correct use in obligatory contexts, and tentative conclusions are drawn concerning the order of acquisition of these terms in Hebrew. An attempt is made to examine the role of cognitive complexity and formal linguistic complexity in determining that order. Special reference is made to the form of this expression in Hebrew, and the following hypotheses are proposed: (1) prefixed locatives are more salient for children than whole word prepositional locatives, and (2) morphological complexity is a determinant factor in the acquisition of new forms. Out of a total of 4,294 spontaneous  utterances, only 439 utterances contained obligatory contexts for locative prepositions. The children supplied the expected prepositions in all but 49 of these. The Hebrew data show that not only correct productions increase with mean length of utterance (MLU), but so does the total number of obligatory contexts for locative prepositions. The data support the assumption that children require semantic coherence and that they try to look for a one-to-one mapping between ideas and linguistic units. No consistent preference for one preposition over another was found. Enclitic prefixed prepositions seems to be acquired before full word prepositions that share the same locative notions, and morphological complexity seemed to act as a determinant in the acquisition of locative prepositions in  Hebrew.

According to the phonological deficit theory, supporting phonological development during the sensitive infancy period could prevent or ameliorate future dyslexic symptoms. Music is an established method for supporting auditory and speech processing and even language and literacy, but no previous studies have investigated its benefits for infants at risk for developmental language and reading disorders. We pseudo-randomized N~150 infants at risk for dyslexia to vocal or instrumental music listening interventions at 0-6 months, or to a no-intervention control group. Music listening was used as an easy-to-administer, cost-effective intervention in early infancy. Mismatch responses (MMRs) elicited by speech-sound changes were recorded with electroencephalogram (EEG) before (at birth) and after (at 6 months) the intervention and at a 28 months follow-up. We expected particularly the vocal intervention to promote phonological development, evidenced by enhanced speech-sound MMRs and their fast maturation. We found enhanced positive MMR amplitudes in the vocal music listening intervention group after but not prior to the intervention. Other music activities reported by parents did not differ between the three groups, indicating that the group effects were attributable to the intervention. The results speak for the use of vocal music in early infancy to support speech processing and subsequent language development in infants at developmental risk.",

Theoretically, lower adult/child ratios (fewer children per adult) and smaller group sizes are hypothesised to be associated with positive child outcomes in ECEC. A lower adult/child ratio and a smaller group size may increase both the extent and quality of adult/child interactions during the day. This systematic review examines the effects of reducing adult/child ratios and group sizes on process quality and on individual children's psychosocial adjustment, development and well-being in ECEC for children aged 0-5 years old. The review analyses evidence from 12 studies, two of which were randomised control trials, representing eight different populations. The main finding of the present review is that there are surprisingly few quantitative studies exploring the effects of changes to adult/child ratio and group size in ECEC on measures of process quality and on child outcomes. The review should be interpreted cautiously due to the low quality of the evidence. However, results tentatively support the theoretical impact of two structural features--adult/child ratio and group size--on process quality, which is reflected in legislation and quality standards imposing minimum requirements on the adult/child ratio and a maximum group size in ECEC settings. Findings from the review serve as a testimony to the urgent need for more contemporary research on the effects of adult/child ratio and group size in ECEC.",

Early childhood initiatives that take into account the entire preschool period of 0 to 5 years need a better understanding of the disparities which may be emerging at the very youngest ages in order to address these gaps with effective, targeted interventions for children ages 0 to 3 or the full age range from birth to school entry. This brief uses data from a nationally-representative sample of infants born in the year 2001 to examine multiple socio-demographic characteristics that may be associated with developmental disparities at 9 and 24 months of age. The authors examine developmental outcomes in three domains: cognitive development, general health, and social-emotional development. The authors conclude that causal relationships among the factors presented cannot be inferred in an indicators report, and this specific report cannot explain the reasons for any identified disparities by each of the demographic characteristics considered. However, indicators of wellbeing can inform society about social conditions and influence current policy discussions, including needs assessment and planning, goal-setting, and accountability.

Using data from the Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and Adaptation, we tested how harshness and unpredictability experienced in early childhood (age 0-5) versus in later childhood (age 6-16) uniquely predicted sexual and risky behavior at age 23. Findings showed that the strongest predictor of both sexual and risky behavior was an unpredictable environment between ages 0 and 5. Individuals exposed to more unpredictable, rapidly changing environments during the first 5 years of life displayed a faster life history strategy at age 23 by having more sexual partners, engaging in more aggressive and delinquent behaviors, and being more likely to be associated with criminal activities. In contrast, exposure to either harsh environments or experiencing unpredictability in later childhood (age 6-16) was, for the most part, not significantly related to these outcomes at age 23. Viewed together, these findings show that unpredictable rather than merely harsh childhood environments exert unique effects on risky behavior later in life consistent with a faster life history strategy. The findings also suggest that there is a developmentally sensitive period for assessing environmental unpredictability during the first 5 years of life. (Contains 8 tables and 5 footnotes.)",

        "description":"Purpose: In this article, a new signal-processing algorithm is proposed and evaluated for the suppression of the combined effects of reverberation and noise. Method: The proposed algorithm decomposes, on a short-term basis (every 20 ms), the reverberant stimuli into a number of channels and retains only a subset of the channels satisfying a signal-to-reverberant ratio (SRR) criterion. The construction of this criterion assumes access to a priori knowledge of the target (anechoic) signal, and the aim of this study was to assess the full potential of the proposed channel-selection algorithm, assuming that this criterion could be estimated accurately. Listening tests with normal-hearing listeners were conducted to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm in highly reverberant conditions (T[subscript 60] = 1.0 s), which included additive noise at 0 and 5 dB signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Results: A substantial gain in intelligibility was obtained in both reverberant and combined reverberant and noise conditions. The mean intelligibility scores improved by 44 and 33 percentage points at 0 and 5 dB SNR reverberation + noise conditions. Feature analysis of the consonant confusion matrices revealed that the transmission of voicing information was most negatively affected, followed by manner and place of articulation. Conclusions: The proposed algorithm produced substantial gains in intelligibility, and this benefit was attributed to the ability of the proposed SRR criterion to detect accurately voiced or unvoiced boundaries. It was postulated that detection of those boundaries is critical for better perception of voicing information and manner of articulation.",

Data are limited regarding provider perspectives of the accessibility and availability of HIV testing and treatment services in southern rural counties. Purpose: We surveyed providers in the rural south to better understand: (1) the accessibility and availability, and (2) the facilitators and barriers of HIV testing and treatment services. Methods: All county health departments (N = 326) serving populations of less than 50,000 persons, within 10 southern states, were mailed surveys. Responding health departments identified up to 3 HIV testing sites and up to 3 HIV treatment sites to which they refer clients. Findings: Overall, 243 of 326 (75%) health departments, 133 of 250 (53%) HIV testing sites, and 73 of 152 (48%) HIV treatment sites responded to the surveys. The number of testing sites per county ranged from 0 to 20; the number of treatment sites ranged from 0 to 4. An average distance of 50 miles for clients to travel for HIV treatment was reported by health department respondents as a barrier. Facilitators of HIV testing were (1) integrating HIV testing into other health services; (2) using rapid HIV testing; and (3) establishing easily accessible HIV testing locations and free testing services. Conclusion: Providers perceive that distance from local health departments to HIV treatment sites presents a barrier to HIV care for their clients. Future studies should ascertain clients' perspectives to ensure appropriate service provisions.",

Exemplar-based theories of speech processing, however, would predict that imitation beyond linguistic reproduction may occur in word repetition. Five experiments were conducted in which verbal audio-motor translations had to be performed under different conditions. Nonwords varying in phonemic content, in vocal pitch (F[subscript 0]), and in speaking style (schwa-syllable expression) were presented. We experimentally varied the factors \"response delay\" (repetition vs. shadowing), \"intention-to-repeat\" (repetition vs. pseudo-naming), and \"phonological load\" (repetition vs. transformation). The responses of ten healthy participants were examined for phonemic accuracy and for traces of para-phonological imitation. Two aphasic patients with phonological impairments were also included, to find out if lesions to left anterior or posterior perisylvian cortex interfere with imitation. In the healthy participants, significant imitation of both F[subscript 0] and phonetic style was observed, with markedly stronger effects for the latter. Strong imitation was also found in an aphasic patient with a lesion to left anterior perisylvian cortex, whereas almost no imitation occurred in a patient with a lesion to the posterior language area. The degree of unintended imitation was modulated by each of the three independent factors introduced here. The results are discussed on the background of cognitive and neurolinguistic theories of imitation. (Contains 2 tables and 3 figures.)",

In the domain of language, context processing in schizophrenia has been investigated mostly with single-word semantic priming paradigms; however, natural language comprehension depends on more than semantic relations between words. The present study aimed to systematically assess sentence context effects in homonym meaning activation in patients with schizophrenia. Fourteen patients with schizophrenia and 14 normal controls matched to the patients on sex, age, education and parental education, were examined using a cross-modal priming paradigm. Primes were sentences biasing the first, second, or neither meaning of a sentence-final equibiased homonym; targets were related to either the first or the second meaning of the homonym and appeared after an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 0 ms or 750 ms. Patients with schizophrenia exhibited a trend towards facilitation of both target types following unbiased sentences at ISI = 0 ms, similar to controls. However, in contrast to the pattern of selective target facilitation exhibited by control subjects following first- or second meaning-biased sentences, no significant target facilitation was observed in patients in the same condition. At ISI = 750 ms, patients did no longer exhibit significant target facilitation in any sentence context condition. This pattern of results is compatible with the assumption of a combined impairment in lexical (automatic spreading of activation within the semantic network) and extralexical (working memory) processes in patients with schizophrenia.

        "description":"Relational reasoning is an essential component of fluid intelligence, and is known to have a protracted developmental trajectory. To date, little is known about the neural changes that underlie improvements in reasoning ability over development. In this event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, children aged 8-12 and adults aged 18-25 performed a relational reasoning task adapted from Raven's Progressive Matrices. The task included three levels of relational reasoning demands: REL-0, REL-1, and REL-2. Children exhibited disproportionately lower accuracy than adults on trials that required integration of two relations (REL-2). Like adults, children engaged lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and parietal cortex during task performance; however, they exhibited different time courses and activation profiles, providing insight into their approach to the problems. As in prior studies, adults exhibited increased rostrolateral PFC (RLPFC) activation when relational integration was required (REL-2 greater than REL-1, REL-0). Children also engaged RLPFC most strongly for REL-2 problems at early stages of processing, but this differential activation relative to REL-1 trials was not sustained throughout the trial. These results suggest that the children recruited RLPFC while processing relations, but failed to use it to integrate across two relations. Relational integration is critical for solving a variety of problems, and for appreciating analogies; the current findings suggest that developmental improvements in this function rely on changes in the profile of engagement of RLPFC, as well as dorsolateral PFC and parietal cortex.",

        "description":"The relation between short-term and long-term change (also known as learning and development) has been of great interest throughout the history of developmental psychology. Werner and Vygotsky believed that the two involved basically similar progressions of qualitatively distinct knowledge states; behaviorists such as Kendler and Kendler believed that the two involved similar patterns of continuous growth; Piaget believed that the two were basically dissimilar, with only development involving qualitative reorganization of existing knowledge and acquisition of new cognitive structures. This article examines the viability of these three accounts in accounting for the development of numerical representations. A review of this literature indicated that Werner's and Vygotsky's position (and that of modern dynamic systems and information processing theorists) provided the most accurate account of the data. In particular, both changes over periods of years and changes within a single experimental session indicated that children progress from logarithmic to linear representations of numerical magnitudes, at times showing abrupt changes across a large range of numbers. The pattern occurs with representations of whole number magnitudes at different ages for different numerical ranges; thus, children progress from logarithmic to linear representations of the 0-100 range between kindergarten and second grade, whereas they make the same transition in the 0-1,000 range between second and fourth grade. Similar changes are seen on tasks involving fractions; these changes yield the paradoxical finding that young children at times estimate fractional magnitudes more accurately than adults do. Several different educational interventions based on this analysis of changes in numerical representations have yielded promising results.",

Methods: A convenience sample of 180 women aged 25-45 residing in Toronto, Canada, with no history of breast cancer and mammography received an information brochure and four questionnaires which assessed their knowledge of breast health, sociodemographic/clinical characteristics, and intended decision to use screening mammography. Results: Women's overall baseline knowledge score ranged from 0-18 with a mean of 10 and SD of 3.9. About half of the participants had a low score (0-9), 31 per cent did not know that the risk of breast cancer increases with age, 43 per cent did not know what was the appropriate age to start breast self examination (BSE), and 48 per cent did not know how frequently BSE should be performed. The overall knowledge score was significantly higher for those women who intended to use screening than those who did not (10.8 vs. 8.4, p less than 0.001). The intended use of screening was associated with women's knowledge (p less than 0.001), self-perceived health (p = 0.02), perceived susceptibility to breast cancer (p = 0.04) and perceived usefulness of information (p = 0.001). Conclusion: The study demonstrates that breast health knowledge is limited even among highly educated young women. This finding suggests the need for providing breast health education to women at earlier stage in their life when they have ample time to go through a logical series of decision stages on their way to adopting a new behaviour.

Students first use Protein Explorer to examine the structure of lysozyme and its charge dependence on pH. Student groups are then assigned one of four 45 mM sodium acetate buffers: pH 3.6 with either 0 or 60 mM NaCl or pH 4.6 with either 0 or 60 mM NaCl. Using their assigned buffers, student groups determine the second virial coefficient of lysozyme using laser light scattering and gel permeation chromatography. Student groups also determine the van't Hoff enthalpy of unfolding by UV absorbance thermal denaturation and compare their results to the van't Hoff enthalpy and calorimetric enthalpy of unfolding determined by differential scanning calorimetry. We stress the use of complementary techniques to determine these thermodynamic variables for student validation of experimental results. Students present their results in a peer reviewed, journal-style report and, using the data from the entire class, must determine the dependence of the lysozyme second virial coefficient and unfolding enthalpies on pH and ionic strength. Upon completion of these experiments, students are anticipated to appreciate the pH dependence of protein charge and screening of protein electrostatic repulsion with ionic strength.

The following acoustic measures were obtained on the sustained vowel phonations: correlation dimension (D[subscript 2]), percent jitter, percent shimmer, SNR, F[subscript 0], vF[subscript 0], and vAm. The results indicated the following: The mean D[subscript 2] of control PD patients was significantly higher than the mean D[subscript 2] of non-pathologic subjects and patients who received deep brain stimulation. These results suggest an improvement in PD voice in treated patients. Many PD vocal samples in this study have type 2 signals containing subharmonics that may not be suitable for perturbation analysis but are suitable for nonlinear dynamic analysis, making the D[subscript 2] results more reliable. These findings show that DBS may provide measurable improvement in patients with severe vocal impairment. Learning outcomes: Readers will be able to: (1) identify the advantages of nonlinear dynamic analysis as a clinical tool to evaluate the aperiodic voice commonly found in patients with Parkinson's disease, (2) describe in general the method of obtaining a correlation dimension measure from a voice sample and the significance of this measure in terms of specific voice signal properties, (3) consider the preliminary implications from nonlinear dynamic analysis of a positive DBS effect on Parkinsonian voice and the potential for further investigations using nonlinear dynamic analysis on the influence of gender, severity of disease, and combined treatments on Parkinsonian voice improvement.

        "description":"Background: It has frequently been suggested that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have deficits in auditory-visual (AV) sensory integration. Studies of language integration have mostly used non-word syllables presented in congruent and incongruent AV combinations and demonstrated reduced influence of visual speech in individuals with ASD. The aim of our study was to test whether adolescents with high-functioning autism are able to integrate AV information of meaningful, phrase-length language in a task of onset asynchrony detection. Methods: Participants were 25 adolescents with ASD and 25 typically developing (TD) controls. The stimuli were video clips of complete phrases using simple, commonly occurring words. The clips were digitally manipulated to have the video precede the corresponding audio by 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 14 video frames, a range of 0-500ms. Participants were shown the video clips in random order and asked to indicate whether each clip was in-synch or not. Results: There were no differences between adolescents with ASD and their TD peers in accuracy of onset asynchrony detection at any slip rate. Conclusion: These data indicate that adolescents with ASD are able to integrate auditory and visual components in a task of onset asynchrony detection using natural, phrase-length language stimuli. We propose that the meaningful nature of the language stimuli in combination with presentation in a non-distracting environment allowed adolescents with autism spectrum disorder to demonstrate preserved accuracy for bi-modal AV integration.",

        "author":["Snow, David"],
        "description":"Previous studies have suggested that intonation development in infants and toddlers reflects an interaction between physiological and linguistic influences. The immediate background research for this study, however, was based on vocalizations that were only one syllable in length. By extending the analysis to polysyllabic utterances, the present study evaluated a broader range of physiological constraints on intonation production than the maximally simple context of monosyllabic utterances had permitted. The width and direction of pitch change across one- and two-syllable nuclear tones were acoustically analyzed in utterances produced by 60 children between the ages of 0 ; 6 and 1 ; 11. The results showed that the children controlled the characteristic intonation pattern of English monosyllables by the age of 1 ; 6-1 ; 8. However, even the youngest groups of children produced relatively robust and adult-like intonation contours when the tone-bearing string was polysyllabic, suggesting that the trochaic or dactylic foot is the natural \"unmarked\" unit of tone production. The asymmetrical results for one- versus two-syllable tones support the conclusion that width of pitch change largely reflects physiological universals in children's earliest vocalizations and language-specific learning after the age of 1 ; 6. Implications of the findings are also discussed in relation to the Trochaic Template Hypothesis. It is concluded that a bias for trochaic rhythms that some children demonstrate could be based, in part, on the child's sensitivity to physiological constraints on the velocity and range of intonational pitch change. [Portions of this study were presented at the Child Phonology Conference, Arizona State University, May 14-15, 2004.]",

        "author":["Ibrahim, Raphiq"],
        "description":"The goal of the present study was to explore the pattern of lexical connections between translation equivalents represented in the cognitive system of an Arabic-Hebrew bilingual. To achieve this goal, repetition priming effects (reaction times (RTs) and accuracy measures) were compared between translation equivalents in the two forms of Arabic, Spoken Arabic (SA) and Literary Arabic (LA), with those between translation equivalents in Hebrew and LA, in native Arabic students living in Israel. While these students master Hebrew as well as they master LA, they consider it as a second language. LA targets were preceded by cognate and non-cognate translation equivalents in SA or Hebrew either immediately (Lag 0) or separated by four unrelated words (Lag 4), in a lexical decision task. The participants were requested to make a word/non-word decision regardless of language. Across languages, morpho-phonemic similarities augmented the repetition priming effects. At Lag 0 this effect was larger when the primes were in Hebrew than when they were in SA. At Lag 4, however, the priming effect between Hebrew and LA was significantly reduced (and even absent for non-cognates). In contrast, the priming effect between Spoken and Literary Arabic was only slightly attenuated. The conclusion was that, despite the intensive daily use and psychological proximity, Spoken and Literary Arabic are represented as first and second languages in the cognitive system of the native Arabic reader, entertaining distinct lexica. However, the strength of the lexical associations between translation equivalents is influenced by the frequency of concomitant use.",

        "author":["Desmet, Ophelie"],
        "description":"This dissertation investigated an affective curriculum intervention's effectiveness in resolving underachievement. The intervention was first implemented at a summer program with 20 students and four camp counselors. Inductive analysis of qualitative data indicated that most participants had positive perceptions of the model. Descriptive analyses indicated the intervention had small, positive effects on students' academic self-perceptions (MD = 0.122, SD = 0.621, d = 0.196) and attitudes toward teachers (MD = 0.139, SD = 0.848, d = 0.164) were found. There was no change in attitudes toward school (MD = 0.080, SD = 1.327, d = 0.060) and goal valuation (MD = 0, SD = 0.721, d = 0) and a moderate, negative effect on self-regulation (MD = -0.620, SD = 1.346, d = - 0.460). The intervention was then implemented in a middle school with one 12-year old girl who was gifted and underachieving. An explanatory mixed methods design, combining a single-case A-B design, an interrupted time series simulation, and inductive analysis, was used. The model was perceived as useful, mainly in increasing self-perceptions. Results showed a significant increase in behavioral engagement (d = 1.224, p &lt;.001) and improved achievement (SMD = 1.28). Academic self-perception (MD = 0.57) and attitudes toward school (MD = 1.00) improved, attitudes toward teachers showed no change, and goal valuation (MD = -0.67) and self-regulation (MD = -0.40) decreased. These two studies provide preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of the intervention. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

        "description":"Purpose: Accurate production of lexical stress within English polysyllabic words is critical for intelligibility and is affected in many speech-language disorders. However, models of speech production remain underspecified with regard to lexical stress. In this study, the authors report a large-scale acoustic investigation of lexical stress production in typically developing Australian English-speaking children ages 3-7 years (n = 73) compared with young adults (n = 24). Method: Participants named pictures of highly familiar strong-weak and weak-strong polysyllabic words. Of 388 productions, 325 met criteria for acoustic measurement. Relative vowel duration, peak intensity, and peak f[subscript 0] over the first two syllables were measured. Result: Lexical stress was marked consistently by duration and intensity but not f[subscript 0]. Lexical stress on strong-weak words was adultlike by 3 years. All 3 measures showed significant differences between adults and children for weak-strong words still present at 7 years. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that protracted development of weak-strong stress production reflects physiological constraints on producing short articulatory durations and rising intensity contours. Findings validate treatment that is centered on strong-weak stress production for children greater than or equal to 3 years with dysprosody. Although intervention for the production of weak-strong words may be initiated before age 7 years, reference to normative acoustic data is preferable to relying on perceptual judgments of accuracy.",

Parents of 1185 children with autism spectrum disorder (aged 3-12; 80.3% male) completed the first draft of the measure online. Factor and item response theory analyses reduced the set of 40 items to the final 21-item Pediatric Insomnia Autism Rating Scale. In this online sample, Pediatric Insomnia Autism Rating Scale mean was 21.8 ± 15.0 (range 0-63; coefficient alpha = 0.94). Item response theory results indicated excellent reliability across a range of scores. Next, we conducted a telehealth assessment of 134 children with autism spectrum disorder (aged 3-12; 73% male). In this clinical sample, Pediatric Insomnia Autism Rating Scale mean was 28.9 + 14.62 (range 0-61; coefficient alpha = 0.93). Pearson correlations of Pediatric Insomnia Autism Rating Scale with the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance and the modified Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire was 0.74 for each. This was significantly higher than correlations of parent-rated disruptive behavior, hyperactivity, repetitive behavior, and anxiety measures (range 0.29-0.59)--supporting convergent and divergent validity. Parents of 63 children completed the Pediatric Insomnia Autism Rating Scale three times over 4 weeks. Intraclass correlation was excellent (0.88) over three time points. Pediatric Insomnia Autism Rating Scale is a valid dimensional measure of insomnia in autistic children that produces reliable scores.",

        "description":"Science education reforms advocate modeling as a core practice in which &quot;analogy&quot; is a significant form and &quot;analogical modeling&quot; is a creative process for scientific explanation and discovery. This study adopts the self-generated analogical modeling approach involving electricity, which considers all the modeling subprocesses and includes two subtopics (circuits and energy) with incompatible ontological presuppositions as a conceptual space to develop an analogical modeling competence (AMC) instrument. Two constructs,&quot; phenomenon-related abductive premises&quot; (Phenomenon-AbPr) and &quot;analogical modeling processes&quot; (AMP), that describe the increasing sophistication of students' AMC (i.e., Level 0 experience to Level 4 high-order relation) are considered. The procedures utilize a construct-based approach of developing an assessment to validate the underlying constructs and subtopics to develop the mapping between the target and the analogical models, design items, and determine outcome spaces. Data were collected from 294 Grade 6 students to examine their AMC. The item response theory technique based on the Rasch partial credit model was used to validate the two-phase model. Student results revealed that the infit and outfit mean square values were between 0.75 and 1.33, indicating acceptable item fit. Results revealed that students scored highest on the open series circuit and lowest on electric energy in the Phenomenon-AbPr phase. Most students demonstrated relational mapping in the analogical model validation (Level 3) stage, which performed best in the AMP phase. However, they struggled to transfer factors during the analogical model application and deployment (Level 0). Implications for science assessment and teaching are discussed.",

In 2015, the United States adopted a new version (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision) of the World Health Organization coding system, a standard for classifying medical conditions. Our goal was to examine how the transition to this new coding system impacted autism diagnoses in 10 healthcare systems. We obtained information from electronic medical records and insurance claims data from July 2014 through December 2016 for each healthcare system. We used member enrollment data for 30 consecutive months to observe changes 15 months before and after adoption of the new coding system. Overall, the rates of autism per 1000 enrolled members was increasing for 0- to 5-year-olds before transition to International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision and did not substantively change after the new coding was in place. There was variation observed in autism diagnoses before and after transition to International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision for other age groups. The change to the new coding system did not meaningfully affect autism rates at the participating healthcare systems. The increase observed among 0- to 5-year-olds is likely indicative of an ongoing trend related to increases in screening for autism rather than a shift associated with the new coding.",

Results of logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curves analyzed with a sample of 195 K-5 students from 13 schools across three U.S. states suggested the following preliminary cutting scores for the SRSS-E5 for use at the elementary level: 0 to 1 for low risk, 2 to 3 for moderate risk, and 4 to 15 for high risk for externalizing behaviors. Results of the same analyses with a sample of 227 students in Grades 6 to 12 suggested the following preliminary cutting scores for the SRSS-E5 for use in middle and high (secondary) schools: 0 to 4 for low risk, 5 to 6 for moderate risk, and 7 to 15 for high risk for externalizing behaviors.

        "description":"Understanding fraction magnitudes is foundational for later math achievement. To represent a fraction x/y, children are often taught to use &quot;partitioning&quot;: Break the whole into y parts and shade in x parts. Past research has shown that partitioning on number lines supports children's fraction magnitude knowledge more than partitioning on area models. However, partitioning may not take full advantage of children's prior knowledge or the structure of the number line. We tested an alternative fraction number line lesson that leveraged children's preexisting whole number knowledge using a domain-general learning tool: &quot;analogy.&quot; In a preregistered online experiment, second and third graders (N = 84, M = 8.83 years) were randomly assigned to an analogy lesson (e.g., if I know how big 3 is on a 0-4 line, I know how big ¾ is on a 0-1 line), a partitioning lesson on number lines, or a control lesson using square area models. Results showed that the analogy lesson was more effective for promoting fraction magnitude understanding than the control lesson, and it was at least as effective as the partitioning lesson. The analogy group, but not the partitioning group, significantly outperformed the control group with large-denominator fractions at retention (i.e., 1-week delayed posttest) and on transfer tests (i.e., fraction comparison). We also replicated past findings that fraction partitioning lessons are more effective on number lines than on area models, and this advantage was partially sustained after a 1-week delay. Overall, these findings highlight the power of domain-general analogy to support mathematical development.",

Design/methodology/approach: A scoping review. We synthesized qualitative and quantitative research according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Database selection was based on specific content coverage of peer-reviewed articles in the biomedical and life sciences (PubMed) and health sciences and education (Scopus). We included articles complete original articles in English and/or Portuguese from peer-reviewed indexed journals whose reporting of evidence was in line with the objectives of this study: studies with parents and caregivers of newborns from 0 to 13 months old. Two independent reviewers extracted data and inconsistencies were resolved in a discussion between them and the third reviewer. Findings: A total of 345 articles were recruited, and 342 were excluded. The most studied age group was 2 months old. Regarding geographic location, most studies were carried out in the USA. All articles were published after the year 2010 and carried out only with fathers and mothers, excluding other caregivers (e.g. relatives and professionals). Research limitations/implications: Only one instrument is focused on health literacy in parental educational practices. Originality/value: We observe that this is a little-researched theme. All caregivers of young children face important barriers to understanding and implementing basic child health tasks (e.g. providing adequate nutrition, safety and medication).",

In early 1994, about 19,000 students in grades 4, 8, and 12 across the nation participated. This was the first comprehensive geography assessment by NAEP and will provide baseline data to measure future progress. Sample questions from the 1994 assessment are included. NAEP geography scores are reported on a scale that ranges from 0-500. Results are reported according to geography achievement levels--basic, proficient, and advanced. The NAEP assessment includes: (1) a mixture of 228 multiple-choice items; 80 short constructed response items; and 30 extended constructed-response tasks across grades 4, 8, and 12; (2) performance tasks that require students to  demonstrate geographic skills; (3) analytical tasks in which students are asked to construct geographic representations such as maps, charts, and diagrams; and (4) balanced and comprehensive coverage of topics that are engaging and relevant to students' experiences and world concerns.

Cadre training was designed to prepare participants to provide, coordinate, and enhance educational, safety, and health-related services for the target population. The training centered around three major areas: (1) technical skills; (2) team process; and (3) service delivery. The program included a needs assessment component which led to competency-based training in selected training events in  each site. Training was augmented by project-supported follow-up activities and technical assistance based on individual goals developed by cadre participants. One of the challenges faced by the project was the difficulty in obtaining parent input due to their inability to attend meetings. (CR)",

Using simulated data, the effects of sample size (500 and 1,000 examinees), focal group distribution (N(0,1) and N(-1,1)) number of differential item functioning (DIF) items (0%, 10%, and 20%), magnitude of DIF, and the value of a-parameter were evaluated. Overall, the DFIT framework  performed well. Type I error rates were affected by the number of DIF items, magnitude of DIF, and the value of the a-parameters. The DIF detection rates were affected by all the factors in the study. Future directions for research are discussed. (Contains 5 tables and 16 references.) (Author/SLD)",

The method is based on a statistical model for the response-time distributions of the examinees on items in the pool that is updated each time a new item has been administered. Predictions from the model are used as constraints in a 0-1 linear programming (LP) model for constrained adaptive testing that maximizes the accuracy of the ability estimator. The method is demonstrated empirically using an item pool from the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery and the responses of 38,357 examinees. The empirical example suggests that the algorithm is able to reduce the speededness of the test for the examinees who otherwise would have suffered  from the time limit. Also, the algorithm did not seem to introduce any differential effects on the statistical properties of the theta estimator. (Contains 9 figures and 14 references.) (SLD)",

That assessment, the National Adult Literacy Survey, produced a profile of the English literacy skills of the adult population along three scales, each ranging from 0 to 500, for prose, documents, and quantitative material. This volume draws on results from the first official report on the survey issued in 1993. One in 5 adults performed at the lowest level of prose literacy, while 3 in 10, at Level 3, can match information in a text to the directive given to them. Only 1 in 33 were at the highest level, able to make high-level inferences based  on text and to find information in dense text that contained distracting information. Results for document literacy and quantitative operations are similar. Three in 10 adults can solve problems with 2 or more numbers that must be found in printed material. Findings are presented in 28 graphs, and 15 example tasks illustrate the survey's problems. (SLD)",

Students ranged in age from 7 years 0 months to 14 years 7 months. Subjects included Black, Caucasian, Asian, and Hispanic children. Analysis of variance revealed no significant differences for age, geographical density, or race. Findings indicated the DAP:SPED was able to discriminate between the ED and LD samples but not the ED and CD samples.

Providing training programs and information can help reduce risks. It also notes that child development can vary from culture to culture. Intervention can be guided by theory, but it is important to recognize that most theory originates in the United States or Europe and should not be assumed to be universally valid.

The developments consist of an increase in the use of multiple realization rules for the same intent and an increase in the use of variable-type, selective realization rules. Sixteen 12- to 28-month-old children were videotaped six times in a year. The emergence of syntax was found to follow by 0-6 months a steep increase in the use of multiple mapping rules for the realization of the same intents in one-word utterances, as well as an &quot;explosion&quot; in the use of variable-type mapping  rules. The results raise the possibility that an understanding of the componential structure of communicative intents, and of the ways selected components may be mapped to expressions, is a necessary antecedent to understanding the mastery of patterned speech.

        "description":"Scores on the Institutional Functioning Inventory (IFI) administered to faculty at 18 unionized and 18 matched non-unionized campuses in 1980 were compared to scores at these campuses prior to the implementation of academic bargaining a decade earlier. The sample was selected from among 93 institutions that had administered the IFI in 1970 and in 1980. The IFI is a standardized instrument with scales designed to measure 112 dimensions of institutional climate and with scale scores ranging from 0 to 12 for such items as Intellectual-Aesthetic Extracurriculum, Freedom, Human Diversity, Concern for Undergraduate Learning, and Concern for Innovation. Results of the study show no significant relationship between unionization and changes in campus climate as measured by the IFI.  Although the results dispute commonly held assumptions about the effect of bargaining on campus life, it is noted that the finding is consistent with other research that has also failed to find a relationship between collective bargaining and changes in important institutional and organizational processes.

The measures use entire data. Difficulty value of test and item is defined as function of cosine of the angle between the observed score vector and the maximum possible score vector. Discriminating value of test and an item are taken as coefficient of variation (CV) of test score and item score respectively. Each ranges between 0 and 1 like difficulty value of test and an item. With increase in number of correct answer to an item, item difficulty curve increases and item discriminating curve decreases. The point of intersection of the two curves can be used for item deletion along with other criteria. Cronbach alpha was expressed and computed in terms of discriminating value of test and item. Relationship derived between test discriminating value and test reliability as per theoretical definition. Empirical verifications of proposed measures were undertaken.

DI flashcards require the student to provide the correct solution quickly and if an error occurs, the student is required to engage in error correction using a model, lead, and test procedure. The overall outcomes indicated large increases in student accuracy. Maintenance of treatment gains was also found with several division facts with our participant. The present outcomes replicate the range of classroom settings and disability designations.

        "description":"Racial residential segregation persists at high levels in all American cities with sizeable black populations. In 1980, 28 cities with black populations of more than 100,000 were home for 9.7 million blacks, more than a third of all American blacks. The average segregation index score for these cities was 81, when 100 means that every city block is either 100 percent black or 0 percent black. Neither the size of the black population nor its percentage of the total city population can be used to predict how segregated a city is. Racial exposure measures, which calculate the extent to which blacks are exposed to nonblack residents in their home neighborhoods, and similarly, nonblacks to black residents, also indicate the extent of racial segregation in the 28 cities. The 1980  average segregation index score has declined from the 87 of 1970, thus continuing the trend that was apparent in the 1960s. More rapid declines are possible, as shown by 8 individual city scores which declined by over 10 points. Seven cities, however, failed to decline by more than two points. Reasons for the differences are not known. (CMG)",

The framework for the approach is derived from empirical Bayesian theory. To illustrate the approach, two elementary decisions--selection and mastery decisions--are combined into a simple decision network. A linear utility structure is assumed. Decision rules are derived both for quota-free and quota-restricted selection-mastery decisions for several subpopulations. An empirical example of instructional decision making in an individual study system concludes the paper. The example involves 43 freshmen medical students (27 were  disadvantaged and 16 were advantaged with respect to elementary medical knowledge). Both the selection and mastery tests consisted of 17 free-response items on elementary medical knowledge with test scores ranging from 0 to 100. The treatment consisted of a computer-aided instructional program. Three data tables and three figures are provided. (Author/TJH)",

        "description":"The Rehabilitation Research and Development Laboratory at the United States Veterans Administration Hines Hospital is engaged in a long-term evaluation of blind rehabilitation. One aspect of the evaluation project focuses on the measurement of attitudes toward blindness. Our aim is to measure changes in attitudes toward blindness from pre-training, to post-training, and then to a six month follow-up. The Attitude Toward Blindness Questionnaire consists of 39 statements scored as Strongly Agree:3, Agree:2, Disagree:1, Strongly Disagree:0. The Rating Scale Rasch model for ordered response categories was used to explain these data. The three periods were first calibrated as a single set, the residuals were analyzed, peculiar items were identified and removed. The analysis of change  consisted of a calibration of items and persons at the separate time periods and the plotting of person attitude measures at each period. This paper demonstrates that: (1) detailed residual analyses can reveal critical measurement interaction processes, (2) measurement of change using the Rating Scale model is feasible, and (3) blind rehabilitation effects on attitudes can be studied quantitatively.

        "description":"Many researchers assume that people are creative, but their degree of creativity is different. The notion of creative thinking level has been discussed .by experts. The perspective of mathematics creative thinking refers to a combination of logical and divergent thinking which is based on intuition but has a conscious aim. The divergent thinking is focused on flexibility, fluency, and novelty in mathematical problem solving and problem posing. As students have various backgrounds and different abilities, they possess different potential in thinking patterns, imagination, fantasy and performance; therefore, students have different levels of creative thinking. A research study was conducted in order to develop a framework for students' levels of creative thinking in mathematics. This research used a qualitative approach to describe the characteristics of the levels of creative thinking. Task-based interviews were conducted to collect data with ten 8th grade junior secondary school students. The results distinguished five levels of creative thinking, namely level 0 to level 4 with different characteristics in each level. These differences are based on fluency, flexibility, and novelty in mathematical problem solving and problem posing.",

Therefore, it is important to understand which aspects of online discussion encourage learning and increase knowledge construction. This paper investigates the effect three Structured Divergent prompts (playground prompts, brainstorm prompts, and focal prompts) have on knowledge construction as compared to Convergent prompts. Participants (N = 58) were required to post in an online discussion thread during a graduate education course at a private university. The Interaction Analysis Model was used to determine the levels of knowledge construction demonstrated within students' posts. The posts were given a score using the following codes: 0-no post/no understandable post; 1-sharing information, 2-disagreeing; 3-negotiation of meaning; 4-testing co-construction; 5-agreement of the constructed meaning. The analysis revealed that two of the three Structured Divergent prompts (focal and brainstorm) yielded significantly higher levels of knowledge construction as compared to Convergent prompts.",

Data were collected from 288 elementary school students using math anxiety scale and math achievement test tools. The mathematics achievement test scores reveal that the students were classified into four groups: math learning difficulties (0-10%), low achievers (11-25%), normal achievers (26-95%), and high achievers (96-100%). The findings reveal that there was a strong correlation (r=-0.597) between the math anxiety and math achievement of the participants, while there was no significant difference between the mean scores of the mathematics anxiety of the lower two groups as it was between the two upper groups. This indicates that the math anxiety level of the students with math learning difficulties does not differ from the low achievers.

This is a simulation study. So data simulation and data analysis were done via packages in the R programming language. Results of the study showed that item parameter estimations performed under normal distribution were much stronger and bias-free compared to non-normal distribution. Moreover, the sample size had some limited positive effect on parameter estimation. However, the test length had no effect parameter estimation.

The researchers used document review and structured interviews with state education agency representatives. It was found that institutions of higher education (IHEs) in 38 states offer at least one LISD preparation program; 12 states offer no programs at all. Further, program intensity, a measure of state capacity to serve students with LISD, varies from 0 to about 3 programs per million state residents. States also differ by the regime used to qualify teaching candidates, using either licensure or endorsement. Nationally, being an LISD licensure regime is, all else being equal, negatively correlated with number of LISD programs. The findings suggest that many states lack the capacity to supply enough trained professionals to serve students with LISD. Recommendations are framed for states, national organizations, and IHEs.",

Evaluation of the estimators was based on bias and variability as measured by mean square error, and efficiency relative to the Pearson correlation coefficient. Correlations of .9, .3, .6, and .0 for samples of size twenty and forty for different weight tails were used. Two estimators that stood out as not being situation specific and demonstrated robust properties were the averaged bisquare, and Tukey correlations. The transformed Spearman's rho was  easy to calculate, and for small correlations was clearly the best of all the estimators considered; however, it degenerated as the correlation increased so that it was among the worst for a correlation of .9. The standardized sums and differences estimator demonstrated robustness and warrants further investigation. The biweight standardized sums and differences estimator did not demonstrate robustness, and the bivariate trimming estimator demonstrated limited usefulness. (Author/RL)",

        "description":"In an examination of institutional decision making, this study identified types of data used by college presidents in assessing their institution's stability and their perception of the comparative importance of various indicators purported to demonstrate the vital signs of an institution. Indicators were in the areas of Student Flow, Finance, and Personnel. Three rounds of the Delphi method were employed over a four-year period. Presidents were asked to indicate their assessment of the relative importance of each of the indicators using the following scale: high importance--3, moderate importance--2, low importance--1, and no importance--0. Mean scores and rankings were calculated for each informational subset within the three areas. Although the rankings according to highest  mean values varied, the five highest rated items in each informational subset were consistent in each round with only minor exceptions. The data indicated that although the context in which decisions were made was changing, the indicators utilized by presidents to determine the vital signs of their institutions' stability changed little over the four-year period of the study.

Vendors of health services were contacted, and the proportion of need they were meeting was calculated. Health factors including hazardous environments, chronic illnesses, acute illnesses, dental health, and nutrition were assessed. Traditional child  development factors including cognitive development, social development, and special needs were assessed. Programs attempting to meet these needs were reviewed. The vendors of such services were interviewed, and estimates of the unmet needs were established. The programs reviewed included preschools, kindergartens, and day care centers.

The problem was to discover the most effective way to represent the learner in such a film. In films used to teach 3500 Navy recruits the camera angle was either 180[ (as if facing someone performing the act) or 0[ (\"over the shoulder\" of the learner). Other variables tested included motion pictures versus static, sequential presentations, inclusion of the learner's hands versus their exclusion, and practice. It was found that the more realistic presentations--motion pictures from the learner's  perspective--were more effective. Excluding the learner's hands was superior to including them in static presentations. Results from participating during the learning by practicing were not conclusive. (BB)",

Some of the findings are: (1) group day care is considerably more expensive for children 0-3 years of age than for children 3-7 years of age; (2) group day care centers under municipal management are more expensive than group day care centers under private, nonprofit management; (3) staff salaries amount to 70 percent of total operating costs; and (4) family day care is significantly cheaper than group day care in Denmark. Implications of these findings for day care in the United States are suggested. As quality day care is expensive, a cost sharing plan (based on the Danish model) is proposed. In this  plan, the national government, the local government, and the family of the day care child share costs. Quality control is linked to the government subsidy; the government collects parental fees, and the caretakers are free to focus on the best possible care for the child. (CS)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to provide basic information concerning the acute effects of a small, moderate, and large dose of d-amphetamine sulfate upon muscular endurance; a secondary purpose involved the effect upon resting (R), and submaximal, and maximal (MAX) heart rate (HR). Twelve male university students underwent four separate trials of a progressive work task on an electric bicycle ergometer. Prior to each trial the subject consumed either a placebo (0 mg), small (5 mg), moderate (10 mg), or large (15 mg) dose of d-amphetamine sulfate per 70 kg body weight. A repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant F ratios (P.05) for the RHR and MAX HR. The Neuman Keuls analysis indicated the RHR for the moderate dose was higher than the placebo condition, while all three  amphetamine doses elicited a higher maximal heart rate than the placebo. It was concluded that variant dosages of d-amphetamine sulfate do not influence maximal endurance capacity or the heart rate during submaximal exercise, while the effect exerted upon RHR and MAX HR may have been due to chance occurrence.

        "description":"This document is the compilation of 50 reviews of selected articles, published between 1966-1970, pertaining to the relationship between malnutrition and potential to learn. The materials represent a relatively complete cross-section of the information available on this subject. There are three recurring themes in the publications reviewed. (1) If significant malnutrition occurs during critical periods of rapid brain cell multiplication, the number of cells produced is reduced. The cell deficiency is irreversible regardless of subsequent nutritional sufficiency. (2) Non-nutritional environmental factors may influence intersensory organization during periods of rapid development in a similar manner and might be more specifically described as the deprivation of positive perceived  stimuli. (3) It seems that in the near future some governmental institution will assume major proportions of responsibility for a broad spectrum of children between the ages of 0-5 years. Since educators and educational institutions will share these responsibilities, the importance of all aspects of nurturance will become a paramount consideration. (Author/AJ)",

(2) A study of 2-year-olds in residential nurseries compared development of children who had spent most of their lives in residential care with working class children living at home. (3) Language development of residential nursery children (2-5 years) was examined using verbal and nonverbal tests to determine presence and degree of language retardation. (4) An observational study of residential nurseries attempted to assess the  manner in which specific aspects of the children's environment affected their psychological development. Emphasis was placed on comparison of the speech and actions of staff in different types of nurseries. A short discussion follows each report and specifies outcomes and conclusions. (WY)",

        "description":"Three separate laboratory studies were conducted to determine the conditions under which a person reciprocates a past favor and retaliates a past harm. The first study utilized the framework of equity theory (Adams, 1965) and predicted that when faced with inequity due to the generosity or stinginess of another, one means of reducing the inequity would be to reciprocate the other's generosity or retaliate his stinginess. It was concluded that people will reciprocate a favor and retaliate harm, but prefer situations in which reciprocation and retaliation are not needed. The 2nd and 3rd studies focused on the joint effects of the intentions and the actual behavior of helper (0) on the reciprocation and retaliation of person (P). The results showed reciprocation to be based solely  on O's actual behavior, with no effect at all for O's intent. The 3rd study was carried out to test the reactance theory interpretation of the failure of O's intnetions to be reciprocated. The findings showed that both O's intent and the outcome of O's actual behavior were determinants of reciprocity, but that intent and behavior do not summate into a total level of reciprocity.

A 40% random sample was drawn for the study, and teaching plans were received for 96% of this sample. These were evaluated by an independent jury of adult educators. Each Extension Agent completed a personal experience questionnaire and a self-evaluation of his own teaching plan. Supervisors rated teaching performance by paired comparison of agents. The mean score of the total teaching plans evaluated by the independent jury was 2.44 on a scale ranging from 0-5.  Mean scores for teaching plans were highest for home economics agents and lowest for agricultural agents. In addition, supervisors rated differently the teaching performance of county and area agents. Also, significant positive correlations existed between the self-evaluation and the independent jury evaluations of the teaching plans. (CK)",

        "description":"For more than 100 years the Native Americans of the U.S. have been dominated economically, socially, educationally, and culturally by the larger society in which they live. The U.S. government has set policies, primarily through the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), without consulting Native Americans. The Ramah Navajo Community experienced relatively greater Federal and local domination because of their isolation from the larger Navajo reservation. In February, 1970, the Ramah Navajo Community voted 44-0 to create a school board. The 44 represented the intent of the entire Navajo community to assume responsibility for control of the already existing school. On March 25-27 the school board received support from Representatives and Senators and eventually from the BIA. The  curriculum stressed the bicultural setting. Many of the traditional subjects taught in public schools were included with adaptations, i.e., English was classified as a foreign language. Physical education stressed continuing leisure activities rather than pure calisthenics. The curriculum attempted to combine Navajo culture, international humanistic values, and competence in individually chosen fields. (FF)",

Continuous diagnosis and prescription were utilized to select materials and give intensified instruction by adjusting the content, level, and learning rate for each pupil. Materials were constantly manipulated and modified for self-directing and self-correcting experiences. Selected to participate in the project were 250 students from two schools which had a major population from black, low socio-economic families. All of the students were to meet the criteria of being more than one year retarded in reading, with an IQ above 75. Involved personnel took part in  a week of pre-service activities, with the actual instruction of students lasting approximately six months. Comparison of pre- and post-test results indicated that the achievement gains were significant and encouraging: 39% of the pupils gained 0.6 years or more, and another 39% gained from 0 to 0.5 years. Findings of a follow-up study and a list of references are included. (AW)",

Extremely high correlations for IQ's (.96 - .98) and subtests (.66 - .95) were found. However, when mean differences between complete WISC-R and the shortened form were examined, significant differences between administrations were found. Furthermore, one third of the subjects showed changes in intelligence classification levels when the abbreviated form was used. Thus, two of the three criteria previously suggested for a valid abbreviated intelligence test of: (1) high correlation between administration forms; (2) non  significant t-tests between the abbreviated and standard form mean IQ; and (3) low percentage of IQ classification change with the administration of the short form were not met. It was concluded, however, that the abbreviated WISC-R may be appropriate when intelligence is a question relative to candidacy for therapy or as a non-critical, general indication of intelligence when IQ classification is not important and/or assessment time is limited.

Optimal experiences for infants and toddlers are reported as the presentation of motivating stimuli specific to the cognitive level of the infant, a healthy attachment relationship, and game experiences which teach the baby his effect on the environment. Activities, interactions, and environmental design are discussed for infant development at four different stages (sample activities are in parentheses): 0-4 months (kinesthetic stimulation to aid the child in processing information and  attending to more and more complex stimuli); 5-8 months (stimuli inviting more active exploration like &quot;Busy Boxes&quot;); 9-18 months (involving the infant in all family tasks, such as cooking and laundry, to encourage feelings of competence); and 19-30 months (providing low shelves with simply arranged toys so the child can maintain his own environment).

The main purpose of the study was to identify those features of student backgrounds which have a bearing on academic achievement. Factors studied include socioeconomic class, pupil and parental aspirations and attitudes, staffing and type of school, home characteristics, parental support, and pupil variables. The method used was to survey a cross section of 5,200 Scottish secondary school students, their parents, teachers, and school administrators. Researchers evaluated the confidential questionnaires and found that parental attitudes, student aspirations, and student abilities are more important than social class in determining academic achievement. Among the nine  conclusions based on research results are that (1) the &quot;experience of teachers&quot; factor did not produce a consistent pattern; (2) teachers' forecasts and allocation to specific courses of study are of high predictive significance; and (3) students taught by a small number of teachers are likely to be high academic achievers.

This study is a quantitative study with a research design using a post-test-only control design. The data were collected using test and observation method and were analyzed using normality test, homogeneity test, t-test, and further hypothesis testing, which are to compare the learning outcomes of the experimental class and the control class. This study concludes that there was an increase in students' learning motivation through changing seats in primary schools, which can be seen from the results of data analysis showing that the value of t[subscript count] = greater than t[subscript table] = 2.2899 at a significant level of 5% (t[subscript count] &gt; t[subscript table]) count 3.0030 &gt; table 2.2899, H[subscript 0] was accepted.",

For this purpose, the &quot;estimation skills test&quot; comprised of 41 questions allowing estimates using 14 distinct estimation strategies was used. 209 pre-service primary school teachers took part in the study. The responses provided by the pre-service teachers were scored on the basis of the accuracy of the estimation. Furthermore, the responses to the questions in the test were scored with reference to the applicability of the estimation method, on a binary scale of 0 and 1. The study revealed that the pre-service primary school teachers had mediocre operational estimation skills, and that majority of them failed to use the optimal strategy. In this context, one should recommend the offering of undergraduate courses to pre-service primary school teachers to improve their estimation skills.",

The literature examines how this approach could support bilingual tamariki (children) who may present with dyslexic tendencies in Maori-medium immersion contexts. Through an anonymous questionnaire to kaiako within kura kaupapa Maori (Maori-medium immersion schools) who teach or have taught tau 0-10 akonga (years 1-10 students), participants shared what they know and understand about literacy, dyslexia and how this learning difference might reveal itself through te reo Maori (Maori language) and English. The findings highlighted the potential structured literacy has to benefit all akonga in both languages and the need for te reo Maori resources and professional development on dyslexia and structured literacy.",

        "description":"The Adult Education and Family Literacy Act, as part of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, requires programs to use standardized assessments to report learning gains for students in adult education programs. In addition, local and state agencies need an accountability tool for students who are difficult to assess adequately with a paper-and-pencil format. In this study CASAS sought to determine the feasibility of calibrating basic skills on the Providing Options for the Workplace, Education, and Rehabilitation (POWER) performance assessment and to establish corresponding difficulty estimates on the CASAS scale. The goal of the calibration was to achieve consistency of the POWER scoring system with guidelines of the National Reporting System (NRS) for adult education. Results indicate that performance levels (0-4) for each of the basic skills in a POWER assessment can be scaled and located on the CASAS scale score continuum. Therefore, agencies can use the POWER performance assessment to measure learning gains for students with developmental disabilities and for NRS reporting purposes.",

        "description":"The metric of the multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) item parameter estimates is usually referred to as reference axes that are orthogonal and of unit length. This is due to the fact that most MIRT parameter estimation programs solve the identification problem by requiring that multidimensional abilities be distributed as multivariate normal distribution, N (0, I). Under this circumstance, the equated group's reference system can be transformed into the base group's reference system by a composite transformation: an orthogonal procrustes rotation, a translation transformation, and a single dilation. Based on this composite transformation, three sets of MIRT equating methods have been developed and evaluated in this study. The results indicate that the best MIRT equating  method is an unbiased, effective, and consistent estimator producing accurate transformation parameter estimates when the errors in the estimation of item parameters were purposely manipulated. In addition, this MIRT equating method is capable of successfully recovering parameters, especially for the item parameters, under well-fitting model conditions.

Lastly, all scripts of students in these segments were re-scored with regard to strategy use. Multiple regression and discriminant analysis were utilized to evaluate data. Results showed that strategies explain 84% of the problem solving success, and their importance order is as follows: look for a pattern, work backward, make a systematic list, make a drawing, guess and check and simplify the problem. Strategies which play a significant role in distinguishing students are look for a pattern, make a systematic list, work backward, simplify the problem, make a drawing, respectively.

We show that achievement gaps vary substantially, ranging from nearly 0 in some places to larger than 1.2 standard deviations in others. Economic, demographic, segregation, and schooling characteristics explain roughly three-quarters of the geographic variation in these gaps. The strongest correlates of achievement gaps are local racial/ethnic differences in parental income, local average parental education levels, and patterns of racial/ethnic segregation, consistent with a theoretical model in which family socioeconomic factors affect educational opportunity partly though residential and school segregation patterns.

The conditional stimuli were compounds of pairs of stimuli from two different dimensions, fast versus slow cycles of red or green stimuli, and short- versus long-duration presentations of these cycles. Across conditions, the probability of reinforcers for correctly responding to each dimension was varied from 0 to 1. Discriminability, measured by log \"d,\" for stimuli on a dimension increased as the relative frequency of reinforcers for that dimension increased, replicating the results of Shahan and Podlesnik (2006). Two further conditions showed that discriminability between stimuli on each dimension was unaffected by whether the stimuli on the other dimension varied or were constant. Finally, maximal discriminability was unchanged in a redundant-relevant cues condition in which either of the stimuli comprising a compound signaled the same correct response. Davison and Nevin's (1999) model provided an excellent quantitative account of the effect of relative reinforcer frequency on discriminability, and thus of the way in which divided stimulus control is itself controlled by relative reinforcement.

A total of 142 articles (152 studies) that met review criteria were included. Nearly all (95%) of these experiments provided an operational definition of the independent variable, but only 30% of the studies provided treatment integrity data. Nearly half of studies (45%) were judged to be at high risk for treatment inaccuracies. Treatment integrity data were more likely to be included in studies that used teachers, multiple treatment agents, or both. Although there was a substantial increase in reporting operational definitions of independent variables, results suggest that there was only a modest improvement in reported integrity over the past 30 years of JABA studies. Recommendations for research and practice are discussed. (Contains 2 figures and 1 table.

        "description":"Socially anxious adolescents often endure anxiety-provoking situations using &quot;safety behaviors&quot;: strategies for minimizing in-the-moment distress (e.g., avoiding eye contact, rehearsing statements before entering a conversation). Studies linking safety behaviors to impaired functioning have largely focused on adults. In a sample of 134 14-15 year-old adolescents, we tested whether levels of safety behaviors among socially anxious adolescents relate to multiple domains of impaired functioning. Adolescents, parents, and research personnel completed survey measures of safety behaviors and social anxiety, adolescents and parents reported about adolescents' evaluative fears and psychosocial impairments, and adolescents participated in a set of tasks designed to simulate social interactions with same-age, unfamiliar peers. Relative to other adolescents in the sample, adolescents high on both safety behaviors and social anxiety displayed greater psychosocial impairments, evaluative fears, and observed social skills deficits within social interactions. These findings have important implications for assessing and treating adolescent social anxiety. [This paper will be published in &quot;Behavior Modification.&quot;0",

Many researchers consider growth to be a superior (if still imperfect) measure of school effectiveness relative to status. Moreover, compared to status, growth has weaker relationships with schools' demographic compositions. We conduct an online survey experiment featuring a nationally representative sample of parents and caretakers of children ages 0-12. Participants choose between three randomly sampled elementary schools drawn from the same school district. The provision of status information guides participants toward schools with higher achievement status and fewer Black, Hispanic, and economically disadvantaged students. The provision of growth information and the provision of both types of academic performance data guide participants toward higher growth schools. However, only growth information--alone, and not in concert with status information--tends to elicit choices with desegregating consequences.",

This mediation model rendered an explanation for how student interaction related to student satisfaction through social presence.

The report uses federal data to determine the so-called &quot;college affordability gap&quot; in three states--California, Michigan, and New York--with a focus on students who are eligible for the federal Pell Grant. The affordability gap is defined in this analysis as the gap between a student's total costs of attending college--including tuition, fees, housing, food, and other expenses--and the amount of non-loan aid available to them: a combination of family resources, grant aid, and earnings from a reasonable number of work hours. The report then examines how much the example states would need to invest close this gap for Pell-eligible students, with the goal of a $0 gap for such students. This analysis builds on TICAS' ongoing efforts to build a debt-free future for all students.",

        "description":"A voluntary survey regarding beliefs on evolution, and creation and ethics was developed and administered on-line from June through July 2006 to over 100 students, faculty, and staff at a mid-sized public university in the Midwestern United States. The survey consisted of 33 questions to measure participant agreement with core principles of evolutionary theory, 5 questions designed to place participant views along a creationism-evolution continuum, 21 questions to measure respondent beliefs on ethics, and a concluding question asking for comments. A KR-20 value of 0.896 for the first 33 questions indicated high reliability of the evolution portion of the survey, but the KR-20 of 0.510 for the last 21 questions indicated lower reliability for the ethics portion. The hypothesis tested in this study was that teleological ethical views would correlate positively with evolutionist views. An evolution score and a teleological ethics score were calculated from each participant's responses to the first 33 questions and the last 21 questions, respectively. To generate evolution scores, a response to each of the 33 evolution questions was assigned a &quot;1&quot; if the response indicated agreement with evolution and a &quot;0&quot; if the response indicated agreement with creationism. The evolution score for each participant was the sum of the scores across all 33 questions. Likewise, to generate the teleological ethics scores, a response to each of the 21 ethics questions was assigned a &quot;1&quot; if the response indicated agreement with teleological ethics and a &quot;0&quot; if the response indicated agreement with deontological ethics. The teleological ethics score for each participant was the sum of the scores across the 21 ethics questions. The mean evolution score (n = 123 participants) of 26.10, responses to the 5 creationism-evolution continuum questions, and comments solicited at the end of the survey indicated that participant views were more evolutionist than creationist, but participants held a diversity of views, and seemed unsure of some evidence supporting evolutionary theory, and of the nature of scientific theory itself. The mean teleological score (n = 123 participants) of 10.08 indicated that participants were almost equally split between deontological and teleological ethics views. A weak positive correlation between evolutionary views and teleological ethics views (r = 0.258, p &lt; 0.05) supported the hypothesis of this study. At the same time, however, answers to some ethics questions seemed contradictory, reflecting unclear questions, respondent uncertainty with the topic, the inherent difficulty of ethics itself, or a combination of these factors. A question arising from these results is whether ethical values might shift as participants learn more about evolution and the nature of science.",

        "description":"The teacher is considered the most important factor in student success. With increased emphasis on research-based information through federal legislation, teachers struggle selecting credible methods and procedures among available reading instruction sources confounding the possibility of student achievement. Teacher self-knowledge, peer teachers, administrators, professional development, and the Internet are accessible sources for educators in regard to obtaining reading instruction information. Research in the field of education suggests teacher-practitioners procure and implement retrieved reading instruction information based on two factors: existing teacher beliefs regarding reading instruction and support of implementation of the method or practice within the school climate. This study investigated through quantitative and qualitative analyses if there is a significant difference in perceived reliable sources of reading instruction information among teacher-practitioners based on years of experience and grade level designation as supported by questionnaire comments and interview responses.    A 3 X 3 Factorial Multivariate of Analysis (MANOVA) reported no significant interaction in perceived reliable sources (peer teacher, professional development, the Internet, and school administrators) based on years of experience (0-8 years, 9-18 years, and 19+ years) and grade level designations (Kindergarten-First, Second-Third, and Fourth-Fifth). A main effect was reported for \"years\", and a univariate follow-up for \"Internet\". The finding of the main effect reported a difference in perceived reliability of the Internet for reading instruction for teacher-practitioners of 0-8 years of experience and 19+ years of experience. Teacher-practitioners with 19 + years of experience perceive the reliability of the Internet greater than teacher-practitioner with 0-8 years of experience. No significant difference was reported for teacher-practitioners with 9-18 years of experience regarding the perceived reliability of the Internet.    Qualitative findings support the quantitative outcome through comments provided on the questionnaire and interview statements. The use and availability of the Internet was reported in all interviews. The quantitative and qualitative findings of this study suggest the influx of the Internet has changed the perspectives of traditional approaches to how instructional information should be disseminated, and presents findings questioning whether other available sources investigated are presently effective in providing reading instruction knowledge in an effort to bridge teacher-practitioners acquisition of reading knowledge to implementation application. Suggestions regarding policy, practice, and further research directions of assisting teacher-practitioners and higher education with investigations for reading instruction through the Internet are presented.

However, tractable versions of these models typically make strong assumptions that render them ill suited for monetary policy analysis. We propose a new framework, based on explicit micro foundations, within which macro policy can be studied. The framework is analytically tractable and easily quantifiable. We calibrate the model to standard observations and use it to measure the cost of inflation. We find that going from 10 percent to 0 percent inflation is worth between 3 and 5 percent of consumption-much higher than previous estimates.",

        "description":"When running out of time on a multiple-choice test, some examinees are likely to respond rapidly to the remaining unanswered items in an attempt to get some items right by chance. Because these responses will tend to be incorrect, the presence of &quot;rapid-guessing behavior&quot; could cause these items to appear to be more difficult than they really are. This study used simulated data from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 for 5,000 examinees. It found that item response theory parameters are affected by rapid-guessing behavior, and that the Item Characteristic Curves (ICCs) were generally lower than the true ICCs. Using response times, an attempt was made to remove responses that appeared to be the result of rapid-guessing behavior. Two methods of  removing responses were used. After removing the fast responses (rapid guesses), the item parameters and ICCs were recovered more accurately. The two methods of classifying responses as rapid guesses and removing them worked equally well in recovering the true parameters and ICCs. (Contains two tables, eight figures, and seven references.)

This research project, part of a larger project on early intervention with young disabled children, investigated the play of children with a motor handicap. The sample consisted of 61 disabled children age 0 to 7 years who regularly visit the department of Paediatric Neurology at Tampere University Hospital in Finland. Cognitive development and motor functioning were assessed with formalized tests, and play activities (both structured and unstructured) were videotaped, and the level of play and motor functioning were assessed. Preliminary results, presented in three examples of individual children, revealed extensive variation  among children. Although most made progress in play activities and in mental and motor functioning, several did not (they had severe mental and motor disabilities). The capacity of the child's gross motor functioning affected play development: the better the gross motor functioning, the higher the level of play. Results also suggested that disabled children exhibit pattern of developmental play sequence similar to that of nondisabled children. (Contains 38 references.) (EV)",

Given this situation, two questions arise concerning counselor preparation literature: (1) To what extent have women authored counselor preparation literature? (2) To what degree has this literature considered gender? In order to establish a context for specific gender issues, this study provides a historical grounding for dialogue on gender issues in counseling. The context was set by examining women's authorship rates in volumes 0-32 of the journal \"Counselor Education and Supervision\" (CES). Articles that dealt specifically with gender issues were also analyzed. Analysis showed that women wrote 18 percent of the articles and that 4 percent of the articles addressed gender. Results  indicated a significant increase over time in women's authorship of CES articles. These rates increased even though the total number of articles published per issue dropped. However, there was no significant rise in the appearance of gender articles since the 1970s, suggesting a disturbing gap in counselor preparation research. It is argued that a greater focus on gender issues in counselor training and supervision is necessary if counselors are to remain an efficacious source of mental health services. (RJM)",

An introduction discusses clinical approaches to assessment and diagnosis, gives an overview of the classification system, and offers guidelines for diagnosis. In the classification, the focus is on developmental issues with dynamic processes, such as relationships and developmentally based conceptualizations of adaptive patterns of central importance. The diagnostic framework consists of five axes: Axis 1--primary classification (e.g., disorders of affect, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, sleeping and eating behavior disorders); Axis  2--relationship disorder classification (e.g., overinvolvement, underinvolvement, anger/hostility, abuse, sexual abuse); Axis 3--medical and developmental disorders and conditions; Axis 4--psychosocial stressors; and Axis 5--functional emotional developmental level. Appendixes include the Parent-Infant Relationship Global Assessment Scale, descriptive criteria for patterns of multisystem developmental disorder, and an outline of the classification system. Seventeen case vignettes are provided, as is an index to primary diagnoses of cases. (DB)",

The prior welfare participation of a teenage daughter's mother is an important focus in the analysis, which employs a bivariate probit model. Among the many findings of the investigators is that teenage daughters whose mothers have more education are less likely to give birth out of wedlock, that teens whose mothers received  welfare are more likely to give birth out of wedlock and receive welfare themselves, and that teens who grew up in a home experiencing stressful events (e.g. parental separation, geographic moves) are more likely to give birth order of wedlock.

Parents (12 mothers and 10 fathers) of autistic children (mean age 56 months) completed a self-report questionnaire. Expenses associated with the therapy included the initial consultation, a 3-day training workshop for parents, rearrangement of the home environment to foster therapy, hiring of therapists (mean number 5 per family for a mean number of 29.5 hours per week), and follow-up consultations. Parents estimated the average monthly cost of providing therapy for their autistic child to be $1,237. Responses concerning family adjustment and stress indicated many families have a  highly structured routine for their autistic child, both mothers and fathers perceived high levels of stress, most parents reported spending 0-3 hours together per week, the autistic child frequently had additional health problems, and financial assistance defrayed only a small percentage of treatment expenses. Discussion focuses on recommendations for additional government funding and insurance coverage for families of autistic children. (DB)",

A principal focus of the program was the provision of interagency services in a collaborative mode led by an interagency council. One conclusion was the need for regionalization of resources in such a large state. Accomplishments toward seven objectives are reported in terms of the project's goal and project year, including: providing information for identifying and  referring infants and young children with deaf blindness; providing technical assistance in assessment and program development services for infants and preschoolers with deaf blindness; providing support services and consultation to parents, especially in rural areas; and maintaining an updated state registry of infants, children, and young adults with deaf blindness.

The first goal states that &quot;By the year 2000, all children in America will start school ready to learn.&quot; The grade given to goal 1 is &quot;incomplete&quot; because of insufficient data. Only half of all children with disabilities ages 3-5 attend preschool programs. This conclusion is based on unpublished tabulations from the Early Childhood Component of the 1991 National Household Education Survey. Services for children age 5 or younger who have special needs are being expanded yearly in view of estimated increases in numbers of children needing services. In 1990-91 approximately 400,000 children with  disabilities, ages 3-5, participated in preschool special education progams and approximately 200,000 infants and toddlers, ages 0-2 years participated in early intervention programs. The report briefly outlines services available for young children with disabilities, the number of children receiving services and their geographic distribution, parent involvement, nutritional and health needs, and the need for additional information.

The purpose was to assist teacher educators to more adequately train beginning teachers who then would be better prepared to deal with problematic classroom situations. Subjects (N=49) were secondary teachers from the Southeast of the Netherlands: 25 inexperienced teachers with 0 to 3 years experience and 24 experienced teachers with more than 5 years of practice. Five simulated problematic classroom situations were shown on videotape, and teachers were asked to complete two questionnaires dealing with emotional stress reaction and the sense of self-efficacy. The data suggest that experienced teachers' reactions are  characterized by more complexity than those of inexperienced teachers; experienced teachers produce more reaction-intentions and need more reaction time; both groups show no differences in their range of reactions and seem to react in a confrontive, friendly-directive or understanding-permissive way. Attributional differences of teachers appear to be related to situational cues, rather than to teachers' experience. (LL)",

Students were asked to indicate the extent to which each statement described them using a scale from 0 to 9. The resulting data show that the alpha reliability coefficient for the whole 24 items was 0.82. Then, after dropping the 3 weakest items, the reliability coefficient increased to 0.86. A principal components factor analysis with a varimax (orthogonal)  rotation revealed the following six factors: (1) students' interest and future applicability; (2) relationship and impact of the instructor; (3) attitude toward statistical tools; (4) self-confidence; (5) parental influence; and (6) initiative and extra effort in learning statistics. The Students' Attitudes Toward Statistics inventory psychometric analysis revealed sound properties and therefore can be used by researchers and practitioners to measure students' attitudes about statistics.

This report describes a study that sought to answer questions concerning science instructional practices in kindergarten and first grade. Nine full-day observations were made of 27 kindergarten and 18 first-grade classes to discover how and how much science is being taught in these classrooms. The amount of time spent in science activities and the types of teacher interactions during these activities was recorded. Kindergarten teachers were found to average from 0 to 28 minutes teaching science, while first-grade teachers averaged from 1 to more than 15 minutes of science instruction  during a typical day. Analyses of the teacher-directed interactions revealed that about 40% of the interactions involved questions to be answered from the children's background knowledge, over 25% were procedural, 11% were reviews of material presented previously, 7.5% were answered in texts, and 4% were oral reading turns. No significant differences were found among teachers in regard to children's performance on the three tests designed specifically for the study. (Contains 28 references.) (Author/PR)",

Participants were sent a digital survey and asked to use a scale from 0 (do not agree) to 8 (agree) to score their agreement level with 43 statements of opinion. Data revealed that community college faculty perceive CTE as beneficial, but CTE programs must include the habits of mind and support students' social and emotional development. The findings also indicated that CTE programs should be credit-bearing and offer students a holistic education. Implications of the study are concerned with community college development and implementation of CTE programs such that these programs must include industry-required competencies to prepare students for work.

Studies had reported that one of the most robust factors of SWB is the sense of mattering. While the sense of mattering is built upon social feedback, being locked down limited their source of social feedback to they can only develop their interpersonal mattering through their significant others whom they shared the dwelling place and their societal mattering through the 'society' they found in the social media. We purposively selected 82 participants to respond to our scales of mattering types and SWB. Among our inclusion criteria was to have a limited number of living partners (0-3) to make sure that their mattering was predominantly built from the social media feedback. The result of the multiple regression analysis suggested that despite their interpersonal mattering having a weaker contribution to their SWB, it was still a significant predictor of SWB when controlling for societal mattering. Thus, both types of mattering are still considered salient and robust predictors of SWB. Further limitations and suggestions are discussed.",

In the Eastern Cape (EC) province, the dismal percentage of Grade 12 learners who achieve success in gateway subjects, as reflected in the National Senior Certificate Examination results, was linked to the grossly inequitable distribution of funding and even the defunding of education. The 3 high schools in question were stigmatised as chronic underachievers, having reported a 0% pass rate for 5 successive years. Establishing an intervention programme to finance quality education for schools in poverty-stricken communities was an arduous undertaking. Although the windfall was temporary, it was construed as the dawn of a new age of philanthropy. The project spurred the development of local education finance to motivate South Africa's &quot;Dinaledi&quot; (stars).",

To have such skills gives the student many advantages in the process of comprehending, and evaluating any text. This study aims to bring out the opinions of Turkish language teachers and elementary school teachers about teaching text type and structure. In this study, a descriptive research design was employed and the participants consisted of 55 Turkish language teachers and elementary school teachers. Content analysis was utilized for data analysis. In this study, to check reliability and validity, the statements of participants were transfered directly, participant confirmation and the percent of agreement (approximately % 0, 81) between two researchers were used. It was found that Turkish language teachers and elementary school teachers generally adopted a different teaching approach, and used the text-based, production and conversion, information transfer, and audience-centred activities. The participants stated that there are different problems in Turkish textbooks concerning the teaching. It is suggested that studies should be carried out to solve the problems that teachers have stated in the teaching of text type and structure.",

The Suzuki Early Childhood Education (SECE), which aims at the musical education of babies (0-3) and conducts the lessons face-to-face, is one of the areas most affected by the pandemic. Due to the nature of babies, in these lessons, where digital technology is rarely involved, questions emerged about how the process is managed. The purpose of this research is to identify SECE teachers' views on online courses and their practices. Qualitative research method was used in the research. The researcher attended online classes organized by the Mexico Suzuki Association and made interviews. Content analysis was performed. It was found that online adaptation was easy due to the systematic structure of the SECE; in addition, managing the process was convenient thanks to the active participation of the parent; however, playing together, interaction, learning from each other and group studies could not be done as required; finally, there were deficiencies in tone and aural studies due to the lack of instruments. Overall, teachers were found to prefer face-to-face and interactive education.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the accuracy of a common data point decision rule. This study used a three-point rule with a goal line of 1.50 words read correctly per minute (WRCM) across six levels of true growth (range = 0-3 WRCM), two levels of dataset quality or residual (5 and 10 WRCM), and 13 levels of data collection (range = 3-15 weeks). We estimated the probability of a correct decision as well as the probability of each outcome (change instruction, increase the goal, maintain instruction) across each condition with probability theory and a spreadsheet program. In general, results indicate that recommendations are often inaccurate. Further, the probability of a correct recommendation is below chance in most situations. Results of multiple regression analyses indicate that residual, duration, and true growth interacted to influence decision accuracy.

(22°C, 10,5°C, 0°C, -5,5°C ,-11°C). Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine whether the data showed normal distribution. ANOVA was used to compare the data for normal distribution and Kruskal-Wallis-H test was used for showing not normal distribution. Additionally, Tukey test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for meaningful difference. The significance levels were taken as 0.01 and 0.05. Significant changes were found all measured parameters compared to cold environment and Significant differences were found in all motor scores except anaerobic capacity (p &lt;0.05). In all sport activities done in hot environment, higher efficiency is obtained compared to those done in cold environment and therefore, performances of athletes increase depending on the environment temperature.",

The self-administered CSIS consists of directions followed by two scenarios. The student reads each scenario, decides how he or she would react to the situation, and rates each of the coping strategies on a scale of 0 to 9 as &quot;not at all characteristic&quot; or &quot;characteristic&quot; of himself or herself. The first scenario addresses study coping skills, and the second addresses test-taking coping skills. The CSIS was piloted on two undergraduate introductory statistics classes in the College of Education at the University of Alabama in the fall of 1988. A total of 45 students (5 males and 40 females), representing 20  different majors, took the inventory. The CSIS was administered during the last class meeting before the fall semester final exam and again (in a slightly modified form) before the first exam of the spring semester. Factor analysis indicated that the CSIS has reliability, demonstrates evidence of validity, and is appropriate for its stated use. The CSIS is provided. (TJH)",

        "description":"In some testing programs an early item analysis is performed before final scoring in order to validate the intended keys. As a result, some items which are flawed and do not discriminate well may be keyed so as to give credit to examinees no matter which answer was chosen. This is referred to as allkeying. This research examined how varying the numbers of allkeyed items affects the equating function and resulting equated scores. The experimental conditions consisted of allkeying 0, 4, 10, and 25 items. The examination was a 200-item multiple choice licensing examination. Over 3,500 examinee records were studied. The results showed virtually no differences in scaled score means across the experimental conditions. Although the equating procedures compensated for the changes that  occurred as more items were allkeyed, the effect of allkeying on an individual's scaled score will depend on the individual's performance on the allkeyed items. The results suggest that an item should not be allkeyed unless it is clear that there is no defensible answer among the options. (Author/GDC)",

The Parent-Infant Project is a cooperative, multidisciplinary program with a network and linkage system which connects many disciplines and agencies. The project provides periodic assessments of  children's growth in the developmental skill areas of cognition, perception, motility, language/communication, self-help, and physical and social behavior.

The model generated the following hypotheses: (1) emotional commercials will more likely be recalled than nonemotional commercials; (2) the stronger the emotion experienced by the viewer, the more likely the recall; and (3) types of details remembered will differ for emotional and nonemotional commercials. To test these hypotheses, 20 commercials were categorized as depicting neutral, postive, negative, or poignant (positive and negative) emotions. Sixty-five college students viewed the comercials, and continually registered their feelings on a dial ranging from  100 (very positive) through 50 (neutral) to 0 (very negative). After viewing the 20 commercials, subjects were asked to write down as much as they could remember about each commercial. The results indicated that there are differences in the memory strength of episodic traces for emotional and nonemotional commercial messages and even differences reflecting the relative intensity of emotional response. In addition, some semantic processing (for example, judgment and evaluation) was shown to be affected by the emotionally enhanced episodic trace. (HTH)",

Political information in the form of national and international political issues were scaled multidimensionally among four political interest/media reliant groups. Each respondent was asked how related two issues were by assigning to each dyad a score from 0-100. Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis of the data showed that newspaper reliance, whether of higher or lower interest, was associated with a  more developed understanding of political information. It also provided evidence that only when television reliance is combined with lower levels of political interest is there a demonstrable difference in the cognitive space allocated to at least some political issues. The findings suggested that reliance, across levels of political interest, has meaning. Further, that television does not necessarily impede the ability to access and use political information.

        "description":"This paper presents a brief review of Ising&apos;s work done in 1925 for one dimensional spin chain with periodic boundary condition. Ising observed that no phase transition occurred at finite temperature in one dimension. He erroneously generalized his views in higher dimensions but that was not true. In 1941 Kramer and Wannier obtained quantitative result for two-dimensional Ising model and successfully deduced the critical temperature of the system. In 1944 Onsager explicitly obtained free energy in zero fields. Though only 1 dimensional formula has been derived in this review paper but Monte Carlo simulations results verify the established part of experiment and theory and explore the temperature dependence of magnetic property of thin film in 2D case. The paramagnetic case with spin coupling coefficient J = 0 and ferromagnetic cases with J = 0.50, 0.75 &amp; 1.0 are studied at temperatures kT = 0.20, 0.30, 0.40, 0.50, 0.60, 1.0, 1.5 &amp; 2.0. The change in behavior from Ferro to para is also observed and explained at high T values. I have demonstrated data writing for application purpose by writing number 10 on a thin ferromagnetic tape (i.e. 2D film).",

We use a complete dataset covering 44 countries over the period 1990-2010. It comprises the following: education index, the ratio of girls to boys in primary and secondary education, income per capita, human development index, life expectancy at birth, population in the 0-14 and 15-64 age intervals, population over 64, number of seats held by women in parliaments, and female labor force ratio. We interpret this dataset using panel regression analysis, with the human development index as the depend ent variable. The variables are also subject to factor analysis and this results in three statistically significant factors--education and development, female labor force ratio, and population. We examine the rankings of factor scores for the countries covered and relevant to the issues in question. We then interpret their consequences. The countries are ranked using factor analysis and the results of the fixed effects model, which studies the changes that occurred between 1990 and 2010.",

The study is informed by two curriculum frameworks: The Australian Early Years Learning Framework (EYLF) and the Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Framework [(VEYLDF) (0-8 years)]. These documents support a whole school approach to early childhood inclusive education and professional relationship with families to achieve common outcomes for all children in Australia. The findings point to marginalized identities which are induced by capital, field and habitus differentials, and have resulted in putting astray the achievement of successful early childhood inclusive education for the children of these families. We concluded with a call for teacher educators to engage preservice educators in what Freire called an &quot;epistemological curiosity&quot; to help them reconstruct their profession to facilitate the empowerment and development of all children and their families.",

        "description":"Interaction plays a critical role in the learning process. For online course participants, interaction with the course content (learner-content interaction) is especially important because it can contribute to successful learning outcomes and course completion. This study aims to examine the relationship between learner-content interaction and course grade to determine if this interaction type is a contributing success factor. Data related to student interaction with course content, including time spent reviewing online course materials, such as module PowerPoint presentations and course videos and time spent completing weekly quizzes, were collected for students in three sections of an online course (N = 139). The data were then correlated against grades achieved in the course to determine if there was any relationship. Findings indicate statistically significant relationships between the amount of time the learner spent with the content and weekly quiz grades (r = 0.-72). The study concludes that learners who spent more time interacting with course content achieve higher grades than those who spent less time with the content. (Contains 4 tables.)",

        "description":"Holistic integrated early childhood policies foster child well-being in the first 3 years of life. The normative framing of Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) entrenches segmentation and creates artificial divides between education and health. This segmentation persists yet development processes for children are intertwined and mutually reinforcing. We trouble this artificial divide by drawing on findings from a study which examined the discursive care spaces in an urban poor locale in Kenya. Data were produced through in-depth interviews; participant observation and focus group discussions with caregivers and both state and non-state care providers. Using a socio-ecological lens to analyse intra- and inter-household interactions among caregivers, our analysis exposes the assumptions and silences in ECCE health and education and presents caregivers' rich nuanced experiences and counter accounts. We conclude by calling for the imperative of bridging the divide between and within early childhood health and education to support integrated, adaptive and contextualised policy and practice.",

The objectives of this research are (1) to evaluate acoustical characteristics of the classroom (2) to assess acoustical perceptions of students with different educational backgrounds. The subjects of this study consisted of 54 science students and 53 art students. The control variable is the Percentage of Absorbing Surface (PAS) inside the classroom. The first procedure of experiment was to simulate a lecture speech from a sound generator, with the adjustment of the sound absorbing surface between five levels of PAS: 0, 7.5, 15f, 15b, and 30. Next, the participants were asked to complete a questionnaire to evaluate their auditory perception according to three main areas: loudness, clearness, perceived reverberation. Then, the results were compared with the outcome from a sound test device. The findings revealed that overall there was no difference between two groups of students in their auditory perceptions. However, when the results according to the different levels of PAS were thoroughly investigated, it was found that the science students rated their auditory perception of loudness and clearness higher than the art students who rated theirs when they were in the room with the PAS above 15%.",

Experimental data obtained over a large range of fixed conical pendulum lengths (0.435 m-2.130 m) are plotted with the theoretical lines and demonstrate excellent agreement. Two of the seven derived linearization equations were considered to be especially useful in terms of student understanding and relative mathematical simplicity. These linear analysis methods consistently gave an agreement of approximately 1.5% between the theoretical and experimental values for &quot;g&quot;, the acceleration due to gravity. An equation is derived theoretically (from two different starting equations), showing that the conical pendulum length &quot;L&quot; appropriate for a second pendulum can only occur within a defined limit: &quot;L&quot;=[&quot;g&quot; / (4 p[superscript 2])] . It is therefore possible to calculate the appropriate circular radius &quot;R&quot; or apex angle (0= ø = p /2) for any length &quot;L&quot; in the calculated limit, so that the conical pendulum will have a one second period.

Two studies will be presented. In the first study, 1095 preschool children completed a mathematics test (MARKO-D0) based on a 5-level model. The test fitted with a one-dimensional Rasch model. The extension of the model to a sixth level was verified in a new study: 312 first-graders took part in a mathematics test based on the six levels (MARKO-D1). In order to check whether the data of both samples adhered to the principle of unidimensionality, the data of MARKO-0 and MARKO-1 were used in a common analysis for comparative purposes. The applicability of these findings for a qualitative diagnostics and an adaptive training will be discussed.",

Children were observed at the McGill Daycare Centre twice a week for 8 weeks, totalling approximately 30 hours. Event sampling was used to record the frequency and duration of empathic behavioral interactions, defined as the presence (or absence) of a prosocial response to a peer's display of one of four categories of emotion (e.g., comforting responses, participation, etc., in response to peer's observed emotional state of happy, sad, angry, or afraid). Midway through the observation period, role-taking tasks were individually administered. These included measures of  perceptual-cognitive and affective role-taking skills. At the end of the 8 week period an experimental task was administered in which children could privately donate from 0 to 10 pennies to an unknown child. Results provide information (1) describing the frequency and duration of various kinds of emotional behaviors and the responses to them in a naturalistic setting, and (2) intercorrelating the various cognitive, naturalistic, and experimental measures of empathy.

The studies focused on noun-noun ambiguities, e.g. &quot;straw&quot; and &quot;organ.&quot; The experiments utilized a variable stimulus onset asynchrony priming paradigm in which an auditory stimulus is followed at a variable interval (either 0 or 200 milliseconds) by a target word related to one meaning of the ambiguous word. For example, &quot;Although the farmer bought the straw...&quot; would be followed by &quot;hay&quot; or &quot;sip.&quot; In the first experiment, with ambiguous words appearing in contexts that did not favor either reading, subjects accessed multiple readings or meanings at one millisecond but retained only a single reading 200 milliseconds later. In the second experiment, with  ambiguous words appearing in contexts that provided semantic information relevant to only one reading, listeners accessed only a single reading at both stimulus onsets. The results suggest that selective access will occur for this class of ambiguous words when a word in the context primes one reading of a subsequent ambiguous word. (Author/MKM)",

A 5-option multiple-choice examination was constructed, least attractive distractors were eliminated based on the instructor's judgment, and the resulting three forms of the examination (i.e. 3-, 4-, or 5-choice question form) were randomly assigned to quiz sections with similar mean cumulative grade point averages. Students were later grouped into high (3.6-4.0), average (3.1-3.5), and low (0-3.0) ability levels based on their final course grades in French where B=3.0 and A=4.0. A Kuder-Richardson 20 reliability coefficient was computed for each test form for each ability group and adjusted by the Spearman-Brown formula. Differences among  reliabilities for the three forms were: (1) significant at alpha=.05 for the low ability group; (2) not significant for the high ability group; and (3) significant at alpha=.10 for the average ability group. The ability groups were combined and differences among reliabilities for the three forms were significant at alpha=.05. The optimal number of alternatives for all ability groups combined was four.

Parent involvement included employment in the program, school visits, home visits by school personnel, group meetings, and incidental contacts such as telephone calls. Degree of involvement ranged from 0 to 200 hours. Three kinds of cognitive development were examined: (1) general reasoning, measured by the Walker Readiness Test for Disadvangated Children; (2) school related knowledge and skills, measured by the Cooperative Preschool Inventory; and (3) knowledge of verbal concepts, measured by the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. Results showed that parent involvement had a  favorable effect on all three kinds of cognitive development. The effects were found regardless of the child's age, mother's education, or family income. For general reasoning and school related knowledge and skills, the effects were also found, regardless of the child's score on the same test at the beginning of prekindergarten. For knowledge of verbal concepts, however, the effect of parent involvement tended to be greater for children who were initially lowest in knowledge of verbal concepts. (Author/SS)",

The booklet lists goals of sharing centers for parents and children and considers such planning aspects as location, time, setup procedures, and activity scheduling. Twelve basic concepts for working with children under 3 years, including child proofing the environment and expecting physical interaction among the children, are set forth. Following a brief discussion of program evaluation, the booklet  describes activities and objectives in four classifications: gross motor, fine motor, sensory, and cognitive. Another section contains suggested combinations of activities for sharing centers held in homes, outdoors, or in churches or community buildings.

In the first group were those whose birthdates fell from 1924-1947, and in the second group were those with birthdates in 1950 to 1951. A grade index (GI) was computed by averaging the T scores for the School and College Ability Test (SCAT) total and high school ranks (HSR). A Pearson Product Moment correlation was used to test for correlations between the GI and GPA for each group and to test for correlations between predicted and actual GPA  for each group. The results indicated that the mean of obtained GPA's for the older group was 2.67 as compared with 2.22 for the younger group, with near identical GI's. For the older group, the correlation between GPA and GI was significantly different from 0. This was not true for the younger women.

Results showed that white listeners' speech recognition was significantly poorer for black speakers than for white speakers, while black listeners scoring white speakers equalled black listeners scoring black  speakers. Overall black listener speech recognition was significantly superior to that of overall white listener speech recognition. It was concluded that since inexperienced white student teachers manifested severe speech recognition problems with black children, structured auditory training for white teachers may be fruitful.

        "description":"This paper describes three experiments related to differences in discrimination learning. In Experiment 1, sixth-grade subjects were required to judge the situational frequency of items which had occurred from 0 to 4 times on a study list. For one group the study list consisted of high-frequency words. Another group judged low-frequency words which were high in meaningfulness. A third group judged low-frequency words which were low in meaningfulness. A fourth group gave frequency judgments for nonsense items. Items were presented for study and test at a 5-second rate. The results supported the hypothesis that pre-experimental or background frequency differences in materials account for apparent frequency differences. In experiment 2, one group of sixth graders earned a 15-pair  verbal discrimination list consisting of low-frequency/high-meaning words. Another group learned pairs of low-frequency/low-meaning words. A third group learned high-frequency words. No significant differences were found. In experiment 3, groups of beginning fourth graders learned high-frequency and low-frequency words presented on a word list. The results indicated that background frequency is negatively related to discrimination learning. (WR)",

Because the IFI is concerned primarily with dimensions of interest to faculty, while CUES reflects aspects of campus life more important to students, these two measures are frequently used together to obtain a complete perspective. It may be disconcerting when the user finds that each employs a different scoring technique. The IFI is scored in the typical measurement fashion where each item answered in the keyed direction is scored &quot;1&quot; and those in a non-keyed direction are scored &quot;0.&quot; The scoring system for CUES is quite different; it utilizes the &quot;66+/33-&quot; method, a technique which takes into account only those items about which there is a  consensus of two-to-one or greater among the respondents. IFI data from the 37 institutions comprising the IFI normative group was rescored using the CUES method. The comparison of the two scoring techniques indicated that the two methods are practically identical in terms of the resulting institutional profiles. However, a variety of reasons are given for the retention of the traditional scoring method with IFI. (CK)",

In the first experiment, 98 subjects, ages 5 through 11, inductively identified four silhouetted pictures by removing, one at a time and in any sequence, as few covering pieces as possible. Results indicated that: (a) the ability to utilize incomplete information improved with increased age, but with a performance plateau between ages 8 and 11; and (b) the ability to expose information improved with age while the number of verbalized hypotheses remained relatively constant. In the second experiment, 120 subjects, ages 9 through 14, either utilized their own (Master) exposure sequence or followed (slaved) that of an age, sex, and IQ paired subject to  inductively identify six, 36-cell symmetrical patterns of X's and 0's. Deductive cell predictions improved with increased age and were similarly accurate for both subject groups. For pattern inductions, which also improved with increased age, slaved subjects generally hypothesized earlier, more often, and more correctly with less information than did master subjects. Results are analyzed from cognitive and developmental orientations, and implications are offered for research and educational practices. (Author)",

The three independent variables treated in the experiment were: 3, 6, and 9 foot-lambers (FL) illumination levels; four images, three static and one dynamic; and 26 fixation points positioned around a display from 0 to 120 in the horizontal axis and 60 to 90 up the vertical axis. Recorded measures in the factorial experiment consisted of: time to first observation of flicker, percentage of the total number of trials that flicker was observed, and the severity of flicker regarding its interference with a visual task. Conclusions drawn from the experiment were: 1) flicker will probably be encountered  at all illumination levels between 3 and 9 FL; 2) the most prominent flicker effects will be encountered when fixating at a point 30 from the source of illumination with flicker being observed out to 120 horizontally and to +90 /-60 vertically; 3) each individual is fairly consistent in his sensitivity to flicker.

The author determined, through investigating subjective experiences of an unselected population of 100 users of LSD type drugs and 20 users of cannabis drugs, that psychedelic drugs are mystical in their effect. The data were gathered by a questionnaire asking the respondent to compare his experiences under drugs with normal everyday experiences, ranking them in six degrees of intensity from &quot;0 no different from normal&quot; up to &quot;5 - beyond anything ever experienced or imagined.&quot; Findings indicate that category 5, the most intense rating, was the mode of distribution for users of LSD type drugs, with cannabis users not so  intense. All respondents rated positively at least some of the characteristics of profound religious experience. The findings suggest that the religion of the counter culture is not only a nonrational, pure experience of being but also rational in that interpretation of the experience builds a rational base, as in theology, for example. Although drugs may not be religious in themselves they can be a means of triggering a religious process. (SJM)",

Thirty-four librarians receive government publications from congressmen and 22 never receive them. Thirty-six librarians attended either workshops or classes on government publications.

The report describes significant new effects of violence on three groups of Sierra Leonean children, very few of whom have received any humanitarian assistance thus far: (1) those who have spent prolonged periods in forest &quot;bush camps&quot;; (2) unaccompanied adolescent girls who have been claimed by a variety of captors; and (3) young boys working in mining camps. The report also reviews two sets of problems besetting children in Sierra Leonean refugee camps in Guinea: (1) difficulties arising from the high ratio of females to males in the camps; and (2) the United Nations  High Commissioner for Refugees' (UNHCR) role as the central agency for the protection and support of refugees. The report notes that the Women's Commission advocates investing in Sierra Leone's future by directing education, skills training, and small credit programming at the majority of Sierra Leone's citizens--its youth. The report also discusses several other Commission recommendations. (EV)",

Ninety-four percent of respondents had received information about HIV/AIDS at the secondary school level. The most frequently allocated amount of instructional time devoted to HIV/AIDS was 0 to 6 hours. The three most common venues for presenting HIV/AIDS information were health class (83 percent of respondents), other gatherings such as assemblies, and physical education class. Multiple instructional strategies were employed, with lecture, use of pamphlets, and films/videos most frequent. The sample, as a whole, exhibited qualitative and  quantitative characteristics that were consistent with or exceeded previously reported instructional data. HIV/AIDS knowledge was influenced by age, gender, place of residence, class rank, method of presentation, quantity of instructional time devoted to the topic, comprehensiveness of content, and other variables. Class rank and presentation of information in an instructional unit (series of lessons) appeared to be the best predictors of HIV/AIDS knowledge retention. (Contains 22 references.) (JDD)",

It also examined the importance of timing of family income, estimating models that related years of completed schooling to average levels of parental income in early childhood, early middle childhood, preadolescence, and adolescence. Data came from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), a longitudinal household survey. This study used sibling data on 1,364 families with children born between 1968-76 and present in the PSID between birth and age at least 20 years. The outcome measure, completed years of schooling, was examined when the child was age 20 years. The income  measure was the total pre-tax income of all family members, inflated to 1993 price levels. Results indicated that family income during early childhood positively impacted children's educational attainment. The magnitude of the effect suggested that a 2.7-fold increase in parental income when the child was age 0-4 years led to an increase of about half a year of schooling. Income during adolescence had a positive, but less robust, effect. (Contains 21 references.) (SM)",

In the classification, the focus is on developmental issues with dynamic processes, such as relationships and developmentally based conceptualizations of adaptive patterns of central importance. The diagnostic framework consists of five axes: Axis 1--primary classification (e.g., disorders of affect, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, sleeping and eating behavior disorders); Axis  2--relationship disorder classification (e.g., overinvolvement, underinvolvement, anger/hostility, abuse, sexual abuse); Axis 3--medical and developmental disorders and conditions; Axis 4--psychosocial stressors; and Axis 5--functional emotional developmental level.

Students' responses were scored using a holistic scoring rubric from 0 to 4. Analyses of generalizability and dependability revealed that the four forms achieved moderate levels of generalizability, although they varied by school. Analyses of data from subsets of the items on the forms suggested that acceptable levels of generalizability could be achieved by using items if items were well chosen. The choice of  subsets of the items did not affect the validity of the content coverage of the test. One U.S. school and one Japanese school showed more similarity than between two U.S. schools.

Second, tasks that measured similar types of knowledge would correlate strongly, and tasks that measured different types of knowledge would correlate weakly. We recruited and assessed four groups of participants including 46 experienced algebra teachers (2+ years experience), 17 novice algebra teachers (0-2 years experience), 10 teaching experts, and 13 subject matter experts. Results indicate one task differentiated among levels of expertise and measured several aspects of knowledge needed to teach algebra.

        "description":"This study examines the community-wide effects of two statewide early childhood policy initiatives in North Carolina. One initiative provides funding to improve the quality of child care services at the county level for all children between the ages of 0 to 5, and the other provides funding for preschool slots for disadvantaged four-year-olds. Differences across counties in the timing of the rollout and in the magnitude of the state financial investments per child provide the variation in programs needed to estimate their effects on schooling outcomes in third grade. We find robust positive effects of each program on third-grade test scores in both reading and math. These effects can best be explained by a combination of direct benefits for participants and spillover benefits for others. Our preferred models suggest that the combined average effects on test scores of investments in both programs at 2009 funding levels are equivalent to two to four months of instruction in grade 3.",

Since standards vary across states, the results of the various state assessments cannot be used to directly compare students' progress. However, by placing a state standard onto the NAEP scale, a common metric for all states, a NAEP equivalent score of that standard is produced, which can be compared across states. The 2017 edition of this report highlights the results of mapping state proficiency standards onto the NAEP scales using state assessment results from the 2016-17 school year and the 2017 NAEP assessments for public schools. The study focuses on the reading and mathematics standards that states set for grades 4 and 8. For each state, the report displays the NAEP equivalent scores with a range of 0 to 500.

        "description":"The normal-distribution-based likelihood ratio statistic T[subscript ml] = nF[subscript ml] is widely used for power analysis in structural Equation modeling (SEM). In such an analysis, power and sample size are computed by assuming that T[subscript ml] follows a central chi-square distribution under H[subscript 0] and a noncentral chi-square distribution under H[subscript a]. However, with either violation of normality or not a large enough sample size, both empirical and analytical results indicate that the chi-square distribution assumptions are not realistic and consequently methods of power analysis based on such assumptions are not valid. This article describes a Monte Carlo (MC) method for power analysis. A measure of effect size for characterizing the power property of different rescaled statistics is also provided. Robust methods are proposed to increase the power of T[subscript ml] and other statistics. Simulation results show that the MC method reliably controls Type I errors and robust estimation methods effectively increase the power, and their combination is thus recommended for conducting power analysis in SEM.",

To address these deficits, we interviewed 21 Black girls enrolled in a summer program in a mid-sized Southern city individually and in focus groups about their knowledge of Black women leaders and definitions of leadership. Using narrative analysis, we analyzed the individual and focus group interviews. Knowledge of Black female leaders ranged from 0 to 4 with the majority (11; 52%) listing 1. Definitions of leadership aligned with identity developmental questions of &quot;Who am I?&quot; and &quot;How do I fit in?&quot; Being a leader involved making positive life choices for staying on the right path, even if that path differed from their peers, and emphasized that leaders support other Black girls. Suggestions as well as a list of ten guiding questions to help researchers, policymakers and practitioners continue to support developing Black girl leaders in middle school are provided.

A task was adapted and used as a data collection tool. Clinical interviews were conducted with 20 primary school students from each grade level. Data were analyzed within the context of the analysis framework hierarchy of development for variability. The results showed that the highest number of students were at Level 1, followed by those who are at Level 0. It can also be seen that the numbers of the students who are at Level 3 and Level 4 are close to each other and smaller than the number of students at Level 1. In addition, it is seen that there is no 1st grade student at Level 4 and that the majority of the students at Level 3 and Level 4 are 3rd and 4th graders. One out of four students had difficulty in informal statistical inferences on the concept of variability. Informal statistical inferences on the concept of variability of three out of every four students, albeit at different levels, drew attention.",

Indeed, Hawai'i's citizens have long made young children and their education a high priority. The first steps were taken as early as 1894 when the Samuel N. and Mary Castle Foundation was created to promote high quality early education and care for children ages 0-5. In the same year, the Kindergarten and Children's Aid Association Preschools of Hawai'i was established to offer teacher training and free kindergarten to Hawai'i's children. Much thought, research, and collaborative work across public and private agencies, early education and care programs, parents, K-12 education, and higher education systems have brought Hawai'i to this point. The Good Beginnings Alliance Master Plan, presented in 1996, and the School Readiness Task Force Report of 2003 have both spelled out incremental steps and moved Hawai'i closer to providing a coherent early childhood system for families and children. In this article, the author reflects on lessons that have been learned from work to date and points to some directions for the future.",

It has also been recently recognized that early childhood interventions, particularly those that combine child-focused educational activities with parent-child relationship building, can positively influence children's readiness for school, particularly for those at-risk for poor developmental outcomes. Though early childhood services have traditionally received fewer resources than those for school-aged children or adults, many states have tried to address this inequity by sponsoring early childhood initiatives aimed at providing comprehensive health and social services to children ages 0 to 5 and their families. The current article presents an overview of one such initiative--California's &quot;First 5&quot;--and provides three Southern California case studies of how it is being implemented at the county level. Implications for policy makers, school psychologists, and other educational stakeholders are discussed. (Contains 2 figures and 2 footnotes.)",

Experiment 1 involved a symmetrical choice arrangement in which the children could earn points exchangeable for rewards contingent on correct math problem completion. Points were delivered according to signaled variable-interval schedules at each workstation. For 2 children, relative rates of problem completion appeared to have been controlled by the schedule requirements in effect and matched relative rates of reinforcement, with sensitivity values near 1 and bias values near 0. Experiment 2 involved increasing the difficulty of math problems at one of the workstations. Sensitivity values for all 3 participants were near 1, but a substantial increase in bias toward the easier math problems was observed. This bias was possibly associated with responding at the more difficult workstation coming under stimulus control rather than schedule control. (Contains 6 figures and 1 table.)",

        "description":"Item factor analysis (IFA), also known as Multidimensional Item Response Theory (MIRT), is a general framework for specifying the functional relationship between a respondent's multiple latent traits and their response to assessment items. The key element in MIRT is the relationship between the items and the latent traits, so-called item factor loading structure. The correct specification of this loading structure is crucial for accurate calibration of item parameters and recovery of individual latent traits. This paper proposes a regularized Gaussian Variational Expectation Maximization (GVEM) algorithm to efficiently infer item factor loading structure directly from data. The main idea is to impose an adaptive L[subscript 1]-type penalty to the variational lower bound of the likelihood to shrink certain loadings to 0. This new algorithm takes advantage of the computational efficiency of GVEM algorithm and is suitable for high-dimensional MIRT applications. Simulation studies show that the proposed method accurately recovers the loading structure and is computationally efficient. The new method is also illustrated using the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) mathematics and science assessment data.

ITSs for literacy instruction commonly assess typed responses using Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms. One step in this direction often requires building a scoring mechanism that matches human judgments. This paper describes the challenges encountered while implementing an automated evaluation workflow and adopting solutions for increasing performance of the tutoring system. The algorithm described here comprises multiple stages, including initial pre-processing, a rule-based system for pre-classifying self-explanations, followed by classification using a Support Virtual Machine (SVM) learning algorithm. The SVM model hyper-parameters were optimized using grid search approach with 4,109 different self-explanations scored 0 to 3 (i.e., poor to great). The accuracy achieved for the model was 59% (adjacent accuracy = 97%; Kappa = 0.43).

        "description":"Job automation is a topical issue in a technology-driven labor market. However, greater amounts of human capital (e.g., often measured by education, and information-processing skills, including adult literacy) are linked with job security. A knowledgeable and skilled labor force better resists unemployment and/or rebounds from job disruption brought on by job automation. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to advance understanding of the association between educational attainment and literacy, and job automation risk. Using the 2012/2014/2017 Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) data, survey-weighted linear regression was used to model the risk of job automation as a function of education, and literacy proficiency. Higher educational attainment (college or higher vs. less than high school: b = -18.23, p &lt; 0.05) and greater literacy proficiency (score 0-500 points: b = -0.038, p &lt; 0.05) were associated with a decrease in job automation risk among the U.S. workforce.

        "description":"This phenomenographic case study attempted to determine the alternative and misconceptions of learners in selected concepts in Physics. The research adds another dimension to understanding alternative conception in kinematics by qualitatively determining how learners describe/define a distance of 0m, a displacement of 0m, a speed of 0m/s, a velocity of 0m/s as well as an acceleration of 0m/ss. Data were gathered by means of a free response test. Senior high school grade 12 learners were purposefully selected to complete the test. Data were analyzed by qualitatively interrogating the descriptions and related graphs and pictures to look for the ways in which learners described these concepts. The research revealed that some learners were not able to comprehend the meaning of a displacement of 0m, thus they experienced challenges in the understanding of the concepts such as a speed of 0m/s, a velocity 0m/s and an acceleration 0m/ss. The data seems to suggest that learners fail to formalise and contextualise &quot;0&quot; as a concept in kinematics.",

This article reviews how local education agencies (LEAs) allocated their state-issued funding to improve MLL language programs and increase student outcomes. Findings reveal that of the total state-issued MLL funding, LEAs used 88.7% on teacher salaries and benefits, 5.1% on teacher professional development, 4.9% on language program implementation, 0% on language program evaluation, and a small percentage of funding remained unspecified. Collectively, these findings indicate that LEAs did not adhere to the state's funding policies, nor did the state follow their own policies to regulate the LEAs' expenditures. We close with a discussion on how the state can improve their function as an organizational leader and serve as a model for other stakeholders in the shared obligation of the education of MLLs.",

        "description":"Purpose: This study aims to investigate the effects of dysphonic voice on speech intelligibility in Cantonese-speaking adults. Method: Speech recordings from three speakers with dysphonia secondary to phonotrauma and three speakers with healthy voices were presented to 30 healthy listeners (15 men and 15 women; M[subscript age] = 22.7 years) under six noise conditions (signal-to-noise ratio [SNR] -10, SNR -5, SNR 0, SNR +5, SNR +10) and quiet conditions. The speech recordings were composed of sentences with five different lengths: five syllables, eight syllables, 10 syllables, 12 syllables, and 15 syllables. The effects of speaker's voice quality, background noise condition, and sentence length on speech intelligibility were examined. Speech intelligibility scores were calculated based on the listener's correct judgment of the number of syllables heard as a percentage of the total syllables in each stimulus. Results: Dysphonic voices, as compared to healthy voices, were significantly more affected by background noise. Speech presented with dysphonic voices was significantly less intelligible than speech presented with healthy voices under unfavorable SNR conditions (SNR -10, SNR -5, and SNR 0 conditions). However, there was no sufficient evidence to suggest effects of sentence length on intelligibility, regardless of the speaker's voice quality or the level of background noise. Conclusions: This study provides empirical data on the impacts of dysphonic voice on speech intelligibility in Cantonese speakers. The findings highlight the importance of educating the public about the impacts of voice quality and background noise on speech intelligibility and the potential of compensatory strategies that specifically address these barriers.",

        "description":"We investigated the dimensionality of various indicators of reading prosody, and the relations of word reading and listening comprehension to the identified dimension(s) of reading prosody, using longitudinal data from Grades 1 to 3. A total of 371 English-speaking children were assessed on oral text reading, word reading, and listening comprehension in the fall and spring of each year (i.e., 6 waves of data). From oral text reading, reading prosody was evaluated on pause structures (pause duration, pause frequency) and pitch (intonation contour, F[subscript 0] change) using spectrographic analysis, and on expressiveness, smoothness, phrasing, and pacing using the Multi-Dimensional Fluency Scale (MFS). A bifactor structure described the data best across the 6 waves, composed of (a) a ratings and pause &quot;general&quot; factor, which captured common variance among MFS, pause frequency, and pause duration; (b) ratings (MFS) and pause &quot;specific&quot; factors, which captured variance over and above the ratings and pause general factor; and (c) a separate pitch factor, which captured variance in intonation contour and F[subscript 0] change. Word reading and listening comprehension were related to the identified dimensions of reading prosody, but when they were in a model together, word reading, not listening comprehension, was uniquely related to reading prosody across the six waves. These results indicate that reading prosody is multidimensional and that a pitch factor is a dissociable skill from the general ratings and pause prosody. Furthermore, word reading is the primary driver for the development of various dimensions of reading prosody, at least for children in primary grades.",

Nine childcare centers in London, Ontario, participated in this cluster, randomized controlled trial. Early Childhood Educators allocated to the experimental group, from five childcare centers in London, Ontario, implemented the policy for young children (18 months to 4 years) for 8 weeks and documented adherence to each policy item (i.e., dose) in daily logs. Program evaluation surveys (n = 21) and interviews (n = 10) were completed postintervention to assess Early Childhood Educators' perspectives of feasibility, context, enjoyment, communication between researchers and childcare staff, and likelihood of future implementation. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and thematic analysis was conducted. Adherence to policy items ranged from 16.5% (for delivery of shorter, more frequent outdoor periods) to 85.9% (for delivery of unstructured/child-directed play). Participants reported effective communication between the research team and childcare centers (0 = &quot;not at all effective&quot; to 5 = &quot;very effective&quot;; M = 4.20; SD = 0.83) but noted that they were unlikely to continue the implementation of more frequent outdoor periods (0 = &quot;not at all likely&quot; to 5 = &quot;extremely likely&quot;; M = 2.19; SD = 1.21). Interview themes included weather as a prominent barrier and the use of verbal prompts as a solution for implementing the policy. As this was a small and short-term intervention, this pilot study offers important insight on larger scale policy interventions aimed at increasing physical activity and minimizing sedentary time among children enrolled in childcare.",

        "description":"Purpose: Graduated compressive stockings (GCS) have been suggested to influence performance by reducing muscle oscillations and improving muscle function and efficiency. However, no study to date has analyzed the influence of GCS on muscle activity during running. The objective of the study was to analyze the influence of GCS on the perception of comfort and muscle activation of the main muscles of the lower leg during running. Method: Thirty-six participants ran on a treadmill with (GCS) or without (control) GCS. The running tests consisted of a 10-min warm-up followed by a 20-min intense run at 75% of the athlete's maximal aerobic speed. Surface electromyography of the tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, gastrocnemius lateralis (GL), and gastrocnemius medialis (GM) were recorded every 5 min during the run and analyzed using a non-linearly scaled wavelet analysis. Perception of comfort of the GCS was measured before and after the run. Results: The GCS were reported as comfortable garments and reduced GL activity at Minute 0 (p &lt; 0.05, ?[superscript 2][subscript p] = 0.245) and Minute 5 (p &lt; 0.05, ?[superscript 2][subscript p] = 0.326) and GM activity at Minute 0 (p &lt; 0.05, ?[superscript 2][subscript p] = 0.233) compared with running without garments, but their effect was temporary and disappeared after 5 min of running. Conclusion: Even though GCS reduced gastrocnemius muscle activity during the initial minutes of running, it is hypothesized that the GCS could have lost their initial levels of compression after some minutes of exercise, thereby reducing their influence on muscle activation. However, this hypothesis needs to be further investigated.",

The purpose of this article is to characterize the nutrition and physical activity (PA) practices, including implementation difficulty and barriers, of licensed center- and family home-based ECE programs serving 2- to 5-year-old children in Minnesota (MN) and Wisconsin (WI). Method: A stratified random sampling procedure was used to select representative cross sections of licensed ECE providers in MN and WI. A total of 2,000 providers (1,000 center-based, 1,000 family home-based) were randomly selected and invited to respond to a 97-item survey with questions representing (1) nutrition and PA practices, (2) barriers to meeting nutrition and PA best practices, and (3) written and implemented nutrition and PA policies. Summated scales were constructed for nutrition-related (range 0-15; Cronbach's a = 0.86) and for PA-related best practices (range 0-10; Cronbach's a = 0.82). Results: A total of 823 providers returned surveys between August 2010 and March 2011, resulting in a 44% bistate participation rate. Across all programs an average (SD) of 7.0 (4.1) nutrition best practices were already implemented. Center-based providers reported on average 0.8 additional nutrition best practice (7.4 vs. 6.6, p = 0.01). Across all programs an average (SD) of 5.2 (3.1) PA best practices were already implemented. Center-based providers reported on average one more PA best practice (5.3 vs. 4.3, p &lt; 0.01). The cost of healthy food and the weather were identified as barriers by 80% of providers, regardless of program type.",

The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of an innovative approach whereby the whole wheat content of bread products in school lunches was gradually increased to increase whole grain intake by children. Methods: A convenience sample included children in K-6th grade from two elementary schools in a Midwestern city. Whole red and white wheat flour content of buns and rolls served twice weekly was increased from 0% to 91% in 16 and 7 incremental levels, respectively over the school year. Red wheat products were served in one school and white wheat products in the other. Plate waste methods were used on a whole school basis to estimate consumption. ANOVA procedures were used to determine whether whole grain and modified bread product intake differed by level of whole wheat flour and menu entrée category. Results: Mean consumption of whole grain (g/child) increased as the level of red and white whole wheat flour increased in modified bread products. Consumption of modified bread products did not differ statistically from baseline (0% whole grain flour) until the 72% level for red and 67.5% level for white wheat was served. Consumption of buns and rolls varied with type of accompanying menu items regardless of wheat type or level. Application to Child Nutrition Professionals: A gradual increase in whole wheat content in menu items resulted in favorable whole grain consumption by children. This approach may allow school foodservice directors to gradually introduce acceptable whole grain products into school menus.",

        "description":"Multiple-choice-questions are common in medical examinations, but guessing biases assessment results. Confidence-based-testing (CBT) integrates indicated confidence levels. It has been suggested that correctness of and confidence in an answer together indicate knowledge levels thus determining the quality of a resulting decision. We used a CBT approach to investigate whether decision quality improves during undergraduate medical education. 3rd- and 5th-year students attended formative multiple-choice exams on pharmacological issues. Students were asked to indicate their confidence in a given answer. Correctness of answers was scored binary (1-correct; 0-wrong) and confidence levels were transformed to an ordinal scale (guess: 0; rather unsure: 0.33; rather sure: 0.66; very sure: 1). 5th-year students gave more correct answers (73 ± 16 vs. 49 ± 13%, p &lt; 0.05) and were on average more confident regarding the correctness of their answers (0.61 ± 0.18 vs. 0.46 ± 0.13, p &lt; 0.05). Correlation of these parameters was stronger for 5th-year students (r = 0.81 vs. r = 0.52), but agreement of confidence and correctness (&quot;centration&quot;) was lower. By combining the Bland-and-Altman approach with categories of decision-quality we found that 5th-year students were more likely to be &quot;well-informed&quot; (41 vs. 5%), while more 3rd-students were &quot;uninformed&quot; (24 vs. 76%). Despite a good correlation of exam results and confidence in given answers increased knowledge might be accompanied by a more critical view at the own abilities. Combining the statistical Bland-and-Altman analysis with a theoretical approach to decision-quality, more advanced students are expected to apply correct beliefs, while their younger fellows are rather at risk to hesitate or to act amiss.",

        "description":"Purpose: Working memory capacity and language ability modulate speech reception; however, the respective roles of peripheral and cognitive processing are unclear. The contribution of individual differences in these abilities to utilization of spatial cues when separating speech from informational and energetic masking backgrounds in children has not yet been determined. Therefore, this study explored whether speech reception in children is modulated by environmental factors, such as the type of background noise and spatial configuration of target and noise sources, and individual differences in the cognitive and linguistic abilities of listeners. Method: Speech reception thresholds were assessed in 39 children aged 5-7 years in simulated school listening environments. Speech reception thresholds of target sentences spoken by an adult male consisting of number and color combinations were measured using an adaptive procedure, with speech-shaped white noise and single-talker backgrounds that were either collocated (target and back-ground at 0°) or spatially separated (target at 0°, background noise at 90° to the right). Spatial release from masking was assessed alongside memory span and expressive language. Results and Conclusion: Significant main effect results showed that speech reception thresholds were highest for informational maskers and collocated conditions. Significant interactions indicated that individual differences in memory span and language ability were related to spatial release from masking advantages. Specifically, individual differences in memory span and language were related to the utilization of spatial cues in separated conditions. Language differences were related to auditory stream segregation abilities in collocated conditions that lack helpful spatial cues, pointing to the utilization of language processes to make up for losses in spatial information.",

        "author":["Caglayan, Günhan"],
        "description":"The purpose of this research study was to understand how linear algebra students in a university in the United States make sense of subspaces of vector spaces in a series of in-depth qualitative interviews in a technology-assisted learning environment. Fourteen mathematics majors came up with a diversity of innovative and creative ways in which they coordinated visual and analytic approaches in the exploration of subspaces of a number of vector spaces such as R[superscript n], R[superscript n x n], P[subscript n] and C[R]. In the demonstration of the closure property, the research participants embraced three different approaches in expressing the linear combination of u and v: (i) u + v [type I notation]; (ii) cu + v [type II notation]; and (iii) cu + dv [type III notation]. Although the majority of the students embraced type I notation at the beginning; there was a considerable shift towards type II notation towards the end of the study. Although students' visualizations on the DGS appeared at times to be in agreement with the vector sum notation analytically embraced, students still most of the time utilized the type I notation in their visualizations. The role of the zero vector manifested itself in three main categories: (i) to show nonemptiness of a subspace; (ii) to show the failure of closure property of a nonsubspace [e.g., u, v \\in W, but u + t = 0 \\notin W; (iii) to show nonsubspaceness by showing that 0 \\notin W. The zero vector seemed to be emphasized both within the visual approach and the analytic approach. Moreover, the visual approach did not prove necessary except for the nonsubspace explorations of certain cases. The paper concludes by offering pedagogical implications along with implications for the mathematics teaching profession and recommendations for further research.",

        "description":"Purpose: Despite the apparent primacy of syntactic deficits, children with developmental language disorder (DLD) often also evidence lexical impairments. In particular, it has been argued that this population have difficulty forming lexical representations that are detailed enough to support effective spoken word processing. In order to better understand this deficit, a meta-analysis of studies testing children with DLD in the auditory lexical decision task was conducted. The objective was to provide summary effect size estimates for accuracy and response time measures for comparisons to age- and language-matched control groups. Method: Two thousand three hundred seventy-two records were initially identified through electronic searches and expert consultation, with this cohort reduced to 9 through duplicate removal and the application of eligibility and quality criteria. The final study cohort included 499 children aged 3;8-11;4 (years;months). Results: Multivariate analysis suggests that children with DLD were significantly less accurate in the auditory lexical decision task than age-matched controls. For the response time estimate, however, confidence intervals for the same group comparison crossed 0, suggesting no reliable difference between groups. Confidence intervals also crossed 0 for language-matched control estimates for both accuracy and response time, suggesting no reliable difference between groups on either measure. Conclusion: Results broadly support the hypothesis that children with DLD have difficulty in forming detailed lexical representations relative to age- though not language-matched peers. However, further work is required to determine the performance profiles of potential subgroups and the impact of manipulating different lexical characteristics, such as the position and degree of nonword error, phonotactic probability, and semantic network size.",

        "description":"An Indiana 310 Project was conducted to determine the needs of very low level adult basic education students (0-4th grade). Specifically, the study sought to answer the following four questions: (1) What brings low academic level students into ABE programs? (2) What aspects of the ABE programs do low academic level students dislike? (3) Why do low academic level students drop out of ABE programs? and (4) What major benefits do low academic level students derive participating in an ABE program? Data were collected from 184 1979-80 school year, low academic level dropouts of the Northwest Indiana Adult Learning Centers through personal or telephone interviews. From the data gathered, it appears that most students were primarily attracted to the ABE program through radio or  newspaper advertising, flyers, or through another person who had heard of the programs through these means. Although most students could not think of aspects of the program they disliked, a few complaints about teachers, books, transportation, and Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) were heard. Most of the students who had dropped out did so for reasons beyond the teachers' control. Other reasons included inadequate transportation, lack of child care, impatient teachers, inconvenient hours, CETA pay, and books too easy or too hard. Nearly all the students gained an awareness of what an Adult Learning Center offers and plan to attend again; benefits gained by a few included better jobs, registerinq to vote, better reading skills, and better money manaqement skills. It was  recommended that the ABE program continue its present programs and advertising, but work to maximize teacher behavior of giving clear and simple explanations as the best methods of retaining low academic level students.

The study compared the accuracy of students&apos; abilities, before and after a treatment, in the pedagogy of rote learning. The posttest t-test revealed a decline in accuracy. The findings suggested students relied on technology and showed no improvement with the use of rote for retaining correctly spelled words and multiplication tables. The resulting information from the t-test showed no significant difference in multiplication and the use of technology to assist in problem solving. The results for the math t-test and the spelling t-test showed the p-value was less than the alpha 0.05 level, which resulted in the rejecting of the hypothesis. The t-test for math was 0 for the posttest and the pretest with technology. The t-test was 0.32 for the pretest in math without technology. The t-test for spelling was 0 for the posttest and the pretest t statistic without technology was 0.03 and 0.56 with technology. Results from the study considered the efficacy of students as a component to the learning process. The efficacy of students rose through the treatment, however though there was no significant improvement in accuracy through the posttest score results.

A sample of 860 faculty members from 11 institutions participated in the online Organizational Leadership Assessment (OLA) measuring the servant leadership dimensions of Values People, Develops People, Builds Community, Displays Authenticity, Provides Leadership, Shares Leadership, and the Overall score. An independent samples t test indicated that part-time faculty participants hold significantly higher perceptions of organizational leadership&apos;s alignment with the six dimensions and overall. A one-way analysis of variance measured differences in three ranges of years employed at the institution: 0 to 5 years; 6 to 15 years; and more than 15 years. The ANOVA indicated that perceptions for faculty with the fewest years of experience were significantly higher than those with the greatest number of years of experience for all six dimensions and overall. For some dimensions, faculty perceptions in the range of 0 to 5 years were significantly higher than those in the 6 to 15 years range. For some dimensions, perceptions in the 6 to 15 years range were significantly higher than those in the range of more than 15 years.

The samples were made up of three professors and their corresponding student groups (students, n = 100, 34 and 53, respectively), each in a different teacher education programme. The results show that there was a high reliability correlation among SSG, PG and NFG in all three programmes. Furthermore, in these programmes, the grade differences were never higher than 1.5 on a scale of 0 to 10 points; in fact, agreement between DDG and PG was reached 96%, 35.29% and 43.39% of the time), and, when disagreement emerged, it was mainly within a minimum range of 0.1 to 0.5 points. As for the tendency of NFG versus SSG in each programme, slightly higher percentages were obtained for NFG greater than SSG in Programmes B and C, whereas the opposite (NFG less than SSG) was true in Programme A; overall, however, it could be said that both tendencies balanced each other out, being the total percentages in each programme 0%, 41% and 30% for NFG greater than SSG; and 4%, 23% and 26%, for NFG less than SSG, respectively.

        "description":"Two studies were conducted to evaluate short-latency vocal tract air pressure responses to sudden pressure bleeds during production of voiceless bilabial stop consonants. It was hypothesized that the occurrence of respiratory reflexes would be indicated by distinct patterns of responses as a function of bleed magnitude. In Study 1, 19 adults produced syllable trains of /pa/using a mouthpiece coupled to a computer-controlled perturbator. The device randomly created bleed apertures that ranged from 0 to 40 [mm.sup.2] during production of the 2nd or 4th syllable of an utterance. Although peak oral air pressure dropped in a linear manner across bleed apertures, it averaged 2 to 3 cm [H.sub.2]0 at the largest bleed. While slope of oral pressure a(so decreased in a linear trend, duration of the oral pressure pulse remained relatively constant. The patterns suggest that respiratory reflexes, if present, have little effect on oral air pressure levels. In Study 2, both oral and subglottal air pressure responses were monitored in 2 adults while bleed apertures of 20 and 40 [mm.sup.2] were randomly created. For 1 participant, peak oral air pressure dropped across bleed apertures, as in Study 1. Subglottal air pressure and slope, however, remained relatively stable. These patterns provide some support for the occurrence of respiratory reflexes to regulate subglottal air pressure. Overall, the studies indicate that the inherent physiologic processes of the respiratory system, which may involve reflexes, and passive aeromechanical resistance of the upper airway are capable of developing oral air pressure in the face of substantial pressure bleeds. Implications for understanding speech production and the characteristics of individuals with velopharyngeal dysfunction are discussed.KEY WORDS: stop consonants, oral air pressure, subglottal air pressure, respiratory reflexes, velopharyngeal dysfunction",

        "description":"The goal of the present study was to explore the emergence of verbal behavior resulting from the joint control of two antecedent stimuli that are presented together for the first time. Conditional discriminations were used for teaching and for probing. Four stimuli PI, P2, 0 1 , and 02 were samples and four stimuli Al, A2, BI, and B2 were the comparisons in all discriminations of the study. We taught 4 conditional discriminations with 1 sample and 2 comparisons in each trial; overall, each sample controlled selections of 2 comparison stimuli (i.e., sample PI controlled selections of Al in 1 conditional discrimination and controlled selections of BI in another conditional discrimination). In a probe with no reinforcement, 1 P and 1 O stimuli formed a compound sample, and the 4 comparisons appeared in each trial. Only selections of 1 comparison have been reinforced in the presence of the 2 sample stimuli during teaching (i.e., only selections of Al have been reinforced in the presence of PI, in 1 conditional discrimination, and in the presence of 0 1 , in the other conditional discrimination). We analyzed whether the 2 sample stimuli would jointly control comparison selections. In Study 1, 2 adult participants did not show the emergence of the discrimination with the compound samples. In Study 2, we modified the procedure of Study 1 in such a way that (a) a prompt procedure was used, (b) trials of the 4 single-sample conditional discriminations were gradually intermixed, and (c) the reinforcement was reduced. The 2 adult participants showed the emergence of the conditional discrimination with the compound samples. This study thus demonstrated the emergence of discriminations by joint control. These results have important consequences for the study of language. (Contains 5 figures and 2 tables.)",

        "description":"Prosodic abnormality is common in the dysarthria associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI), and adjustments of speaking rate and emphatic stress are often used as steps in treating the speech disorder in patients with TBI-induced dysarthria. However, studies to date do not present a clear and detailed picture of how speaking rate and emphatic stress are affected in this speech disorder. This study, based on the acoustic analyses of syllable repetitions and sentence speech samples, reports on speaking rate and emphatic stress for 12 subjects with TBI and 8 healthy controls. For speaking rate, the subjects with TBI had (1) both slow speaking and articulation rates, (2) smaller phonation proportion and larger pause proportion, and (3) larger percentage change in speaking rate and smaller percentage change in articulation rate. For emphatic stress, the subjects with TBI had (1) significant increases in the difference and percentage change between pre-stressed and pre-unstressed pause durations, (2) significantly smaller difference between stressed and unstressed word durations, but not the percentage change between stressed and unstressed word durations, and (3) significantly reduced differences in f\"0 movement and f\"0 slope between stressed and unstressed words, but not in RMS range. This study demonstrates the multidimensional nature of prosodic deficits in the dysarthria related to TBI and illustrates the ability of acoustic measures to give a picture of the dysprosody related to TBI-induced dysarthria. Learning outcomes:: As a result of this activity, the participant will be able to (1) describe the prosodic disturbances that have been reported in studies of dysarthria associated with TBI; (2) define acoustic measures appropriate to the analysis of changes in speaking rate and emphatic stress; and (3) discuss the importance of prosody to spoken communication.",

It was hypothesized that the BT condition would be superior to MAC at the end of acute treatment, and would also demonstrate durability of gains through the maintenance treatment phase. Method: A randomized controlled trial in which 24 youths were assigned to either a pilot-tested BT protocol, consisting of eight weekly sessions, or to MAC, consisting of three sessions and five telephone calls over 8 weeks. Independent evaluators assessed outcome at pretreatment (week 0) and post-treatment (week 8) for BT and MAC, and again at week 16 for BT patients only. The primary outcome measure was the National Institute of Mental Health Trichotillomania Severity Scale (NIMH-TSS). Results: For the BT condition, the week 8 mean NIMH-TSS score was significantly lower than that of the MAC condition. The BT condition's mean week 8 score was also significantly lower than their own mean week 0 score, whereas no such reductions were observed for the MAC condition. Upon completion of acute treatment at week 8, the BT group's gains were maintained through an 8-week maintenance treatment phase. Conclusions: BT produced a superior outcome compared with a condition that controlled for participation in a pediatric TTM research study, nonspecific therapist contact effects, repeated assessments, and the passage of time. Maintenance of gains after acute BT provides preliminary support for the durability of treatment gains.

Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of all autopsies carried out at the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Belgrade during a 15 year period between 1991 and 2005, focusing on homicide cases of victims aged 0-14 years. These were then analyzed in terms of number of deaths, mortality rates, age, and sex of the victim, relation to the perpetrator, and cause of death and injury. Results: Forty-six homicides were identified where the victims were aged 0-14 years. These included 24 girls and 22 boys. In 32 cases (69.6%) the perpetrator was one of the child's birth parents, more frequently the mother. Blunt head trauma was the most frequent cause of death, followed by exsanguination. In 9 cases (19.5%) there was evidence of physical abuse; 16 children died in the setting of multiple homicide and/or murder/suicide. In 4 cases (8.7%) there was evidence of neglect which contributed to the fatal outcome. There were 10 cases of neonaticide within the 46 homicides. There were, however, 49 further cases where bodies of newborn infants were discovered after having been disposed of in suspicious circumstances. Conclusions: Proportionally, the largest number of victims fell within the 1-4 years age group, with a slight preponderance of females, most of them killed at home by a close family member, usually the mother. Blunt head trauma was the single most frequent cause of death. Injury patterns consistent with child abuse were identified among 20% of the study group. (Contains 5 tables.)",

We investigated parents' perspectives on these domains and QoL for children and young adults with ID and hypothesized that parents' well-being would be a predictive factor in QoL of their children with ID. Methods: Our longitudinal study administered questionnaires to parents at T[subscript 0] (n = 147) and T1 (n = 108). The inclusion criteria were: (i) the child's age 0-24 years and (ii) the child's intellectual disability (IQ less than 70 or IQ less than 85 in combination with behavioural problems). Results: Social well-being of parents (P less than or equal to 0.001), changes in parents' social well-being (P less than or equal to 0.01) and changes in children's social well-being (P less than or equal to 0.05) were strong predictors of QoL for children with ID. Emotional well-being of children with ID (P less than or equal to 0.01), changes in children's emotional well-being (P less than or equal to 0.01) and changes in emotional well-being of parents (P less than or equal to 0.05) also predicted QoL of children with ID. Material well-being of parents, and health, development and activity of the children were not predictors. Conclusion: Our study revealed that predictors of QoL in children and young adults with ID occurred in the following domains: physical well-being (children), social well-being (parents and children) and emotional well-being (parents and children).",

Mental health outcome at 1 1/2 years was assessed by clinical and standardised measures including the Child Behavior Check List 1 1/2-5 (CBCL 1 1/2-5), Infant Toddler Symptom Check List (ITSCL), Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT), Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID II), Mannheim Eltern Interview (MEI), Parent Child Early Relational Assessment (PC ERA) and Parent Infant Relationship Global Assessment Scale (PIR-GAS), and disordered children were diagnosed according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and Diagnostic Classification Zero to Three (DC: 0-3). Results: Deviant language development in the first 10 months of life predicted the child having any disorder at 1 1/2 years, OR 3.3 (1.4-8.0).

        "description":"Background: Nearly 10% of students enrolled in US public schools are absent daily. Although previous research has shown associations of school absenteeism with participation in risk behaviors, it is unclear if these associations vary by whether the absence was excused. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations of health risk behaviors with being absent from school with and without permission among high school students. Methods: During spring 2004, questionnaires similar to the Youth Risk Behavior Survey questionnaire were completed by 4517 ninth- and eleventh-grade students. Responses to items assessing frequency of school absences during the past 30 days for any reason and without permission were combined to create a variable coded as absent on: 0 days; greater than or equal 1 day, all with permission (WP); and greater than or equal 1 day, at least 1 day without permission (WOP). Logistic regression analyses controlling for gender, grade, and race/ethnicity examined the association of risk behaviors with absenteeism. Results: Controlling for demographic variables, compared to students who were absent 0 days, students who were absent WP had significantly higher odds of engaging in 25 of 55 risk behaviors examined and students who were absent WOP had significantly higher odds of engaging in 43 of the 55 behaviors. Students who were absent WOP also had approximately twice the odds of engaging in risk behaviors compared to students who were absent WP.  Conclusions: School absenteeism, with and without permission, is associated with risk behaviors. Schools should recognize absenteeism for any reason as a warning sign for a variety of risk behaviors.

We analyzed data for the present study mainly from the Department of Statistics, Ministry of the Interiors, Taipei, Taiwan: &quot;Number of early intervention for children with developmental delays in Taiwan&quot; from 2003 through 2007. The reported number of children with developmental delays slightly increased from 13,231 to 14,250 (increase rate = 7.7%) from the year of 2003 through 2007 in Taiwan. More than one-half of children with developmental delays were reported during the age 3-5 years. Aged 0-2 group has the highest increasing reported numbers in the previous 5 years which changed dramatically increased from 4139 (31.3%) in 2003 to 6201 (43.5%) in 2007 (increase rate = 49.8%). The medical care setting was the main reported channel of the children with developmental delays and the results also showed that the reported prevalence of the aged 0-2 developmentally delayed children was 57.4-102.2 per 10,000 children; aged 3-5 was 79.0-105.1 per 10,000 children from the year 2003-2007 in Taiwan. The present concluded that early intervention based on the precise affected population would provide important supports for families of children with developmental delays. Therefore, the health care system should be strengthened to increase the proportion of children identified at the earlier age and to decrease the variability in the age at identification for most of the conditions of children with developmental delays.

        "description":"Cyberbullying is a serious problem, and research on associations between different types of interpersonal violence and cyberbullying victimization is limited. The purpose of this study was to examine how the frequency of physical dating violence (PDV), sexual dating violence (SDV), and forced sexual intercourse (FSI) is associated with cyberbullying, and whether sex modified these associations among a nationally representative sample of US youth. 2017 and 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) survey data from 14,655 students were used. Youth reported the frequency of PDV, SDV, and FSI in a self-administered questionnaire, with aggregate categories of 0 times, 1 time, 2-3 times, or 4 or more times. Cyberbullying was also self-reported using a single-item measure. Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the PDV, SDV, FSI-cyberbullying associations. Stratified analyses were used to determine if sex was an effect modifier of the PDV, SDV, and FSI-cyberbullying associations. Approximately 16% of students reported having been cyberbullied in the last 12 months. After adjustment, there was a statistically significant dose-response relationship between the frequency of SDV and cyberbullying (1 time: OR = 2.97, 95% CI: 2.30, 3.84; 2-3 times: OR = 3.53, 95% CI: 2.54, 4.93; [greater than or equal to] 4 times: OR = 4.46, 95% CI: 2.86, 6.95; referent 0 times). A similar dose-response relationship was observed for both PDV and FSI. Stratified analysis results suggest that sex may modify these associations. These results underscore the need to address youth dating violence as early as possible, with special attention to sex, as this may also prevent other types of victimization, like cyberbullying.",

        "description":"Despite the efforts from the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and from chemistry educators, misconceptions in the classroom and among professionals arise from the inherent complexity of chemical language and the remaining traces of the historical development of chemistry as a science. In order to improve the learning and understanding of chemistry, it is crucial to clearly define and contextualize the fundamental notions of chemistry. In a previous article, we proposed a new definition of molecule as a stable and electrically neutral chemical entity that exists with a finite number of chemical bonds (0 to n, with n being a finite integer number) (&quot;J. Chem. Educ. 2022, 99&quot; (8), 2999-3006). This new definition, which implies that isolated He, Ne, and Ar atoms can be considered as molecules with 0 bonds, was shown to be useful for our students and may help them overcome commonly described misconceptions. During this work, we noticed that the term &quot;compound&quot; maybe confusing since various texts give different definitions. Actually, there are four commonly accepted senses or meanings of the term &quot;compound&quot; that refer to different things within different scales and realms (abstract and material). Herein, we propose a way to overcome the misconceptions originating from the use of the word &quot;compound.&quot; In order to do this, we encourage the correct use of the terms &quot;substance&quot; and &quot;molecule&quot;, respectively, for macroscopic and microscopic objects and the use of the word &quot;compound&quot; to refer to a category of objects, and we discuss the possibility to introduce a new word, &quot;reticulum&quot;, for referring to chemical species that are not made of molecules.",

Using algebra, attempting to parametrize by means of rational functions of t, one discovers quickly that it is not the degree of f but the \"relative degree,\" that describes how difficult the computations become. When the relative degree is one, the parametrization technique is well-known (and quite simple). When it is two, solutions can still be directly computed using the quadratic formula.

Several strategies on how to help children attain their full emotional development are also suggested. One such effective strategy is for parents and caregivers to be sensitive to the individual needs of children and to be responsive to them during daily interactions as this supports their growing sense of self.

Remembering when to multiply by 5/9 or 9/5 and whether you have to add 32 or subtract 32 makes it fairly easy. Sometimes, though, fairly easy isn't easy enough. Students have trouble remembering the order of operations: \"Do I add or subtract 32, and is that before or after I multiply?\" Of course, knowing that 32[degrees] Fahrenheit is 0[degree] Celsius helps with remembering, but students don't always see it that way.

        "author":["DiGirolamo, Cara Masten"],
        "description":"This dissertation approaches the idea of lexical types such as word, clitic and affix from an oblique angle. Starting with Cardinaletti &amp; Starke's (1999) diagnostics for the Weak Pronoun, I deconstruct the category of clitic, breaking it down into two binary qualities: the syntactic primitive of being linked to a head of a different basic phrasal category, and the phonological primitive of being internal to the phonological word of the host. I argue that the syntactic behaviors of clitic-words, in particular pronominal clitic-words, are predictable if we assume that there is an operation that allows Xmin/max elements to fuse with X[superscript 0] nodes during a syntactic derivation. This creates a complex X[superscript 0] node that selects a clitic-type spell-out form. This fusion process--m-merge, adapted from Matushansky (2006)--is the same process that drives the incorporation part of head-movement. I also propose that the features identified as phonologically clitic-like--reduction, lack of a syllabic nucleus, no coordination and morphological simplicity--result from a similarity to inflectional affixes. Instead of arguing for a distinct clitic phonology I suggest that clitics---when they are simple feature bundles---and agreement affixes are functionally identical and therefore are likely to undergo spell-out in the same way, in particular by being realized internally to their hosts' phonological word, and being able to determine the shape of their host to a greater extent than we expect word-level phonological processes to allow. The evidence supporting these claims shows that many strange grammatical phenomena can be explained simply if we adopt the above principles. The operation m-merge--fusing an Xmin/max to an X[superscript 0] node--offers a straightforward account of the WH as C pattern in interrogative relatives in Middle Bavarian and Lake Constance Alemannic. Considering how my model affects the diachronic trajectory of word-to-clitic-to-affix and adopting a restricted version of Roberts (2010) Move via Agree provides insight into the behavior of French subject pronouns in Old French, Standard French, and Contemporary Colloquial French. Most dramatically, my model offers a straightforward analysis for eight highly distinct types of phi marking in Middle Welsh, even to the point of predicting that three very different syntactic contexts will have the same realization for a phi-marked element. In sum, I argue that although clitics look and behave quite differently from canonical independent words and inflectional affixes, with a thorough understanding of the operations underlying head-movement and vocabulary insertion for paradigmatic elements, clitics are a predicted part of the model. Instead of requiring extra apparatus to explain, clitics offer us ways of simplifying our approach to syntax and the syntax-morphology interface as a whole.

        "description":"The goal of teaching philosophy is to develop philosophically literate students and to ensure that students develop philosophical literacy by design and not by chance. Perhaps the best method for teaching philosophy to beginning students is the public model, in which the practice of defending positions in the public arena forces students to become more self-reflective about their positions. Multiple choice exams can be an effective testing method for philosophy courses in that they can encourage students to think deeply about philosophical issues, test whether students can make conceptual distinctions, and help instructors handle grading with large classes and course loads. However, essay exams or written papers represent the best and most appropriate method for testing  philosophical literacy. In addition to in-class essay questions on exams, out-of-class critical essay papers provide useful means of determining outcomes that are not dependent upon students' memory on a given test day. In an ideal grading mix, 20% to 25% of the final grade should reflect the students' scores on the final exam, 20% to 25% should reflect student scores on out-of-class writing assignments, and 0 to 20% should reflect the quality of a student's participation in classroom discussion and debates. Sample multiple choice questions are appended. (HAA)",

Chapter 10 focuses on the 154 children (0-16) with disabilities residing in Carelia. The study reviews the number of children living at home, the level  of development and age of the children, services provided to the children, the tuition of children living in institutions, and family characteristics. Chapter 11 describes the training of the authorities responsible for children with disabilities in Segezha, as well as the training of the children's parents. General recommendations for changes in the care of individuals with disabilities in Segezha are presented in Chapter 12.

The first investigation interviewed 17 families of children with physical disabilities who had received help under the new act. The second investigation studied the effects of the legislation on 18 children with intellectual disabilities who had personal assistants. The last investigation studied the effects of having personal assistants for children with disabilities in schools in five municipalities.  Results found that the number of divorces was much higher in families with children with physical disabilities than those with intellectual disabilities and that women with children with physical disabilities worked outside the home to a lesser extent than women with children with intellectual disabilities. Findings also indicated that personal assistants made the parents feel safe and relieved that their children were receiving good care; however, the school staff sometimes found the personal assistants difficult to deal with because they were outside the school system.

        "description":"Logistic regression was used for modeling the observation-to-indicator ratio needed for the standard error scree procedure (SEscree) to correctly identify the number of factors existing in generated sample correlation matrices. The created correlation matrices were manipulated along the number of factors (4,6), sample size (250, 500), magnitude of factor loadings (0.5, 0.8), and degree of interfactor correlations (0, 0.4). Consequently, the observation-to-indicator (n/v) and the indicator-to-factor (v/f) ratios were also changed. The results indicate that the optimal n/v ratio for determining the number of factors by the standard error scree procedure depends on the characteristics of the data. A smaller n/v (7:1) ratio was needed when factor loadings were high and a larger ratio  (14-22) was needed with low loading, particularly when factors were correlated. In all conditions, the n/v ratio for the SEscree procedure to correctly identify  the true number of factors with high probability exceeded the minimum of 5:1 stated in some of the related literature. Furthermore, the use of logistic regression provided a model for analyzing data from complex simulation studies that makes it very easy to communicate otherwise very complicated relationships.

        "description":"Correlation coefficients are frequently reported in educational and psychological research. The robustness properties and optimality among practical approximations when phi does not equal 0 with moderate sample sizes are not well documented. Three major approximations and their variations are examined: (1) a normal approximation of Fisher's Z, N(sub 1) (R. A. Fisher, 1915); (2) a student's t based approximation, t(sub 1) (H. C. Kraemer, 1973; M. Samiuddin, 1970), which replaces for each sample size the population phi with phi*, the median of the distribution of r (the product moment correlation); (3) a normal approximation, N(sub6) (H. C. Kraemer, 1980) that incorporates the kurtosis of the X distribution; and (4) five variations--t(sub2), t(sub 1)', N(sub 3), N(sub4), and  N(sub4)'--on the aforementioned approximations. N(sub 1) was found to be most appropriate, although N(sub 6) always produced the shortest confidence intervals for a non-null hypothesis. All eight approximations resulted in positively biased rejection rates for large absolute values of phi; however, for some conditions with low values of phi with heteroscedasticity and non-zero kurtosis, they resulted in the negatively biased empirical rejection rates. Four tables contain information about the approximations. (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"This manual was developed in order to study the sociomoral atmospheres of three kindergarten classrooms. Previous research by Robert Selman et al. conceptualized developmental levels of interpersonal understanding in terms of two types of experiences: negotiation, where the developmental goal is identity separate from others; and shared experience, where the goal is connection, or mutuality with others. Negotiation strategies describe interaction when an interpersonal dynamic is in disequilibrium, e.g., when a tension is present between interactors that requires some action to resolve it. The tension, characterized by Levels 0-3, may be mild, as when one actor makes an assertion of opinion, or strong, as when one actor attacks the other physically or verbally. Shared experiences  describe interaction when an interpersonal dynamic is in equilibrium, e.g., in an absence of tension. The equilibrium may be weak, as when one actor briefly acknowledges the other, or strong, as when two laugh together at a shared secret. Assessment is of that which is expressed, rather than of the teacher's elective understanding. The study that forms the basis for this manual examined three kindergarten teachers as they interacted with their children. The coding manual provides operational definitions of 88 categories of negotiation strategies and shared experiences. (SH)",

The results are reported of individually administered tests on reading indicating that after 3 to 4 years of Success for All at schools with a nearly 100 percent African American population and 90 percent on free lunches, the program  dramatically increased achievement, decreased special education assignments, and reduced retention in grade to near 0. These results can be replicated as the program is currently in place in 31 schools in 12 states. A second section describes the policy implications of the program based on costs, comparisons with other programs, and implications for compensatory and special education and school reform. Included are 47 references, 1 table, and 1 bar graph. (JB)",

The M-FIRST goals focused on developing an inservice training model that utilized current knowledge of best practices regarding adult learning, state of the art technical skills and service delivery models, and interdisciplinary team development strategies. The teams typically included school nurses, occupational therapists, physical therapists, parents, teachers, administrators, paraprofessionals, and other school agency and community personnel. The teams participated in team  development activities and team-based evaluative assessments designed to track and analyze team functioning over time. Training was provided through a series of formal training sessions and technical assistance follow-ups. Project evaluation activities focused on the following areas: best practices in inservice education, knowledge change in competency areas, team process development, impact on district services, consumer satisfaction with training activities, team member assumption of the trainer role, validation of instrumentation, and project dissemination and material development.

The research sample consisted of 1015 teachers of English from different cities, teaching levels, and various ages in Turkey. In order to find out what factors influence English Teachers' professional learning the most, English Language Teacher Learning Scale (ELTLS) was used. According to the results, teacher cognition and beliefs factor influenced teacher learning the most and contextual variables were the second influencing factor. When the differences were examined it was found out that there was a significant difference only between teacher cognition and beliefs, and teacher experience. The post-hoc test revealed that there was a significant difference between 21 and above year-experienced teachers and 0-5 year-experienced in teacher cognition and beliefs factor (p&lt;0.05).",

Using an e-survey questionnaire and focus groups, the study sought to understand the supports that were available to children with autism and their families. More importantly, it explored the supports parents perceived were most useful and effective for their children at home, after school, and in educational settings. The key findings highlighted the need for autism-specific knowledge and training for educators and caregivers, and flexibility of funding for parents to access supports and services that they perceived to be the most useful. These findings were juxtaposed by issues of &quot;availability,&quot; &quot;accessibility&quot; and &quot;affordability&quot; of services and supports. There was unequivocal support from participants for a one-stop-shop for better coordination of services, funding flexibility and closer partnerships with families.

The result signified that t[subscript count] &lt; t[subscript table] (-2.84&lt;-1.97) leading to the acceptance of H[subscript 0] and the rejection of H[subscript 1]. This explicitly stated that civil servant job satisfaction has a negative direct effect on their absenteeism. For job satisfaction predictors, positive attitude places the highest position followed by comfort in work and certainty in work. While the highest predictors of absenteeism from the highest to the lowest are: punctual task completion failure, absenteeism style, and no explanation absence. The study is predicted to provide recommendation for schools to promote teacher job satisfaction and suppress their absenteeism rate. Providing comfort and creating positive working atmosphere for teachers either has significant consequence to endeavor job satisfaction promotion and absenteeism rate decrease. Besides, leaders and school management board assertiveness in the mechanism of decreasing absenteeism is unarguably decisive to create fairness in policy and procedure obedience.",

However, our understanding of science learning as it occurs for children from birth to three years, is limited. We do not know enough about how scientific thinking develops across the first years of life. Identifying what we do know about science experiences for our youngest learners within the birth to three period specifically, is critical. This paper reviews the literature, and for the first time includes children in the birth to three period. The results are contextualised through a broader review of early childhood science education for children aged from birth to six years. Findings illustrated that the empirical research on science concept formation in the early years, has focused primarily, on children aged three to six years. The tendency of research to examine the process of concept formation in the birth to three period is also highlighted. A lack of empirical understanding of science concept formation in children from birth to three is evident. The eminent need for research in science in infancy--toddlerhood is highlighted.",

The data sources were an integrated L2 writing corpus of 185 literary analysis essays and an independent L2 writing corpus of 500 argumentative essays, both of which were compiled in higher education contexts. Both essay groups were scored between 0 and 100. Two Python libraries, TextBlob and SpaCy, were used to generate sentiment and sentence similarity data. Using sentiment (polarity and subjectivity) and sentence similarity variables, regression models were built and 95% prediction intervals were compared for integrated and independent corpora. The results showed that integrated L2 writing performance could be predicted by subjectivity and sentence similarity. However, only subjectivity predicted independent L2 writing performance. The prediction interval of subjectivity for independent writing model was found to be narrower than the same interval for integrated writing. The results show that the sentiment and sentence similarity analysis algorithms can be used to generate complementary data to improve more complex multivariate L2 writing performance prediction models.",

Study results indicate that professionalism grades, in terms of attendance and punctuality, were high (median of 93.33-100%) for students earning 80-100% median final course grades. Students earning 70-80% mean final course grades were less motivated to earn high professionalism grades--earning a 75.20% mean. There was little difference between final course grades and professionalism grades for students earning less than a 70% median for a final course grade.

Participants in this research were special and general education teachers randomly selected from elementary schools in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which have special education programs. The theoretical framework of the study was the Concern Based Adoption Model (CBAM). Non-experimental cross-sectional survey was used to collect data. Data were obtained from 332 teachers, i.e., the response rate was 83%. The Stages of Concerns Questionnaire (SoCQ) provided by CBAM indicated that respondent stages of concern 0-2 (Unconcerned, Informational, and Personal) ranked the highest, while stages 4-6 (Consequence, Collaboration, and Refocusing) ranked the lowest. This profile was identified as a &quot;non-user profile&quot;, meaning respondents wanted more information about inclusive education. Teachers, in general, showed interest for professional development on inclusive education, including immediate training and seminars/workshops. The only significant difference in interest for professional development was by gender. The t-test indicated that female teachers have more interest for professional development compared to male teachers.",

        "description":"In this study, we aimed at developing &quot;Human and Environment&quot; unit around SSI based instruction. We followed action research methodology in development and implementation of the unit. The participants of this study were 24 seventh graders students and the instruction was extended to eight and a half weeks, taking four hours in a week. The data collection tools included the teacher's, the students' diaries, midterm exams, and video records. The SSI-based instructional framework of Presley and colleagues (2013) guided us to develop this unit for middle school. We also used the framework for analyzing student and teachers' diaries. The correct answers were scored with 1 point while wrong answers were evaluated with 0 point for mid-term exams which were multiple choice exams. Video records were evaluated in terms of SSI-based instruction observation form. Our findings showed that the framework of Presley and colleagues (2013) was useful for the development of an effective SSI-based instruction. At the end of the study a unit started with a global warming, interacting with science ideas and practices, and ended with a final activity was presented.",

The current study seeks to add to the existing literature on this topic by performing a qualitative analysis across events recorded in students' autobiographical narratives. The purpose of this analysis is to assess student learning of preselected developmental theories (Piaget, Schaie &amp; Willis, and Erikson). Participants were undergraduates (N = 108) enrolled in introductory life-span development classes at a public state college in the southeastern United States. Participants composed three written assignments of a flowing narrative quality due at designated time intervals throughout the semester. The first assignment covered infancy through preschool (0-6 years); the second, the elementary school years through adolescence (7-19 years); and the third, early through late adulthood (20 years onward). In completing their assignments, participants conducted an introspective analysis of their own development (past, present, and realistic speculations about the future) in terms of applicable developmental principles. The data were analyzed for correct and incorrect links between dominant themes and corresponding developmental conceptions. Results are discussed in light of participants' content learning in the context of each preselected developmental theory. Implications for undergraduate teaching, learning, and assessment are also presented.",

The study used purposive sampling to select school of Mechanical Science and Engineering in Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China. The researchers used a random sampling technique in coming up 25 faculties and 187 undergraduate students. We conducted a Multiple linear regression analysis to examine whether independent variables are statistically significant to explain dependent variables. The results showed that all the four dimensions of faculty competency jointly predict students' perception with an R square value of 0.792. The study therefore, developed a model: SP=ß[subscript 0] + ß[subscript 1]T + ß[subscript 2]R + ß[subscript 3]S + ß[subscript 4]A + µ implying that students' perceptions are influenced by faculties' measured competencies.

A list of 49 agricultural education competencies were developed from existing research, and responses were analyzed using mean weighted discrepancy scores (MWDS). We found induction-phase teachers (0-5 years of experience) had the highest inservice needs for the following competencies: (a) writing grant proposals for external funding, (b) utilizing a local advisory committee, and (c) utilizing the AET record book system. Non-induction phase agriculture teachers (6 or more years of experience) were most in need of: (a) balancing priorities to make time for career and family/personal life, (b) utilizing the AET record book system, and (c) utilizing techniques and skills to stay organized. Additionally, differences and similarities between inservice needs of induction and non-induction teachers were identified and discussed.

The Rand Health Insurance Experiment examined this issue in a general population. Health outcomes of children in a free-care plan were compared with those of children in cost-sharing plans. From November 1974 through January 1982, 1,844 children between the ages of 0 and 13 were tracked. Families from six cities and counties nationwide were assigned to either a free-care health plan or to one of several cost-sharing plans for 3 to 5 years. The effects of cost sharing on measures of physiologic function, physical health, mental health, and general health perceptions were assessed. The results revealed that, for the  typical child in the study, no discernible differences in health status were observed between those on the free-care plan and those on cost-sharing plans. No differences were observed among the cost-sharing plans. These findings suggest that insurance plans can be designed to shield the poor from excessive cost-sharing and preserve demand-reducing incentives for a non-aged general population without producing unacceptable health effects.

The traditional delta scale uses an inverse normal transformation based on normal ogive models developed years ago. However, no use is made of this fact in typical uses of item deltas. It is simply one way to make the probability scale of item difficulty a more useful set of units that are not compressed near 0 or 1. The alternative scale uses a different function to achieve the same result. Both a logistic definition and a normal definition can be calculated. For item difficulty between .10 and .90, the difference between the standard definition of the delta scale and one based on the logistic distribution is negligible. The logistic definition scales very easy  items as easier than the normal definition. This change in the delta scale, as compared with the traditional delta, would have little effect on the values of the statistics used. However, it offers the advantage of the use of logits. Also, differences in item deltas (e.g., for a comparison of two subpopulations' performance on an item) can be interpreted in terms of odds-ratios of the corresponding difficulty values. (GDC)",

Previous AEL educational needs studies (1980-83) utilized the need statements generated by statewide conference participants in 1980. This 1984 study used 21 needs statement summaries, with a rating scale of 0 to 4 for evaluating importance. Results for 1980-83 indicated that important educational needs had not shifted extremely over time; consequently, no major shifts in AEL services or long term programmatic  research and development should have occurred as a function of these results. The 1984 survey results were strikingly similiar to the previous studies: mastering basic skills and developing the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to be effective life-long learners were very important in each state and across the region. Those surveyed were in high agreement concerning the importance of the needs statements.

Findings indicated that a young handicapped child did induce greater stress in his parents than did a nonhandicapped child. Parents of handicapped children appeared to have greater problems associated with the care of the handicapped child, felt more pessimistic about the child's future, and felt more negative about his/her present behavioral and physical characteristics. The general functioning of families and availability of social support was altered but not necessarily impaired by the presence of a handicapped child. Families with handicapped children placed a greater emphasis on achievement  and moral-religious beliefs and were more likely to employ rules and control as a method of operating family life. The two groups perceived equal degrees of social support, although the handicapped group received less from their own extended families. Results suggested that intervention efforts to relieve parental stress should focus on cultivating positive family relationships, developing skills for efficient operation of daily family activities and care of the handicapped child, and improving the social support system both inside and outside the family.

        "description":"Students with personal-social problems report seeking help from friends and relatives first, as compared to faculty, clergy, and counseling centers. To investigate the subsequent referrals friends might provide, 28 college freshmen, 14 male and 14 female, rated 16 problem descriptions on a 0-9 point scale according to the likelihood that they would send their friend to each of seven potential help-giving sources, i.e., dean, counseling center, chaplain, friend, parent, faculty member, or themselves. The problems were varied according to severity, history, and immediacy. An analysis of the results showed that students could distinguish among problems, although no one characteristic was of singular importance. More serious problems did lead to a greater likelihood of recommending  the college counseling center and the chaplain. Subjects rated themselves and other friends consistently high across problem types, except for the most severe problems. The dean and faculty were rated consistently low except for less severe, recent past, or recurrent problems. Parents and the chaplain received their highest ratings for ongoing problems. Providers of counseling services may need to educate students about the seriousness of certain problems in order to counteract students' tendencies to see themselves as appropriate sources of help.

It is based on a model of instruction and testing which systematically uses assessment information to support and facilitate instructional improvement. Course goals and objectives are first translated into domain specifications which are used to link testing and instruction. A domain specification contains six components: (1) domain description; (2) content limits; (3) distractor limits and response-criteria; (4) item format; (5) student directions; and (6) sample items. Test items are then developed to match domain specifications. Standard item construction rules are given for both constructed responses (essay, short answer,  completion) and selected responses true-false, matching, multiple choice). Items are then judged for their match to the six domain components plus linguistic and thinking complexity using the Item Rating Scales. When all eight categories have been individually scored on scales from 0 to 10, an overall rating is calculated. Guidelines are given for interpreting overall item rating for acceptance, rejection, or revision. Appendices contain: (1) sample domain-referenced test specifications; (2) item difficulty levels; and (3) materials used in the item rating process. (BS)",

To investigate the characteristics of the faculty in accredited counselor education programs, a survey was sent to all faculty members in 22 accredited institutions. Data were collected on their general characteristics, teaching load, areas of primary interest, and state and national credentials. An analysis of the results showed that the majority of faculty members are white, middle-aged males. Fifty-three percent hold the Doctor of Philosophy degree and 46% hold Doctor of Education degrees. The majority are tenured professors in counselor education. Teaching was indicated as the preferred professional activity of the  respondents. Thirty-five percent of the group are licensed and 19% hold counselor certification. The majority have professional memberships in a variety of counseling related associations. A total of 50% have published between 0 and 11 articles, while 23% have published 20 or more articles. Eighty-three percent of the respondents have engaged in paid consulting activities.

Some issues associated with providing training for this personnel group include: (1) determining who is responsible for the training programs, which are not currently the domain of any one professional group; (2) revision of the curriculum to provide the extended amount of experience and course work necessary; (3) provision of quality training; (4) consideration of job mobility and the hiring problems of personnel trained under these  programs; and (5) identification of needed competencies. The State Education Department of Arkansas has drafted suggestions of competencies needed by personnel working with preschool handicapped populations. The paper presents a set of competencies based on the Arkansas suggestions, guidelines of the National Association for the Education of Young Children, and suggestions of the Council for Exceptional Children's Division of Early Childhood. Detailed competencies are outlined for the areas of multidisciplinary approach, assessment, programming, professional practice, issues and ethics, theories and history, and field experiences. (DB)",

Previous studies have used computer-generated data or real data with unknown amounts of bias. The present project extends previous studies by using items that are logically generated and subjectively evaluated a priori to be biased or unbiased, and simultaneously controls the amount of bias and true ability differences (as measured by the unbiased items). The study evaluated the functioning of four statistical methods of assessing test item bias (transformed item difficulties, chi-square, three parameter and one parameter item characteristic curves) when (1) tests have varying amounts of bias (0 biased/60 items, 18 biased/78 items, 40 biased/100 items) and (2)  ability differences on the unbiased items were either one-half or one standard deviation apart. Results indicate that agreement among the methods and between the statistical methods and judged bias was generally high except for data set VI (40 percent biased items, one standard deviation difference). Problems with individual methods and with cutoffs are discussed. Finally, presence of biased items did not affect reliability but did decrease validity and increase score differences between groups.

Method: The stages of concern questionnaire was used to identify stages of concern among Florida school librarians about their potential role in this implementation. Analysis: Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample and the distribution of responses to each question. Questions were separated into seven separate stages, with key differences analysed using the stages of concern profiles and the analysis of variance test. Results: Results indicate that participants conform to the non-user profile, which has higher unconcerned (Stage 0), informational concerns (Stage 1) and personal concerns (Stage 2). It is also found that school librarians' restrictive schedules and heavy workloads prevent them from studying new innovations--in particular digital textbooks. Intensified personal concerns (Stage 2) suggest potential resistance to digital textbooks. Conclusions: These findings could provide librarians as educators an opportunity to establish more interest in digital textbooks and to discuss those textbooks' impact on teaching and learning. More broadly, the findings can provide some implications and recommendations to help educational policy makers and school administrators identify issues related to expanding digital textbooks.",

First, we determined the components of three-dimensional geometric thinking and prepared questions for each component. Then, we conducted the pilot studies of the test at three stages in six state schools located in the city of Ankara in Turkey. The first draft test consisting of 54 items was administered to 384 students; the second draft test consisting of 53 items was administered to 120 students and the third draft test consisting of 45 items was administered to 268 students. In order to establish the content validity of the test, prior to all the administrations, it was subsumed to the review of 13 experts and by considering the content validity rates, the items to be included in the test were determined.

        "description":"Life skill development is essential for social empowerment and civic engagement, which are universally desirable learning outcomes. A longitudinal study using both a BRIDGE process and activity scaffolding was completed. The following hypothesis was evaluated: Structured equine experiences will result in increased third-party perception of life skill development. Multiple measures were used to assess life skills including third-party surveys, student-reflections, scholastic reports, and researcher reflections on participant experiences. A case study was conducted August 2011-March 2013, with a student participant (age = 9yr). Four phases (0, I, II, III) of activities consisting of no interactions and structured interactions were completed. During each phase repeated measures of survey respondents (N=9) were used to assess life skill development. Weekly reflection journals by student and researcher were qualitative and student scholastic reports (grades) were quantitative measures. Third-party perception showed an increase in perceived life skill development using the BRIDGE process. Scholastic improvement occurred while the student was actively participating; however, scholastic improvement was not persistent following termination of activities. This study illustrates that using a structured flexibility scaffold grounded in the BRIDGE process enhanced life skill development and highlighted the importance of mentorship in applied learning.",

The program and curriculum design is based on two phases--the early intervention phase which incorporates inhome and onsite activities for infants, toddlers, and their parents; and the basic skills phase which provides a preschool class at the center. Activities involving direct and related services to children cover the areas of referral, admission, evaluation and placement, individualized education program (IEP) development, curriculum, instructional programing, and child progress assessment. Intervention  with parents is based on a three stage model--assessment of parental needs, knowledge and skill development, and maintenance. Minimum staff requirements are outlined for administrative, teaching, support, parent program, and program assistance personnel. Program impact is evaluated in terms of program continuation, demonstration and replication, child and parent progress, and dissemination. Appendixes, which make up half the document, contain sample admission forms, IEP forms, progress monitoring forms, parent assessment forms, a report on staff development and improvement procedures, preservice student involvement forms, and a parent program evaluation form.

Five groups of 15 student Fuel and Electrical Repairmen, 630 Military Occupational Specialty, performed from zero to four repetitions on testing charging system electrical output using the 500A Sun Test Stand. Each group received test stand familiarization instruction followed by one level task repetition. Retention was tested immediately and 14 days after training. Transfer to a different charging system was tested immediately after the delayed retention test. Retention improved with task repetition and deteriorated over the interest retention interval. Significant overall test improvements in task time and errors first occurred after three repetitions with no added  benefits resulting from a fourth. Transfer was not affected by increased task repetition due to probable floor effects operating on the data. However, transfer was better after task repetition (1-4 repetition groups) than after familiarization alone (0 repetition group). It was concluded that task repetition during training enhances retention of maintenance skill. Three repetitions were most effective, although this number may vary depending on training conditions. Transfer was best when training involved combined test equipment instruction and task performance. (Author/YLB)",

The specific communication variables investigated were cue sensitivity and strategy use. Subjects were 45 boys (24 LD and 21 normal children from public elementary schools) who were interviewed individually by an adult female who asked each subject a series of open-ended questions about how he would teach a friend to play a game that his friend did not know how to play. Audiotape records of each interview were transcribed verbatim for coding, and responses were scored on a scale of 0  to 3 by two independent coders. Results showed that for both cue sensitivity and strategy use, knowledge increased with age. LD children did not differ from normals on Knowledge about cue sensitivity, but they displayed less knowledge than normals on knowledge about strategies for effective communication. Results suggest that limitations in metacommunicative knowledge may contribute to the communicative deficiencies of LD and younger normal children. (Author/MP)",

A key concern was the percentage of state approved reading and mathematics skills measured by a test, rather than the test's value for other uses. Other content concerns were readability and cultural and sex bias. Most technical criteria were straightforward, but additional issues included extrapolation of grade equivalent scores and the consistency of mastery decisions resulting from the test. Mathematics, reading, and vocabulary tests only, from fourteen standardized achievement batteries were reviewed by three committees: technical, reading, and mathematics. Reading content ratings (representing content validity, readability, and bias)  ranged from 0-8 of the maximum 10 points available; mathematics content ratings were either 2 or 5. Technical ratings for both subject areas were much higher--ranging fron 29-50, or 52-89% of the possible score. It was recommended that bias and technical adequacy be considered independently of content validity. The first two issues should be handled by the state; content validity is the responsibility of the local district. (The rating form and basic skills objectives are appended.) (CP)",

One or both of their parents and at least one sibling were mentally subnormal. The subjects and 21 of their 93 siblings attended an experimental nursery school for 1 to 3 years. Intervention consisted of medical and dental care, psychological evaluation, training of mothers in nutrition and food preparation, and structured social interaction among mothers. Medical diagnoses revealed that children were retarded partly because of mild encephalopathy, partly because of psychosocial factors, and frequently both. Over the course of the  project, the growth rate of the children (who were 81% below average in weight and 84% below in height) ranged from 0 to 24.4% partly due to increased nutritional intake. Although 32 of the children attending the school gained some in IQ, the group with normal electroencephalographs gained the most. Group meetings gave the mothers a feeling of belonging and were more successful than sewing classes. (JZ)",

Analysis of parent responses indicated imbalance among the subgroups: less achievement discrepancy was observed among the high achievers of the lower socioeconomic group than high achievers of the higher socioeconomic group (p>.05); the high achievers in both socioeconomic groups differed from the low achievers in that they had a lower  IQ, mental age, and expected grade placement (p<.05); and a disproportionately high representation of girls was found in the higher socioeconomic group (p=.01). Results from the parent interview indicated fathers of high achievers, regardless of socioeconomic level, mentioned with higher frequency their social emotional dealings with the child (p<.01); and mothers of high achievers gave less verbal control.

In the subgroups, the students who took a course at a higher level than they qualified for  did not do as well as the control group; those who took a lower-level course did better. With one explainable exception, those who took the course indicated by the V-score did as well as or better than the control group.

The Reading Component not only met, but surpassed, its objectives for comprehension gain among disabled readers. Objective I stated, in part, that students with pretest comprehension grade-scores of 0-3.9 would show a median of 1.5 months comprehension gain for every month in the ESAA program; in fact, these students achieved a median gain rate of 2.4. Objective II stated, in part, that students entering the Component with pretest scores of 4.0-6.0 would have a median rate of 2.5 months  gain per program month; the actual median rate for Objective II students was 3.1. Also, within each separate school, the ESAA students usually surpassed Objective I and II. In every public school approximately 60 percent of the Objective I students exceeded the expected median gain-rate of 1.5. Factors possibly accounting for differences among schools in gain rates were discussed. (Author/DEP)",

        "description":"Investigates the effect of delay of reinforcement upon human discrimination learning with particular emphasis on the form of the gradient within the first few seconds of delay. In previous studies subjects are usually required to make an instrumental response to a stimulus, this is followed by the delay interval, and finally, the reinforcement occurs. The present procedure did not require any instrumental response during the experimental treatment. Instead, a pair of stimuli was presented for a brief period, a delay interval occured, and then a light appeared over the stimulus that the subject was instructed to remember. In the present situation the subject is required to associate a stimulus with the reinforcement light. Classical conditioning literature indicates that an  interstimulus interval of about .50 sec. produces optimal conditioning. Even small changes in either direction from this interval produce performance decrements. Thus, evidence from both animal discrimination learning and classical conditioning support the importance of the first second or two of the interval between the occurrence of two stimuli that are to become associated. In this series of experiments, particular attention was given to delay intervals between 0 and 2.0 sec. with other delays ranging up to 5.0 sec. (Author/RC)",

Self-learning resources are listed with the unit objectives and include references to the \"recommended\" and \"alternate\" texts, suggested problems in each  text, and designated numbers of specially made television tapes germane to the unit. Three regular class-meetings per week are scheduled.

Three separate models relate the average earnings of these types to several area variables. Multiple regression equations, based on 1960 Census and related data, indicate that: (1) the earnings of the male labor types are significantly related to the cooperating labor force in an area; (2) area unionization provides a significant explanation for the interarea earnings differentials of all labor types, both male and female; (3) the earnings of the lowest labor type are related primarily to the extent of area unionization and to the percentage of the type relative to the area labor force; (4) the  earnings of females are affected by the number of females relative to males in the labor force with nonwhite females of the lowest labor type suffering discrimination; and (5) a North-South regional differential exists for females but not for males. These results indicate that the forces which determine the earnings of women are different from those which determine the earnings of men. (Author)",

        "description":"After the Westinghouse Electric Corporation made a comprehensive analysis of the technical, economic, social, environmental, and institutional factors affecting the feasibility of utilizing solar energy for heating and cooling buildings, it determined that solar heating and cooling systems can become competitive in most regions of the country in the 1985-90 period. Heating-only systems can be competitive in the 1975-80 period in limited regions of the country. Impressive progress has recently been made in solar collectors, but further reduction in costs is necessary to capture a large market. Five regions of the country containing more than 75 percent of the country's population have been identified as the market for solar systems. Retrofit of solar systems to existing structures  is not economically attractive for residential buildings but can be applied to larger buildings. The amount of fossil fuel that can be saved by use of solar energy will build up slowly and could reach 50 million barrels of oil per year by 1990. In the next century, sales of solar systems could approach $10 billion. A proof-of-concept experiment spanning a 3-year period involving 300 single-family residences and 25 large buildings, and requiring $26 million is recommended. (Author)",

        "description":"Eleven indexes of rurality and their effect on the classification of Michigan's 83 counties were investigated. The indexes were based on different concepts of rurality: (1) percent of employment in agriculture, fishing, and forestry; (2) population density and distance to urban centers; and (3) economic conditions. Index rankings were compared to determine if a county's rank varied from one index to another. The two indexes most frequently associated with extreme ranks were then eliminated and a similar analysis performed. The average county still had adifference of 31 between its highest and lowest rank. Further classification into four discrete quartile groupings also revealed substantial difference in county classification depending on the index selected. Rank correlation  analysis revealed that 55 pairs of correlations between indexes were significantly different from 0 at the .01 probability level. Index choice, then, did make a difference, since in selecting a particular index, rurality was explicitly or implicity defined. It was concluded that no one index could satisfy the needs of all potential users, since policy is usually problem specific and the rurality index used should also, therefore, be problem specific.

The general objects of this project were: to alter the pre-school environment of children aged 0-5 from a culturally deprived welfare population in order to achieve behavior which is socially and economically compatible with that of American life; to work with the mothers of these pre-school children to increase their capacities to provide an emotionally stable home environment; to work with underprivileged high school and college youths in order to train them as teachers of the underprivileged; and, to work with children now in the public schools  who are functioning academically at a level significantly lower than the grade level in which they are enrolled. In January 1969, a Child Development Center was established to fulfill the terms of the Project. Its program differed from programs such as Head Start. Children participated year-round in full-day sessions. Terminal behaviors were identified and then broken down into component parts which could be taught to children. A contingency management system was employed to facilitate a high success rate. (Authors/JM)",

Mother interviews and test protocols were obtained for 416 children between the ages 3-0 and 3-11. Results indicated the most striking relationships between level of education, environmental experience, and aspects of thinking ability. Children with  mothers at home full-time were less able in visual and spatial manipulation. Children with professional fathers showed less ability but scored higher in ideational fluency. Children of fathers who attended college were more able in convergent figural thinking. Mothers' education was related to verbal tasks as well as figural. Some geographic differences were found. It was evident that 3- and 4-year-olds showed \"types\" of thinking ability. (Author/DR)",

        "description":"A cybernetic subcomponent is proposed which can gather the necessary information and make the operating decisions to allow one system of instruction (M.D. Merrill's) to respond to and provide for differential needs within the individual learner. (Merrill's system divides the universe of instructional objectives into a taxonomy of seven categories, each having associated with it a paradigm for instruction of its objectives.) A model modification scheme for computer-assisted instruction is proposed for introducing and using information on individual learner aptitudes that allows the system to provide individually prescribed instruction. Aptitudes have associated with them value scales so that the value of a learner's aptitude will be associated with a value of a parameter for one  of the instructional paradigms. (Each paradigm has more than 50 parameters associated with it.) Parameter values (scaled from 0 to 1.0) for a given individual are always changing, being reset after every learner response. The model monitors performance and changes parameter values, resulting in changes in the content, organization, and sequencing of instructional displays. Before the modification schedule can be incorporated into an instructional system and implemented for use, relevant parameters must be identified and scaled; experiments must be run to validate the scheme. Collection of computer-generated data for demonstration of the system is currently in the planning stages. (JS)",

A fourth seminarium trains a selected group of experienced seminarium graduates to be leaders of child care institutions or practicum teachers in day care centers. Individual curriculums of the seminariums are influenced by governmental laws regulating the  number of hours of theoretical instruction in specific subject areas as well as practicum experience. Student-related topics examined in this report include selection, qualification, evaluation, organizations and job placement.

A self-administered questionnaire with approximately 30 items was filled out by parents concerning their children before the child entered nursery school. Following entry into school and again at the end of the semester, the teacher completed a 1-paragraph description of each child according to the parameters outlined in the behavior inventory guideline. On the basis of parent questionnaires and teacher behavior inventories, independent raters experienced in early childhood development and the psychopathology of childhood made predictions about the child's probable emotional difficulties, based on a  4-point scale, 0 to 3. In a sample study, at the end of the first two weeks of school, 4 out of 14 were correct within one rank of prediction of emotional problems including separation problems. By the end of the first semester of school, thirteen out of fourteen were correct within one rank of prediction. It is suggested that this method may be an improvement over the transcribe-interview method used in previous prediction studies. (CS)",

The answers were obtained by summarizing 50,000 data records for 8,000 students on grades and number of quarters completed. An IBM 1130 computer was used. Two matrices were constructed to report the summarized data.

The second matrix showed students who earned from 90 hours through 108 hours. The latter  proved the most useful. Analysis of these data provided the following answers: (1) it took 8.16 quarters to get a junior college degree; (2) over the five-year period studied, 18.32% of the enrolled students dropped out without completing one hour for credit; (3) the average number of credit hours taken was 10.23 and the average number completed was 8.51; and (4) one can expect 82.73% of the enrolled students to complete one quarter successfully.

Data, collected from the files of three large voluntary societies, included information about all children admitted in 1962, 1963 and 1964. The movements of the children were followed until December 1968. None of the children had been received into care with the aim of adoption. By 1968, 37%-46% of the children were restored to mothers and relatives (percents vary with race and reason for admittance). Half of the children placed in foster care were adopted by foster parents. Between 1/4 and 1/3 of the total population would probably have to grow up in a child welfare institution. Predictions based on information from the survey indicate that  infants over six months old, boys and colored children are less likely to be either adopted or restored. In recent years, a different pattern in the number and age concentration of admissions has occurred, thereby rendering results of this survey partially outdated. However, colored children continue to be the most difficult to place. Expansion of preventive services is presently being undertaken to reduce the number of young children admitted to residential care. (WY)",

Details of the first year's activities are presented and analyzed. It is believed that the organization, financial, and programmatic record might be of value to others contemplating a project similar to SLICE. The three main objectives of the first year's operation reported upon here are:  sharing of the MARC-0 Data Base, a regional plan for a bibliographic network, and continuing education activities for librarians focusing on improving library services to the disadvantaged ethnic groups and a systematic planning and evaluation methodology. Also included are an evaluation of the first year, the financial statement and a projection of the future. (Other documents on SLICE are ED 065 147 through 065 150) (Author/SJ)",

        "description":"Vocabulary level of 10 special students was determined and compared to their supposed level of proficiency on the Functional Basic Word List for Special Pupils (Tudyman and Groelle, 1958). Ss were five educable mentally retarded (EMR) students (CA 9-6 to 12-0, IQ 64-77, MA 6-6 to 9-7) and five matched emotionally disturbed students. Word sampling procedures were used in the development of procedures used to measure reading, written, and oral vocabulary levels. If a S knew a group of four words at a certain vocabulary proficiency level, he was advanced to the next level, since knowledge of four random words at a level was found to indicate knowledge of all words at that level. Results indicated that testing procedures developed could be used to determine students' level of  vocabulary proficiency. In general, the Ss could read the words that Tudyman and Groelle suggested as expected for them. In addition, Ss knew the meaning of words at levels higher than their expected levels when tested orally. It was determined that the three tests (reading, written, oral vocabulary level) could be condensed into two tests by having Ss read written words aloud on the written test. Significance of student vocabulary level in comprehension of audiovisual material is discussed. (KW)",

Control Subjects were randomly selected, without regard for reading ability, from the total grade 2 population of three non-Title I schools. Tutors spent another, equivalent period of time learning how to teach names of letters, sounds of letters and digraphs, sound blending, decoding of new words and sight words, and in learning to listen to the child read orally from primers and workbooks. Following instruction, 20 tutorees scored 100% on the criterion test, 73 scored 90% or above, and 102 scored 80% or above. For the total sample, 72% scored 80% or above on the  criterion test, 20% scored between 60% and 80%, and 8% scored between 0% and 60%. Parents of both tutors and tutorees were enthusiastic about the children's improved reading skills and increased interest in reading. Teachers of tutors were initially and subsequently enthusiastic and cooperative in granting released class time; despite some initial skepticism, virtually all teachers of tutorees acknowledged the improved skills of the former nonreaders.

It was hypothesized that each component (O,S,D) is acquired separately before it is combined with any other component (OD,SD). An acquisition sequence of the three components (O,S,D) was also sought. Forty-five 4-, 5- and 6-year-old children were tested individually. Three behavioral outputs (body movements, manipulation of lights and language) were included. Each child was given four tasks: nonverbal imitation, production, comprehension, and verbal imitation. The indicators  used for order were before/after, first/last; for simultaneity, when, at the same time; for duration, a long time/a short time; for coordination of order and duration, until; coordination of simultaneity and duration, while, during. The results support the following developmental sequence for the concept of time. First, the main components (O,S,D) are understood separately (possibly in that order), then they are integrated (OD,SD). Moreover, temporal relations are grasped first on a nonverbal level and later on a linguistic level. (Author/SB)",

The study is conducted with 107 parents, 96 mothers and 11 fathers, with children between 0-72 months. The data has been collected via an online questionnaire. Parents completed the prompt &quot;Playing outside is like…Because...&quot; to indicate their conceptualization of outdoor play. In addition, interviews were conducted to obtain more in-depth data about parent's views about outdoor play. Content analysis technique is used in the evaluation of the data obtained in the research and eight conceptual categories were identified. The metaphors developed about outdoor play are, in order of frequency, freedom, healing, need, fun, instruction, happiness, peace, and exploration. As a result, it has been found that parents of preschoolers have positive perceptions towards outdoor play. Also, parents are aware of the benefit of outdoor play for the child, perceive it positively, but limit their children's outdoor play opportunities, or try to structure it especially because of their concerns about security and health. Thus, it will be possible for children to benefit from outdoor play at the maximum level by eliminating the difficulties faced by parents and increasing their awareness about outdoor play.",

The results of the simulation model show that the peak of students' vulnerability to changes in learning behavior increases rapidly in the first two days and will be stable when passing the 150th day. The results of the simulation of the SEIR mathematical model with an incubation period of 365 days found that student learning behavior in Non-Boarding Schools will be stable in on day 198, while in Boarding Schools it will be stable on day 201. Infection cases in Boarding Schools fell to 0 on day 25 while in Non-Boarding Schools decreased on day 21, meaning that infections occurring in Boarding Schools were slower and more resistant long, meaning that the influence of the social environment is very significant on student learning behavior.

Brazil exhibits tremendous disparities and some of the worst welfare indicators in Latin America. Much of the population faces poverty, limited educational opportunities, and inequitable access to services and basic protections. The youngest children are disproportionately affected. Indicators of malnutrition remain high. Despite the efforts of dedicated teachers and officials, the public education system is not providing an adequate foundation so that children from low-income families may one day rise out of poverty. Education has been a key area of public policy under several government administrations, but early childhood development has not been underscored. Nonetheless, there are reasons for optimism. This paper includes numerous examples of good practice in early childhood education in Brazil, including children's participation, progressive pedagogies that build on local cultures and well-designed, publicly funded early childhood education strategies.

Variability in assessment ages across the studies should enable everyone to identify the separate effects of all three time-related components. The project is a meta-analysis of evaluation studies of early childhood education programs conducted in the United States and its territories between 1960 and 2007. The population of interest is children enrolled in early childhood education programs between the ages of 0 and 5 and their control-group counterparts. Since the data come from a meta-analysis, the population for this study is drawn from many different studies with diverse samples.

        "description":"The purpose of creating a developmental (i.e., vertical) score scale is to make it possible to compare students in terms of differences in magnitude.  In other words, the scale should have interval properties.  When this has been accomplished one can claim to measure growth in a sense that is both coherent and meaningful.  In this paper I argue that the practice of creating and maintaining developmental scales for large-scale assessment systems in the United States is at odds with this purpose, and that this is due to confusion over the theoretical rationale under which item response theory calibration leads to scales with interval properties.  The problem seems to stem from a conflict in the philosophical underpinnings of what it means (and what it requires) to support the claim that one has measured a latent construct, an issue that has been brought to light by the recent work of Joel Michell and Denny Borsboom.  Using data drawn from 14 states with established developmental scales for math and reading, I illustrate the equivocal nature of aggregate growth interpretations when one follows the implicit premise that--despite claims to the contrary--developmental scales communicate only ordinal information.

In experiment one, 100 psychiatric clinicians were asked to rate items on the Child Behavior Checklist in terms of their relationship to oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). Based on their ratings 27 items were found to be indicative of a diagnosis of ODD. These items were then used to create vignettes of a black, white, or racially unspecified child presenting with no symptoms of ODD, clear symptoms of ODD or possible symptoms of ODD. In the second experiment, a different set of 225 psychiatric clinicians were sent one vignette each and each was asked to give a different diagnosis of the child and to rate how confident they were in their diagnosis via a 0-5 Likert scale. The  vignette that ostensibly described a black child got significantly more diagnoses than the other two groups with clinicians being more confident doing so. Additionally, though not statistically significant, the black child got the diagnosis of ODD more often than the white or the racially unspecified child again with higher clinician confidence rating. Results are discussed in relation to the use of heuristics to arrive at judgments. (Contains 49 references, 4 tables, and 11 appendixes.) (Author/GCP)",

The initial impetus for the change came from the 2003 Secondary Education Review &quot;Future Directions for Secondary Education in the Northern Territory,&quot; chaired by Gregor Ramsay. There are many features of this change which will include both administrative and pedagogical aspects. Some comparisons with other systems which include a middle schooling element will be made. However the way in which educational change in the Territory is being introduced is of importance in itself and much of this study will relate to the change mechanisms that the government has used and public reaction to them.

        "description":"This paper reports on a study that investigated the effectiveness of an early intervention program based on the needs of Turkish mothers of six children (ages 0-3) with hearing impairments. The program included an informational component and an educational component. During the preparation of the program, the mothers' expressed needs were taken into account. The informational program covered the following topics: the importance of the education provided to children with hearing impairments; the characteristics of sound; the reasons, classification and rating of hearing losses; resources; development of children with hearing impairments; communication with children with hearing impairments; and coping with problem behavior. The educational program was designed to prepare children  for learning and to develop auditory skills as well as preverbal and verbal communication skills. Individualized educational programs were prepared for each skill and given to mothers. In addition, mothers were provided with observation forms to observe and evaluate the predetermined skills and home assignments were given. Educational videotapes were also provided to the mothers. The mothers' participation in the program was found to be a positive factor in increasing the success of the program. (Contains 26 references.) (CR)",

        "description":"In 2 years, RMIT University (Melbourne, Australia) set up an online learning system for 50,000 students. The development of the RMIT Distributed Learning System has taken the University from a cottage industry model to a fully fledged enterprise system for flexible online learning, integrated with the University's student administration system and capable of integration with the PeopleSoft student system when it goes live. This paper reviews the infrastructure and basic services required for this level of growth. First, a background is briefly sketched, followed by a list of initial design objectives for the distributed learning system (DLS). The DLS was built and deployed in four phases. Each of these phases is described. RMIT is simultaneously implementing four enterprise  systems in parallel, with intention to integrate them during 2001. These four systems are described. The rollout of the DLS brought into sharp focus the problems of deploying an enterprise system across a large intranet in which could be found non-standard servers, different versions of network software, and variations in configuration of the network software. The parallel information technology (IT) infrastructure refurbishment is outlined, and outcomes including the success of the program are discussed. (Contains 11 references.) (AEF)",

The programs are: (1) Special Education Grants to States (School-age Grants); (2) Special Education Preschool Grants (Preschool Grants); and (3) Special Education Grants for Infants and Families with Disabilities (Infant Grants). It concludes that the School-age and Preschool Grants are similar, except for the age ranges of children they serve, while Infant Grants differ in goals, performance objectives, performance measures, eligibility, and services. It found that states receive all grants and many provide services to 3- through 5-year-olds with School-Age  as well as Preschool Grants. The report also finds that the Grants' effects have not been evaluated and few data are available on the effectiveness of special education programs for young children. It concludes that although there is overlap between School-age and Preschool Grants, it is not clear whether this overlap presents problems of service duplication or unnecessary administrative burden.

Data come from the Current Population Survey. Hispanic employment was over 500,000 workers below its potential level at the end of 2002. Hispanics comprised 13 percent of the labor force but were responsible for over half of the increase in the labor force. Before the recession, Hispanic employment grew 5 percent per year. By the end of the recession, the rate fell to 0 percent and then increased to 2 percent. Unemployment rates for Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites and blacks peaked in the first quarter  of 2002, then dropped. Of 51 industries studied, Hispanics lost 600,000 jobs in 10 industries and gained 900,000 jobs in 10 other industries. Job losses for Hispanics and whites emerged primarily in manufacturing, transportation, communications and wholesale trade. Industries in which Hispanics gained jobs while others suffered losses included construction and business and auto repair services. Hispanics increased their employment primarily in executive, administrative and managerial, professional specialty, and precision production, craft, and repair occupations. Older and better educated workers fared better than other workers during the slowdown. (SM)",

Each item was rated in a 9-point Likert scale from 0 (\"Not at all effective\") to 9 (\"Extremely effective\"). According to the descriptive statistics, players perceive their respective coaches to perform average and below average on the four tested constructs. There are also no practical significant differences between the perceptions of big and small schools players on the effectiveness of their respective coaches.

Since standards vary across states, the results of the various state assessments cannot be used to directly compare students' progress. However, by placing a state standard onto the NAEP scale, a common metric for all states, a NAEP equivalent score of that standard is produced, which can be compared across states. The 2017 edition of this report highlights the results of mapping state proficiency standards onto the NAEP scales using state assessment results from the 2016-17 school year and the 2017 NAEP assessments for public schools. The study focuses on the reading and mathematics standards that states set for grades 4 and 8. For each state, the report displays the NAEP equivalent scores with a range of 0 to 500.

Methods: Data for Hispanics ages 25-65 (N?=?700) come from the 2012/2014 Program for International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC). Binary logistic regression models were used to predict online health information seeking as a function of literacy skill scores (0-500 points) and primary language use (Spanish vs. other). Results: Literacy (Odds-Ratio?=?1.012, p?&lt; 0.001) was a positive predictor, while speaking Spanish at home (Odds-Ratio = 0.352, p?&lt; 0.01) was a negative predictor of online health information seeking. Conclusion: Literacy skills and language use appear to be separate contributors of online health information seeking among Hispanic adults. Practice implications: Online health information providers should be aware of literacy skills and Spanish language use as barriers to online health information seeking among Hispanics, particularly those who have both limited literacy skills and predominantly Spanish language use.

        "description":"While considered elusive and abstract, authorial voice is paramount in English writing. Unfortunately, many of Indonesian EFL learners found it is highly challenging to show their voice in their writing. The importance of voice is even exaggerated in argumentative writing, since this kind of writing needs obvious stance of the writer. This study investigates the authorial voice students made in their argumentative writing. The purpose of this study is to gain the picture of students' writing ability especially in authorial voice to map the road in guiding the next writing classes. The object of the study is the argumentative writing made by English department students at one Indonesian State College of Islamic Studies in their writing III course. Using Hyland's interactional model of voice (2008) the data analysis results the authorial presence in the essays is in position 2 at 0-4 scale which means the reader feels somehow weak presence of the authorial voice in the essay. This result confirms the findings of some previous studies that EFL learners especially from 'interdependent' cultural background tend to find this authorial voice difficult in writing English essay.",

The government adopted a warning index (ranging from 0 to 10) to classify municipalities by infection rates in 2020, which was then used by the Ministry of Education in 2021 to establish a &quot;stoplight&quot; system for in-person instruction. Using administrative panel data for all students in Guatemala, the study employs a difference-in-differences strategy that leverages municipal differences over time in the warning index to estimate the effects of the pandemic on dropout, promotion, and school switching. The results show that municipalities with a higher warning index had significantly larger dropout, lower promotion rates, and a greater share of students switching from private to public schools. These effects were more pronounced during the first year of the pandemic. The findings show differential effects by the level of instruction, with greater losses for younger children in initial and primary education. The results are robust to specification choice, multiple hypothesis adjustments, and placebo experiments, suggesting that the pandemic has had heterogeneous consequences.

The most difficult problem proved to be converting repeating decimals to fractions, while the easiest was on finding the value of x[superscript 0]. As a whole, the reasoning ability of the respondents, based to their average reasoning ability on the given tasks, indicate that 73% was low, 27% was moderate and that nobody had a high level of reasoning.

Students were recruited as they entered a fitness facility. Participation consisted of completing a survey that measured exercise self-efficacy and physical activity behavior over the two-week span prior to participation. Age, sex, race, and year in school also were recorded. Exercise self-efficacy was calculated on a 0-20 scale. Mean self-efficacy scores for the group were 14.18 plus or minus 3.50. Physical activity was measured in number of days participants reported being moderately to vigorously physically active in the two weeks prior to their participation. Mean physical activity scores for the group were 7.81 plus or minus 3.15, and mean length of a typical physical activity session was 52.23 plus or minus 25.99 minutes. Correlation analysis revealed positive moderate correlations between self-efficacy and physical activity (r = 0.462). Males scored significantly higher on all measures. A future research goal is to compare self-reported physical activity rates to objectively measured physical activity rates. (Contains 3 tables.)",

However, the Czech population still attributes less importance to education as a success factor for life compared to more developed countries. Still, young people strive for as high a level of education as possible, the primary incentive being expected financial gain. The characteristic features of the Czech population include a high occurrence of ISCED 3 qualification, a low proportion of the labour force with basic education (ISCED 1, 2) and with no education (ISCED 0) and a low proportion of individuals with tertiary qualifications (ISCED 5, 6). The 1990s saw a sharp reduction in the number of secondary vocational school students and an increase in participation in secondary programmes with &quot;maturita&quot; and in tertiary education. A further development of tertiary education is hindered by insufficient capacity in higher education institutions. The CR also shows a very low level of upward educational mobility. Participation in continuing education is lower compared to the EU and there is weak motivation particularly among individuals with lower qualifications.

In all age levels, children with disabilities were found to exhibit the same types of clinical findings as children without disabilities. The most common clinical finding for both children with and without disabilities was behaviour problem. Children with disabilities were significantly more likely to be identified for various clinical findings than children without disabilities except for running away and substance abuse. Overall, children with disabilities were more likely to have been identified for at least one clinical finding than children without disabilities. The proportions of children with and without disabilities identified for various clinical findings generally increased with age.

The patterns followed by children's estimates on the number line task could provide insight into this. This study investigates children's estimation patterns on the number line task and assesses whether mathematics achievement is associated with these estimation patterns. Singaporean children (n = 324, Age M = 6.2 years, Age SD = 0.3 years) in their second year of kindergarten were assessed on the number line task (0-100) and their mathematical performance (Numerical Operations and Mathematical Reasoning subtests from WIAT II). The results show that most children's number line estimation patterns can be explained by at least one mathematical model (i.e., linear, logarithmic, unbounded power model, one-cycle power model, two-cycle power model). But the findings also highlight the high percentage of participants for which more than one model shows similar support. Children's mathematical achievement differed based on the models that best explained children's estimation patterns. Children whose estimation patterns corresponded to a more advanced model tended to show higher mathematical achievement. Limitations of drawing conclusions regarding what performance on the number line task represents based on models that best explain the estimation patterns are discussed.",

While most young children are likely using their parents' accounts, 11% have their own YouTube accounts and 16% have registered with the YouTube Kids app. On average, children spend 1.39 hours each weekday and 1.47 hours each weekend day viewing YouTube videos, which are approximately 4 to 9 minutes in length. The topics most likely to be viewed by children include: play, toys, nursery rhymes, television interests, funny videos, and animal videos. This article presents how children use YouTube, selecting quality videos, the possible benefits, and concerns.",

In a slightly restricted form, these problems have five variables (?&quot;x,&quot; &quot;v[subscript 0],&quot; &quot;v,&quot; &quot;a&quot; and &quot;t&quot;) and two independent equations, so three variables must be given to solve for the other two, giving 10 cases. Instead of the haphazard solution of individual problems, we advocate teaching a strategy for tackling the entire class of problems. We enumerate the possible strategies, and present in detail one which reveals a number of interesting special cases and also allows the possibility of developing an automatic problem generator and solver.",

It examines patterns of and constraints on nominals with relation to the relative clause, theory concerning argumental pronouns, the syntactic status of nominals, and the internal syntax of relatives. It is concluded that Navajo relatives are neither &quot;headless&quot; nor &quot;internally headed&quot; but have overt pronominal heads, are adjuncts to main clause pronouns, and create no problems for Binding theory or the 0-criterion.

        "description":"New Jersey's state grant program delivers the highest level of need-based aid per student in the country. And the state's major grant program, the Tuition Aid Grant (TAG), funds all eligible students, rather than excluding students when the funding runs out. But different levels of grant aid for enrollment in different institutions within sectors, combined with a confidential need analysis formula, make it difficult for students to predict how much support they will receive. Large differences in award levels create tensions among higher education institutions both within and across the public and private sectors in New Jersey. This report is based on analysis of state data, a review of existing state reports, and discussions with a wide range of constituents, including state officials, institutional administrators, and advocacy organization representatives. New Jersey modifies the federal need analysis methodology, basing TAG awards on the New Jersey Eligibility Index (NJEI) instead of the federal expected family contribution (EFC). We find that less than half of the full-time students in New Jersey who have $0 federal EFCs appear to fall into the lowest category of the NJEI. A much larger share of $0 EFC independent students than dependent students fail to receive the maximum TAG award because they are not in the lowest-need category. Students are not eligible for TAG for as many terms of study as for Pell, and New Jersey has not followed the federal government's lead in providing additional need-based funding for summer enrollment. In addition, the allocation of aid means that minimum TAG awards are high enough to create a large difference between students who just qualify for TAG and those with a slightly higher NJEI who miss out on the program. The following actions would strengthen the TAG program: (1) Improve NJEI transparency. The state should make the TAG eligibility process simpler and more transparent, clarifying differences between the federal EFC and the NJEI and ensuring that additional verification hurdles do not interfere with access to college; (2) Revisit TAG award differences across institutions. Instead of focusing only on differences in published tuition prices, policymakers should focus on differences in the prices institutions charge, net of institutional grant aid, in determining appropriate levels of TAG awards across sectors. Differences in award levels across institutions within sectors are also probably larger than they should be, and the state should review them; (3) Smooth TAG award levels across levels of ability to pay. The state should revisit the tables determining the size of TAG awards for students at different NJEI levels at each institution, ensuring that differences in award levels associated with differences in NJEI are consistent within similar institutions; and (4) Use grant aid to support degree completion. The state should make an effort to include extra funding for summer enrollment, support for students enrolled at least half time, and more equitable funding for independent students.",

        "description":"This paper describes the further development of the &quot;Epidemiology of Eyam&quot; project at Winchester College since the publication of our previous paper (French &quot;et al&quot; 2019 Phys. Educ. 54 045008). A much wider cadre of students have been involved with this recent phase of the study, and we have also benefitted from a sabbatical collaboration with Oxford University Mathematical Institute. It is hoped that the research presented here can be used as a case study for an Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) or equivalent in a range of schools around the UK and worldwide. We feel that a project such as this, with a strong humanities and public health rooted context, could incentivise students of mathematics and sciences to participate in interdisciplinary teams over an educationally significant period, and offer an opportunity to develop vital independent research skills that are required at University, but are often difficult to experience in a School context. The main educational goal of our previous paper was to provide an suitable context to incentivise the introduction of Calculus ideas. In this paper we assume a slightly higher level of mathematical skill, and aim to present a more comprehensive analysis of the epidemiological model that we will refer to as the 'Eyam Equations.' We describe a 'semi-analytic' solution, and make the connection to the approximation of Kermack and McKendrick (Kermack and McKendrick 1927 &quot;Proc. R. Soc. Lond&quot;. A 115 700-21) which held sway for much of the early twentieth century. We revisit the Eyam 1660s plague data of William Mompesson, and also apply the model to Ebola data collected in Liberia during the 2014-16 epidemic in West Africa. Motivated by uncertainty in the size of the 'at-risk' Susceptible population, we re-parameterize the model in terms of alternative inputs which enable a curve-fitting mechanism to be conducted more efficiently, with a much more tightly bounded range of possible parameter values. In addition to a spreadsheet model, we have created a software application in the MATLAB environment which has dynamic tools that could potentially enable a sensible curve fit to be calculated very rapidly in response to new data. From a time series describing the Infective population of the 2014-16 Liberia Ebola epidemic, we can predict Infective I(t), Susceptible S(t) and Dead D(t) populations, calculate the associated total population size N, calculate the Kendall Susceptible threshold &quot;?&quot;, and hence the Basic Reproduction Number R[subscript 0] = N/&quot;?&quot;. For the Liberia Ebola data, these are: N = 2542, &quot;?&quot; = 1373, R[subscript 0] = 1.85. Note this suggests that out of an 'at risk' population of N = 2542, about 75% may ultimately have been infected by the Ebola virus. In the WHO Ebola Response Team report (WHO Ebola Response Roadmap Situation Report), R[subscript 0] = 1.83 plus or minus 0.11 for the 2014-16 Liberia outbreak.",

        "description":"Multiple-baseline studies provide meta-analysts the opportunity to compute effect sizes based on either within-series comparisons of treatment phase to baseline phase observations, or time specific between-series comparisons of observations from those that have started treatment to observations of those that are still in baseline. The advantage of the within-series approach is that because all data are used the treatment effects are expected to be estimated with greater precision, whereas the advantage of the between-series approach is that it does not rely on assumptions that time trends are correctly specified and can be extrapolated -- assumptions that are questionable in contexts where shifts in the time series may result from effects other than the treatment. Regardless of whether within- or between-series comparisons form the basis for the effect size estimates, meta-analysts also need to decide whether to analyze the individual participant data or to analyze effect sizes obtained from the primary studies, and whether or not to standardize the treatment effect with small sample size adjustments to meta-analyze outcomes that are scaled differently across studies. The purpose of this study was to compare eight multilevel modeling based approaches to meta-analyzing multiple-baseline studies. The approaches were defined by the crossing of three analytic decisions: 1) whether to use a within- or between-series estimate of effect, 2) whether to analyze individual participant data or effect sizes, and 3) whether to standardize the effect with sample size adjustments or not. The performance of these multilevel modeling approaches are evaluated based on bias and root mean square error of the estimated treatment effect for a variety of data conditions. A Monte Carlo simulation study is currently being run that examines the eight meta-analytic approaches for data conditions that vary in the number of studies (10, 30), the number of participants per study (4, 8), the number of observations per participant (20, 40), the treatment effect size (0, 1), the treatment effect variance across participants and across studies (0, 1), and the size of randomly placed other than treatment event effects (0, 0.5). For each of the 64 conditions obtained by crossing the design factors, 3000 meta-analyses were simulated, where the generated data and effect estimation were based on an immediate shift in level model and where the within case error variance was set to 1.0. Initial results suggest that within- and between- series effect estimates were comparably well-estimated with lower bias and RMSE when individual participant data were meta-analyzed. Based on initial run times for the simulation program, the full simulation study is expected to be finished in October. Graphical displays will be used to compare the distribution of bias and RMSE results for the eight meta-analytic approaches as a function of the manipulated design factors. Discussion will focus on practical advice for those selecting among multilevel modeling approaches for meta-analyzing multiple-baseline studies, while also highlighting the limitations that arise from the design of the simulation study.",

        "author":["Hill, Venola L."],
        "description":"This practicum was designed to decrease the number of times boys in third, fourth, and fifth grade classes met with the school guidance counselor for unacceptable behaviors and to improve the attitudes of the boys and their parents. Pre- and post-attitudinal and observational questionnaires were administered to 30 randomly selected third, fourth, and fifth grade boys and their parents. Pre- and post-sociometric devices were administered to the boys to elicit their feelings about each other. Self-monitoring records of behaviors were kept by the boys and compared with the counseling log of meetings. Anecdotal records of the boys' behaviors were kept by their teachers. One educational trip was taken. Monthly parents' meetings concentrated on topics of interest and significance.  Small group counseling sessions with the boys focused on topics that would adhere to counseling strategies for behavior improvement. Analysis of data showed that the action plan helped to reduce the number of meetings with the school guidance counselor from a high of 100, and a low of 6, to a high of 70, and a low of 0. Parents and children made attitudinal changes that attributed to the behavior changes. (Author)",

        "description":"This guide outlines a curriculum designed to provide English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) life-skills instruction for refugees in the Chicago metropolitan area, concentrating on the Level One survival skills. Non-Southeast Asians account for more than half of those served, all of whom receive, or are at risk of receiving, public assistance. Most are aged 25-40 years, and two-thirds have been in the United States for longer than 6 months. Approximately 50% have 0-3 years of education in their own countries, and work experiences range from farming/fishing to engineering, with most in unskilled jobs. After initial needs assessment by bilingual staff, Project Work English consists of 3 levels of instruction: Level One, survival, Level Two pre-employment, and Level Three,  pre-employment. Students attend special job workshops, often in their native language, and industry specific needs are also addressed, such as for food production/service, woodcraft, housekeeping, and auto mechanics. The guide includes Work English competencies for Level One and the following instructional units: basic literacy skills; personal identification; money; shopping, time and dates; telephone, health, emergencies; directions; transportation; housing; post office, banking/bills; social language; and clarification. A Level One screening test, key competencies checklist, and Work english achievement test are also included. (Contains six references.) (NAV) (Adjunct ERIC Clearinghouse for ESL Literacy Education)",

        "description":"A new free-response item type for mathematics tests is described. The item type, referred to as the Student-Produced Response (SPR), was first introduced into the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test in 1993 and into the Scholastic Aptitude Test in 1994. Students solve a problem and record the answer by blackening the ovals on a grid that permits numbers from 0 to 999. For the test taker, the use of the SPR format provides a more natural problem-solving situation in which the student must analyze and solve the problem without being influenced by multiple choice alternatives. Responses from students and teachers have generally been positive, agreeing that the format reflects the mathematical ability of the student better than multiple  choice items. There are some drawbacks to the approach, including the length of time required to grid the answer. The ability to enter answers directly into a computer will eliminate this difficulty. The reduction or elimination of guessing has resulted in items with better discrimination indices and improved test reliability. Two figures and two sample items illustrate the discussion. Appendixes A and B contain directions and a sample score report; Appendixes C and D present sample items. (SLD)",

        "author":["Weisenfreund, Anat"],
        "description":"This thesis discusses normal principles of infant development during the first 2 to 3 months of life and applies these principles to the provision of services to drug-exposed infants. Emphasis is on the infant as an active and interactive participant in his/her own development, the primacy of the body during this early developmental period, and the interrelatedness of physical experience and emotional development. Chapter 1 examines underlying assumptions of the infant's basic nature. Cultural assumptions are discussed as is the infant's capacity for subjective experience. Chapter 2 outlines key principles and processes of normal development and provides information on neurobehavioral organization and the organizational model. Chapter 3 evaluates the emotional development and  subjective experience of the infant. The infant's achievement of basic trust, ego integration, and the &quot;coming into being&quot; of the infant's true self is discussed. Chapter 4 provides information on the medical and neurobehavioral effects of intrauterine drug exposure. Also discussed is how various environmental variables impact development of hospitalized infants. Chapter 5 describes a hospital-based early intervention program which stressed that effective clinical interventions with very young drug-exposed infants should be based on normal development.

To provide a numeric summary to students' performance on the assessments, the NAEP used a 0 to 500 scale for each subject area. Comparisons of average scale scores are provided across the years in which trend assessments have been administered and among subpopulations of students. Nationally representative samples totaling approximately 31,000 students were involved in the 1994 assessments. Descriptions of trend results are based on the results of statistical tests that consider the estimates of average performance in each year as well as the degree of uncertainty associated with the estimates. Each sequence of results was  tested for linear and quadratic trends, and these tests were supported by tests that compared results for selected pairs of assessment years within each trend sequence. In science and mathematics, the early decline has been replaced by improved performance in recent years. The overall reading trend has been one of only minimal changes, while writing results have been mixed overall. A procedural appendix explains the methodology of the four assessments.

        "description":"Due to the instability of state funding, California's community colleges have turned to the foundation as a source of alternative fundraising and resource development. To gather data on the foundations in place at California community colleges, a survey was conducted of 50 foundation directors, focusing on how their foundations raised money, what this money was used for, obstacles faced, and other pertinent information. Results of the study, based on responses from 48 directors, included the following: (1) 78% of foundations emphasized raising immediate cash rather than planned-giving programs; (2) 73% of the foundations had paid staff; (3) the president of the college sat on the foundation's board at 92% of the colleges; (4) while the mean amount of raised money in the 1990-91  fiscal year was $458,303, amounts ranged from a low of $0 to a high of $4 million; and (5) 96% of the foundations expended money they raised on student scholarships. No significant differences were found in the responses with respect to college size or location, while a significant difference was found for the existence of paid staff, with foundations having paid staff using personal solicitation and direct mail more often than other foundations. Recommendations for improving foundations' efforts include hiring a professional staff; incorporating a long-range component of planned giving; and involving administrators, faculty, and student leaders.

The program's intensive instructional services component was completed by 2,496 eligible displaced homemakers, 84% of whom were aged 30-59. Of the DHP participants, 84% were white, 75% were separated or divorced, 79% had 0 to 2 dependents, 79% had a high school diploma or its equivalent, 55% received training, and 45% were placed in employment. DHP information/referral service costs and employment/training placement costs averaged $13.84 and $303.85 per person, respectively. The program focused on the following areas: reducing barriers to employment by informing participants of employment and training opportunities, making them aware of their skills  and abilities, increasing their self-confidence, helping them clarify their employment goals, and teaching them job search skills. It was estimated that employment of the 1991-1993 program graduates will generate $3.6 million in state tax revenues in 1993-1995. The program's success was attributed to collaboration among diverse agencies and organizations. A longitudinal study of program graduates and increased funding to meet increasing demands for DHP services were recommended.

        "description":"To test the theory of mental calibration for mental addition it was hypothesized that the mean reaction time for problems in homogeneous sets will be faster than for problems in heterogeneous sets and that the reaction time was inversely related to ability and development (grade level) and independent of gender. Three sets of 40 addition problems were selected from the basic facts, and from combinations of addends in the range of 10 through 29. These combinations were presented by a computer program in a true-false format with the correct answers, and with answers differing by plus or minus one and plus or minue two. The problems were selected so that the digits 0 through 9 appear equally often as the first and last digit, and that the incorrect sum of one half of the problems  was an odd number. Three groups of 40 problems (1-digit, 2-digit, and mixed) were presented in various orders. Results for grade, ability, and task were significant as predicted. One-digit problems in the heterogeneous set took significantly longer than 1-digit problems in the homogeneous set, but there was no significant difference in the context-related processing of 2-digit problems. It appears that mental calibration accounts for some of the processing resources in mental addition, but only in tasks that are in the declarative knowledge of the subject. (Author)",

The program consists of eight action plans, or strands: Arts, Music, Foreign Language, Reading/Language Development, Thinking Skills, Health/Emotional Health, Family Involvement, and Community Involvement. This is a report of the implementation of program goals during the first year of the project. Surveys were distributed to principals in the 12 elementary schools at midyear, and again at the end of the first year of implementation. Midyear surveys were open ended, and the end of the year surveys asked principals to rate the degree to which the steps of the plan had been implemented in their schools. Ratings were from 0 (no  implementation) to 5 (fully implemented). After comparing principals' ratings with the list of 1997-98 goals for implementation, implementation was classified as low, medium, or high for each strand. At midyear, principals reported full implementation on two strands, and some implementation on all strands. Only a few schools reported no implementation at midyear. Strands for Art, Music, and Reading/Language Development had high implementation ratings at the end of the year, and the other strands had medium ratings. There was a clear shift from low and medium ratings at midyear to medium and high ratings at the end of the year. (Contains 10 tables and 56 references.) (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"This fact sheet documents the overrepresentation of status Indian youth in the juvenile justice and child welfare systems of Ontario (Canada). Data are limited to children and youth, age 0-19, whose parents resided on an Indian reserve; who were dealt with by the family court (not criminal court); and whose disposition was probation, training school, observation and detention facility, or care of a Children's Aid Society. Status youth from 26 Indian bands and non-status Indian and Metis youth are not included. As of March 1984, status Indian youth (1.15% of Ontario's juvenile population) constituted 2.1% of all youth on probation, 2.6% of all youth in observation and detention homes or in Children's Aid facilities, and 3.4% of all youth in training schools. Compared to the  situation reported for March 1982, the percentage of training school youth that are status Indians nearly doubled, and percentages in other categories also increased somewhat. In 1983-84, the rate of involvement of status Indian youth was about 2-4 times that of the total population. Nevertheless, the relatively low absolute numbers of status Indian children creates difficulties in justifying to government the need for special programs for these children. A more accurate reflection of the reality should be gained by tracking &quot;Native&quot; young people, including both status and nonstatus Indians, plus Metis and Inuits. (SV)",

A previous study using national data from the High School and Beyond data set failed to confirm the hypothesis. This study sought to test the hypothesis further by limiting the analysis to students in a single state, using multiple indicators of educational disadvantage, and applying more rigorous control over background variables known to affect academic achievement. The group studied included all (13,553) students in Grades 4, 6, and 8 who had attended the same school since first grade and who had participated in the fall 1989 Alaska Statewide Student Testing Program. The disadvantaged status of students was rated on a scale of 0-4, with 1  point each given for minority ethnic status, migrant education status, Chapter 1 status, and handicapped status. Data were analyzed with multiple regression analysis, controlling for school resources, school climate, and student academic background. While the overall average achievement score was lower for students in small schools than in large schools, results indicated that: (1) the negative effect of disadvantaged background on student achievement is significantly less in small than in medium or large schools; and (2) the interaction of disadvantaged status and school size explains an additional, significant amount of variance in student achievement.

        "description":"The COVID-19 pandemic forced higher education to develop new strategies to meet the needs of students. One of the most critical issues was delivering an online experience in undergraduate Biology laboratories aimed at meeting hands-on outcomes, specifically within the health sciences. Hybrid lab group models in which students rotated between in-person and online attendance represented one such option. A student population of 71 at Minnesota State University, Mankato was studied to observe the effects on student exam scores. Negative student perceptions were made clear in course feedback surveys, and students that attended 2+ labs via Zoom preceding an exam were associated with a lower Exam I score compared to peers that only attended 0-1 labs via Zoom. Three class strategies were introduced before Exam II, meant to improve online learning. The Exam II scores saw no overall significant difference between groups, with Multi-Zoom students closing the gap from Exam I. Importantly, Multi-Zoom students that utilized the class strategies significantly outperformed Multi-Zoom students that that did not use them. Although any classroom results represent a mix of variables, the risks of online labs intended to assess hands-on and data interpretation outcomes of Human Physiology can be detrimental when targeted strategies are absent.",

Subjects were divided into two group, experimental and control and measured their result using posttest only control group design. There are six instruments consisting six items used to measure mathematical concepts understanding. The results confirmed that H[subscript 0] is rejected, while Ha is accepted proved by t count (3.132)&gt;t[subscript table] (1.674). It means there is a significant difference between the of both groups (experimental and control). In addition, the results indicated that the IDEA learning models is effective to assist students in understanding mathematical concepts showed by the higher score of experimental groups than control group. Three factors are involved in order to implement the IDEA learning model effectively; namely: individual problem-solving opportunities, active student involvement, and guidance and assistance (from lecturer) on the IDEA learning model.

The current study sought to evaluate the presence of differential item functioning (DIF) in ACCReS items and the magnitude of DIF, if detected. With a national sample of 999 grade K-12 teachers in the United States, we examined measurement invariance of ACCReS items in relation to responses from (a) racially and ethnically minoritized (REM) youth and white teachers (teacher race), (b) teachers in schools with 0-50% and 51-100% REM youth (student race), and (c) teachers with &lt;1-5 years of teaching experience and teachers with &gt;5 years of experience. Findings suggested that ACCReS items exhibited negligible levels of DIF. The lack of DIF found provides additional evidence for the validity of scores from the ACCReS to assess teachers' cultural responsiveness. Furthermore, descriptive analyses revealed that teachers were more likely to agree with items pertaining to their own classroom practice than items related to access to adequate training and support.

First, we use a national district level panel of data from the School Finance Indicators Database to evaluate recent (2012-2017) disparities in school revenue and spending by race in addition to poverty, across and within all states and within selected states. Next, we use data from the National Education Cost Model (NECM) to evaluate disparities in spending against estimates of &quot;costs&quot; of achieving national average student outcomes to determine racial differences in gaps between current spending and costs of equitable outcomes. As Latinx shares increase, per pupil spending and revenue decrease, respectively by about 4% to 7% for districts that are approximately 100% Latinx compared to those that have few or no Latinx students, controlling for poverty. More striking, when controlling for poverty, a district that is 100% Latinx is nearly 2.5 times as likely as a district that is 0% Latinx to be financially disadvantaged (have revenue &lt;90% of labor market average, and poverty greater than 120%), when controlling for poverty and 28.5 times as likely when not controlling for poverty. Finally, spending is less adequate to achieve national average outcomes, across states, in districts serving larger shares of Latinx students.",

        "description":"South Africa, like many developing countries, is heavily burdened by high dropout and unemployment rates and an undersupply of skilled workers. Grade retention is a common practice when learners do not meet the specific requirements--especially in countries with limited socio-economic resources. In South Africa, 52% of the learners are retained at least once before they reach Grade 10. However, the results of this study clearly suggest that the policy of repeated scholastic retention does not contribute positively to the academic achievement or to career maturity of Grade 11 and Grade 12 learners in township schools in South Africa. This study emphasises the importance of improving learner performance, starting in the Foundation Phase (Grade 0/R to Grade Three) and the need for accessible career guidance and counselling for all learners. By guiding these at-risk learners into vocation-oriented or technically oriented directions before the career maturity and academic achievement decline emerges, a decrease in dropout and an increase in the outflow of skilled people in the short term and unemployment in the long term may be addressed. The latter can be regarded as the cornerstone of socio-economic development and enhanced social capital in all developing countries.",

        "description":"Business analytics is a fast-growing area in practice. The rapid growth of business analytics in practice in the recent years is mirrored by a corresponding fast evolution of new educational programs. While more than 130 graduate and undergraduate degree programs in business analytics have been launched in the past 5 years, no commonly accepted model of business analytics curriculum yet exists. Drawing on competency-based curriculum design literature, we take the first steps towards initiating a debate on the model curriculum in business analytics. We analyze a sample of business analytics job announcements from different industries and identify a preliminary set of business analytical competencies sought in practice. Further, we examine six existing graduate programs in business analytics, which reveal divergent approaches to business analytics curricula. These institutions were selected since they offered a graduate degree program in business analytics for at least two years. Our findings indicate that there are significant variations in the program structure in terms of program length (10 to 18 months) and flexibility (electives comprise 0 to 37% of the course work). We also found that the programs vary greatly in the coverage of both traditional analytics and the new emergent technologies and analytical methods. We conclude with a commentary on the emergent trends in business analytics in practice and the opportunities presented by these trends for the academia.",

This study investigates 55 male and 25 female participants, aged 24 to 49, randomly selected from among the physical education and sport teachers in government and private schools in the cities of Edirne, Tekirdag, and Kirklareli of the Trakya region of Turkey. The evaluation form includes 72 courses (questions) taken by the participants from departments of physical education and sport at universities in Turkey. The participants were given four weeks to assess the courses on the evaluation form according to their professional past experience. The participants gave scores from 0 (unimportant) to 5 (very important) to all courses. According to the study, in the opinion of physical education and sport teachers, some of the courses were not needed in their professional careers: (1) practical courses (education: wrestling, mountaineering, ski, judo, etc.), (2) theoretical courses (education: statistics, seminars and projects, Olympic sports, etc.) and (3) pedagogical formation (education sociology). As a result of this study, it was argued that the courses that received low scores on the evaluation should be re-evaluated or eliminated from the curriculum. Moreover, the course hours and contents could be rearranged and developed.",

The facilities as mentioned in the RTE Act should reach into the hands of students properly and the teachers should have a good awareness level. This article explores the awareness of RTE Act 2009 among elementary school teachers in Coimbatore District. In this article, survey method was adopted with 100 elementary school teachers taken as a sample from Coimbatore District. A Personal Data Sheet was used to collect demographic information like qualification, locale, teaching experience and type of management. It was found that awareness level of average group was highest with 58% of the total sample. The mean scores of teachers in rural area was higher than the mean scores of urban area. In this case mean scores of under graduate teachers and post graduate teachers as well as teachers having teaching experience between 0 and 10 years and between 10 and 20 years are almost equal. From the total analysis it was found that the teachers are required to have better awareness about RTE Act in order to attain the aim of the Act.",

        "description":"This article attempts to suggest the existence of a human computer called Quantum Human Computer (QHC) on the basis of an analogy between human beings and computers. To date, there are two types of computers: Binary and Quantum. The former operates on the basis of binary logic where an object is said to exist in either of the two states of 1 and 0. The latter, however, operates on the basis of fuzzy logic where an object can exist in more than two states simultaneously. Through analogy, it is hypothesized that human beings are superb quantum computers that operate on the basis of human logic that accepts multiple states for objects simultaneously. Moreover, and since human beings are composed of physique, mind, memory, soul, and spirit, it is also hypothesized that the QHC legalizes the existence of objects in Hilbert space. Finally, it is further suggested that, as fictitious as it may seem, human learning can be reduced into a &quot;suggestion model&quot; whereby information is suggested into the human computer in much the same way as a given software is assembled on a digital computer; the paper proposes a model for human learning based on its description of the quantum human computer. It is claimed that human learning can be whole sale rather than being linear, sequential and time-consuming. Sleep and hypnosis are presented as examples.",

In a second phase we sought to determine how students perceived the received classes for a time later. We analysed data collected during implementation, through cooperative learning, of two teaching units to a total of six groups of students; in addition, a number of interviews, five individual and one collective, were carried out to a total of 1 0 former students who had left school between one and five years earlier. The results show the positive effects of cooperative learning on students' motor performance, and some social achievements such as a greater autonomy of the students in the learning process, an increasing in prosocial behaviours and the inclusion of pupils with special educational needs. On the other hand, as time went on, the students rated the received classes as cooperative, participatory, funny and useful, emphasizing peer support as a key factor that enabled them to learn in Physical Education.",

Establishing consensus among the target groups through this Delphi study will allow Idaho Team Ag Ed to be specific and purposeful in long term professional development planning. Through this study, 21 professional development areas were agreed upon in three areas: Teacher Skills and Knowledge (8); Personal Skills and Professional Development (6); and Program Area Concerns (7). Volume of work was the area of highest concern (n = 92, 90.11%) followed by classroom management skills and teaching experience (n = 81, 89.01%) and 79 of the 91 respondents (86.81%) agreed that finding alternative funding sources was an area of concern followed closely by overall program funding (n = 79 of 90 responses, 87.78%). The consensus supported previous research across the country and will provide a guide for targeted professional development, mentorship, and long-term retention for beginning teachers (0-5 years' experience) in Idaho.",

Results suggested two dimensions were captured by the 41 items, entitled &quot;knowledge, skills and behavior in promoting student achievement,&quot; and &quot;resource use, academic language, and numeracy,&quot; with reliability of person separation of 0.94 and 0.73, respectively. Use of the 0-4 response scale was appropriate for both dimensions. Items were relatively easy to agree with for both scales, with person means of 1.24 and 0.57. Differential item functioning was found for respondent group and also for extent of program involvement but not for sex or for route to certification.

        "description":"Self-direction in learning is a major topic in the field of adult learning. There has been extensive coverage of the topic by theorists, researchers, and practitioners. However, there have been few studies which look at learner self-direction specifically as a personality trait. The present study addresses the relationship between learner self-direction and other personality traits of college students when the traits represented by the five-factor model of personality (Digman, 1990) are differentiated from narrow personality traits. Archival data were used from an undergraduate sample at a large Southeastern U.S. university (sample size = 1981). Correlation and multiple regression analyses were used in examining the unique individual relationship between Big Five and narrow personality traits and learner self-direction. Analysis of the data revealed five significant part correlations between specific traits and learner self-direction. The part correlations for Work Drive (0.30), Openness 0(.19), and Optimism (0.12) were significantly higher than all other part correlations. Neither Conscientiousness nor Agreeableness had significant part correlations despite having significant zero-order correlations with learner self-direction. Extraversion did not have a significant zero-order correlation with learner self-direction but the part correlation was significant. Results were discussed in terms of the predictive relationship between personality variables and learner self-direction. Study implications, some limitations, and possible directions for future research were noted.",

        "description":"In this study, a collection of lullabies which have an important place in Turkish culture and which form an important genre in folk literature are examined to find out distribution and presentation of geographical terms in the lullabies in this collection. In the study, 2480 lullabies in Turkish Lullabies which is one of the leading collections in Turkey and 1320 lullabies, which were still being collected when the study was conducted, have been examined. These lullabies were accepted as linguistic sample of the study. Content analysis and discourse analysis were used in the study. Lullabies were transformed to the computers, their word counts and lists have been obtained. Among these words, the one related to geography were grouped and content analysis was conducted. Later on, the lullabies were submitted to content analysis, and the researcher depicted how geographical terms were presented. Results of the study indicated that approximately 10% of the words in the lullabies are related to geography. The lullabies presented environmental and geographic information from immediate environment to remote environment and starting from concrete and experiences. In the respects, lullabies can be used as instructional materials to teach geography to children aged 0 to 6. It is suggested that lullabies should be collected, saved and used in education as primary source of information in linguistic development and in other fields in pre-school period.",

        "description":"The curriculum was developed by the First Years Together program, a demonstration service and training model providing coordinated medical, educational, mental health, and public health services to maximize the social-emotional, physical, and cognitive development of high risk infants. The first chapter provides instructions for use of the curriculum by mental health and health-related professionals. Four distinctive characteristics of the model's assessment-intervention sessions are explained in the second chapter: (1) parent-professional partnership, (2) assessment as intervention, (3) anticipatory guidance, and (4) parent support. The third chapter looks at the post-hospital period, considering such aspects as infant physiological control, the fears and feelings of parents,  the support system, and expenses. The remaining chapters provide assessment and intervention activities for infants in the age ranges of 0-3 months, 3-6 months, 6-9 months, and 9-15 months. The curriculum in each chapter covers infant development, emotional milestones, and family issues. Typically provided for a behavior is an explanation, samples of praise for parents, and related suggestions to encourage parents in fostering infant development. After an extensive bibliography, seven appendixes offer suggestions for talking to a toddler, sample songs and finger plays, criteria for choosing a therapist, and sample forms and newsletters.

        "description":"Job stress is an area of research in which the relationships among job stressors (characteristics of the workplace) and individual strains (responses of the individual worker) are explored. The uncertainty model of occupational stress proposes that the two uncertainties (of effort-to-performance or E--&gt;P and performance-to-outcome or P--0&gt;) are intervening variables between some job stressors and individual strains. It is inherent in the uncertainty model that the two uncertainties can function as intervening variables between some job stressors and individual strains. Also, supervisory practices have long been thought to contribute to role conflict and role ambiguity, and the uncertainty model is therefore consistent with the proposition that conflict and ambiguity would be  intervening variables between supervisors' styles and the uncertainties. This study examined these intervening various possibilities. Subjects were 106 employees of 260 (response rate was 41%) in 3 offices of a large accounting firm who responded to questionnaires measuring supervisory styles, job stressors, uncertainties, and outcomes. Overall there was mixed support for the uncertainty theory of occupational stress. Role conflict and role ambiguity were related to estimate effort-to-outcome and performance-to-outcome uncertainties in different, predicted ways. Supervisory styles tended to be less strongly related to the uncertainties than the role stressors were, and they also tended to be more strongly related to the role stressors than to the uncertainties.

Included also are a discussion of early childhood curricula with suggestions for selecing curricula for deaf blind students and a description of the sensorimotor period of development noting developmental lags and atypical behaviors observed in many deaf-blind children. Part 2 of the manual describes the following steps for adapting curricula: (1) collect  functional assessment data; (2) plan functional individualized program; (3) implement adapted activity; and (4) maintain and generalize new skills. In Part 3, 14 examples of adapted activities exemplifying concepts of means ends/causality, spatial relations, object permanence, and relationshp to objects are given. Five readings on orientation and mobility, vision, hearing, toy selection, and sensory integration are presented in the fourth section.

Using a needs-based, social support approach, it provides and mediates child- and family-level resources and services for approximately 300 families of handicapepd and at-risk children, 0-6 years old. The conceptual bases of the program's assessment and intervention procedures are family- and systems-oriented. Family-level needs and goals are identified and all intervention efforts are based on those needs. A social systems orientation is used to analyze the complex relationships among needs, resources, and support. Professional staff take on expanded roles as counselors/listeners, consultants, resources, enablers, mediators, catalysts/mobilizers,  teachers/therapists, and advocates. Project HAPPEN (Helping Agencies Promote Parent Empowerment through Networking) is a model-demonstration project which operationalizes the FIPP approach. A major goal of this project is the empowerment of parents of special needs children to identify their needs and resources independently as they prepare for a transition phase of service delivery for their child. Project HAPPEN's major components include, among others, involvement in interagency networking, assessment of child and parent strengths and needs, assessment of the empowerment process, development of family action plans, and intervention.

Survey responses were received from 49 states. Forty states reported plans to use the Employment and Training Administration adjustment methodology to establish local performance standards. Of the 40 states that use the methodology to establish service delivery area (SDA) standards, 36 found its ability to be applied objectively to SDAs to be a strength. States who used it felt the lack of uniform data definitions was the greatest cause for concern. The proportion of 6 percent funds used for incentive awards remained stable or increased and ranged from 0 to 100 percent. The most common type of eligibility criterion for an  incentive award was the requirement that a particular number of standards be met or exceeded. Eighty-five percent of the states had a reporting system for the attainment of youth employment competencies. Sixty percent of the SDAs had youth employment competency systems actively serving youth. Preemployment competencies were the most common categories of competencies offered, with work maturity a close second. Eighty percent of the states reported they would have operational follow-up systems in place by the beginning of program year 1986. (YLB)",

A wide range in levels of thinking among the subjects was found; some were consistent in identifying, naming, comparing and operating on geometry figures; others were able to give informal deductive explanations (level 2). It was also found that the inability to advance in  level of thinking may be related to their deficiencies in language, both in knowledge of geometry vocabulary and ability to use it precisely and consistently. In addition, textbook material on geometry provides students with little opportunity to make progress to higher levels of thinking and may actually impede such progress by concentrating on level 0 thinking and reducing the level of thinking for topics which can be treated at levels 1-2.

Yavapai education is tied to the family and the community, and specific educational objectives exist for ages 0-2, 3-5, 6-12, 13-25, 25-45, and over 45. The Yavapai community values each person as an individual without regard to achievement in institutional settings. In contrast, Anglo education is separate from the community and the family. The  Anglo community values individuals for the skills and work they can perform as they pass through a series of institutions related to their stage in life. Community based education should develop formal educational training and instruction that is compatible with community values and should integrate that education with daily learning in community activities. Therefore, community based education for Fort McDowell should combine basic skills instruction in reading, writing, English, and math with instruction in the Yavapai language, history, and values.

        "description":"Findings are presented from a project which aimed to estimate the prevalence of developmental disabilities among Navajo children, aged 0-5 years, living in the Navajo Nation; determine what services they and their families require; and recommend policy and practice to assure that needed services are received. Section I provides a description of the project's background and purpose. Section II analyzes and compares prevalence rates based on diagnostic and functional criteria. A prevalence rate ranging from less than 1 percent to about 2.3 percent (100-644 children) is estimated. Services required by children with developmental disabilities and their families are outlined in Section III, and the present status of services, based on an agency survey, is reported. Policy and practice  recommendations focus on four areas: underlying values, guiding policy, direct services, and administrative supports. Among recommendations are the desirability of delivering services in the most appropriate setting, coordinating existing resources, promoting community awareness, strengthening the family support system, developing an improved client information system, and developing a Navajo protection and advocacy system. References are included. Appendices describe provisions of the Early Childhood Education Act (Public Law 99-457) and legislation pertaining to the Navajo Trust Fund. (JW)",

        "description":"It has been shown that internally generated (thought or imagination) and externally generated (events, things, or people encountered in the past) autobiographical memories differ in characteristic ways. To examine the consequences of rehearsal on simulated perceived and imagined autobiographical memories, 36 undergraduate students participated in a 3-day experiment. During the first day, subjects perceived six situations and imagined another six situations. On the second day, subjects rated their memories for each of the situations, using a 7-point scale. They then were instructed to think about each situation 0, 4, or 8 times and were cued with an event label on each rehearsal trial. On the third day, subjects rehearsed the situations again, and rated their memories. Results  showed that rehearsal affected some aspects of the memories but not others. For example, rehearsal had parallel effects on both perceived and imagined memories for all visual attributes. Perceived memories were sharper, had more colors, more visual details, and were more vivid than imagined memories. In addition, perceived memories were more detailed and more comprehensive than imagined ones, and subjects had less doubts and better overall memory for perceived than for imagined events. These findings agree with previous reality monitoring findings that people distinguish between memories for perceived and imagined events basing their judgments on the typical attributes of each type of memory.

It was a descriptive study in which the questionnaires were developed to collect the data, and it was analyzed applying t test and chi square. It revealed that GCE-O-level results are better due to the availability of competent teachers, educational equipments, management and incentives given to teachers. The examination system also promotes understanding conceptual clarity instead of cramming. It also revealed that the teacher practise Direct, Audio Lingual and activity based methods in GCE-O-level system whereas at SSC level system Grammar Translation and Lecture methods were frequently used by the teachers.

        "description":"Our plan is to bring professors and their Moroccan pupils to focus on the teaching-learning of physics, without adopting forced mathematical modeling in previously unknown frames and registers, as is actually the practice. The preliminary study consists of developing a new analytical model for the teaching-learning of the radioactive decay law. However, the validation study was conducted to test its pertinence. The results show that, compared to the official model, pupils are very satisfied. In fact, the proposed new model intelligibility frame facilitates the linking of the concept of space of reality, with those of registers and frames. The pupils' performance amounted to 65.33% in the development of the analytical model of the radioactive decay law, while in terms of suitable applications, pupil performance ranged from 0% to 75%. This result is partly due to the collaborative work, which induced a very significant increase in pupil performance. They were observed between increases ranging from 33.3% to 69.5%. In fact, we attribute these good performances to the ICT resources' mobilization, specifically SimulP200, the one that we have exclusively elaborated. These resources have also mitigated the difficulties of the experiment, and those related to the processes of elaboration of different radioactive decay law model.",

        "description":"This paper reports the performance of 30 rising seventh-grade girls on a task in which they were asked to order four fractions from least to greatest. Less than three-fifths attained correct answers. The performance gap was widest between students who attended Title I schools and those who did not, the latter being much more likely to attain correct answers. The achievement gap was less prominent by race/ethnicity, family socioeconomic status, and community type (suburban/urban versus rural). Participants tended to use conceptual and procedural approaches equally, but conceptual approaches were more successful. The most common conceptual strategy was making drawings that illustrated part-whole concepts, and the most common procedural strategy was converting fractions to equivalent fractions. The most problematic fractions to place in order of relative size were the two middle fractions, which were somewhat closer to each other in size than other adjacent pairs and were farthest from the benchmarks of 0 or 1. Based on these and other research findings, we conclude that it would benefit students to possess a greater repertoire of specific strategies, especially conceptual strategies such as use of number lines, benchmarks, and set models, for working with fractions.",

In this regard, on the data acquired from 1046 candidates who entered to Foreign National Student Exam (FNSE) held in year 2016 by Mersin University (MEU) and answered Basic Skills subtest, using different missing data handling methods, differential item functioning analyses with Mantel Haenszel, Standardization and Likelihood Ratio Test methods are performed. Basic Skills test consists of 80 multiple choice items. The items are all binary scored (1-0) items. Among the participants 523 are female and 523 are male. The findings showed that the number of items flagged as DIF has changed with the used missing data handling methods. The DIF detection methods based on Classical Test Theory are more consistent within themselves compared to DIF detection method based on Item Response Theory, whereas the used missing data handling methods differentiate the DIF detected items and this difference reaches a significant level for Mantel Haenszel method.

The present study evaluates a South African attempt to estimate the level of difficulty, as distinct from cognitive demand, to exit-level examination papers in Life Sciences. A team of four expert raters assigned a level of difficulty ranging from 1 (easy) to 4 (very difficult). Invalid items were assigned a difficulty level of 0. The reference point was &quot;the ideal average South African learner.&quot; Discussion and practice was conducted for 12 examination papers, followed by individual analysis of four examination papers. Inter-rater agreement for the final four papers was low. Raters assigned most items to difficulty levels 1 and 2, indicating that unreliability may be caused by the instrument having too many levels. Raters' predictions of levels of difficulty supported the actual mark distribution for private school candidates, but not for public school candidates. The &quot;ideal average South African learner&quot; is an unsuitable reference point in the unequal educational landscape of the public school system.

Begun in 1920 as a reaction to a world that produced World War I, the Society of Brothers now has three communities in the United States and one in England. Since its inception, communal ownership, adherence to certain religious values, and the care of young children have been important aspects of this communal society. A child first enters the Children's House at age 6 weeks for a few hours each day. As the child grows older he or she spends more time, including Saturday and Sunday  morning, in the Children's House. At 8th grade level the children attend the local public schools. Characteristics of educational programs from the first through the fourth grade level are described in detail while programs beyond the fourth grade level are briefly outlined. Also described are characteristics of the community, general attitudes toward children, and conditions favoring healthy prenatal development. In conclusion, an attempt is made to compare children who grow up in communities of the Society of Brothers to non-community children. (Author/RH)",

Involving the use of editorial judgment and data on student use, this process includes five levels of evaluation and revision: (0) materials are reviewed for subject matter accuracy, instructional psychology, and message design; (1) materials pass through several cycles of formal debug, using skilled and critical students to look at every display with different types of mental sets characteristic of students and catch problems in answer processing; (2) lessons and units are tested on 20 or more students enrolled in convenient institutions to identify those lessons, segments, and  displays which produce confusion or difficulty; (3) courses, lessons, and units are tested on 20 or more community college students to discover any remaining areas causing difficulties; and (4) courses, units, and lessons are tested on several hundred community college students. Modifications indicated by the results in each step are part of the on-going process. The most advantageous role during this period for Educational Testing Service (ETS), which would perform a separate summative evaluation of the final revised version, was seen as facilitator of interchange between the developers and the users and as a facilitator of the formative evaluation process.

        "description":"Research was conducted to develop and gather evidence of validity for a normative process model to be used by community adult education councils in establishing priority among community-level needs. The study design was based on a five-stage problem solving, systems model involving exploration, model building, design and development, validation, and implementation. A prototype process model utilizing a rating scale was developed to determine priorities based on (1) contribution to goals--the goal's importance to the need and the need's contribution to the goal definition, (2) magnitude of discrepancy--discrepancy between the present and valued future situation, (3) immediacy--immediacy of attention the need requires, (4) instrumental value--effect meeting one need has on meeting  other needs, (5) resource availability--current resource availability for meeting the need, and (6) commitment to change--relevant publics' commitment to eliminating discrepancies between the present and future situation. The decision-making body assigns weights to the criteria. Judgments using individual criteria are made on a 0-10 scale. Twenty-one research questions were formulated covering the five dimensions of model validity. It was concluded that the model must be refined but that it holds promise as a tool for prioritizing needs. (The supplementary materials contain information on the criteria and rating scales.)

        "description":"This study tested the hypothesis that regular communication students are oriented to more symbols and their meanings than are developmental communication students and thus have more ways to receive information. One-hundred students (50 regular and 50 developmental) at Central Piedmont Community College were given the 220-item Cognitive Style Interest Inventory, developed by Oakland Community College. The inventory measures major and minor cognitive style orientations. Results substantiated the hypothesis. Of the four major theoretical symbol orientations (auditory, visual, linguistic, and quantitative), regular students had a mean of 1.44 major orientations while developmental students had a mean of 1.04 major orientations. Fifteen developmental students and eight regular  students were found to have major orientations to no theoretical symbols. Of the fifteen qualitative symbol orientations, regular students had a range of 3 to 15 major orientations with a mean of 9.94. Developmental students had a range of 0 to 13 major orientations with a mean of 6.84. Implications for instruction are discussed. A list of symbols and their meanings, a graph of theoretical symbolic orientations of the two groups, a graph of qualitative symbolic orientations of the two groups, a qualitative orientation profile for each group, a literature review, and a bibliography are included.

        "description":"A second year of experimental research on young children examined the instructional power of television in facilitating the acquisition of cognitive skills. In addition, researchers investigated the efficiency of an instructional support system designed to maximize the results of educational television. Subjects were three- to five-year-old Native American children attending Head Start centers on the Papago Reservation in Arizona. The four experimental studies undertaken demonstrated that programed television presentations can influence complex cognitive capabilities in preschool children. Sequentially structured televised instruction based on social learning principles was differentially effective for different cognitive tasks and for different age groups. It was concluded that  with a skill such as seriation where perceptual cues are clear, TV modeling of the rules and strategies may be sifficient to teach the concept. Enumeration and conservation skills showed a gradient 0-age-related additive value attributable to direct instruction designed to supplement the TV presentations. One implication of these results was that, in general, a single approach in programing may not be equally effective for the teaching of all kinds of conceptual rules, and direct instruction may be necessary to supplement televised instruction for young children.

Central hypothesis was that Spanish Americans were less mobile than Anglo Americans in this region. Data were collected in a personal interview survey of 800 households in the 7-county region. Every city and most rural villages were cluster-sampled to reflect the rural-urban, sex, and occupational makeup of the region's population. Willingness to commute and to relocate were measured by specially constructed bidding games. Analyses were restricted to data from 643 completed questionnaires. Analysis included 2 phases: (1) a cross-classification analysis of mean scores by ethnic group and other  socioeconomic variables and (2) a stepwise multiple regression analysis of socioeconomic characteristics and the 2 dependent variables--willingness to commute and to relocate. Some findings were: (1) Spanish Americans were more willing to commute but less willing to relocate than were Anglo Americans; (2) young household heads were more willing to commute than the older ones; (3) commuters tended to be younger, Spanish American, and male with lower occupational status, lower educational levels, and larger families (more dependents); and (4) Anglo Americans with 0-6 years of education indicated the greatest willingness to relocate.

Major emphasis is on motor learning in relation to the physical and motor characteristics of the child's maturation and development. In the first three sections of the study, general ideas concerning motor learning are discussed. Topics presented include the following: (a) maturation and motor learning; (b) development and motor learning; and (c) transfer and motor learning. The final sections of the report concentrate on more specific aspects of the motor learning of children, focusing on the following age groups: (a) infancy: ages 0-2; (b) early childhood: ages 2-6; and (c) late childhood: ages 6-12. Research dealing with factors known to influence the motor  learning of children, such as appropriate levels of sensory stimulation, critical learning periods, exposure to a variety of basic skills, the child's interest, motor readiness, and sex differences is also reviewed. The study concludes that more research is needed in many areas concerned with motor learning of children, including the following: (a) various learning phenomena in relation to children's acquisition of motor skills; (b) the influence that the learning of motor skills has on the child's social, intellectual, and emotional development; and (c) the kind of experiences, amount of exposure to each experience, and timing of introduction of each experience in order for learning to be most effective.

Classes, stressing prevocational readiness and personal growth, had similar class hours, numbers of students, and a representative sample of out of school youth and adults in the Cincinnati Public Schools ABE program. The classes, which focused on learning skills rather than content, offered 100 hours of instruction in language arts, arithmetic, and general education based largely on printed materials. The learning laboratory provided for independent study and individualized  instruction through a variety of programed and self-instructional materials as well as audiovisual aids. Much study was accomplished at home in leisure hours. Two major findings were that average gains in test scores showed educational needs being served by both approaches; but that Level 3 gains, being somewhat lower than anticipated, indicate a need for more of both traditional and programed materials.

Grammaticalness (G), meaningfulness (M), and familiarity (F) are three variables which are potentially such. In order to study the effect of violating these variables upon Ss' responses to deviant sentences, 85 deviant and 15 correct sentences were assigned to eight groups representing all combinations of two values (&quot;correct&quot; or &quot;deviant&quot;) on these three variables. The 100 sentences were given to four equal groups of Ss (total N=112), who rated each sentence from 0 to 10 on the basis of either grammaticalness (G*), meaningfulness (M*), familiarity(F*), or ordinariness(O*). The data of the first three groups were then combined into an 84 by 100 matrix. A principal components analysis was  performed on the cross-product matrix with a varimax rotation. Four interpretable factors emerged, accounting for 89% of the variability. Factor I was a general comprehensibility factor in the factor loadings, related to changes in all three variables. However, the familiarity Ss scored highest on Factor I. Factors II and III represented G-G* and M-M*, respectively, in both factor loadings and factor scores. Factor IV corresponded to the F variable in the factor loadings, but was uninterpretable for the factor scores.

The procedures for identifying the domains of content material, assigning the material to grade levels, developing the instruments, collecting and analyzing data, and sampling are briefly described. The test instruments were produced in a cloze format, and a description and justification of the cloze procedure are provided. According to cloze research, scores between 0 and 35% suggest that little or no information can be gained; between 35 and 50%, some information can be  gained but the task is difficult and guided instruction is necessary; and greater than 50%, information can be gained independently with ease and comfort. Composite results for grade four indicate that 68% of the students scored less than 35% correct, 13% between 35 and 50%, and 19% above 50%. In grade seven, 56% scored below 35% correct, 16% between 35 and 50% and 28% above 50%. Breakdowns of scores by content type and attendance area are given.

        "description":"A study was conducted at Catonsville Community College to investigate the relationship between grade received and attendance during the fall 1971 semester. No attempt was made to establish a cause-effect relationship. Analyses were based upon a sample of individual grades and percentage of attendance as reported by faculty. Grades analyzed totaled 9,322 (5,525 freshman and 3,797 sophomore grades), 56% of the total number of grades. Data were analyzed for these subgroups: freshmen, sophomores, new students, returning students, transfer students, full-time, part-time, numbers of credits completed, and composite profiles. \"Beyond toleration\" levels were established for percentage of absences beyond which the level of absence group's mean grade was below 2.0. The data clearly  establish the existence of a strong relationship between attendance and grade awarded for the population as a whole and within each group. The degree of the relationship is highest for students completing 0-10 credits. Mean QPA's for each of the other groups rise as the degree of the relationship lessens. Thirty-eight percent of all F grades in the sample occurred within the absence level that could be tolerated. Grade distribution and academic action data do not support a hypothesis that the present attendance policy has had an adverse effect upon grades or withdrawals. (KM)",

Students were grouped in English classes according to their spelling and language scores on the Stanford Achievement Test, Form X, in classes of from 10 to 12 and into four reading levels on the basis of tests scores on the Stanford Diagnostic Reading Test. Participating teachers were chosen for their ability to deal with students from a low socio-economic level. Results of the project indicated that the combination of small classes, material geared to the interests and abilities of the students, and an atmosphere which encouraged participation and individual progress had produced  improvement in language skills. The statistics based on the X & W forms of the SAT scores of the random pilot group are as follows: Spelling +1 Month; Language +6.5 months; Overall +4.5 months. A control group receiving traditional instruction showed the following results: Spelling +0; Language +5.6 months; Overall +2.8 months. The teachers concluded that a curriculum of this sort should not begin unless provisions are made to continue it for several years and they recommended various ways to set up the program and to carry it out.

The data were collected via a test that was developed by the authors. The findings of the study demonstrate that the prospective elementary mathematics teachers had difficulty in defining the concept of limit of a sequence and in determining the graphical representations of the variables and the inequalities in the formal definition. Moreover, they also had difficulty comprehending the relationship between the variables of [open-mid front unrounded vowel] and n[subscript 0] , and hence, when a numerical value was assigned to one of these variables, they were not able to find an appropriate value for the other. It was concluded that the prospective mathematics teachers generally tended to memorize the formal definition of the limit of sequences but lacked conceptual understanding of its meaning. Therefore, they were not able to reason about the variables it contained.",

In addition to this, establishing interaction with other people brings along the notion of competition. Anxiety is a term which leads to various results among the individuals depending on the occasion. It can be said generally that anxiety is a physiological and psychological state which may occur in case of an activity or a state and which may have negative impacts. So as to understand the effect of anxiety on English learning, a survey was carried out. The students at the Karabuk University constitute the universe of this study. The survey was conducted in the spring term of the 2020-2021 AY. There were 62 participants who want to be English teachers after the graduation. They were from all grades; daytime, evening and distance-education programs at Karabuk University. The participants were aged between 21 and 27-over. They took part in the survey voluntarily. The statistical analyses of survey are performed by means of the IBM-SPSS Statistics, Version 23·0 program (Armonk, New York). The salience level is set to 0,05. The total scores, standard deviations, and mean measurement values are calculated with descriptive analysis.

However, it is children who are most affected by the problems arising from climate change and will be affected in the future. Within this scope, the aim of this study is to examine the effects of climate change on children through the current literature and to interpret the studies on this subject in Turkey. The research was conducted in a qualitative way and content analysis method was used. The content of the study was limited to researches focusing individuals aged 0-12, including early and late childhood. National studies in Turkey on climate change for children and their education are included in the scope. According to the results, there has been a noticeable increase in studies on the effects of climate change on children and their education, especially in the last five years. Furthermore, most of the studies focus on examining dimensions such as knowledge, awareness, perception and attitude. However, there is a great need at the moment to teach children, who are the architects of the future, permanent environmentally and eco-friendly behaviors.",

The author, who earned his master's while in prison, argues that education offers prisoners the best chance of staying out of prison after their release, as well as qualifying them for a decent job and easing social reintegration. The author outlines the approaches prisoners can take to finance an A.A., B.A., or master's degree. He also offers guidelines for receiving equivalency credit. A 1995 Texas Department of Corrections study reported that recidivism among those with an A.A. degree is 13.7%, with a B.A. 5.6%, and with a master's 0%. States report overall recidivism rates as high as 75%. The article describes the College-Level Examination Program (CLEP), which administers exams to  institutionalized individuals as well as to the general public. CLEP exams are comprehensive subject and general exams. A college usually grants the same amount of credit to students earning satisfactory scores on a CLEP exam as it grants to students completing the same course at its school. The author also describes the Regents College Examinations and the DANTES Subject Standardized Tests (DSST). In addition, the paper includes reviews of end-of-course exams, prior learning credit, and credit bank schools. (NB)",

        "description":"This article attempts to suggest the existence of a human computer called Quantum Human Computer (QHC) on the basis of an analogy between human beings and computers. To date, there are two types of computers: Binary and Quantum. The former operates on the basis of binary logic where an object is said to exist in either of the two states of 1 and 0. The latter, however, operates on the basis of fuzzy logic where an object can exist in more than two states simultaneously. Through analogy, it is hypothesized that human beings are superb quantum computers that operate on the basis of human logic that accepts multiple states for objects simultaneously. Moreover, and since human beings are composed of physique, mind, memory, soul, and spirit, it is also hypothesized that the QHC legalizes the existence of objects in Hilbert space. Finally, it is further suggested that, as fictitious as it may seem, human learning can be reduced into a \"suggestion model\" whereby information is suggested into the human computer in much the same way as a given software is assembled on a digital computer; the paper proposes a model for human learning based on its description of the quantum human computer. It is claimed that human learning can be wholesale rather than being linear, sequential and time-consuming. Sleep and hypnosis are presented as examples. (Contains 3 figures.)",

The conceptual and methodological approaches used to develop the CTSPC are described and psychometric data, including reliability, validity, and normative data, are presented based on a nationally representative sample of 1,000 U.S. parents. The Psychological Aggression and Physical Assault scales of the original version were revised to: (1) improve clarity and age-appropriateness; (2) add items to increase content validity; and (3) better differentiate among levels of severity of aggression by parents. A supplementary scale has been added to address child neglect.  Reliability ranges from 0 for the severe physical assault subscale to 0.70 for the nonviolent discipline subscale. Despite low reliability coefficients, the CTSPC has found a prevalence rate for physical maltreatment of 49 per 1,000, much greater than for cases reported to child protective services, and 5 times greater than the rate uncovered in a national incidence study. The CTSPV is better suited to measure child maltreatment than the original instrument. It is brief and easy to administer. The instrument is attached as an appendix.

Caption rates among program types varied considerably, with sports and music specials having the slowest caption rates. The second part of the study determined the amount of editing being done to program scripts. Ten-minute segments from two different shows in each of 13 program categories were analyzed by  comparing the caption script to the program audio. The percentage of script edited out ranged from 0 percent to 19 percent. In the third part of the study, commonly used words in captioning and their frequency of appearance were analyzed. All words from all the programs in the study were combined into one large computer file. This file, which contained 834,726 words, was sorted and found to contain 16,102 unique words. The following reports are appended: Presentation Speed and Vocabulary in Closed Caption Television; Closed-Caption Television Presentation Speed and Vocabulary (American Annals of the Deaf, October 1996, Vol. 141); and Viewer Reaction to Different Captioned Television Speeds.

        "description":"In North Carolina, work force development education (WDE) begins in grade 6 with exploratory courses and leads to specialized classroom instruction in grades 11 and 12. Since 1992-1993, North Carolina's WDE programs have been evaluated with respect to eight long-range performance standards. Only in the case of standard 1 (all students will have career development plans appropriate to their designated career goals) was steady progress made from 1992-1993 to 1996-1997 (23.73% to 97.96%). Fewer schools met standard 7 (the completer unemployment rate will be lower than the county's youth unemployment rate) in 1996-1997 (93.66%) than in 1992-1993 (95.09%). In the cases of the other standards examined, 1996-1997 indicators were slightly to somewhat higher than 1992-1993 indicators;  however, the progress was not steady throughout the intervening years. When asked to rate completers of WDE on a scale of 0 to 5, the 4,534 North Carolina employers who responded to a survey of 11,540 employers gave the completers a 4.0 on most items (including knowledge of duties, accuracy/quality of work, and attendance), a 3.9 on knowledge of technical information, and a 4.1 on ability to get along. On average, 3,600 employers were involved in curriculum development and vocational student organizations annually. (MN)",

        "description":"This paper uses socialization theory to re-examine a unique, 10-year longitudinal study of headteachers so as to describe the stages of headship transition. It outlines prior models of leadership succession in both business and schools and produces a stage theory of headship that can be used not only as a research tool, but also as a way to assist the development of heads and prospective heads. The article outlines the stage theories of socialization and examines previous research on headship-preparation programs. The longitudinal study re-examined here consisted initially of questionnaires that were administered to 188 headteachers. Follow up questionnaires were then distributed to a select number of these principals over a 10-year period. The responses enabled the creation of a  model depicting the stages of transition in the headship: Stage 0--preparation prior to headship; Stage 1--entry and encounter (first 2 months); Stage 2--taking hold (months 3-12); Stage 3--reshaping (year 2); Stage 4--refinement (years 3-4); Stage 5--consolidation (years 5-7); and Stage 6--plateau (years 8 and onward). The model should help headteachers understand the likely phases they will experience during their tenure. Although each school is unique, patterns of development are still evident and can be used for preparation and support. (Contains 22 references.) (RJM)",

Prior to 1991, police cadets in Houston were required to have a minimum of 60 hours of college credit; however, following the Gulf War, an ordinance exempted military personnel from the 60-hour requirement. The study design was a one-way analysis of variance, with a five-year stratified sample of n=273 participants. Achievement levels were determined by scores on a reading comprehension test, a state licensing test, and a Civil Service examination, as well as by academic average,  driving skills, and firearms performance. The study found that cadets without military service but with 60 or more credit hours scored higher on reading comprehension and state licensing and civil service examinations than the other two groups. Driving skill scores were not affected by either college hours or military service. Cadets with military experience performed better at firearms skills than those without military experience.

AISD received $4,401,968 from the state Prekindergarten Expansion Grant to support full-day instruction in 2002-2003. This program evaluation shows that a total of 4,414 4-year-olds attended AISD prekindergarten in 2002-2003, representing an increase of 591 students from 2001-2002. Ninety-two percent of these students were from low-income families, and 45% met two criteria for eligibility. Hispanic students were the largest ethnic group, followed by African American. Thirty-eight languages were reported as home languages among these students, and the most frequently  reported home languages were Spanish (49%), English (47%), and Vietnamese and Korean, at 1% each. In 2002-2003 there wee 243 prekindergarten teachers, and 26% had 0 to 1 years of teaching experience. Program effectiveness in language and literacy was determined by pretest-posttest scores in English and Spanish picture vocabulary test. Eighty-one percent of all Spanish language students and 71% of English language students made measurable gains. Informal mathematics assessment indicated progress in mathematics. Program teachers participated in professional development activities, with 58% of program teachers attending professional development directly related to prekindergarten. Recommendations are made for program improvement. Five appendixes contain supplemental tables and data.  (Contains 20 figures.) (SLD)",

        "description":"This report summarizes research on interventions intended to improve four key breastfeeding behaviors: early initiation of breastfeeding, feeding of colostrum to newborns, exclusive breastfeeding for the first 0-6 months, and continued breastfeeding through the second year and beyond. It clarifies what is known about improving these practices in order to guide program planners and managers. Over 50 studies worldwide were identified that had an intervention designed to influence one of the four behaviors and reported data on one or more of those behaviors. Results indicated that only 1 of the 51 studies examined the impact of national policy changes, and few examined the impact of prenatal education in isolation from other interventions. Some results suggested that prenatal  education, when combined with other interventions (e.g., training of health providers and access to outpatient breastfeeding support clinics) related to improved breastfeeding practices. Many studies documented the impact of changing hospital practices, noting that counseling and discharge packs supporting breastfeeding, and training of hospital staff in lactation management, dramatically impacted exclusive breastfeeding rates. Most studies suggested that peer counseling and social support positively impacted initiation of breastfeeding, giving of colostrum, and exclusive breastfeeding. Evidence regarding the impact of postpartum counseling and guidance by health workers was mixed. An appendix presents detailed tables on interventions to improve breastfeeding behaviors.

The Adolescent Grief Knowledge Survey was administered to middle and high school students (N=164) to determine whether they knew: the definition of grief, the stages of grief, what can cause grief, and how long the grief process can last. Each survey was ranked with a score ranging from 0 to 4 according to the number of &quot;yes&quot; responses. Percentages of &quot;yes&quot; responses were calculated for each sex, race, and age. The mean score for each sex was compared to the mean scores for each race and age group of the same sex. A correlation coefficient was calculated for the relationship between age and mean scores because of the appearance of a strong positive correlation. It was determined that the  adolescents who participated had a good understanding of the definition of grief and its causes. The findings suggest that these adolescents did not possess enough knowledge of the grief process to deal with loss in a healthy fashion, and that the younger adolescents were especially vulnerable. It is recommended that counselors enhance their skills in grief counseling and that grief education be added to health curriculums of schools. Appendix A is the Survey. (Contains 36 references.)

SERVOL works with Caribbean communities to assist them in making social changes that they not only want but also can afford. Projects from 1970-1976 highlighted in the report include: (1) community based preschools; (2) training courses in carpentry, welding, plumbing, electrical installation, masonry, child care, and home economics; (3) a bakery; (4) several consumer co-operatives; (5) a youth farm; (6) sporting facilities in disadvantaged areas; (7) cultural projects; and (8) adult literacy classes. The report notes that since 1981, SERVOL has concentrated on helping two age groups: 0- to 5-year-old children, through an early childhood intervention program; and  16- to 19-year-old adolescents, through an adolescent training program. Teachers and field officers trained by SERVOL return to their own countries to begin projects of their own. Beginning in 1987, at the request of the Trinidad and Tobago government, SERVOL has disseminated its program throughout that country. The report also presents the basic SERVOL method of approach to helping people: always ask them what their needs are, listen attentively to what they say, and then offer assistance with respect to helping them solve their problems. The report concludes with a recap of activities in the 1990s, a discussion of funding sources for SERVOL centers, and a list of center locations. (DLH)",

Some are responsible for just one charter, while others monitor hundreds of charters serving tens of thousands of students. Some are school districts, while others are independent statewide boards, universities, not-for-profits, or state education agencies. Regardless of their size and type, authorizers must do the important work charged to them by law: deciding which schools should open, monitoring and supporting their progress, and closing those that fail to serve students adequately. There is an emerging consensus on specific authorizer practices that are necessary to do the job well. The National Association of Charter School Authorizers (NACSA) has created and refined \"Principles & Standards\" that reflect this consensus. Drawing from that, NACSA has crafted a 12-item \"Index of Essential Practices\" that provides a baseline measure for authorizers. An individual index score (from 0-12) is a diagnostic tool, and can be used to scan the work across the entire sector. The index score communicates to authorizers if they are doing these essential, key pieces of work. This information can then help begin a dialogue about improving practice. Appended are: (1) Methodology; and (2) NACSA Resources for Authorizers. (Contains 4 footnotes.)",

In Philadelphia, evidence indicates that seven early childhood risks tracked by public agencies have negative effects on early school outcomes. These risks include low birthweight or preterm birth, inadequate prenatal care, teen mother, low maternal education, homelessness, lead exposure, and child maltreatment. The purpose of this research was to understand the early risk experiences of the entire population of children age 5 years in Philadelphia between 2008 and 2012. The specific questions were: (1) What are the prevalence rates of known early childhood risks, including low birthweight or preterm birth, inadequate prenatal care, teen mother, low maternal education, homelessness, lead exposure, and child maltreatment?; (2) What percentage of young children experienced multiple early childhood risks?; and (3) What is the geographic distribution of children experiencing multiple early childhood risks in Philadelphia? The Data Management Office (DMO) in the City of Philadelphia's Office for Health and Opportunity partnered with the Penn Child Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of Education to create a data model that tracks evidence-based early risk experiences for children 0 to 5 years old.

        "description":"In much previous research, language listeners were found to perform differently when listening to a second language (L2) spoken in foreign/native accents. Influential factors have not been ascertained. This study aimed to gain new insights into this issue. 82 Mandarin speakers of different L2 (English) proficiency and different degrees of familiarity with Cantonese, Thai, and Yorkshire accent participated in the study. The stimuli were 40 English sentences with a noun as the last word (stimulus word). The stimulus words were gated with gate 0 revealing no phonological information, gate 1 displaying the first 40 &quot;ms&quot; of it, gate 2 having an additional 40 &quot;ms,&quot; etc., accumulating until the end of the word was revealed. The sentences were spoken in the accent of Mandarin, Yorkshire, Cantonese, and Thai. The participants were asked to write down the stimulus words each time after they heard a gated sentence. The results indicated that the participants required significantly less phonological information to correctly recognize the stimuli spoken in their own and Yorkshire accent than in Thai and Cantonese accent. Moreover, the participants' degree of familiarity with the accents and their L2-English proficiency both had a significant effect on their perceptual performance.",

        "description":"The Montana Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) is administered by the Montana Office of Public Instruction every two years to students in grades 7 through 12. The purpose of the survey is to help monitor the prevalence of behaviors that not only influence youth health, but also put youth at risk for the most significant health and social problems that can occur during adolescence. While all schools in Montana can participate in the survey, approximately 50 high schools are randomly selected to be included to provide the Montana statewide data for use in other national YRBS reports. Data used in this report are based on a random sample survey of Montana high school students. The weighted data results can be used to make inferences about the priority health-risk behaviors of all high school students in grades 9 through 12 in all schools in Montana. For the purpose of this report, youth classified as not eating breakfast are those who answered &quot;0 days&quot; to the question, 'During the past 7 days, on how many days did you eat breakfast?' Forty-four separate risk behaviors were queried for association with eating breakfast. These findings are presented in bullet, table, and graph forms. Results are broken down by gender, grade level, and white or Native American race.",

        "description":"Education systems are increasingly creating rich, longitudinal data sets with frequent, and even real-time, data updates of many student measures, including daily attendance, homework submissions, and exam scores. These data sets provide an opportunity for district and school staff members to move beyond an indicators-based approach and instead employ new methods to compute more frequent, more accurate, and more nuanced predictions of student risk. For these reasons, MDRC has been exploring the value of predictive modeling. Predictive modeling estimates individuals' future outcomes or their probabilities of future outcomes. It does this by building and testing a model using data on similar individuals whose outcomes are already known. When results are interpreted correctly, predictive modeling offers benefits to those engaged in continuous improvement efforts and those who are looking to allocate resources more efficiently. MDRC researchers have developed and implemented a comprehensive predictive modeling framework that allows for rapid and iterative estimation of a &quot;continuous&quot; measure of risk (a probability between 0 and 1 of not achieving an outcome) for each student at a point in time. Such estimates allow students to be ranked by their risk levels, and thresholds can be determined for particular interventions.",

        "description":"Reasoning about numerical magnitudes is a key aspect of mathematics learning. Most research examining the relation of magnitude understanding to general mathematics achievement has focused on whole number and fraction magnitudes. The present longitudinal study (N=435) used a 3-step latent class analysis to examine reasoning about magnitudes on a decimal comparison task in 4th grade, before systematic decimals instruction. Three classes of response patterns were identified, indicating empirically distinct levels of decimal magnitude understanding. Class 1 students consistently gave correct responses, suggesting that they understood decimal properties even before systematic decimal instruction. Class 2 students were accurate when a 0 immediately followed the decimal, but were inaccurate when a zero was added to the end of the decimal string, suggesting a partial understanding of place value; their performance was also negatively influenced by a whole number bias. Class 3 students showed misunderstanding of both place value and a whole number bias. Class membership accurately predicted 6th grade mathematics achievement, after controlling for whole number and fraction magnitude understanding as well as demographic and cognitive factors. Taken together, the findings suggest students may benefit from instruction that emphasizes decimal properties earlier in school.

This research was conducted on seventeen students of mathematics education study programs by providing tests on vector material in elementary linear algebra courses. The test results show that there are four students who can solve the evidentiary questions correctly using warrant, but there is only one student who can be the subject of research. The selection of subjects is based on students' ability to communicate verbally about the thought process carried out in constructing implicit warrant to explicit warrant when conducting proof. Data in this study were obtained from think aloud, tests, and interviews conducted by researchers to subjects. The results showed that the explicit warrant constructed by the subjects was obtained from an implicit warrant based on the thought process carried out. The subject constructs an explicit warrant derived from an implicit warrant through four steps, namely identifying problems,determining warrant, doing algebraic manipulation, and making conclusions. Warrant is a guarantor used to get the correct conclusions from a mathematical proof, thus further research needs to be done related to warrant.

The Mean Scores of the Pre Test averaged 6.848 (elementary) while the Post Test mean, 22.455 (intermediate). The Mean Percentage Scores (MPS) of the Pre Test MPS was 17.120 (Low) while the Post Test MPS was 56.140 (average). The test statistic Z equaled to -24.97, was not in the 95% critical value accepted range. Therefore, H[subscript 0] was rejected. The researcher recommended: (1) training both students and teaching staff in the use of digital texts to optimize their learning outcomes for school governing personnel; (2) using different strategies and practices when reading digital among teachers; (3) teaching of technology skills explicitly to primary and sometimes secondary students is seen as a necessity for developing 21st century skills in children for both teachers and students; and (4) developing digital texts that are user-friendly in developing new reading enhancement programs among teachers.",

Despite the significance of Euclidean geometry for developing these skills, learner performance in mathematics, particularly geometry, remains a concern in many countries. Thus, the current study examined the nature of learners' errors in Euclidean geometry problem-solving, particularly regarding the theorem for angle at the centre and its applications. Van Heile's theory of geometric thinking and teacher knowledge of error analysis were used as conceptual frameworks to make sense of the nature of learners' errors and misconceptions. Using a participatory action research approach, the study was operationalised by five mathematics teachers from four secondary schools in Motheo district in the Free State Province of South Africa and three academics from two local universities. The study analysed 50 sampled midyear examination scripts of Grade 12 learners from four schools. The findings of this study revealed that most learner errors resulted from concepts on Van Heile's operating Levels 0 and 1, while the questions mainly required Level 3 thinking. The study recommends that teachers determine their learners' level of geometric thinking and integrate this knowledge in their lesson preparations and material development.",

        "description":"Reinforcers may increase operant responding via a response-strengthening mechanism whereby the probability of the preceding response increases, or via some discriminative process whereby the response more likely to provide subsequent reinforcement becomes, itself, more likely. We tested these two accounts. Six pigeons responded for food reinforcers in a two-alternative switching-key concurrent schedule. Within a session, equal numbers of reinforcers were arranged for responses to each alternative. Those reinforcers strictly alternated between the two alternatives in half the conditions, and were randomly allocated to the alternatives in half the conditions. We also varied, across conditions, the alternative that became available immediately after a reinforcer. Preference after a single reinforcer always favored the immediately available alternative, regardless of the local probability of a reinforcer on that alternative (0 or 1 in the strictly alternating conditions, 0.5 in the random conditions). Choice then reflected the local reinforcer probabilities, suggesting some discriminative properties of reinforcement. At a more extended level, successive same-alternative reinforcers from an alternative systematically shifted preference towards that alternative, regardless of which alternative was available immediately after a reinforcer. There was no similar shift when successive reinforcers came from alternating sources. These more temporally extended results may suggest a strengthening function of reinforcement, or an enhanced ability to respond appropriately to \"win-stay\" contingencies over \"win-shift\" contingencies.

Purpose: This study sought to determine STI knowledge among high school students and factors associated with such knowledge, and to determine whether poor STI knowledge is associated with chlamydia or gonorrhea infection. Methods: Students in an urban United States school district serving a predominantly African American student population participated in a urine-based chlamydia and gonorrhea screening. Participants (N = 3563) were surveyed about their knowledge of selected basic facts concerning STIs. Point-scores were assigned to knowledge items. Results: The mean knowledge score was 3.65 (range: 0 to 6; median: 4.00). In a multiple regression analysis, knowledge score was significantly associated with female gender (P less than 0.001), upper grade level (P less than 0.001) and a past infection with chlamydia or gonorrhea (P = 0.001). In logistic regressions, knowledge score was not significantly associated with current infections with chlamydia (P = 0.22) or gonorrhea (P = 0.74). Discussion: There was an insufficient basic knowledge of STIs among students and a lack of association between knowledge and current infections with chlamydia and gonorrhea. Translation to Health Education Practice: Health education curricula taught throughout the high school years should incorporate basic facts concerning STIs. (Contains 4 tables.)",

        "description":"The goal of this paper is to verify up to what point ELT textbooks used in Spanish educational settings comply with the official regulations prescribed, which fully advocate the Communicative Language Teaching Method (CLT). For that purpose, seven representative coursebooks of different educational levels and modalities in Spain--secondary, upper secondary, teenager and adult textbooks--were selected to be analysed. A full unit randomly selected from each coursebook was examined through the parameters of the &quot;communicative potential&quot; of the activities--measured on a scale from 0 to 10--and the &quot;communicative nature&quot; of the methodological strategies implemented--measured on a dichotomous scale (yes/no). Global results per educational levels point to the prevailing communicative nature of all the materials, which was shown to be above 50%. The remaining non-communicative block was covered by activities focused on the formal features of language (grammar and vocabulary). This resulting degree of dissociation between official regulations and what is really found in teaching materials may be positive, since the learning of languages is complex and results from the intervention of multiple factors and learning styles, as is evidenced by the professional experience of teachers from different backgrounds and beliefs.

        "description":"The general purpose of this study was to examine the proportions of children and adolescents identified with behavioral, emotional and cognitive clinical findings and disabilities. Data from the Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect (CIS) were used in this study. Participants in this study included 7672 children aged 0 to 15 years who were reported for maltreatment and investigated by child welfare services across Canada. It was found that behaviour problem was the most common clinical finding in all age levels and psychiatric disorder was among the least common across all ages. Significant relationships were found among age levels and each clinical finding. A significant relationship was also found among age levels and having at least one clinical finding. Generally, the proportions of children for each clinical finding increased with age. Developmental delay was the most common disability at all age levels. Significant relationships among age levels were revealed for other health conditions, physical or developmental disability, and having at least one disability. The proportions of children identified for each disability generally decreased as age increased. The results suggest the use of a developmental approach to address the assessment, prevention, and intervention needs of these children and adolescents. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "description":"Gamification in second language acquisition research is a popular topic, but there are few empirical comparative studies in the literature. This quasi-experimental mixed-approach study enrolled 77 Japanese university EFL learners to enable a comparison between two digital vocabulary flashcard learning software conditions carefully designed by the author; the gamified group's software (group 1; n = 26) had daily awards (i.e., consecutive day awards, medals related to daily participation, and a bonus point counter in an effort to encourage spaced learning principles and discourage cramming) and the non-gamified group's (group 0; n = 51) did not. The daily awards had a significant effect in encouraging the gamified group to spread out their study efforts throughout the 12-week study period more effectively than the control group as they completed a lower median number of tasks per active study day (non-gamified: 104.76, gamified: 82.11; p = 0.021, r(75) = --0.264) but studied on more days to complete a similar total number of vocabulary tasks (non-gamified: 2313.00, gamified: 2228.50; p = 0.601). Moreover, the gamified group significantly outperformed the non-gamified group in terms of vocabulary knowledge score gains between the pretest and posttest; p = 0.03, r(50) = 0.300. These results show the numerous and significant positive pedagogical impacts of gamified daily awards.",

Mexican, Dominican, and African American mothers and their infants were video-recorded sharing wordless books and toy beads in the home when infants were 1:2 and 2:0. Mothers' utterances were classified into 7 categories (labels/descriptions, emotion/state language, attention directives, action directives, prohibitions, questions, and vocal elicitations) which were grouped into 3 broad language functions: referential language, regulatory language, and vocalization prompts. Mothers' ethnicity, years of education, years living in the United States, and infant sex and age related to mothers' language functions. Dominican and Mexican mothers were more likely to use regulatory language than were African American mothers, and African American mothers were more likely to use vocalization prompts than were Latina mothers. Vocalization prompts and referential language increased with mothers' education and Latina mothers' years living in the United States. Finally, mothers of boys used more regulatory language than did mothers of girls. Socio-cultural and developmental contexts shape the pragmatics of mothers' language to infants.

        "description":"Purpose: Tracheostomy patients face many adversities including loss of phonation and essential airway functions including air filtering, warming, and humidification. Heat and moisture exchangers (HMEs) facilitate humidification and filtering of inspired air. The Shikani HME (S-HME) is a novel turbulent airflow HME that may be used in-line with the Shikani Speaking Valve (SSV), allowing for uniquely preserved phonation during humidification. The aims of this study were to (a) compare the airflow resistance (R[subscript airflow]) and humidification efficiency of the S-HME and the Mallinckrodt Tracheolife II tracheostomy HME (M-HME) when dry (time zero) and wet (after 24 hr) and (b) determine if in-line application of the S-HME with a tracheostomy speaking valve significantly increases R[subscript airflow] over a tracheostomy speaking valve alone (whether SSV or Passy Muir Valve [PMV]). Method: A prospective observational ex vivo study was conducted using a pneumotachometer lung simulation unit to measure airflow (Q) amplitude and R[subscript airflow], as indicated by a pressure drop (P[subscript Drop]) across the device (S-HME, M-HME, SSV + S-HME, and PMV). Additionally, P[subscript Drop] was studied for the S-HME and M-HME when dry at time zero (T[subscript 0]) and after 24 hr of moisture testing (T[subscript 24]) at Q of 0.5, 1, and 1.5 L/s. Results: Rairflow was significantly less for the S-HME than M-HME (T[subscript 0] and T[subscript 24]). R[subscript airflow] of the SSV + S-HME in series did not significant increase R[subscript airflow] over the SSV or PMV alone. Moisture loss efficiency trended toward greater efficiency for the S-HME; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions: The turbulent flow S-HME provides heat and moisture exchange with similar or greater efficacy than the widely used laminar airflow M-HME, but with significantly lower resistance. The S-HME also allows the innovative advantage of in-line use with the SSV, hence allowing concurrent humidification and phonation during application, without having to manipulate either device.",

        "description":"Children's Centres are widespread in England and comprise multi-professional staff teams seeking to work with families with children aged 0-5 years. Although parent-child group music sessions appear frequently in Children's Centre activity programmes, the rationale for their inclusion remains unclear. This article presents the results from phase two of an exploratory mixed-methods study which investigated the role of and rationale for parent-child (0-3 years) group music making activities in Children's Centres. The perceptions of parents and practitioners were considered, and differences were found between them. The themes generated by the initial qualitative interview study (phase one) were investigated further in this quantitative questionnaire study (phase two), which involved 49 practitioners and 91 parents. Seven thematic categories of the perceived benefits of music-Social, Emotional, Learning, Teaching, Links to Home, Parenting, and Organisational-which had been identified in the interview study, were used as the basis of the design of the questionnaire. Statistical analyses revealed some significant differences between the expressed views of parent and practitioner groups, as well as between parents in different broad age groups. Practitioners expressed more positive views about the perceived benefits of music for parents than were expressed by the parents themselves. Parents in the majority age group (27-35 years) appeared to express significantly more positive opinions on a variety of questionnaire items than did parents in both younger and older age groups. Working practices of Children's Centre practitioners appear to include music group activities for which they have had little training. A new practitioner role is proposed: that of social music pedagogue. The questionnaire results have augmented and enhanced the findings of the interview study and suggest that the rationale for parent-child music group activities in Children's Centres is centred on the benefits for children's social, cultural, emotional and cognitive development.",

        "description":"Purpose: Patterns of physical activity (PA) and sedentary time, including volume of bouted activity, are important health indicators. However, the effect of accelerometer epoch length on measurement of these patterns and associations with health outcomes in children remain unknown. Method: We measured activity patterns in 308 children (52% girls, age range = 8-11 years) using ActiGraph GT1M accelerometers with 15-s epochs and reintegrated to 60-s epochs. We calculated the volume (minutes per day) of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), sedentary time, light, moderate, and vigorous PA, as well as bouted MVPA and sedentary time (0-5 min, 5-10 min, 10-20 min, and &gt; 20 min). Results: The difference between 15-s and 60-s epochs was statistically significant for all outcomes; however, effect sizes were small or negligible in 30% of comparisons. Bias ranged from 1.9 min/day (total MVPA) to 102.7 min/day (0-5 min sedentary bouts). Regression-based estimates of bias and 95% limits of agreement illustrated that the magnitude, and in some cases, the direction, of between-epoch differences varied with activity level. Correlations with body mass index and cardiovascular fitness were similar for 15-s (r = - 0.19 to 0.20) and 60-s (r = - 0.16 to 0.29) epochs. Estimated 15-s data (predicted from 60-s) were similar to measured data and had similar relationships with health outcomes. Conclusion: Epoch length influences measurement of PA and sedentary patterns and the effect is modified by activity level. However, associations with health outcomes were similar and epoch differences can be adjusted. Future research should clarify the accuracy of different epoch lengths for measuring bouted activity and evaluate whether epoch length alters relationships with additional health outcomes.",

        "description":"Optimizing the usability of e-learning materials is necessary to reduce extraneous cognitive load and maximize their potential educational impact. However, this is often neglected, especially when time and other resources are limited. We conducted a randomized trial to investigate whether a usability evaluation of our multimedia e-learning resource, followed by fixing of all problems identified, would translate into improvements in usability parameters and learning by medical residents. Two iterations of our e-learning resource [&quot;version 1&quot; (V1) and &quot;version 2&quot; (V2)] were compared. V1 was the first fully functional version and V2 was the revised version after all identified usability problems were addressed. Residents in internal medicine and anesthesiology were randomly assigned to one of the versions. Usability was evaluated by having participants complete a user satisfaction questionnaire and by recording and analyzing their interactions with the application. The effect on learning was assessed by questions designed to test the retention and transfer of knowledge. Participants reported high levels of satisfaction with both versions, with good ratings on the System Usability Scale and adjective rating scale. In contrast, analysis of video recordings revealed significant differences in the occurrence of serious usability problems between the two versions, in particular in the interactive HandsOn case with its treatment simulation, where there was a median of five serious problem instances (range: 0-50) recorded per participant for V1 and zero instances (range: 0-1) for V2 (P &lt; 0.001). There were no differences in tests of retention or transfer of knowledge between the two versions. In conclusion, usability evaluation followed by a redesign of our e-learning resource resulted in significant improvements in usability. This is likely to translate into improved motivation and willingness to engage with the learning material. In this population of relatively high-knowledge participants, learning scores were similar across the two versions.",

        "description":"This report is based on the Access and Support to Education and Training Survey (ASETS), which was undertaken by Statistics Canada in partnership with Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC). The ASETS brings together three previous education surveys that covered specific population groups: (1) the Survey of Approaches to Educational Planning (SAEP), which focused on 0 to 18 year olds; (2) the Post-Secondary Education Participation Survey (PEPS), which focused on 18 to 24 year olds; and (3) the Adult Education and Training Survey (AETS), which focused on 25 to 65 year olds. While these three surveys examined specific facets of Canadian's educational experience, their integration in the ASETS allows for a more holistic approach to collecting information on participation in and financing of education and training in Canada. While the ASETS can be used to undertake the same research as the PEPS, AETS and SAEP, it can also be used to address additional research not previously possible. This report presents an overview of the first findings from the ASETS and consists of four sections. Section 1 explores participation in education and training among Canadians aged 18 to 64. Section 2 explores the proportion of Canadians aged 18 to 64 who had unmet training needs and the reasons why Canadians did not pursue further education or training. Section 3 explores the costs associated with education and training and the sources of funding used to finance education programs. Section 4 shifts to the next generation of learners (0 to 17 years) and examines the proportion of children whose parents save and plan for their future postsecondary studies. Tables are appended. A cumulative index is also included. (Contains 22 charts, 23 tables and 11 endnotes.)",

        "author":["MacDonald, George T."],
        "description":"A simulation study was conducted to explore the performance of the linear logistic test model (LLTM) when the relationships between items and cognitive components were misspecified. Factors manipulated included percent of misspecification (0%, 1%, 5%, 10%, and 15%), form of misspecification (under-specification, balanced misspecification, and over-specification), sample size (20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, and 1280), Q-matrix density (60% and 46%), number of items (20, 40, and 60 items), and skewness of person ability distribution (-0.5, 0, and 0.5). Statistical bias, root mean squared error, confidence interval coverage, confidence interval width, and pairwise cognitive components correlations were computed. The impact of the design factors were interpreted for cognitive components, item difficulty, and person ability parameter estimates. The simulation provided rich results and selected key conclusions include (a) SAS works superbly when estimating LLTM using a marginal maximum likelihood approach for cognitive components and an empirical Bayes estimation for person ability, (b) parameter estimates are sensitive to misspecification, (c) under-specification is preferred to over-specification of the Q-matrix, (d) when properly specified the cognitive components parameter estimates often have tolerable amounts of root mean squared error when the sample size is greater than 80, (e) LLTM is robust to the density of Q-matrix specification, (f) the LLTM works well when the number of items is 40 or greater, and (g) LLTM is robust to a slight skewness of the person ability distribution. In sum, the LLTM is capable of identifying conceptual knowledge when the Q-matrix is properly specified, which is a rich area for applied empirical research.

        "description":"Aim: The aim of the study was to assess the influence of decreasing gestational age on the risk of developmental delay in various domains at age 4 years among children born at a wide range of gestational ages. Method: In a community-based cohort, the parents of 1439 preterm-born children (24 0/7 to 35 6/7wks) and 544 term-born children (38 0/7 to 41 6/7wks') born in 2002 and 2003 completed the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) when their child was 3 years 7 months to 4 years 1 month old. The prevalence rates of abnormal scores on the ASQ-total problems scale were compared in preterm and term-born children and the resulting odds ratios for gestational age groups were calculated and adjusted for social and biological covariates. Results: The prevalence rates of abnormal scores on the ASQ-total problems scale increased with decreasing gestational age: from 4.2% among term-born children to 37.5% among children born at 24-25 weeks' gestation (p less than 0.001). The risk of an abnormal ASQ-total score increased exponentially with decreasing gestational age compared with children born at term (odds ratio per week of gestation 1.14, 95% confidence interval 1.09-1.19). A similar exponential pattern was seen on all underlying ASQ domains, both before and after adjustment. Interpretation: The risk of developmental delay increases exponentially with decreasing gestational age below 35 weeks' gestation on all developmental domains of the ASQ. Adjustment for covariates did not alter the pattern of exponential increase in developmental risk with decreasing gestational age. We speculate that both direct perinatal cerebral injuries and tropic and maturational brain disturbances are involved. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)",

The authors developed a highly structured services assessment measure [Services for Children and Adolescents-Parent Interview (SCAPI)] for use in the National Institute of Mental Health Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (MTA). Method: After successfully piloting and refining the SCAPI during initial phases of the MTA, the authors used this measure at 24 months post-randomization to ascertain the previous 6 months of services use for all participating (516 of 579) MTA children and families and 285 age- and gender-matched classroom control children. Results: Findings revealed meaningful, face-valid differences between MTA and control children in levels and types of services used during the previous 6-month period. Services use data reported by parents was substantially in accord with data independently gathered by the research data center. Site variations were found in the level and use of several specific services, such as individual child psychotherapy (sites ranged from 0% to 6.8% among classroom controls compared with 9.7% to 46.1% among MTA participants) and special education services (0% to 14.6% among classroom controls, 27.5% to 34.8% among MTA participants), consistent with differences reported in other studies. Conclusions: These data support the descriptive validity of SCAPI-ascertained services use data and indicate that the SCAPI can provide investigators and policymakers a valid means of assessing services type, intensity, onset and offset, provider type, and content.

This study examined these three psychometric properties with the most recent ability test of EI, the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT V2.0; Mayer, Salovey, &amp; Caruso, [Mayer, J. D., Salovey, &amp; P., Caruso, (2000). Models of emotional intelligence. In R. J., Sternberg (Ed.). Handbook of intelligence (pp. 396-420). New York: Cambridge; Mayer, J.

Toronto, ON: MHS]), with a sample (n=431) drawn from the general population. The reliability of the MSCEIT at the total scale, area and branch levels was found to be good, although the reliability of most of the subscales was relatively low. Consistent with previous findings, there was a high level of convergence between the alternative scoring methods (consensus and expert). However, unlike Mayer et al.'s [Mayer, J. D., Salovey, P., Caruso, D. R., &amp; Sitarenios, G. (2003). Measuring emotional intelligence with the MSCEIT V2. 0. Emotion, 3, 97-105.] contentions, there was only partial support for their four-factor model of EI. A model with a general first-order factor of EI and a three first-order branch level factors was determined to be the best fitting model. There was no support for the Experiential Area level factor, nor was there support for the Facilitating Branch level factor. These results were replicated closely using the Mayer et al. [Mayer, J. D., Salovey, P., Caruso, D. R., &amp; Sitarenios, G., (2003). Measuring emotional intelligence with the MSCEIT V2. 0. Emotion, 3, 97-105.] data. The results are discussed in light of the close comparability of the two scoring methods. Furthermore, the fundamental limitations of the MSCEIT V2.0, with respect to the inadequate number of subscales theorized to measure each branch level factor are identified",

        "description":"Objective: To develop further the understanding of emotional abuse and neglect. Methods: Building on previous work, this paper describes the further development of a conceptual framework for the recognition and management of emotional abuse and neglect. Training in this framework is currently being evaluated. The paper also briefly reviews more recent work on aspects of the definition, harm caused by emotional abuse and neglect and threshold. Results: The paper arrives at a working definition as \"persistent, non-physical, harmful interactions with the child by the caregiver, which include both commission and omission.\" There are many forms of harmful caregiver-child interactions, which can be placed in five categories, each category reflecting the fulfillment of one of the child's basic psycho-social needs and requiring a different therapeutic approach for its alleviation. The caregiver-child relationship is embedded within a psycho-social context. It is suggested that greater clarity can be gained about the child and family when information is sorted into the appropriate tiers of concerns: Tier 0--Social & environmental factors, Tier I--Caregiver risk factors, Tier II--Caregiver-child interactions and Tier III--Child's functioning. It is further suggested that while intervention is required, this is directed \"towards\" protection, rather than providing immediate protection of the child. The work takes the form of a time-limited trial of therapeutic work to gauge the capacity of the caregivers to change. This initial work focuses Tiers 0-II. Statutory steps might be required in order to encourage the caregivers to engage. If insufficient progress is achieved, active child protection may be required which might include placing the child in an alternative family. However, some, usually older, children will remain in the emotionally abusive environment and they will require ongoing help and support. Conclusion: While a greater understanding of emotional abuse and neglect is now possible, further evaluation of the utility of this framework is suggested. (Contains 1 figure.)",

Methods: A random sample of 211 children from the CCC 2000 was investigated when the children were 1 1/2 years of age. The prevalence and associates of mental health problems and psychopathology were studied by clinical and standardised strategies, including videotape recordings, parent interviews and the following instruments: The Child Behavior Check List 1 1/2-5 (CBCL 1 1/2-5), The Infant Toddler Symptom Check List (ITSCL), Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT), Bayley Scales of Infant Development II (BSID II), The Parent Child Early Relationship Assessment (PC ERA) and Parent Infant Relationship Global Assessment Scale (PIR-GAS). Results: Mental health problems according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and Diagnostic Classification Zero to Three (DC 0-3) diagnoses were found in 16-18% of 1 1/2-year-old children. Most common were disturbances of emotion, behaviour and eating and the DC 0-3 diagnosis of regulatory disorder. Parent-child relationship disturbances were found in 8%. High psychosocial risk was significantly associated with emotional and behavioural disorders (OR 3.1 95% (1.2-8.1)) and disturbed parent-child relationship (OR 5.0 95% (1.6-16.0)). The strongest association of risk was found between relationship disorders and emotional and behavioural disorders (OR 11.6 95% (3.8-37.5)). Conclusions: The prevalence and distribution of psychopathology in 1 1/2-year-old children seem to correspond to the distributions among older children. Disturbances in parent-child relationship have a key position in the risk mechanisms in early child psychopathology.",

(1994). \"The international epidemiology of child sexual abuse.\" \"Child Abuse & Neglect,\" 18 (5), 409-417] with those found in recent publications in order to confirm the widespread prevalence of child sexual abuse. Methods: Relevant articles about prevalence of child sexual abuse were identified through searches of computerized databases and a handsearch of \"Child Abuse & Neglect\" and the \"Journal of Child Sexual Abuse.\" Results: Thirty-eight independent articles were identified, corresponding to 39 prevalence studies; these articles report the prevalence of childhood sexual abuse in 21 different countries, ranging from 0 to 53% for women and 0 to 60% for men. Conclusions: Comparison of the present study with that of [Finkelhor, D. (1994). \"The international epidemiology of child sexual abuse.\" \"Child Abuse & Neglect,\" 18 (5), 409-417] shows a similarity between prevalence distributions; there appears to be a general pattern that remains more or less constant over the years, especially in women. Practice implications: Twelve years after the first revision study about the international prevalence of child sexual abuse, there is still a need for new data about this topic. The present study shows child sexual abuse is still a widespread problem in the society. In this research, carried out on 38 independent studies, there is new data for 21 countries over the world, being especially relevant the results obtained from other countries different from those pertaining to North America or Europe. It is important to point out the high prevalence found in most of the countries, so this information could be a new warning to make society and governments aware of this problem and undertake actions to prevent sexual abuse in childhood.

        "author":["Wang, Hui-Yu",
          "Chen, Shyi-Ming"],
        "description":"In this  paper, we  present two new methods for evaluating students' answerscripts based on the similarity measure between vague sets. The vague marks awarded  to the answers in the students' answerscripts are represented by vague sets, where each element u[subscript i] in the universe of discourse U belonging to a vague set is represented by a vague value. The grade of membership of u[subscript i] in the vague set A is bounded by a subinterval [t[subscript A](u[subscript i]), 1 - f[subscript A] (u[subscript i])] of [0, 1]. It indicates that the exact grade of membership [mu][subscript A](u[subscript i]) of u[subscript i] belonging the vague set A is bounded by t[subscript A](u[subscript i]) [less than or equal to] [mu][subscript A](u[subscript i]) [less than or equal to] 1 - f[subscript A](u[subscript i]), where t[subscript A](u[subscript i]) is a lower bound of the grade of membership of u[subscript i] derived from the evidence for u[subscript i], f[subscript A](u[subscript i]) is a lower bound of the negation of u[subscript i] derived from the evidence against u[subscript i],  t[subscript A](u[subscript i]) +  f[subscript A](u[subscript i]) [less than or equal to] 1, and u[subscript i][is an element of] U. An index of optimism [lambda] determined by the evaluator is used to indicate the degree of optimism of the evaluator, where [lambda] [is an element of] [0, 1]. Because the proposed methods use vague sets to evaluate students' answerscripts rather than fuzzy sets, they can evaluate students' answerscripts in a more flexible and more intelligent manner. Especially, they are particularly useful  when the assessment involves subjective evaluation. The proposed methods can evaluate students' answerscripts more stable than Biswas's methods (1995).

        "description":"Despite the technical competence of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) graduates of the Department of Computer Science (DCS) at the University of Guyana, stakeholders' perception generally holds that they lack affective and behavioural (soft) skills. These soft skills are expected of them to lead and champion technological change in Guyana. This dissertation addresses the question of what is understood about, and how meaning and sense are made of, the concept of 'ICT graduate employability', in the context of the local public sector, by the key stakeholders: employers (government), and alumni (graduates) and lecturers (educators) of the DCS. On account of the cyclic, incremental, reflective nature of Action Research (AR) and its tenet of integrating theory with practice, an AR project was undertaken to develop a deep local understanding about ICT graduate employability. This understanding has implications for how ICT graduates are prepared as a function of their programme of study in the DCS and how their performance and careers are managed in the public sector. The research comprised one reconnaissance study (Cycle 0), an intervention-based study (Cycle 1), and a qualitative study (Cycle 2). The focus and direction of Cycle 2 were refined by insights garnered from Cycles 0 and 1. Cycle 2 employed surveys, interviews, and focus groups to elicit the perceptions, views, opinions, experiences, values, and framing ideas and beliefs of a sample of forty participants. Thematic analysis was used to identify patterns and develop themes in the process of analysing and interpreting the data. The findings unearthed a local definition of ICT graduate employability; revealed implications of environmental factors in the public sector for the psychological safety and resilience of ICT graduates; and informed recommendations for a locally relevant ICT graduate education ecosystem.

        "description":"Objective: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), which refer to childhood traumatic events, have been identified as risk factors for tobacco use in adulthood. However, studies are limited on the effect of sex on the association of ACEs with e-cigarettes and dual use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes. This study explored sex differences in the association of ACEs with e-cigarettes, cigarettes, and dual use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes among adults in the United States. Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of data from adults aged [greater than or equal to]18 years in the 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (N = 62,768). ACEs, the independent variable, was a composite score assessed from 11 questions (with responses yes-1 or no/never-0) related to childhood emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and household dysfunction and categorized as 0 (reference), 1, 2, 3, or [greater than or equal to] 4. The dependent variable, tobacco use patterns, included nonuse (reference), e-cigarette only, cigarette only, and dual use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to test the interaction between sex and ACEs while controlling for potential confounders. Results: Although we found no statistically significant interaction by sex, a greater number of ACEs were associated with higher odds of the different tobacco use patterns among females and males, with varying strengths of associations. Specifically, females who reported [greater than or equal to] 4 ACEs compared with none had higher odds of e-cigarette (aOR [95% CI]: 3.58 [1.49-8.63]), cigarette (2.57 [1.72-3.83]) and dual use (3.25 [1.79-5.91]) relative to nonuse. Males with [greater than or equal to] 4 ACEs had higher odds of cigarette (1.75 [1.15-2.65]) and dual use (7.64 [3.95-14.79]). Conclusion: Our findings underscore the importance of developing appropriate, tailored trauma-informed intervention strategies for females and males. It is also important to consider ACEs in designing tobacco-specific preventive programs to curb initiation and promote cessation among U.S. adults.",

        "title":"Faculty Classroom Support toward the Native American College Student&apos;s Educational Experience: A Quantitative Study",
        "author":["Jessica Bivens"],
        "description":"The purpose of this quantitative study is to test the correlation between perceived levels of faculty support behaviors on the Native American student's college degree completion experience. Sociocultural Learning Theory and the Social Integration Model are the theoretical frameworks this study used to connect to the related research on the Native American college student experience. Research scarcity and gaps in the existing scholarship justified the study. &quot;What is the relationship between faculty's perceived supportive classroom behaviors and undergraduate Native American college students' self-reported persistence to graduation?&quot; and &quot;What is the relationship between faculty's perceived supportive classroom behaviors and graduate Native American college students' self-reported persistence to graduation?&quot; are the two research questions asked. A quantitative research approach used Spearman's rank correlation to analyze n=315 Gates Millennium Scholars and finalists who identified as Native American from 1999 to 2017 (BMGF, 2021). The Spearman rank correlation test conducted in SPSS 29 revealed a statistical significance of perceived faculty support behaviors on the Native American undergraduate (r[subscript s](138) = 0.617, p&lt;0.001) and graduate (r[subscript s](173) = 0.566, p&lt;0.001) degree experience. The statistical significance rejected both null hypotheses (H[subscript 0]1 and H[subscript 0]2) in this study. Additionally, these statistical findings aligned with several related studies in the literature, increasing the validity of the results. This research may offer higher education institutions information on improving faculty support models for Native American college students. As more higher education institutions invite ways to advance equity for underrepresented students, this research study may help institutions enhance the academic experience for Native American students. A mixed methods research approach using a larger sample size is recommended for future research. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

Previous research indicates that equating results may not be accurate when group differences are large. This study compared the equating results of frequency estimation, chained equipercentile, item response theory (IRT) true-score, and IRT observed-score equating methods. Using mixed-format test data, equating results were evaluated for group differences ranging from 0 to 0.75 standard deviations. As group differences increased, equating results became increasingly biased and dissimilar across equating methods.

The details of these limitations, which can be easily overlooked, are carefully explicated. We also bring in the important example of electrical energy to show how criteria for spontaneity are properly applied to electrochemical cells. The analysis in this article gains clarity from use of the &quot;global&quot; formulation of thermodynamics and from carrying out finite changes of thermodynamic properties rather than manipulating differential changes.

Diary recordings were kept by the child's mother from ages 2:8 to 5:0. The results showed little support for a proposed developmental sequence based on cross-sectional data e.g., Clark & Barron, 1988. Instead, the child usually produced grammatical forms in both languages, though few were in French. In English, he often used -er attached to verbs before nouns and meaning something similar to -ing (and sometimes, although much less frequently, vice versa). These results suggest that children use multiple cues in acquiring deverbal constructions, including existing grammatical forms and the frequency of these forms.",

        "description":"Background: Education researchers typically estimate average program effects with regression; if they are interested in heterogeneous effects, they include an interaction in the model. Such models quantify and infer the influences of each covariate on the effect via interaction coefficients and their associated p-values or confidence intervals. However, while these models produce interpretable estimates, they also constrain the estimates to be linear. More recently, some researchers have been examining incorporating machine learning (ML) methods -- off-the-shelf or otherwise -- for more flexible estimation. While more precise than interaction models, these approaches' estimates are often uninterpretable -- especially with powerful but non-parametric methods like causal forests [Athey and Wager, 2019]. This work proposes a two-stage procedure to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects -- dubbed the &quot;Leave-One-Out Learner&quot; or LOOL, an extension of the &quot;Leave-One-Out Potential Outcomes&quot; (LOOP) estimator first described by Wu and Gagnon-Bartsch [2018]. Purpose: In its first stage, we estimate and impute individual treatment effect (ITE) with the LOOP estimator -- using more flexible methods like random forests [Breiman, 2001]. In the second stage, we can then regress these estimates on the covariates -- using a parametric model like simple least-squares or Lasso regression [Tibshirani, 1996] -- to produce interpretable, parameterized estimates of the conditional average treatment (CATE) with which researchers can draw inferences without any additional step. The first stage allows the LOOL to be more flexible than interaction-based regressions, which restricts predictions to be linear, while the second stage allows it to be more interpretable than non-parametric methods like causal forests [Athey and Wager, 2019]. Moreover, if the experiment design is valid and the modeling process satisfies the leave-one-out requirement outlined by Wu and Gagnon-Bartsch [2018], the first-stage ITE from the LOOP estimators will be unbiased. In turn, this robustness provides researchers a great deal of flexibility: they can choose whichever model best suits their needs in the second stage without worrying about carrying over and further amplifying potential bias from the first. In addition, as recent studies [Sales et al., 2018, 2023, Gagnon-Bartsch et al., 2023] have shown, researchers can further boost the precision of estimates by incorporating auxiliary data outside of the experiment. Data: Our data came from Decker-Woodrow et al. [2023], which examined the effectiveness of three computer-based learning platforms (CBLPs) -- From Here to There (FH2T), DragonBox, and ASSISTments [Heffernan and Heffernan, 2014]. The study examined four conditions: FH2T and DragonBox -- where assigned students simply worked with respective CBLPs -- and Immediate Feedback and Active Control -- which were both administered through ASSISTments. In the latter two conditions, students could either request assistance in the form of hints or only receive them upon submitting their answers. The original sample included 3,612 students. However, due to COVID-19, only 1,852([approximately equal to] 51.2%) of the sample completed the posttest. The data is available upon request. Methodology: Let potential outcomes Y[subscript i](1) and Y[subscript i](0) represent the outcome value Y[subscript i] that subject i [epsilon] {1, . . . , n} would have exhibited if they were assigned to treatment or control, respectively [Rubin, 1974, Splawa-Neyman et al., 1990]. Subject i's ITE is thus [tau][subscript i] = Y[subscript i](1)-Y[subscript i](0). If treatment Z is randomly assigned, with [double-struck P](Z[subscript i] = 1) = p[subscript i], then Y[subscript i]U[subscript i] is an unbiased estimator of [tau][subscript i], where U[subscript i] = 1/p[subscript i] if Z[subscript i] = 1 and -1/(1-p[subscript i]) if Z[subscript i] = 0. Unfortunately, the large sampling variance of Y[subscript i]U[subscript i] renders it impractical as an estimator of [tau]. Wu and Gagnon-Bartsch [2018] modified this quantity to obtain a more efficient estimate [tao with caret] = (Y[subscript i]-[m with caret][subscript i])U[subscript i] where m[subscript i] = (1-p[subscript i])Y[subscript i](1)+pY[subscript i](0). This estimate is unbiased if [m with caret][subscript i] [double up tack] U[subscript i] and thus [m with caret][subscript i] [double up tack] Z[subscript i]. As its name suggests, the LOOP estimator achieves this by cross-fitting potential outcome models [mu][superscript T][subscript i] (·) and [mu][superscript C][subscript i] (·) separately for each observation i with n - 1 observations j [not equal to] i. Moreover, [tao with caret][subscript i] will also be precise if [mu with caret][superscript T][subscript i] (·) and [mu with caret][superscript C][subscript i] (·) are accurate. Consider the definition of the CATE: [tau](x) = [double struck E][Y[subscript i](1) - Y[subscript i](0)|X[subscript i] = x] = [double struck E][tau][subscript i]|X[subscript i] = x] [Imbens and Rubin, 2015]. If, somehow, [tau] were observed, one could estimate the CATE by regressing them on the covariates X, thus estimating [double struck E][tau][subscript i]|X[subscript i] = x]. However, since we observe either Y[subscript i](1) or Y[subscript i](0) corresponding to Z[subscript i], [tau][subscript i] is unobservable. Nevertheless, we can instead use the LOOP estimator's accurate ITE estimates to estimate [tau](x), since [double struck E][tau with caret][subscript i]|X[subscript i] = x] = [double struck E][tau][subscript i]|X[subscript i] = x]. Results: Table 1 shows regression models estimating the CATE of each treatment over Active Control with LOOL. We first utilized a random forest for the LOOP estimator to estimate the ITE. We then regressed these estimates on six covariates to estimate the CATE: the student's pretest score, their mathematics anxiety, whether they started the school year remotely, whether they were under an Early Intervention Program Plan (EIP), whether they received accommodations in the form of either an IEP or Section 504, and whether English is their second or foreign language (ESOL). The results replicated the main findings in Decker-Woodrow et al. [2023], that FH2T and DragonBox had positive average effects, and that the effect of FH2T increased with pretest scores. Moreover, our results suggest that FH2T's and DragonBox's effects were lower for ESOL students, and may have been negative. Table 2 shows an interaction model estimating the posttest -- with coefficients of the treatment and its interactions being analogs to those in Table 1. With only one exception, standard errors of coefficients from the LOOL are all smaller. This result suggests the LOOL can produce more precise estimates than a strictly linear interaction model. Conclusion: The estimation of heterogenous effects is crucial in education research, where the student body is often diverse thus having different strengths and weaknesses along with education needs. While precise and accurate estimates are always desirable, interpretable estimates provide researchers with more information to better understand underlying causal heterogeneity. We believe the LOOL can serve as a sweet spot between flexibility and interpretability in estimation."},

Also, the RVM-based computation of a cut-score is not based on a single item (e.g., marked in an ordered item booklet) but, instead, on a response vector (1/0 scores) on items and their parameters calibrated in item response theory or under the recently developed &quot;D&quot;-scoring method. Illustrations with hypothetical and real-data scenarios of standard setting are provided and methodological aspects of the RVM method are discussed.",

Based on a systematic Internet search carried out in 2015-2016, this article describes children's participation in annual plans through representations of their direct speech. Internet searches resulted in a small sample showing wide variation in the genres and rhetorical reasoning in which the utterances were embedded. This also implies variation in the functions that the different representations will likely have for professional development (PD). Some of the representations of direct speech in the plans where compatible with an idea of PD based on explorations of children's civic participation through communication.",

The results indicated a bidirectional dynamic model of temperament influencing subsequent GCA and GCA influencing subsequent temperament. The dynamic relationship between temperament and GCA arose primarily from shared genetic variance, particularly in families with higher socioeconomic status, where input from temperament contributed on average 20% to genetic variance in GCA versus 0% in lower SES families.",

While children recognized the need for assistance for indirect knowledge, 70% of scaffolded children claimed that they would have learned to use the artifact without assistance, even though 0% of children actually succeeded without assistance. In Study 2, this illusion of self-sufficiency was significantly attenuated when observing another learner being scaffolded.

Fifty-six children (aged 7; 0 to 9; 11 years) completed a measure of faux pas understanding, emotion understanding, and motor skills. Children's faux pas understanding, emotion understanding, and motor skills were all related to each other. However, when age, motor skills, and emotion understanding were entered into a regression to predict faux pas understanding, only motor skills predicted understanding of faux pas.

This study describes an unfolding model for examining rater accuracy. Accuracy is defined as the difference between observed and expert ratings.

The hyperbolic cosine model (HCM) is used to examine dichotomous accuracy ratings from a statewide writing assessment.

To revise the scale for better alignment with the Family Quality of Life theory, the authors excluded non-outcome items in this revision. In this study, we examined reliability and validity of the revised scale (i.e., the FQoL Scale-21) and its scores for Taiwanese families of children and youth with intellectual disability and developmental delay (age 0-18). Results from 400 Taiwanese respondents suggested that the FQoL Scale-21 has the potential to be used as an indicator of positive outcomes in intervention evaluation, policy making, and service delivery.",

The study was conducted using a multiple-probe design across three target phonemes and replicated with three young children. Results indicated all children not only improved their performance on their target phonemes but also learned some of their peers' target phonemes through observational learning.

Intervening in the early years is a critical first step toward alleviating poverty, reducing inequality, and ensuring a productive workforce for the global economy. The challenges presented by the almost 250 million at-risk children in low- and middle-income countries and the main obstacles to investing in ECD demand a paradigm shift in social policy and an action agenda integrated with the world's sustainable development goals for 2030.

Based on a different cultural and economic context, and using data on 146 second-year management students enrolled in a macroeconomics course at an elite economics school in Portugal, it is shown that even when controlling for potential endogenous factors associated with attendance and academic performance, absenteeism considerably lowers the students' final grade (about 2 points in a 0-20-point grading scheme). In addition, it is established that a compulsory, though flexible, attendance policy contributes to improving students' academic performance.",

Often, early childhood educators begin thinking about developmental assessments when children are between the ages of 3 and 5. However, they need to be cognizant of the fact that child development begins from the moment a child is born. It is, therefore, their responsibility as early childhood professionals to begin examining and assessing children's growth and development from the very moment they are placed in their care; this can happen as early as 6 weeks of age.

        "description":"The present study used the stimulus onset delay paradigm to investigate eye movement control in reading and in scene viewing in a within-participants design. Short onset delays (0, 25, 50, 200, and 350 ms) were chosen to simulate the type of natural processing difficulty encountered in reading and scene viewing. Fixation duration increased linearly with delay duration, and the effect was equivalent for both tasks. Although fixations were longer in scene viewing, the effects of onset delay were highly consistent across tasks. These results suggest that reading and scene viewing share a common mechanism for saccade planning and control. (Contains 4 figures and 1 table.)",

Three systems were characterized as strategies (focus, dimension check, hypothesis check) because they always lead eventually to solution. The remainder were called stereotypes (stimulus preference, position alternate, position perseverate) because they involve repeated manifestation of the same hypothesis (despite disconfirmation) and never lead to solution. Preliminary research revealed some striking developmental differences: Kindergarten children showed stereotypes in 90% of their problems; elementary-school children showed mostly dimension- and hypothesis-checking (65 to 80%) and little focusing (0 to 10%);  college students showed focusing in half their problems and no stereotypes. These differences were compared to Piagetian stages of cognitive development. (Author/MV)",

Students simply measure and add stock solutions to start clock reactions. Sudden discoloration or coloration of the reaction mixture marks the end of the reaction, and this can be conveniently timed. Students then complete calculations and graphing in a spreadsheet file by following common protocols. Rates of reaction are calculated from the ratio of [limiting reactant][subscript 0] and clock time. Orders of reactions and rate constants are determined by the method of initial rate. Additional discussions on topics such as catalysis, reaction mechanism, redox reaction, and pseudo-zeroth-order reaction are also possible.",

Using the 2008 Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect, 5,797 cases of substantiated maltreatment that involved children aged between 0 and 14 years were analyzed. One in 10 children (11.3%) was identified with ID. Results revealed functional problems to be higher among children with ID and their parents. Moreover, children with ID experienced more severe maltreatment, and were more often referred to ongoing child protection services. These findings suggest that maltreated children with ID are facing additional challenges that must be accounted for in service planning and delivery.",

However, the situation is different in the presence of a speed-dependent drag force, as either object may hit first or they may hit at the same time. Drag force is quite complex, and the dependence of the drag force on speed is related to a number of factors, some of which are beyond the scope of this paper. Here we specifically discuss the cases of drag forces with a magnitude dependent on an integer power (2, 1, and 0) of the speed &quot;v&quot;, as these are suitable for study in introductory courses.",

Ridge regression avoids the problem of selection of variables that may occur in stepwise procedures. Ridge regression is performed by adding a constant to the diagonal of the correlation matrix. This may be done iteratively for a range of constants, say from 0 to 3 in small increments. The results of data analysis are presented both in tables and in graphs, to show how ridge regression reduces the instability of regression weights in cross valdidation. These data were generated to predict fourth and seventh grade achievement  from achievement test scores and teacher variables. (Author/CTM)",

Each was questioned individually. Findings showed that level of education and race had little effect on the attainment of conservation of quantity and of weight, but that sex does have a significant effect on the attainment of volume. A total of 78 percent of the subjects conserved mass, 67 percent conserved weight, and only 24 percent conserved volume. (Author/DT)",

The role of the family and home environment in stimulating children's language acquisition and pre-literacy competences during their earliest years is clearly important. It is possible that with appropriate exposure and encouragement before the age of 3, children from disadvantaged backgrounds could start school on an equal footing with their more privileged counterparts. We provide a conceptual overview of the factors in the home affecting language and subsequent literacy development in children aged 0-3, and a review of programs designed to enhance the home learning environment.",

In Experiment 2, TMT augmented response stereotypy induced by an amphetamine injection. In Experiment 3, TMT interfered with working memory during 30-s, but not 0-s, delay trials of a spatial-alternation task. However, a larger amount of TMT disrupted performance during delay and no-delay trials. In Experiment 4, TMT impaired the recall of the location of a hidden platform in a Morris water maze, and a preexposure injection of a benzodiazepine agonist prevented this deficit.

Sixty-one Finnish-speaking children were followed up once a year from infancy to school start (1 year 0 months-7 years 3 months). Before entering first grade, 43% of the children were classified as emergent readers and 30% as precocious readers. The readers had displayed more rapid vocabulary, inflectional, and metaphonological development than their agemates. Increased awareness of sound patterns emerged well before word reading. However, the striking growth spurt in phonemic awareness can be regarded more as a consequence of than a precursor to reading. The findings suggest that early mastery of words and word inflections increases the likelihood of becoming aware of sound patterns in words.",

In-phase coordination was performed under manipulations of phase detuning and movement frequency and either singly or in combination with an arithmetic task. Predicted direction-specific shifts in stable relative phase from 0 degrees due to detuning and movement frequency were amplified by the cognitive task. Nonlinear cross-recurrence analysis suggested that this cognitive influence on the locations of the stable points or attractors of coordination entailed a magnification of attractor noise without a reduction in attractor strength. An approximation to these findings was achieved through parameter changes in a motion equation in relative phase. Results are discussed in terms of dual-task performance as limited resources, dynamics rather than chronometrics, and reparameterization rather than degradation.",

(b) Can angles contain curves?, and (c) Difficulties with conceiving of 0 degree, 180 degree, and 36 degree angles.

        "description":"The global psychophysical theory of summation and magnitude production of R. D. Luce (2002) had joint presentations of pairs of intensities (measured above threshold) being matched asymmetrically, with 1 component being 0 intensity and the other the matching intensity. For loudness, an intensity pair to the 2 ears is matched by an intensity in just 1 ear. Realizing this experimentally has been difficult, and so, this article extends the theory to the use of symmetric matches with the same intensity being used in both components. In addition, the representational aspect is much improved; a new formulation of the results of the earlier theory is presented; the theory for symmetric matches is outlined; and it is shown that if 1 form of segregation, right or left, holds for asymmetric matches and 1 for symmetric ones, then all forms of segregation hold.",

        "description":"This paper analyzes whether there exists a causal relationship between parental employment and children's educational attainment. We address potential endogeneity problems due to (i) selection of parents in the labor market by estimating a model on sibling differences and (ii) reverse causality by focusing on parents' employment when children are aged 0-3. We use data from the German Socioeconomic Panel that provide information on household income, parental employment, and time spent with child care. Our approach disentangles income and time effects of parental employment. Overall, we find little support that parental employment affects children's educational attainment. Controlling for household income, we can rule out that having a mother who works one hour more per week lowers the probability of high secondary track attendance by more than 0.1%.

These treatments of missing data make strong assumptions about the causes of the missing data. Such assumptions may be particularly problematic when groups differ in their patterns of nonresponse. Using both real data from Ontario students taking the English- and French-language versions of two large-scale assessments and simulated data, this study compared the Mantel-Haenszel DIF indices produced using a total score or a proportion score as matching variables and treating missing data by listwise deletion, analysiswise deletion, or scoring missing data as incorrect.

We analyze the determinants of time-crunch in relation to work factors for the individual as well as the spouse and find significant gender differences. One result is that longer working hours are associated with more time-crunch for both mothers and fathers, whereas the amount of housework only matters for mothers.

RB for the whole character occurred when the exposure duration was more than 50ms with one intervening character between the two critical characters (lag=1), whereas RB for subcharacter components was more evident at exposure durations shorter than 50ms with no intervening character (lag=0).

Stopping distance, initiation of braking, and the magnitude of brake adjustments were influenced by both optical variables, but global optic flow rate had a stronger effect.

Sixty-four college students were randomly assigned to one of four groups that received a 0-, 5-, 10-, or 20-s time-out duration after an incorrect response. Each participant completed a simple visual discrimination task by attempting to determine and remember the correct response for each of eight different color-shape combinations. The results indicated that timeout was effective at enhancing performance, even when reinforcers for correct responses were used. In addition, the effectiveness was dependent on the duration of the time-out. (Contains 6 figures.)",

The ac generators described in most introductory textbooks are single-phase generators, so physics students are not likely to learn about three-phase power. I have developed a simple way to display the waveforms of the three-phase power supplied to my lab and to demonstrate an interesting feature of three-phase power. The waveform displays require three small transformers, a Vernier Lab Pro[R] data-collection device, and a computer; but the demonstration requires only the transformers and some miniature light bulbs.

Method: The longitudinal pattern of coverage of thirty-three journals categorized in SWA as core journals (published in the 1989-1996 period) is examined. Results: The proportion of issues missing from SWA is significantly greater than 0, increase over time, and is significantly biased in favor of NASW journals. Conclusion: The errors in SWA reported here, combined with those previously reported, will exert a long-term negative impact on scholarship unless their existence becomes known to all SWA users and they take steps to compensate for the situation.

Using sentences biasing homographs toward their dominant and subordinate meanings, two experiments evaluated context effects across three naming-cue delays: immediate, baseline, baseline+600 ms all at a 0-ms interstimulus interval. When participants named a target immediately as it was presented, results converged with previous findings demonstrating initial context-sensitive meaning activation. The delayed naming conditions revealed little post-access influences for dominant contexts. Subordinate contexts, however, provided the strongest evidence of continued (or sustained) processing. It was concluded that context has immediate and automatic effects on initial meaning activation, after which, strategies are invoked for fine-tuning an interpretation of a sentence and integrating it with new information.",

Results showed a significant difference in scores between those with an ASC diagnosis and the general population. Receiver-operating-characteristic analyses showed that using a cut-off score of 76, the AQ-Child has high sensitivity (95%) and specificity (95%).

However, if the convergence is pointwise, the limit function need not be continuous (take f[subscript n](x) = x[superscript n] on [0, 1], for example). Boas has shown that the pointwise limit function of a sequence of continuous real-valued functions defined on the compact interval [a, b] is, nonetheless, continuous on a \"dense\" subset of [a, b]. In this paper, the notion of uniform convergence at a point is offered as an alternative to the Boas approach in establishing this and, consequently, other results. The arguments stay within the realm of a first proof course in classical mathematical analysis.",

On the other, we suggest that computationally, there is no advantage taking these approximations. We further justify this by employing an approach to deriving Fourier series approximations to the pendulum equation accurate to at least eleven decimal places. Students can generate highly accurate Fourier series solutions to nonlinear equations and thus concentrate on the qualitative aspects of the model rather than the computational difficulties.

However, regulations do not vary enough within state over time to allow precise identification of most individual regulation effects.

The curriculum toolkit was designed to give American Indian and Alaska Native early childhood educators who work in a variety of settings the framework for developing a research-based, developmentally appropriate, tribally specific curriculum to use with Native children aged 0-3. The curriculum toolkit should assist Native people in preserving and maintaining their unique culture and language. Challenges specific to the implementation of an early childhood program in Indian Country have been explained. A brief historical overview of Indian education has been included.",

Allen (2006). The TOSCRF is a recently published assessment of reading fluency for ages 7 years 0 months to 18 years 11 months that can be administered individually or in a group. The TOSCRF has 4 alternate forms and is brief; administration time is approximately 10 min. Because of its brevity, availability of alternate forms, and the possibility of group administration, the TOSCRF holds promise as an efficient screening and progress-monitoring tool. The authors report evidence of reliability and validity but further, independently obtained validity evidence is needed. (Contains 2 tables.)",

In this note, the condition for one root of a cubic equation to be \"the negative reciprocal of another one\" is obtained. Given that the coefficients a, b, c of the cubic equation are in arithmetical or geometrical progression, further conditions are deived for one root to be the negative reciprocal of another. These results provide useful means for checking calculated roots of cubic equations and could serve the needs of teachers and students of Mathematical Sciences in tertiary institutions when the solution of cubic equations are first studied.",

This environmental coupling can be weaker (1 beat per cycle) or stronger (2 beats per cycle). The authors examined whether strength of environmental coupling enhanced the stability of in-phase bimanual coordination. Detuning by manipulanda that produced different left and right eigenfrequencies shifted the relative phase angle from 0 degree, with the size of the shift larger for higher movement frequencies. Stronger environmental coupling was found to decrease this relative-phase shift, with accompanying increase and reduction, respectively, in recurrence quantification measures related to coordination stability and coordination noise. Stronger environmental coupling also increased oscillation amplitude. Results are considered from the perspective of parametric stabilization.",

Expectations in communication and academic domains decreased as time since implantation passed. No differences emerged in stress levels between the 3 groups. Higher levels of mothers' and fathers' education correlated with lower stress levels. Older mothers expressed lower levels on the cohesion dimension of family functioning.

During this period, most countries increased their financial investment in primary and lower secondary education, improving student-teacher ratios. However, the distribution of teachers remains uneven, with urban areas often facing recruitment challenges for specific subjects due to high demand, while rural regions contend with both persistent teacher shortages and the risk of school closures or consolidations linked to declining student populations. The demographic decline among 5-14 year-olds expected over the next decade presents both an opportunity to prioritise educational quality and a challenge to balance accessibility with resource efficiency, requiring strategic adjustments in teacher deployment and infrastructure.",

Three studies investigated what was happening in three employment sectors: tourism (service/commercial), social services (public administration), and the chemical industry (process manufacture). The methodology in each study involved a review of literature relevant to accreditation in general and to training in the employment sector and selection of the sample of individual employers. Employer data were obtained by interview, employee data by questionnaire with follow-up interviews. Respondents were as follows: tourism--30 employers, 35 employees, 0 employees interviewed; social  services--30 employers, 122 employees, 30 employees interviewed; chemical--29 employers, 20 employees, 1 employee interviewed. Findings indicated that, for some jobs/skills, there was a commonly accepted form of training, sometimes accredited, sometimes not. Employers and employees found it difficult to say what added value accreditation gave or what benefit accreditation might give, if it was not. Benefits to the individual were as follows: transfer value/career advancement, mobility, job security, self-confidence, pride, job satisfaction, and personal fulfillment. Organizational benefits included the following: improved productivity and profitability, employee motivation, industrial relations, formation of a learning company, and management style. A taxonomy that classified the reasons  for training was developed. Some disadvantages of accreditation were identified: the possibility of failure, cost and administration, time, and the consequences of raising the stakes. (YLB)",

        "description":"This study examined techniques which facilitate children's separation from their mothers and their move into a novel situation. Subjects were 32 male and 32 female 40- to 48-month-old children. Some children were visited in their homes the night before the experiment. Subjects remained with their mothers in a waiting room for 10 minutes. A stranger then entered the room and interacted with the child for 10, 1, or 0 minutes. Half of the children were greeted abruptly by the stranger, while the rest were approached gradually. Mothers then left the children and strangers, and after 5 minutes, the door was opened, allowing children to leave if they were so inclined. Results showed that the children who were visited the night before, and who were approached abruptly by the stranger,  remained in the room with the stranger longest. Those children who were visited the night before and were approached gradually, left the room with the stranger quickest. Of the remaining children who were approached abruptly by the stranger, those who had longer prior interactions with the stranger remained in the room longest. With the gradual approach, less preparatory time with the stranger resulted in children's remaining longer in the room. A &quot;matter-of-fact&quot; approach to children combined with rapport-building interactions may be the best facilitator of children remaining in strange situations. Contains seven references.

        "description":"In the Student Development Tutoring Model (SDTM), tutors engage students with content in such a way as to both increase their understanding of content as well as their ability to use learning strategies independently in the future. To develop and evaluate a procedure for preparing tutors to use behaviors consistent with the SDTM, New York's Bronx Community College undertook a 7-month project beginning in fall 1995. SDTM training sessions were held with six tutors working with English as a second language students. The tutors were then videotaped and rated in simulated tutoring sessions using a Student Development Tutoring Checklist. Individual follow-up training sessions were then held to provide feedback and schedule additional tutoring sessions, which were also rated using the  Checklist. Baseline analyses of tutors' performance before participation in the training indicated that they did not employ the SDTM approach in their tutoring, scoring from 0 to 6 on the Checklist's 20-point scale. After the first training session, tutors scores increased from 7 to 16 points, with most of the gains related to tutors' methods for assessing student skills and gaining students' commitment to learn new strategies. After the second training session, scores increased to 12 to 16 points, indicating that the method was successful in training tutors to adopt the SDTM approach. Contains 18 references. Appendixes include the training checklist and a graph of tutor performance during the training. (TGI)",

        "description":"Critical variables that underlie the performance of a national sample of young adults on a diverse set of document literacy tasks were identified. The final sample was 3,618 adults. The identification of these variables provides an important first step toward building a theoretical model that would systematically account for the constructs of document processing. The 61 tasks and their associated documents that make up the document scale of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) Young Adult Literacy assessment were parsed using a specially devised grammar. Based on the parsings, variables were identified to account for the probability of success for the total population and for major subgroups of interest. The identified variables accounted for 89% of the variance  for the total population. Among racial and ethnic groups, these variables accounted for 89% of the variance for White, 81% for Black, and 87% for Hispanic young adults. Among levels of education, these variables accounted for 56% of the variance for young adults with 0 to 8 years of schooling, 81% for young adults with 9 to 12 years of schooling, 88% for young adults with high-school degrees, and 84% for young adults with post-high-school degrees. Findings are discussed in terms of the need to provide a more general framework for describing, comparing, and researching documents. Five appendixes discuss parsing and scoring.

        "description":"The rapid growth since the 1980s of the use of total quality workforce methods in U.S. companies has contributed to the movement for integrating academic and vocational/technical education. This integration seeks to improve the intellectual capabilities of students through applied and contextual learning and thus make them more capable of adapting to changing conditions in the workplace. In response to these issues and as part of an effort to document institutional outcomes, Wisconsin's Nicolet College formed a task force to explore the role of general education within the context of the college's vocational and technical programs. Core abilities associated with curricula were identified and outcomes matrices were developed describing where, within curricula, core abilities were  taught and assessed. Using the matrices, core abilities were compared to the academic outcomes established for programs by faculty, with outcomes having a direct relationship to the core abilities given a point value of 5, those with a secondary relationship a value of 3, and those with no direct relationship a value of 0. This process allowed faculty to evaluate how effectively general education outcomes were met and indicated a curricular pattern for those outcomes not assessed. Sample matrices for the administrative assistant, barbering/cosmetology, business management, culinary arts, emergency medical services, food service, marine and outdoor power products, marketing, nursing, police science, and office assistant programs are attached.

Students in both public and nonpublic schools have been assessed in various subject areas on a regular basis. This report presents results of the 1994 NAEP trend assessments in science, mathematics, reading, and writing. To provide a numeric summary of students' performance on the assessment questions and tasks, the NAEP uses a 0-to-500 scale for each subject area. Nationally representative samples of approximately 31,000 students were involved in the NAEP 1994 trend assessments. Trend assessment results are included for each area, going back to: 1969-70 in science; 1973 in mathematics; 1971 in reading; and 1984 in  writing. Trends are discussed for students at ages 9, 13, and 17 for science, mathematics, and reading, and for students in grades 4, 8, and 11 for writing. Trends in performance differences among ethnic and racial groups are also discussed. Tests of linear and quadratic trends were supplemented by a second set of statistical tests that compared results for selected pairs of assessment years within each trend sequence. In general, trends in science and mathematics show early declines or relative stability, followed by improved performance, but reading and writing results show few indications of positive trends.

To address the lack of low-cost day care for children under 4 years of age, a home-based care alternative, involving both parent and child education components, was implemented. The parent education program included a wide variety of information about child stimulation and education, organized into a set of 60 eight-page booklets, 12 each for children ages 0-6 months, 7-12 months, 13-18 months, 19-24 months, and 25-36 months. The child education program focused on self-help, numbers, language and communication, social behavior, safety, and activities relevant to their  ages. Trained home visitors made a total of 24 evenly spaced visits during a 7-month period, when they handed out the appropriate booklets, explained the contents, and demonstrated the knowledge and skills covered in the booklets. Mothers were pre- and post-tested. The project started with 162 pairs of mothers and children and concluded with 138 pairs. At the conclusion of the project, there were significant changes in mothers' attitudes toward early education, the physical environment, provision of play materials, variety in daily stimulation, and mothers' emotional and verbal responsiveness.

This report characterizes the population served, describes the services provided, and presents program evaluation data. Although the programs serve students aged 0-21, the majority of children were of elementary school age in regular-year and summer programs. Most children were from migratory families that traveled between Colorado and at least one other state. Reading, English for limited English speakers, language arts, and mathematics were the primary areas of instruction. The summer program offered expanded instructional areas and support services. Regular and summer programs coordinated with other agencies to assure a broad range of services to migrant students and  their families. Migrant program personnel overwhelmingly rated the Migrant Student Record Transfer System (MSRTS) and the summer migrant health program as useful. Personnel offered suggestions for improvement in such areas as secondary credit exchange, parent involvement, and student progress measurement. Based on norm-referenced and criterion-referenced test results, reading and mathematics programs were effective in improving the achievement of participants. The regular year program met 5 of 9 measured objectives, and the summer program realized 7 of 11 measured objectives. This report also contains goals for 1992-93 and recommendations for future migrant programs.

The CVRP employs many characteristics of Farming Systems Research and Extension (FSR&amp;E) which provides technical training in farming through extension education. This evaluation measured the degree to which popular participation occurs in one of the CVRP's working areas, the Ipil River Watershed of Bohol Province. The objectives of the evaluation were: (1) to measure the CVRP participant's perceived performance and perceived importance for a set of activities relating to the planning, execution, and evaluation of CVRP sponsored projects; (2) to determine which of  the participation activities has a higher score for perceived importance than for performance; and (3) to determine the relationship between the CVRP program variables and responses regarding activities. In a spoken interview, participants rated local performance and importance of 23 activities relating to project planning, evaluation and implementation using a 0-4 scale. Findings showed that activities with the highest perceived participation (holding meetings, keeping records, and helping with new technology) also had the highest perceived importance. Activities with a substantive difference in means between perceived importance and perceived performance were: organizing trips, enforcing laws, looking for outside resources, registering associations, and experimentation. Recommendations  include increasing local participation in the identified areas and improving methodology in future studies. (KS)",

Most parents set aside a specific time for homework review,  think that their children's homework load is fair, and feel schools can improve. Parents usually understand their children's homework assignments. Parents have many suggestions about improving homework habits, and students have many suggestions about making homework more interesting. Each day, most younger students spend 0-2 hours on homework, and most older students spend 1-3 hours on homework. Most students do homework at home. Most younger students get homework help from parents. Most older students get homework help from parents or friends. Most students think homework assignments are challenging and worthwhile.

Direct economic impact was assessed by examining institutional expenditures in the metropolitan area; expenditures of college employees in the area; expenditures of students; and expenditures of campus visitors in the metropolitan area. Indirect impact was assessed through the use of a mathematical multiplier applied to the direct impact indicators to account for additional business volume generated through re-spending of the direct expenditures. Results of the study included the following: (1) estimates of expenditures in the metropolitan  area were $12,042,072 for the institution, $6,715,689 for employees, $25,689,160 for students, and $0 for visitors, for a total of $44,446,921 in direct economic impact; (2) application of the mathematical multiplier produced a total spending impact of $100,005,572; (3) in addition to business volume impact, JCCC generated a total of 3,698 full-time jobs in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area; and (4) for every dollar spent by taxpayers in support of JCCC, $3.08 was returned to the area's economy by the institution.

Adults in a control and an experimental group (15 in each) worked one-on-one with volunteer tutors using the &quot;Laubach Way to Reading&quot; materials. The experimental group also had computer-assisted instruction. Other project activities were the following: (1) tutors received computer training; (2) software was created to correlate with Laubach materials; (3) computer programs for adults reading at grade 5-6 levels and basic mathematics books and software were purchased; and (4) peripherals required for use with certain computer programs were purchased. There was a shift  away from computer programs focusing on phonics and toward the more global, visual methods of &quot;Project Star&quot; software, favored by adult students. Analysis indicated that the control group showed an advancement of 0.7 grades per 50 hours of work, and the experimental group showed an advancement of 1.2 grades. Other findings were that students showed evidence of tremendous growth in self-confidence; various reading styles existed among students; and unemployed adults were using the computers to gain skills and enhance their employability. The project also acquired library materials, recruited and trained volunteer tutors, and publicized the program.

        "description":"Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to a set of competencies to process, understand, and reason with affective information. Recent studies suggest ability measures of experiential and strategic EI differentially predict performance on non-emotional and emotionally laden tasks. To explore cognitive processes underlying these abilities further, we varied the affective context of a traditional letter-based &quot;n&quot;-back working-memory task. In study 1, participants completed 0-, 2-, and 3-back tasks with flanking distractors that were either emotional (fearful or happy faces) or non-emotional (shapes or letters stimuli). Strategic EI, but not experiential EI, significantly influenced participants' accuracy across all n-back levels, irrespective of flanker type. In Study 2, participants completed 1-, 2-, and 3-back levels. Experiential EI was positively associated with response times for emotional flankers at the 1-back level but not other levels or flanker types, suggesting those higher in experiential EI reacted slower on low-load trials with affective context. In Study 3, flankers were asynchronously presented either 300 ms or 1000 ms before probes. Results mirrored Study 1 for accuracy rates and Study 2 for response times. Our findings (a) provide experimental evidence for the distinctness of experiential and strategic EI and (b) suggest that each are related to different aspects of cognitive processes underlying working memory.",

        "description":"Many school leaders who sought to enculturate distributive leadership and shared decision-making within their schools/school districts may not have adequate data tools that would encourage teachers and educational leaders to actively participate during times of decision-making. School organizations may struggle in this area and could benefit from the decision-making practices of other learning organizations (Adler-Greene, 2019; Azeska et al., 2017; Darrow, 2016; Flowers &amp;Carpenter, 2009). One such learning organization that has experience in the data decision-making cycle is the U.S. Army (Greer et al., 2018; Hernandez et al., 2017; Parham; 2015; U.S Army Doctrinal Publication, The Operations Process No. 5.0, 2019). This field study explored and compared the cultural use of decision-making tools of a U.S. school district located in the Southeastern region of the United States of America to the cultural use of decision-making tools of a U.S. Army Military unit located in the Southeastern region of the United States of America. The results suggests that U.S. Army decision-making tools may be more sophisticated in solving complex problems than current education decision-making tools used by school principals and enculturates practices of distributive leadership and shared decision-making (Greer et al., 2018;Hernandez et al., 2017; Parham, 2015; U.S Army Doctrinal Publication, The Operations Process No. 5.0, 2019; U.S. Army Field Manual, Commander and Staff Organization and Operations No.6-0, 2015).",

The &quot;CiTA&quot; video module was developed using the ADDIE Model that is supported by the Delphi Technique. This study utilised the Design Development Research (DDR) approach that consisted of three phases. However, for the purpose of this article, the researchers will only discuss Phase 2: Design and Development in developing the Interactive Teaching Approach Video module. The responding twelve VAE teachers provided positive feedback towards learning and teaching using the tutorial module. With the interquartile range of 0 to 1.00 for all items included in the activities, all Expert Teachers in the field of Special Education approved with the content of the CiTA video module from the two rounds of Delphi surveys performed. The CiTA video module was developed with the inclusion of all items that were highly approved by the participating Expert Teachers in the Special Needs Education. Since the two rounds of item evaluation demonstrated a significant relationship between Round One and Round Two, the development of the video module could improve inclusive learning in the Malaysian classroom.",

Eighteen fourth and fifth grade target students (M[subscript age]=10.1, SD=0.44) were observed every 30 sec during two to four lessons each day for five school days (engagement and instructional activities), on average 66.05 times per lesson (SD=19.16, Range=15-80, n[subscript obs]=14,994) between 9-18 lessons during a week. Simultaneously, students provided 1-3 electronic questionnaire self-reports per lesson (M[subscript self_report]=35.1, SD=12.6, Range=19-52, n[subscript self_report]=631). We regressed observed engagement (0 = off-task, 1 = on-task) on self-reported learning experiences using 3-level (time-points nested in lessons, nested in students) Bayesian logistic regression models in &quot;brms.&quot; Observed engagement diminished during lessons, and was predicted by higher cognitive engagement, and instructional activities. As compared to teacher-led instruction, engagement was higher during individual tasks, teacher-supported tasks, and assessments. Overall self-reported and observed engagement within lessons converged, supporting their use in intraindividual research.",

        "description":"Many active, inquiry-based learning activities nowadays rely upon the students' capacity to perform efficient information research on the Internet. Study and Research Paths (SRPs) have been proposed to model inquiry learning, and successfully used as teaching formats in different areas. In an SRP the search for an answer to a generating question (Q[subscript 0]) leads to a sequence of derived questions and answers, which are modeled using a Q-A map. We have investigated the benefits of using SRPs and Q-A maps to improve Web-based inquiry learning. We designed an SRP for a course on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), belonging to an Engineering degree. The class-session SRPs revolved around Q0 questions such as 'What is a «firewall»?', 'What are the main features of 5G?' etc. Our results, based on the analysis of six courses conducted between 2015/16-2020/21, show that the SRP is an enriching tool for learning ICT: content expands beyond that of the traditional course and is maintained up-to-date. Students are engaged and motivated by the active-search activity. In addition, the SRP helps in improving the students' skills in searching and selecting information on the Internet. The Q-A maps served both the students, to structure their Web inquiry, and the teacher, to monitor the learning study process.",

Therefore, the organization of the Islamic higher educations must be coupled with the quality of learning services. Some institutes and universities are optimizing their learning services, while the others tend to choose different service patterns since there is no standard instrument of the quality of the learning service. This research was conducted to develop an assessment instrument model to measure the learning services in Islamic higher education. This research applied a research and development approach through three stages, namely: predevelopment, development, and application of the model. The development of the instrument was done through individual, small group, and large group testing through field tests involving students of Islamic higher education. The instrument model includes the aspects of tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, empathy, and assurance along with the indicators, which is, analyzed using Confirmatory Factor Analysis. The findings of the research shows that learning assessment instrument model of Islamic higher education developed by integrating some aspects categorized as goodness of fit, which is, proved by Lambda score (?)&gt; 0,30, ?- score (p)&gt; 0, 05, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) &lt;0.08, and Goodness of Fit Index (GFI&gt; 0.90). The developed instrument has high validity, while the aspects of learning services meet the requirements and are reliably to assess learning services at Islamic Higher Education.

Data were collected from a group of freshman university students (male and female) studying in Islamic Azad university of Sabzevar, Iran (N = 73). Based on their performance on a Michigan TOEFL reading test battery, they were first randomly divided into three groups, each completing one of the three vocabulary learning tasks that varied in the amount of L1/L2 use they induced during a two month period. The tasks were &quot;Reading plus further L2 reading&quot;, &quot;Reading plus L1 translation only&quot; and &quot;dictionary work&quot;. The statistical analysis of the students' performance on vocabulary post-tests was performed through One-Way ANOVA followed with the post hoc Regression Scheffe test to analyze which task has created a meaningful mean variability at 0/05 for both between and within groups. The results showed the outperformance of the group receiving &quot;reading plus further L2 reading&quot; tasks and not the tasks involving more L1 use.

Students acquire ways of thinking, habits of persistence and curiosity, and confidence in unfamiliar situations by learning to solve problems. In fact, there were students who had difficulty in solving problems. The students were naive problem solvers. This research aimed to describe the thinking process of naive problem solvers based on heuristic of Polya. The researcher gave two problems to students at grade XI from one of high schools in Palangka Raya, Indonesia. The research subjects were two students with problem solving scores of 0 or 1 for both problems (naive problem solvers). The score was determined by using a holistic rubric with maximum score of 4. Each subject was interviewed by the researcher separately based on the subject's solution. The results showed that the naive problem solvers read the problems for several times in order to understand them. The naive problem solvers could determine the known and the unknown if they were written in the problems. However, they faced difficulties when the information in the problems should be processed in their minds to construct a mental image. The naive problem solvers were also failed to make an appropriate plan because they did not have a problem solving schema. The schema was constructed by the understanding of the problems, conceptual and procedural knowledge of the relevant concepts, knowledge of problem solving strategies, and previous experiences in solving isomorphic problems.",

The visualization and interpretation of three-dimensional objects in tactile devices and the possibility of digital manufacturing with 3D printers, offers an opportunity to include replicas of sculptures in teaching and, thus, facilitate the 3D interpretation of the sculptural heritage. In this research, an open access 3D educational resource is created for teaching in the aim of Art and drawing subjects. In Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain, fifteen students of &quot;High School&quot;, worked in a traditional 2D environment and in a 3D environment with sculptural heritage replicas in digital and tangible versions. The three-dimensional interpretation of the sculptures is evaluated with a 3D viewing test created for this experiment, to verify whether the material used does indeed facilitate the 3D interpretation. The results show a greater difference using 3D representations compared with the 2D versions in the three ambits analysed. In modularity, the percentage of correct answers in the 3D viewing test are 84% with 3D technologies, versus 40% with 2D representations, in volumetry, 90,7% versus 72%, but in orthogonal views is where the biggest difference is with a 76,7% of correct answers in the 3D viewing test using 3D technologies versus 0% using 2D versions.",

        "description":"The test-retest reliability of the American Guidance Service (AGS) Early Screening Profiles (ESP)--a battery measuring development in the cognition/language, motor, and self-help/social areas--was examined. The ESP is a nationally normed screening battery for children ages 2 years 0 months through 6 years 11 months. In addition, parent and teacher questionnaires were completed. The sample consisted of 116 children (60 females and 56 males) within the specified age range. Overall, 65% of the children were White, 31% were Black, 3% were Hispanic, and 1% was Southeast Asian. Each child was evaluated by examiners trained in administration of the battery. Retesting occurred an average of 3 weeks after initial testing, with a range of 2 days to 2 months. Pearson product moment  correlations were computed; they produced the following test-retest coefficients for the immediate retest group: Cognitive/Language Profile, 0.90; Motor Profile, 0.70; and Self-Help/Social Profile, 0.81. For the delayed retest group, coefficients were: Cognitive/Language, 0.51; Motor Profile, 0.55; and Self-Help/Social Profile, 0.77. All correlations were statistically significant and fell in the moderate to strong range. The coefficients for the immediate group compare favorably with other instruments; the lower coefficients for the delayed group suggest that cognitive/language and motor skills may be very fluid at this age. Two tables summarize the data. (Author/SLD)",

Introductory sections provide information on the development and use of the manual, and on the philosophy and goals of the ABE-ESL program and objectives for readers at the 0-3 grade levels and 4-5 grade levels. The next section presents an introduction to the assessment of reading skills, including information on the use of various reading tests, instructor and student preparation, steps for diagnostic procedures, and basic reading skill areas. The purpose of the next section is to show how materials chosen for the ABE-ESL program relate to  the program's objectives, and to describe how the materials are used to remediate specific skills. Next, the manual discusses several unconventional approaches to remedial instruction, including the multi-sensory approach, neurological impress method, glass analysis, and cloze procedure. In the next section, records and forms to help the teacher assess student progress and the effectiveness of instructional methods and materials are discussed. After discussing two readability formulas, the manual provides a sample of teaching aids, including a list of paperbacks, vocabulary methods for visual and auditory learners, a series of word lists, pronunciation hints, 15 principles of teaching word identification, instructions for building sight vocabularies and using language experience with  adults, and a glossary.

Attention was also directed to the features of PSI used: mastery criterion, self-pacing, proctors, number of times students could retake an exam, and the number of forms of each examination used. The PSI includes clearly delineated objectives or study guides, formulated by the instructor, and presented to the students as a series of units arranged in hierarchical order. From this material students learn, usually without lectures. Of 115 full-time faculty members who were sent a questionnaire, 85 responded. Eighty-one percent of the respondents used the lecture method, and usage ranged from 100 percent by the natural sciences and  engineering department to a low of 68 percent in the humanities department. The seminar/discussion method was used by 27 percent of the respondents. The humanities faculty used this method the most (50 percent), and the engineering faculty the least (0 percent). Many faculty used lectures for lower-level classes, and seminar/discussion for upper-level classes. PSI, the least used method, was used by faculty in the behavioral sciences (33 percent) and business (10 percent). Only 18 percent of the respondents had ever used the PSI. The PSI features most often used were self-pacing, a mastery criterion, and the use of several versions of the exam over each unit. The questionnaire is included. (SW)",

The purpose of this study is to analyze studies in which social stories were used for teaching social skills to individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The present study includes a descriptive review and meta-analysis of single-subject studies that met the criteria. In all studies, social validity, maintenance, and generalization data were collected in 56.25%, 50%, and 31.25% of the respective studies. Although most studies showed that social stories were effective in teaching social skills to children with ASD in the descriptive study, in the meta-analytic study, the mean of Percantage of Non-overlapping Data (PND) scores for all studies was 63.43%, with a range of 0% to 100%. Results suggest that social stories should not yet be considered as evidence based practice for teaching social skills to individuals with ASD. However, social stories seem to be a promising practice that warrants future research. Results will be discussed extensively and future directions for research and practice will be addressed.

        "description":"Because foreign language placement at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is based solely on College Entrance Examination Board Foreign Language Placement Test scores, first semester courses are composed of students with heterogeneous foreign language backgrounds. French 101 was chosen to study the relationship between two entering variables--number of high school units in French, and number of years intervening between the last high school French course and 101 enrollment--and several French 101 in-class achievement variables. Data were gathered from 86% of one semester's French 101 enrollment. These data indicated that students with no French high school units showed higher drop rates, lower in-class test scores, and lower final grades compared to students with  French high school units. Specific comparisons between students with 0 and 2 French high school units indicated that differences in test scores decreased across the semester. Examination of the intervening years variable indicated that it was not systematically related to course performance. The authors concluded that the College Board French Placement Test is not an appropriate instrument for placing college students into lower level French courses. Implications for other first semester foreign language courses are discussed, and several short- and long-term recommendations are made. (Author/GDC)",

Teachers often fail to find what their purpose of acting among technologies is and what the method for teaching elementary school students online would be right. Considering student's need in communication with a teacher to be at the core of learning as it is, we define what shape the new curricula will take from year to year. This research is a two-stage experiment with two additional surveys that included 430 students aged 8-9 years from across the Republic of Tatarstan. Students need not only facilitators to get better grades, but also a teacher mentoring them. Student-teacher communication can help students to raise their academic performance and motivation. Questions asked by students in time reduce the number of those who cannot reach their grade level from 9% to 0%, and increase the number of A-level students from 11% to 26%. The results confirm that the on-the-spot teaching method should be introduced into the e-learning curricula for primary school so that it provides a more intimate communication between the student and the teacher during classes. Results can be put into practical context to create new e-learning courses for public and private schools.",

Equations for the following principal physical parameters were derived and calculated: period T, angular frequency w, orbital radius R, apex angle ø, tension force F[subscript T] and centripetal force F[subscript C] (additional functions were calculated when required). Calculations were performed over a wide range of values of the apex angle (0° = ø = 85°), corresponding to a calculated tension force F[subscript T] range of approximately (mg = F[subscript T] = 12 N) or alternatively (mg = F[subscript T] = 11 mg) for the string. A technique is demonstrated to determine an accurate value of an unknown pendulum mass, by using a graphical analysis. Intercepts and asymptotic lines with respect to both the horizontal and vertical axes are described and fully explained. The main emphasis for this paper is to present highly detailed graphical charts for the calculated theoretical functions and appropriate physical parameters. Theoretical analysis is presented in comprehensive detail, showing full mathematical derivations and alternative equations when this approach is considered to be advantageous for both understanding and computational presentation.

        "description":"In this study Type I Error and the power rates of omega (?) and GBT (generalized binomial test) indices were investigated for several nominal alpha levels and for 40 and 80-item test lengths with 10,000-examinee sample size under several test level restrictions. As a result, Type I error rates of both indices were found to be below the acceptable nominal alpha levels. The power study showed that average test difficulty was very effective for power (true detection) rates of indices. Clear patterns were observed for the increase of test difficulty in favor of both ? and GBT power rate. Contrary to expectations; average test discrimination was not as effective as average test difficulty. The results of the interaction effects of item discrimination and difficulty showed that for the cases whose b parameters were lower than 0 with weak discrimination, indices had weak power for both ? and GBT. In addition, for the cases whose b parameter levels were below zero with high discrimination indices, the power performance of both answer-copying indices were very weak. Results for test length showed that with the increase of test length the power rate of both ? and GBT tended to increase. Also, ? performed slightly better than GBT or very close to GBT for 80-item test length however, ? performed better than GBT in terms of power rate for the cases with 40-item test length.",

This scale measures a person's level of well being using five components. The measurement scale developed consists of 23 items with a scoring interval from 0 to 10. The internal consistency coefficient of the scale is 0.82. The adaptation study of the PERMA wellbeing scale was applied on a group of university students. For language validity, some translation texts (from English to Turkish/from Turkish to English) were given to the students in the department of ELT and positive significant correlations where obtained from the English and Turkish forms (r = 0.95, p&lt;0.01; r = 0.95, p&lt;0.01). The measurement tool with 23 articles and 8 dimensions tested by confirmatory factor analysis was seen to have enough goodness of fit index (2/sd = 100.96/41, p = 0.00, RMSEA = 0.076, CFI = 0.96, GFI = 0.93, NNFI = 0.94). As a result of the correlation analyses made for the criterion validity of PERMA well-being scale; a significant positive relation was found with subjective well-being scale and psychological well-being scale. The internal consistency coefficient of the scale was a = 0.82 and test retest correlation was found at 0.81. As a result, the 23-item and eight-dimensional measuring tool became ready for use by the researchers.",

        "description":"Background: The pervasive gap in achievement among impoverished children has been investigated primarily in terms of parental investments, specifically parent to child speech and other forms of cognitive stimulation (e.g., toys, print materials). This research extends that literature by considering the role of a non-cognitive factor, namely task persistence, in the income-achievement gap. Using task persistence as the hypothesized mediator, duration of childhood in poverty is used to predict two educational variables - perceived academic competence and educational attainment. Although bivariate relationships between each of the variables have been demonstrated in past research, a full model linking task persistence with the income-achievement gap has not been investigated thus far. Methods: Using multiple waves of longitudinal data, duration of childhood poverty (ages 0-9) is used to predict both perceived academic competence (age 17) and educational attainment (age 23) with task persistence (average of ages 9, 13, 17) as a mediator. Results: With task persistence included in each model, the relationships between duration of childhood in poverty and both perceived academic competence and educational attainment are significantly reduced, confirming a mediational influence of task persistence. Conclusions: As hypothesized, task persistence statistically mediates the relationship between duration of childhood in poverty and educational outcomes. The implications of these findings on school success and intergenerational poverty are addressed, as well as suggestions for future research.",

        "description":"The aim of this study is to determine the effect of participation in school sports teams of students studying in middle school on their levels of school engagement. The relational screening model was used in the study. The study group of the research consisted of a total of 610 students selected by the random sampling method and studying at middle school level (fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grades). For analysis of the data obtained from the participants by means of the 'School Engagement Scale', descriptive statistics were calculated and interpreted with independent samples &quot;t&quot;-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Based on the research findings, the mean level of school engagement of the participants was found to be 3.62 ± 0.51. In terms of the gender variable, a significant difference in favour of female participants was found. With respect to another variable, that of state of participation in school teams, it was determined that as length of participation in school teams increased, mean level of school engagement of the participants also increased. In conclusion, it was determined that participation in school teams made a positive contribution to students' engagement in school, and it is recommended that in order to further increase students' level of school engagement, measures should be taken to ensure students' participation in school teams.

This web-based version was explored to investigate its reliability, face validity, criterion-related validity, and concordance with the Quick Placement Test (QPT). The participants were 585 undergraduate students studying varying academic areas, in a government university in northern Thailand during the 2010 academic year; all the students were volunteers. The instruments used included: (1) the Quick Placement Test (QPT), (2) the Web-Based mC-Test (WB mC-Test), and (3) a questionnaire concerning the face validity of the WB mC-Test. The findings revealed that the WB mC-Test had high reliability and high face validity. The Pearson correlation between the WB mC-Test and the QPT was significant at a medium level. Using a statistical model, it was found that the WB mC-Test could differentiate subjects into 4 levels based on the ALTE (Association of Language Testers in Europe): Level 0 Beginner to Level 3 Upper Intermediate. The WB mC-Test is supported to be a practical preliminary self-assessment test for EFL university students.",

Previous studies in Norway reported, that the prevalence rate for 0-10-year-old children is 1 in 166, and in the case of 11-year-old children it is 1 in 125. Moreover, another nationwide study discovered that 1 in 192 males and 1 in 695 females between the ages of 1-16 years had autism in Norway in the year 2016. This study is underpinned by the data from the National Patient Registry (NPR) for registered incidences of autism/ASD (ICD-10: F84.0 Childhood autism and F84.5 Asperger syndrome). The results show that the prevalence rates of autism/ASD in the capital city of Oslo increased from 2012 to 2016 and the number of children with autism/ASD doubled during this period. Furthermore, in 2016 the results revealed that that 1 in 349 males and 1 in 1594 females between the ages of 1-5 years old had Autism/ASD. Similarly, among the age group of 6-16 years, 1 among 157 males and 1 among 544 females had autism/ASD in the capital city of Oslo in 2016. These findings suggest a 'school-age-effect' in the increase of prevalence rates among the school-age children compared to the preschool-age children. In the following study, the results are presented and discussed along with some suggestions for the educational and healthcare authorities.",

Women (73 percent) were more interested than men (38 percent) in taking such courses, and Arts and Sciences students were most interested (65 percent) and Agriculture students least interested (0 percent). Students were most in favor of a major in women's studies (54 percent in favor) as opposed to having a separate department of women's studies (58 percent opposed), and 59 percent felt that individual departments should offer courses on women. Students were most interested (in descending order) in courses on: Sociology  of Women, Psychology of Women, Sex and Politics, Biology of Women, Women in Literature, History of Women, and Women in Education. Women were more interested in the Psychology of Women than the Sociology of Women, while men were the opposite. Results of this survey suggest that steps ought to be taken at the University of Maryland to implement a women's studies curriculum. Students surveyed were overwhelmingly in favor of such an undertaking and there are large numbers of faculty members interested and willing to teach courses in some area relevant to their interests and to women's studies.

The parent was to indicate on console pushbuttons the number of candies (0 to 9) to be added to the child's supply for a success or to be subtracted for an error so that  the child would best learn how to do the puzzle. In reality, the child was playing in an adjacent room, and the events that the parent believed were being produced by the child were experimentally manipulated. In baseline, the child appeared to make 50% successes independently of the parent's teaching strategy. Successes then became contingent upon the parent's selection of high, and later low, intensities of punishment for errors. Finally, 100% errors were programmed regardless of parental punishment. Results indicated that the parents' and children's gender and the children's apparent responsiveness to parental discipline combined to determine the parents' administrations of rewarding and punishing consequences for the children's behaviors.

        "description":"Studies of occupational choice and the demand for education conducted by economists have generally focused on the pecuniary cost and earnings streams associated with these choices. It has been recognized that many other factors influence such choices, but models using earnings alone have been fairly successful in predicting these choices for men. This paper examines the returns for women with college education, graduate education, and nurses training. The study examines the following two alternative income streams associated with women's educational and occupational choices: (1) discounted earnings, the traditional measure of returns; and (2) discounted family income resulting from marriage. Tables are presented dealing with: (1) women's mean earnings, husbands' income, and  family income in 1959, by women's education and race; (2) values at age 18 of various measures of lifetime income for women by education and race at discount rates of 0%, 5%, and 10%, in $1,000's; (3) internal rates of return to women's education estimated from women's earnings and husbands' income; (4) men's mean earnings, wives' income, and family income in 1959 by men's education; (5) academic degrees earned by sex in 1960-61 and 1964-65; (6) women's mean earnings, husbands' income and family income in 1959 for registered nurses and for other women with 13-15 years of schooling; and (7) number of entrants into registered nurses' training and general college programs in selected years.

        "description":"Piagetian theory provides direction and support for an early identification, early intervention focus for special education of handicapped children. This focus includes guidance and training for parent and child to enhance their relationship and to facilitate the child's movement through normal developmental sequences in sensory-motor, cognitive, linguistic, and social areas. Piaget's sequence of stages in the development of imitative behavior is especially important for parent-infant education: (1) reflective or contagious imitation--0 to 1 month; (2) intentional sporadic imitation--1 to 3 months; (3) intentional systematic imitation of sounds and movements within child's repertoire--3 to 8 months; (4) imitation of movements within child's repertoire which he cannot observe  himself performing (coordination of elements)--8 to 10 months--and beginnings of imitation of new auditory and visual-motor models--10 to 11 months; (5) systematic imitation of new auditory and visual-motor models--12 to 15 months; and (6) deferred imitation and beginnings of representational imitation (internalized coordination precedes external manifestation)--15 to 17 months. Pseudo or elicited imitation can be effectively implemented with very young exceptional infants and children. Care must be taken to guide parents and teachers in &quot;natural&quot; intervention techniques that do not strain parents or child. Home demonstration should begin early and continue until the child is ready for school. Models for imitation must be consistent with the child's capabilities and experiences and should  build upon them. (KM)",

        "author":["Lombardi, John"],
        "description":"Almost from the beginning of the junior college movement, its educational leaders emphasized the desirability of maintaining a no-tuition policy in order to extend free public education through the first two years of college. However, at no time in the 75 year history of public two-year colleges has there been widespread acceptance of the no- or low-tuition policy. Periodically, state laws have prohibited tuition but all of them have been amended or circumvented, allowing colleges to impose fees. Today, no state prohibits the charging of tuition and/or fees. Tuition/fees in two-year colleges average from 50% to 60% of those charged in four-year colleges. Average tuition and fees in 1974-75 have been variously estimated at $263 to $337. For the majority of students nationally they  range from $0-$99 (low) to $100-$299 (moderate), but for the majority of colleges they are moderate to high ($300-$499). Tuition rises annually at a rate of 15% or more and by 1980 will average $400. What effect tuition will have on the ideal of the &quot;open door&quot; depends on the amount of state and federal grants to institutions with limited incomes. It seems reasonable to expect that as tuition rises to the $400-$800 range, a large number of students from low income families will be unable to attend the two-year college. (Author/JDS)",

        "description":"Early childhood education plays a critical role in establishing positive social-emotional behaviors and promoting the development of skills needed to succeed in elementary school. Although inclusion of children with disabilities (CWD) in early childhood classrooms is increasing throughout the world, numerous social, logistical, and political factors continue to present challenges to full inclusion. The Montessori educational approach, established at the beginning of the 20th century and now applied widely throughout Europe and the United States, may present a highly suitable learning context for CWD, particularly given its historical basis in efforts to meet the needs of underprivileged and cognitively delayed children. On a theoretical level, the inclusion of CWD should be an accepted practice for Montessori programs, yet reports of the number and characteristics of CWD attending Montessori programs are scarce. This paper reports upon the findings of a survey of the current enrollment of CWD in U.S. Montessori Early Childhood programs. The survey indicated that CWD represent 3.75% of the Infant and Toddler (0-3 years) population and 8.49% of the Early Childhood (3-6 years) population at responding institutions. Additionally, although school directors indicated that their teachers generally feel confident and competent including CWD in their classrooms, they expressed a need for ongoing professional development and additional support from special education experts to further strengthen the inclusion of CWD in all aspects of Montessori education.",

The methodology corresponds to a quantitative approach, and a survey technique was applied. A 21-item questionnaire card was designed, with a Likert scale that ranged from 1 to 5 for the formative research variable, and 30-item card with a Likert scale from 0 to 4 for the attainment of skills based on the thesis review. The instrument was validated by expert opinion, reaching an average of 85%. The reliability of the questionnaires was 0.92 and 0.95, respectively, according to the Cronbach's alpha method. The population consisted of 1448 theses published in the institutional repository from 2016 to 2020, and the sample was made up of 110 theses from 11 colleges, with a 95% level of confidence. The results indicate that the perception of the achievement of research skills, instructor support during the research process and institutional support are &quot;positive&quot;; likewise, review of the theses reached a &quot;successful&quot; level.

        "description":"The present study seeks to determine whether superior musical hearing is correlated with successful production of second language (L2) intonation patterns. Fifty Polish speakers of English at the university level were recorded before and after an extensive two-semester accent training course in English. Participants were asked to read aloud a series of short dialogues containing different intonation patterns, complete two musical hearing tests measuring tone deafness and melody discrimination, and a survey regarding musical experience. We visually analyzed and assessed participants' intonation by comparing their F[subscript 0] contours with the model provided by their accent training teachers following ToBI (Tones and Break Indices) guidelines and compared the results with the musical hearing test scores and the survey responses. The results suggest that more accurate pitch perception can be related to more correct production of L2 intonation patterns as participants with superior musical ear produced more native-like speech contours after training, similar to those of their teachers. After dividing participants into four categories based on their musical hearing test scores and musical experience, we also observed that some students with better musical hearing test scores were able to produce more correct L2 intonation patterns. However, students with poor musical hearing test scores and no musical background also improved, suggesting that the acquisition of L2 intonation in a formal classroom setting can be successful regardless of one's musical hearing skills.",

Most scales are developed based on a broad conceptual framework, and their metric validation is insufficient and of low quality. The aim of this systematic review is to analyse the psychometric quality of these tests and identify aspects in need of improvement. To this end, the PRISMA methodology and the WOS and ProQuest databases were used to search for articles addressing this topic. A total of 680 articles were identified, of which 72 were selected using the established inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results indicate a scarcity of independent studies on the statistical measurement of the scales. The selected articles are very heterogeneous and validate these tests using adaptations of common metrics. Most perform cross-cultural, concurrent, and prognostic validations of the tests. We conclude that the quality of the scale metrics and other common aspects of these tests need to be improved, particularly sample sparsity and heterogeneity, as well as cultural biases. We underline the importance of applying for advances in metrics for the construction of developmental scales and recommend the use of computerised versions to improve their ease of use and efficiency.",

In 2005, nationally representative samples of about 172,000 fourth-grade and 162,000 eighth-grade students nationwide participated in that assessment. Results are presented in two ways: in terms of scale scores and as the percentage of students scoring at or above three benchmarks called achievement levels. NAEP mathematics scores are reported for grades 4 and 8 on a 0-500 scale. Scale score results also are presented for students at various percentiles. Item maps provide interpretative information about a scale score in terms of the skills and knowledge students with a certain score are likely to have. Items placed along the scale in an item map demonstrate how skills correspond to levels of performance. NAEP results are reported at three achievement levels: Basic, Proficient, and Advanced. Achievement levels are performance standards showing what students should know and be able to do. They are set by the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB), based on recommendations from panels of educators and members of the public, to provide a context for interpreting student performance on NAEP. In this report, the achievement-level results are reported as percentages of students performing at or above Basic and at or above Proficient. (Contains 16 figures and 20 tables.)",

        "description":"This study presents the most comprehensive picture, to date, of public investments in the education and development of children by three age groupings--the early learning years (roughly 0-5), the school-aged years (roughly 6-18), and the college-aged years (roughly 19-23). It is based upon detailed analysis of state, federal, and school district spending in 12 states across the country, conducted by organizations in those states with strong understanding of early childhood services and state budgeting. It is designed to give policymakers and the public a better understanding of overall public investments on education and development of children, in the context of the research on brain growth and child development and the research on potential returns on investment from early learning  programs. This report is part of a two-year effort to organize the complex array of state, federal, and school district funding streams in a way that states can determine how much government invests on education and development and other services by child age. Appendices include: (1) 12-State Data; and (2) Individual State Data. (Contains 28 endnotes, 18 graphs, and 1 table.)

        "description":"This audit reports on the availability of computer resources at the City University of New York's (CUNY) senior colleges. CUNY is the largest urban and the third largest public university system in the United States. Of the 19 CUNY campuses located throughout the five boroughs, 11 are senior colleges offering four-year degrees. For the fall 2001 semester, enrollment at these colleges totaled 129,710. CUNY colleges maintain computers for student use in classrooms and in computer labs, and provide information technology (IT) support staff in the labs to assist students. Each college decides how much of its budget to spend on technology. As of the fall 2002 semester, CUNY students will be assessed a technology fee to help defray campus computer-related costs. This audit explores  whether student computer resources at CUNY Senior Colleges are up to date, adequate, and accessible. The audit found that there was one computer for every three students at York, while there was one for every 42 students at Hunter. Hunter had 0% out-of-date computers, while John Jay and Brooklyn each had 41% out-of-date. Nine of eleven colleges acknowledged that they did not provide enough computer lab hours to meet the needs of their students, a problem attributed to IT staffing shortages. This audit concludes with recommendations to the colleges. Appended are: a list of major contributors to the report; comments of CUNY Central and College Officials; and the State Comptroller's Notes.

The survey was designed to assess satisfaction with the institution. Administered to help meet the accreditation standards set by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), the survey questioned six groups of people impacted by the actions of the community college: administrators, full-time faculty, part-time faculty, full-time staff, students, and members of the surrounding community. A total of 2,341 surveys were issued, with 514 (22% response rate) being completed and returned. The survey asked people to rate, on a scale of 0 (no opinion) to 5 (strong agreement), certain aspects of the college. Different statistical tests  were used to compare results between the 2000 survey and the 1997 survey on institutional effectiveness. Results indicated that: (1) a majority of the respondents agreed that the college was effective; (2) the average response to survey items was 3; (3) no survey item showed a response average of strong agreement or strong disagreement; (4) the highest rating was for the statement &quot;I am proud to work at Cerritos College;&quot; and (5) the two statements that were rated less than 3 were &quot;the board solicits feedback as part of its self-evaluation process&quot; and &quot;I have adequate input into the budget process.&quot; (MKF)",

Two projects that can be used by other educators as freestanding projects or as the core for further study in their applications illustrate the transfer of theory to application in the context of problem solving. The first project involves the design and implementation of a low-cost electromyogram and the interfacing of muscle signals to a computer. The system allows for the control of a computer using electromyographic signals from human muscles. The key emphasis is the development of an inexpensive universal system that can be used by  others to further their skills in the system's applications with the required safety features associated with interfacing humans to machines. The second project is the implementation of a remote data logger. It uses a radio frequency link for analog data collection. The system allows for the computer collection of any analog data that can be translated as a varying DC voltage level between 0-5 volts. It allows a computer to collect analog data from a site up to 250 feet from the computer without connecting wires. The use of such capstone experiences as these has proven to be an effective method in helping students translate theory into application. (YLB)",

This report analyzes how public schools' participation in the E-Rate program varied by their percentage American Indian enrollment, with a focus on Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) schools. The analysis covers program Year 1 (January 1998-June 1999) and Year 2 (July 1999-June 2000). Results indicate that most non-BIA schools serving American Indians applied for the E-Rate program. Application rates varied from about 60 percent for schools with 50-80 percent American Indian enrollment to about 80 percent for schools with 0-2 percent American Indians. While application rates generally increased with school size, rates of non-BIA schools with over 80 percent American Indian  enrollment were not as clearly related to school size. BIA schools greatly increased their E-Rate use between Years 1 and 2. After a Year-1 application rate of only 35 percent, BIA schools had the highest Year-2 rate of any group of schools analyzed--over 95 percent--and received over 3 times the national average in per-student funding commitments. Total commitments to BIA schools in Year 2 were over $6 million. All BIA applicants were funded. BIA Year-2 application rates were higher than other schools with similar levels of poverty and rural/urban location and much higher than other schools with 100 percent American Indian enrollment.

The electronic course that was the focus of this study was offered in fall terms of 1995 through 1999. There were 23 participants in the electronic only classes, 69 in the traditional only classes, and 27 in the combination classes, with a majority membership of white females in all classes. Multiple choice pretests and posttests were given. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was run using posttest scores as the response variable and pretest scores as the covariate. Random selection was not possible since participation in any version of the course was optional. Normality and homoscedasticty across all groups were verified. Homogeneity of regression  was observed in scatterplots of pretest scores versus posttest scores and their trend lines by treatment and control groups. Therefore, the assumptions required for ANCOVA seemed to be reasonably well met. The test indicated that the null hypothesis of no statistically significant difference among the traditional, electronic, and both traditional and electronic classes' scores could not be rejected at the 0.05 level, with an effect size of f=0, a negligible effect according to J. Cohen. It is concluded that offering the course through electronic mail or a combination of electronic mail and the traditional approach did not appear to hinder the performance of the students, to the extent measured by the multiple-choice tests.

It states that the reviews found that state content standards vary greatly in how they are organized, in the levels of detail and specificity of their content prescriptions, and in the clarity of their expression. According to the report, although a number of the states' standards were found to be of exemplary quality and could be used as models, an &quot;unacceptably large number&quot; of state content standards were judged to be of inadequate quality. The report cites the average ratings on the 0 to 4 scale given by each rating group for  English language arts and for mathematics. It finds considerable discrepancy in the reviewers' ranking of the states: there was considerable disagreement among the reviewers about which states had high quality and which states had low quality content standards. The report states that the reviewers used different criteria, defining the qualities they used for evaluation and applying their evaluation criteria differently. The report concludes by discussing ways research and policy initiatives could improve the quality of state content standards. (Contains 18 references, 11 notes, and 3 tables of data.) (NKA)",

Research examined the extent to which third-grade students, following instruction and experience with oral retellings, selected and used this strategy in solving word problems when they were not required to do so. The nature of third graders' oral retellings of mathematics word problems was also explored. Researchers designed a 15-lesson instructional sequence to help students learn to solve word problems, with instruction and guided practice in oral retellings embedded within the lessons. Prior to implementation of the sequence, 10 students were interviewed individually to assess their strategies for solving multiplication and division word problems. Following the interviews, the  lessons were taught intermittently over a 4-month period, based on the teacher's schedule, with a range of 0 to 2 lessons weekly. During lessons, students were videotaped, their work samples collected, and field notes were taken. After the lesson sequence, they were again interviewed. Preliminary analysis revealed that complete oral retellings of word problems appeared to be a challenge for this third-grade group to learn and use; retelling all the major elements of a word problem did not become a strategy of choice. Oral retellings were very basic at the beginning; with experience, students were able to relate more details, but only after extensive instruction and practice in storytelling. Students frequently used their own retelling methods, which researchers characterized as  rudimentary, or partial, oral retellings. Includes 15 word problems. (NKA)",

It examines how other measures of child wellbeing (the share of young children age 0-5 years who are read to infrequently and the share of older children age 6-11 years and teens who exhibit behavioral problems) vary by living arrangements. Finally, the brief discusses how and why the relationship between cohabitation and wellbeing is changing compared with overall trends using data from the 1997 and 1999 NSAFs. Children living with cohabitors are more likely to be poor, food  insecure, and read to infrequently and to exhibit behavioral problems than are children living with married couples. Between 1997-99, the wellbeing of children living with both their unmarried biological parents improved relative to children in general. This was not the case for children living with one parent and that parent's unmarried partner who was not the child's parent. The changing characteristics of cohabiting parents accounted for about one-third of the decline in poverty among children living with unmarried parents. (Contains 11 references and 10 notes.) (SM)",

Chang, 2001) for computerized adaptive testing (CAT), the item pool and item selection process has usually been divided into four strata and the corresponding four stages. In a series of simulation studies, researchers examined the optimum number of strata by systematically varying the number of strata, pool size (200, 400, and 800 items), item characteristics (0., 0.5 correlation between difficulty and discrimination), and item selection method (largest information, matching estimated ability with difficulty). Results show that quite independent of the item pool size and the correlation between item discrimination and difficulty,  ability estimation deteriorated while the number of over- and under-exposed items decreased with an increase in stratum number. There is a diminishing return in that dividing the pool into too many strata can also be problematic because when the stratum is too small, there are not any items of close difficulty for each particular examinee. The results are in general agreement with the speculation that too few and too many strata may not provide optimum efficiency and balanced item pool utilization. It is shown that the ideal and optimum number of strata to be used in each specific application depend on the item pool structure, test length, and other testing conditions.

        "description":"The increasing ability of social policy researchers to conduct randomized controlled trials (RCTs) at low cost could revolutionize the field of performance-based government. RCTs are widely judged to be the most credible method of evaluating whether a social program is effective, overcoming the demonstrated inability of other, more common methods to produce definitive evidence. In recent years, researchers have shown it is often possible to conduct high-quality RCTs at low cost, addressing a key obstacle to their widespread use. Costs are reduced by measuring study outcomes with administrative data already collected for other purposes (e.g., student test scores, criminal arrests, health care expenditures). These developments make it possible now, more than ever before, for policy officials to use scientific evidence about &quot;what works&quot; to increase government effectiveness. The purpose of this document is to illustrate the feasibility and value of low-cost RCTs for policy officials and researchers, by providing concrete examples from diverse program areas. This paper summarizes five well-conducted, low-cost RCTs, carried out in real-world community settings. Study costs range from $50,000 to $300,000, with random assignment itself comprising only a small portion of this cost (between $0 and $20,000). The studies all produced valid evidence that is of policy and practical importance. Individual sections contain footnotes.",

        "description":"The Canada Education Savings Program (CESP) has been an initiative of the Government of Canada since 1998. As part of the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, the program administers the Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG) and the Canada Learning Bond (CLB). These two initiatives help Canadian families save for a child's post-secondary education in Registered Education Savings Plans (RESPs). Although any person can be named by a subscriber of an RESP to receive money for education after high school, the &quot;Annual Statistical Review 2012&quot; only reports on those who have previously received the Government of Canada incentives to save in RESPs which are available to children 0 to 17 years of age. This report provides annual statistics on the CESP and RESPs in Canada for January 1 through December 31, 2012 as well as historical data that show trends since program inception. The primary source of data used to produce this report is the CESP's Reporting Database, which compiles CESG and CLB data supplied by RESP providers. CESG statistics were calculated based on the date on which transactions were made such as the date that a contribution or an Education Assistance Payment was made; whereas the CLB statistics were calculated based on a processing date, which is the date that the grant is paid.

The vote was 48 to 0, but 8 countries abstained from voting. The Declaration is a statement of principles approved a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations. It is not a treaty and therefore imposes no legal obligations. Indeed the ideals embodied in the Declaration are far in advance of actual practice in many parts of the world. The Declaration is a challenge to all mankind to promote world-wide respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The United States actively supported the approval of the Declaration of Human Rights in the General Assembly in Paris. An International Covenant on Human Rights has been developed in the United Nations. This is a draft treaty and deals with certain of the basic civil and political rights embodied in the Declaration. This Covenant will be submitted to individual countries for ratification and will become legally binding on the countries which ratify it. The Covenant has not yet been considered by the Senate of the United States. The purpose of this bulletin is to clarify the meaning of the Declaration so that it may be understood by high-school students. The Declaration contains many principles already accepted in this country. [Best copy available has been provided.]",

Students (n = 127) completed 6 cognitive assessments, a decimal labeling assessment, and 3 measures of decimal magnitude understanding (i.e., comparing decimals to the fraction benchmark task, estimating where decimals belong on a 0-1 number line, and identifying fraction and decimal equivalencies). Each of the domain-general cognitive abilities predicted students' decimal magnitude understanding. Using place value labels was positively correlated with students' decimal magnitude understanding, whereas using whole-number labels was negatively correlated with students' decimal magnitude understanding. Language comprehension, nonverbal reasoning, and concept formation were positively correlated with students' use of place value labels. By contrast, language comprehension and nonverbal reasoning were negatively correlated with students' use of whole number labels. Implications for the development of decimal magnitude understanding and design of effective instruction for at-risk students are discussed.

The synthesis is intended to provide guidance to early intervention personnel, both those providing services to families and children within the Part C system and those working within other service frameworks. The focus is on the parenting knowledge, skill sets and practices that have proven effectiveness and can serve as the content of parenting education delivered through these service models. The synthesis first reviews the evidence for family-centered approaches and practices. Next it examines the literature concerning parent-child interactions and parenting behavior including knowledge gleaned from existing meta-analyses and reviews of the pertinent empirical literature. This includes both content (parenting/caregiving behaviors that impact infant/toddler social emotional outcomes) and methods (practices effective in supporting and changing caregiver behavior). This is followed by a consideration of some of the relevant intervention materials, packages, curricula and models for families of infants and toddlers that are available. Finally, factors to consider in selecting family-focused interventions are discussed.",

        "description":"This work aims to evaluate the relationship between early numerical competence in kindergarteners and their numerical representations as measured by the number line task (NLT). Thirty-four 5-year-old children participated in the study. Children's early performance on symbolic and non-symbolic numerical tasks was considered to determine which was a better predictor of NLT performance. Children completed an early number competence standardized test comprising symbolic semantic tasks (Arabic digit comparison and Arabic digit linear order), lexical tasks (numbers recognition and numbers reading), and non-symbolic semantic tasks (dots comparison and picture linear order), and the NLT 0-100. The relationship between early number competence (both symbolic and non-symbolic) and performance on the NLT was analyzed using a regression model in which the predictors were identified through a forward selection based on the use of the index BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion). Results show that symbolic number knowledge tasks (Arabic linear digits order and Arabic digits comparison) are the best predictors of performance on the NLT. This suggests that knowledge of the semantics of Arabic digits is more important than non-symbolic quantity knowledge in predicting number line task accuracy among young children. This finding brings additional evidence to the debate on the relationship between non-symbolic numeral knowledge and symbolic number processing.

A vigorous debate about the merits of preschool education is underway, although at times it has not included the most recent available evidence. The goal of this brief is to provide a non-partisan, thorough, and up-to-date review of the current science and evidence base on early childhood education (ECE). Our interdisciplinary group of early childhood experts reviewed rigorous evidence on why early skills matter, the short- and long-term effects of preschool programs on children's school readiness and life outcomes, the importance of program quality, which children benefit from preschool (including evidence on children from different family income backgrounds), and the costs versus benefits of preschool education. We focus on preschool (early childhood education) for four-year-olds, with some review of the evidence for three-year-olds when relevant. We do not discuss evidence regarding programs for 0-3 year olds.",

        "description":"Taking the premise that construction or meaning making largely depends on the existing knowledge and experience, this paper uses an analogy of learning the culinary art and learning to teach. This paper attempts to clarify the characteristics of signature pedagogy of teacher education focusing on the threshold concept of constructivism by using the analogy of culinary skills as the contextual/environmental element. It is assumed that the analogy helps the student teachers to comprehend the meaning of the abstract idea of constructivism because in the cultural context of Kerala most student teachers are clear about what it means to learn how to learn cooking. This paper fits into the theme of this conference as future teachers and teacher educators would learn how to relate something as abstract as constructivism with something intimately connected with life and cultural environment as learning to nourish oneself and the younger ones. While cooking facilitates nourishment of body, teaching facilitates learning and development of mind. Building upon the analogy between these two essential process of sustaining and developing human life and culture, this paper augments its arguments with the concepts of signature pedagogy and threshold concepts and elaborates on how these ideas would help to further clarify and improve the theory and practice of constructivism in teacher education.

Data derive from a state representative sample (n=27,087) of school-based adolescent students. ANCOVA analyses identified significant differences in sociodemographic and psychosocial functioning variables for youth with 0, 1, or 2 forms of housing and parental care instability, with more deleterious functioning being observed among youth with greater levels of instability. Those experiencing either or both housing and parental care instability are more represented by males, sexual minorities, and youth of color; psychosocial risk and protective factors demonstrated consistent differences between instability groups. Dimensions of cumulative adversity operate with social marginalities (e.g., race, sexual minority status) relative to instability, with higher frequency of victimization, lower grades, diminished self-regulation capabilities and school engagement, weakened psychological health, and strained family and peer relationships. The paper discusses theorized mechanisms through which cumulative adversity conveys effects as well as implications for social work prevention and resilience-fostering strategies in schools and other youth-serving settings.

        "description":"A randomized controlled trial investigated the research question: Do students who participate in online tutoring and a related mathematical game learn more about fractions than students who only have access to the game? Participants were 144 students from four schools, all serving low-income students with low prior mathematics achievement. In the Treatment condition, students received 20- to 25-minute tutoring sessions twice per week for an average of 18 sessions and also played the game. In the Control condition, students had access to the game, but did not play it often. Control students did not receive tutoring. Students were randomly assigned to a condition after being matched on pretest scores. The same diagnostic assessment was used as a pretest and as a posttest. The planned analysis looked for differences in gain scores (posttest minus pretest scores) between conditions. We conducted a t-test on the aggregate gain scores, comparing conditions; the results were statistically significant (t = 4.0545, df = 132.66, p-value &lt; 0.001). To determine an effect size, we treated each site as a study in a meta-analysis. Using gain scores, the effect size was g = +0.66. A more sophisticated treatment of the pooled standard deviation resulted in a corrected effect size of g =0 .46 with a 95% confidence interval of [+0.23, +0.70].[Co-written with MenloEDU under a subcontract from Cignition.

        "description":"Teacher turnover has adverse consequences for student achievement and imposes large financial costs for schools. Some have argued that high-stakes testing may lower teachers' satisfaction with their jobs and could be a major contributor to teacher attrition. In this paper, we exploit changes in the tested grades and subjects in Georgia to study the effects of eliminating high-stakes testing on teacher turnover and the distribution of teachers across grades and schools. To measure the effect of testing pressures on teacher mobility choices we use a &quot;difference-in-differences&quot; approach, comparing changes in mobility over time in grades/subjects that discontinue testing vis-à-vis grades/subjects that are always tested. Our results show that eliminating testing did not have an impact on the likelihood of leaving teaching, changing schools within a district, or moving between districts. We only uncover small negative effects on the likelihood of grade switching. However, we do find relevant positive effects on retention of beginning teachers in the profession. In particular, the average probability of exit for teachers with 0-4 years of experience fell from 14 to 13 percentage points for teachers in grades 1 and 2 and from 14 to 11 percentage points in grades 6 and 7.",

        "description":"The &quot;Assessment of Culturally and Contextually Relevant Supports&quot; (ACCReS) was developed in response to the need for well-constructed instruments to measure teachers' cultural responsiveness and guide decision-making related to professional development needs. The current study sought to evaluate the presence of differential item functioning (DIF) in ACCReS items and the magnitude of DIF, if detected. With a national sample of 999 grade K-12 teachers in the U.S., we examined measurement invariance of ACCReS items in relation to responses from (a) racially and ethnically minoritized (REM) and White teachers (teacher race), (b) teachers in schools with 0-50% and 51-100% REM youth (student race), and (c) teachers with &lt;1-5 years of teaching experience and teachers with &gt;5 years of experience. Findings suggested that ACCReS items exhibited negligible levels of DIF. The lack of DIF found provides additional evidence for the validity of scores from the ACCReS to assess teachers' cultural responsiveness. Furthermore, descriptive analyses revealed that teachers were more likely to agree with items pertaining to their own classroom practice than items related to access to adequate training and support. Results inform implications for future educational and measurement research. [This paper was published in &quot;Journal of Psychological Assessment&quot; 2021 (EJ1312232).]",

Unfortunately, young people, especially girls, are often not drawn to Computer Science. To address this issue, we conducted an analysis of emotions among 8-9-year-old and 12-13-year-old students engaged in Computational Thinking activities, considering educational level, gender, and type of intervention. Our study sought to understand the lack of interest by examining the emotions present in primary and secondary school students. Hour-long in-person classes were conducted, focusing on Computational Thinking activities. We used the Developmental Channels Questionnaire, which includes 13 emotions rated on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, to measure emotions. The results showed that the predominant emotions were mostly positive and ambiguous, with low intensity negative emotions, particularly in primary education. Gender differences were observed only in secondary education, while in primary education, the differences were not significant. Girls demonstrated an emotional evolution when engaging in these activities, unlike boys. These findings provide valuable quantitative insights for primary and secondary school teachers. Understanding the emotions experienced can help guide effective teaching approaches. By addressing emotional factors, educators can enhance students' interest in computer science, thus fostering a more inclusive and engaging learning environment.",

It is important that students have a correct perception of body weight status as extra weight has potential adverse health effects. This study assessed accuracy of perceived weight status versus medical classification among 102 college students. Perceived weight status was determined by responses to these questions, as part of a health questionnaire, \"Are you overweight?\" and \"Which of the following best describes you?\" (obese, overweight, normal weight, under weight). Medical classification was indicated from body mass index (using researcher-recorded weight and height) based on World Health Organization standards. Seventy eight percent of participants (n = 80) correctly assessed their weight status with significantly more females (79%, n = 45 of 57) than males (53%, n = 24 of 45) correctly assessing their status (p less than 0.01). All participants who misclassified their weight (n = 33) under classified their status as compared to the medical classification. Participants who correctly classified their status were, on average, 0-10 pounds overweight whereas those who misclassified were 11-20 pounds overweight. Among college students, nutrition education strategies should focus on students correctly identifying their weight status and health implications associated with an overweight/obese condition.

Twenty-three groups of 28 interpreter trainees at a University in Iran (six different branches) took part in the study, all groups receiving the same amount of instruction (9 hours over 3 weeks). Three control groups listened to/viewed authentic audio recordings and movies in English, discussed their contents, and completed a variety of speaking tasks but received no specific prosody instruction. Twenty experimental groups spent part of the instruction time on theoretical explanation of, and practical exercises with, English prosody by thirteen nonnative instructors, and seven native instructors. Three experts evaluated the comprehensibility of the trainees in elicited speech samples collected during the pretest, immediate posttest and delayed posttest, and subsequently presented in random order. The findings revealed that the experimental groups gained between 1 and 2 points on the 0 to 10 comprehensibility scale, and lost little in the delayed posttest; however, hardly any changes were observed in the control groups. We conclude that native and non-native English instructors' prosody teaching were equally effective in enhancing EFL students' speech comprehensibility.",

Gaps in services further hinder their development. The study concluded that there is a need for multidisciplinary teams to implement an early childhood home-visiting programme, and that such a programme would hold many potential benefits for the young and vulnerable children. Aim: This article presents a set of guidelines that can be used to support good outcomes for an early childhood home-visiting programme for vulnerable children aged 0-2 years. Setting: The study is set in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Methods: The guidelines were developed over three phases of the study, which used an intervention research design. Results: The guidelines emerged as a number of practice principles and include: engagement and advocacy; the recruitment of a multidisciplinary workforce; training of the home-visiting workforce; implementation of the programme; and monitoring and evaluation of the programme. Conclusion: The article suggests that the guidelines hold promise for both supporting the well-being of vulnerable children and shaping a programme that is preventative, focussed on early intervention, and both multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary in nature. Contribution: The guidelines are intended as a support to those working in the fields of both early childhood and vulnerable children, and can be used alongside the existing services.",

        "description":"The concepts of \"explicit\" and \"implicit\" (knowledge) are at the core of SLA studies. We take \"explicit\" as conscious and declarative (knowledge); \"implicit\" as unconscious, automatic and procedural (knowledge) (DeKeyser, 2003; R. Ellis, 2005a, 2005b, 2009; Hulstjin, 2005; Robinson, 1996; Schmidt, 1990, 1994). The importance of those concepts and components, we believe, must also be acknowledged in language teaching, and consequently in language teaching materials. However, explicitness and implicitness are rather complex constructs; such complexity allows for multiple nuances and perspectives in their analysis, and this fact poses a real challenge for their identification in the learning and teaching process and materials. We focus here on ELT materials and aim at the building of a reliable construct which may help in the identification of their potential for promoting implicit and explicit components. We first determined the features to identify the construct for implicitness and explicitness; next, we validated it and then we applied it to the analysis of the activities included in three sample units of three textbooks. The results were computed along a continuum ranging from 0 to 10 in each activity. The systematization and computation of results will hopefully offer a reliable figure regarding the identification of the degree of explicitness and/or implicitness in the materials analysed.

Time trends were examined over 3-periods: 1980-1989 (Period I), 1990-1999 (Period II) and 2000-2005 (Period III). Results: Most of the individuals presenting to CAP clinic were boys (62.2%-63.5%), aged between 10 to 15 years (44.2%-63.4%). The common diagnoses were mental retardation (18.4%-33.2%), neurotic and stress related disorders (16.4%-18.5%), epilepsy and organic brain disorder (7.1%-15.1 %) and hyperkinetic and conduct disorders (8.3%-17.9%). There was a trend towards decrease in number of cases in younger age group (0-5 years) and those with diagnosis of mental retardation, epilepsy and organic brain disorder. There was a trend towards increase in number of cases in the older age group (10-15 years) and those with diagnosis of psychotic disorders, affective disorders, disorders of psychological development, and hyperkinetic and conduct disorders.

As part of a larger design-based research study, in which a professional development (PD) program was designed to investigate five in-service teachers' conceptualization of different forms of complex numbers, we conducted pre and post written problem-solving sessions together with post PD interviews. Results showed that after PD all the participants defined &quot;i&quot; as one of the roots of the quadratic equation, x[superscript 2] + 1 = 0. They also could show geometrically as a point (0,1) on the complex plane. Although all the participants mentioned operator meaning of &quot;i&quot; as a 90-degree rotation when multiplied with b; only one of them mentioned the dilation meaning of b when multiplied with &quot;i&quot;. Results suggested considering the pure imaginary part of the Cartesian form focusing on both the operator meanings of b and &quot;i&quot; is important for understanding the nature of complex numbers and the complex plane for teacher education and teacher content knowledge.

        "description":"Research on syllable weight in generative phonology has focused almost exclusively on systems in which weight is treated as an ordinal hierarchy of clearly delineated categories (e.g. light and heavy). As I discuss, canonical weight-sensitive phenomena in phonology, including quantitative meter and quantity-sensitive stress, can also treat weight as a gradient interval scale in which (1) differences between syllable types are matters of relative degree rather than strict domination, and (2) there is no clear segregation of syllable types into categories, but rather a continuous distribution of types along a continuum of weight. In a meter sensitive to gradient weight, progressively heavier syllables are progressively more skewed towards metrically strong positions, all else being equal. Gradient weight is likewise evident in a stress system when syllables vary along a continuum in their propensities to attract stress, again controlling for distributional confounds unrelated to weight. The dissertation consists of four parts. Part I comprises corpus studies of six quantitative meters, namely, Kamban&apos;s Tamil epic meter, the Homeric Greek hexameter, the Latin hexameter, the Finnish Kalevala meter, the Epic Sanskrit &quot;sloka,&quot; and the Old Norse &quot;dróttkvaett.&quot; All six are widely held to treat syllable weight as exclusively binary. I demonstrate that, in addition to distinguishing light and heavy syllables, the poets in all six traditions exhibit sensitivity to a continuum of weight within the heavies, to the extent that I am able to derive some of the most detailed scales of syllable weight yet documented for individual languages (e.g. at least nine levels in the first case study). Moreover, across the six languages, the weight scales are strongly correlated, both with each other and with the crosslinguistic typology of weight-sensitive phenomena, supporting and shedding new light on the universal phonology of syllable weight. Part II first addresses the universal principles of weight, e.g. complexity and sonority, that motivate the features of the scales in part I. Particular emphasis is given to Tamil, including its violation of the sonority principle: C[subscript 0] V CR (R = rhotic) is lighter than all other C[subscript 0] V CR[subscript ?R] despite the rhotics being highly sonorous. Prosodic minimality in Tamil also diagnoses C[subscript 0] V CR as being lighter than C[subscript 0] V CR[subscript ?R]. I argue that this discrepancy is motivated by the short durations of rhotics relative to other codas in Tamil. More generally, judging from a phonetic corpus of Tamil, duration of the rime (or energy integrated over duration) correlates tightly with the weight continuum inferred from meter. Building on these empirical findings, a generative analysis of gradient weight mapping is proposed in a maximum entropy constraint framework. In it, categorical and gradient constraints (the latter being violated to real-valued degrees supplied by the phonetics; Flemming 2001) interact to generate the weight mapping typology. This typology includes fully categorical systems, fully gradient systems (directly reflecting the phonetics), and systems exhibiting various degrees of incomplete categorization, in which the phonology is polarized towards categories but remains sensitive to the gradient phonetic interface of weight within categories. Part III treats the contributions of onsets to syllable weight. While onset structure is irrelevant to weight categorization in all the languages examined, it contributes consistently to weight as a statistical effect, in that more complexity is associated with greater weight (e.g. in Old Norse, onset Ø &lt; C &lt; CC &lt; CCC[subscript 1]). Even in Tamil, in which complex onsets are illicit, mean duration of the onset correlates significantly with metrical weight. Finally, part IV considers gradient weight in stress assignment in English. The distribution of stress in extant disyllables follows the same (universal) principles established for meter: First, the complexity of the coda correlates monotonically with stress propensity, such that Ø &lt; C &lt; CC (&lt;) CCC[subscript 1] (as seen in both nouns and verbs). Vowel length is also important, such that, taking the rime as a whole, the hierarchy V &lt; V C &lt; VV &lt; VVC is observed for both nouns and verbs. As in meter, onset complexity also contributes significantly to stress propensity, as observed independently in nouns and verbs as well as in initial and final position in disyllables. Experimental evidence is presented supporting the productivity of the universal V &lt; V C &lt; VV &lt; VVC hierarchy in English stress, as well as the onset effect.

        "description":"&quot;Turning around&quot; chronically low-performing schools is of increasing interest to educators and policymakers, as highlighted by the U.S. Department of Education's (2010) recent call to rapidly improve the nation's 5,000 lowest performing schools. Yet there is little rigorous research on changes in student populations and teacher workforce in schools undergoing interventions to improve low-performing schools. To fill this gap, this study examines turnaround intervention models intended to rapidly improve student performance in chronically low-performing schools in the Chicago Public Schools district. It analyzes the changes in student populations and teacher workforce in 31 public schools in Chicago selected for district-led reform interventions for chronically low-performing schools over 1997-2010. Two research questions guided the study: (1) Did the characteristics of students change in the intervention schools?; and (2) Did the characteristics of teachers change in the intervention schools? For the first research question, descriptive analyses compared students in the school the fall before the intervention with students in the same grades in the fall after the intervention began. For the second, descriptive analyses compared the teacher workforce in these schools for the same periods. These descriptive analyses show school-by-school changes in students and teachers organized around the intervention models. The analyses are based on the entire population of students and teachers at each school and are not statistical estimates. Comparing student enrollment the fall before the intervention and the fall after the intervention shows that: (1) Twenty-three of 31 schools served fewer students by grade after the intervention, with five schools serving at least a quarter fewer students. Four of the schools with the largest declines in enrollment were part of the closure and restart model; (2) Except for schools in the closure and restart model, schools reenrolled 55-89 percent of students eligible to reenroll. The rates were similar to reenrollment rates in the years before intervention; (3) Schools in the closure and restart model reenrolled 0-47 percent of students eligible to reenroll. Schools in this model were closed for one or two years before opening again, did not serve all the same grade levels when they reopened, and held citywide enrollment lotteries, which made it difficult for students to reenroll; and (4) The composition of the student body--in race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and special education status--in intervention schools was largely similar before and after the interventions in all models except for the closure and restart model. In that model, schools after intervention served a larger percentage of economically advantaged students and of students with higher prior achievement levels, and smaller percentages of special education students and of students residing in the neighborhood near the school. Comparing the teacher workforce the year before the intervention and the year after the intervention shows that: (1) The extent of teacher rehiring varied with the intervention model. Schools in the reconstitution model rehired 42-66 percent of teachers, and schools in the STSP model retained 44-80 percent. Schools in the closure and restart, AUSL, and OSI models rehired just 0-24 percent of teachers; and (2) In all intervention models, the teacher workforce was more likely to be White, younger, and less experienced and more likely to have provisional certification after intervention than before it.

        "description":"Context: Each country has a unique history in the development of its athletic training professionals and education and credentialing systems. In Japan, the majority of athletic trainers hold a domestic credential (JSPO-AT) obtained from the Japan Sport Association (JSPO) or a US-based credential from the Board of Certification (BOC-AT). Objective: To determine whether differences in demographic, professional, and educational characteristics exist between Japanese BOC-ATs and JSPO-ATs who currently practice athletic training services in Japan. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Online survey. Patients or Other Participants: Eight hundred twenty-nine Japanese athletic trainers in Japan (BOC-AT, n=64; JSPO-AT, n=765). (s): Pearson's Xsuperscript 2]test and Fisher's exact test were used to determine differences in demographic, professional, and educational characteristics between BOC-ATs and JSPO-ATs. Results: The proportion of female respondents was greater for BOC-ATs (29.7%) than for JSPO-ATs (18.7%; X[superscript 2] [1]=4.5, P=0.03). A greater proportion of BOC-ATs reported having master's degrees or higher (X[superscript 2] [3]=81.6, P[less than]0.01). The percentage of respondents with at least 1 therapist or medical practitioner license in Japan was greater for JSPO-ATs (73.1%) than for BOC-ATs (20.3%; P[less than] 0.01). The percentage of respondents with at least 1 credential in exercise, nutrition, or teaching was greater for BOC-ATs (62.5%) than for JSPO-ATs (45.2%; P[less than]0.01). A large difference was observed in the proportion of individuals who identified as therapists (JSPO-ATs= 29.8%, BOC-ATs=6.3%; X[superscript 2] [5]= 18.9, P[less than] 0.01). The median income for BOC-ATs was 401-600 million yen (US $36,500-$54,500), whereas the median income for JSPO-ATs was 0-200 million yen (US$0-$18,200). Conclusions: BOC-ATs in Japan were more established than JSPO-ATs as athletic training professionals with higher educational backgrounds, while more JSPO-ATs tended to be therapists. Findings from the current study may serve as benchmark data for the athletic training profession and service characteristics in Japan.",

        "description":"Purpose: This study aims to focus on providing a computerized classification testing (CCT) system that can easily be embedded as a self-assessment feature into the existing legacy environment of a higher education institution, empowering students with self-assessments to monitor their learning progress and following strict data protection regulations. The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of two different versions (without dashboard vs with dashboard) of the CCT system during the course of a semester; to examine changes in the intended use and perceived usefulness of two different versions (without dashboard vs with dashboard) of the CCT system; and to compare the self-reported confidence levels of two different versions (without dashboard vs with dashboard) of the CCT system. Design/methodology/approach: A total of N = 194 students from a higher education institution in the area of economic and business education participated in the study. The participants were provided access to the CCT system as an opportunity to self-assess their domain knowledge in five areas throughout the semester. An algorithm was implemented to classify learners into master and nonmaster. A total of nine metrics were implemented for classifying the performance of learners. Instruments for collecting co-variates included the study interest questionnaire (Cronbach's a = 0. 90), the achievement motivation inventory (Cronbach's a = 0. 94), measures focusing on perceived usefulness and demographic data. Findings: The findings indicate that the students used the CCT system intensively throughout the semester. Students in a cohort with a dashboard available interacted more with the CCT system than students in a cohort without a dashboard. Further, findings showed that students with a dashboard available reported significantly higher confidence levels in the CCT system than participants without a dashboard. Originality/value: The design of digitally supported learning environments requires valid formative (self-)assessment data to better support the current needs of the learner. While the findings of the current study are limited concerning one study cohort and a limited number of self-assessment areas, the CCT system is being further developed for seamless integration of self-assessment and related feedback to further reveal unforeseen opportunities for future student cohorts.",

        "description":"Purpose: Persons with unilateral brain damage in the right hemisphere (RH) or left hemisphere (LH) show limitations in processing linguistic prosody, with yet inconclusive results on their ability to process prosodically marked structural boundaries for syntactic ambiguity resolution. We aimed at systematically investigating production and comprehension of three prosodic cues (f[subscript 0] range, final lengthening, and pause) at structural boundaries in coordinate sequences in participants with right hemisphere brain damage (RHDP) and participants with left hemisphere brain damage (LHDP). Method: Twenty RHDP and 15 LHDP participated in our study. Comprehension experiment: Participants and a control group listened to coordinate name sequences with internal grouping by a prosodically marked structural boundary (grouped condition, e.g., &quot;(Gabi und Leni) # und Nina&quot;) or without internal grouping (ungrouped condition, e.g., &quot;Gabi und Leni und Nina&quot;) and had to identify the target condition. The strength and combinations of prosodic cues in the stimuli were manipulated. Production experiment: Participants were asked to produce coordinate sequences in the two conditions (grouped, ungrouped) in two different tasks: a Reading Aloud and a Repetition experiment. Accuracy of participants' productions was subsequently assessed in a rating study and productions were analyzed with respect to use of prosodic cues. Results: In the Comprehension experiment, RHDP and LHDP had overall lower identification accuracies than unimpaired control participants and LHDP were found to have particular problems with boundary identification when the pause cue was reduced. In production, LHDP and RHDP employed all three prosodic cues for boundary marking, but struggled to clearly mark prosodic boundaries in 28% of all productions. Both groups showed better performance in reading aloud than in repetition. LHDP relied more on using f[subscript 0] range and pause duration to prosodically mark structural boundaries, whereas RHDP employed final lengthening more vigorously than LHDP in reading aloud. Conclusions: We conclude that processing of linguistic prosody is affected in RHDP and LHDP, but not completely impaired. Therefore, prosody can serve as a relevant communicative resource. However, it should also be considered as a target area for assessment and treatment in both groups.",

        "description":"The focus of the study was to identify secondary school students' difficulties with aspects of linearity and linear functions, and to assess their teachers' understanding of the nature of the difficulties experienced by their students. A cross-sectional study with 1561 Grades 8-10 students enrolled in mathematics courses from Pre-Algebra to Algebra II, and their 26 mathematics teachers was employed. All participants completed the Mini-Diagnostic Test (MDT) on aspects of linearity and linear functions, ranked the MDT problems by perceived difficulty, and commented on the nature of the difficulties. Interviews were conducted with 40 students and 20 teachers. A cluster analysis revealed the existence of two groups of students, Group 0 enrolled in courses below or at their grade level, and Group 1 enrolled in courses above their grade level. A factor analysis confirmed the importance of slope and the Cartesian connection for student understanding of linearity and linear functions. There was little variation in student performance on the MDT across grades. Student performance on the MDT increased with more advanced courses, mainly due to Group 1 student performance. The most difficult problems were those requiring identification of slope from the graph of a line. That difficulty persisted across grades, mathematics courses, and performance groups (Group 0, and 1). A comparison of student ranking of MDT problems by difficulty and their performance on the MDT, showed that students correctly identified the problems with the highest MDT mean scores as being least difficult for them. Only Group 1 students could identify some of the problems with lower MDT mean scores as being difficult. Teachers did not identify MDT problems that posed the greatest difficulty for their students. Student interviews confirmed difficulties with slope and the Cartesian connection. Teachers' descriptions of problem difficulty identified factors such as lack of familiarity with problem content or context, problem format and length. Teachers did not identify student difficulties with slope in a geometric context.    [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

When p = 2, for all full-rank R[subscript xx] is not equal to I, R[subscript xx] = E[xx[prime]] = V[image omitted]V[prime] (where V[image omitted]V[prime] denotes the eigen decomposition of R[subscript xx]; [lambda][superscript 1] greater than [lambda][superscript 2]), the set B[subscript 1] := {b[subscript i] : R[superscript 2] = b[prime][subscript i]r[subscript i] = r[prime][subscript i]r[subscript i]; 0 less than R[superscript 2] less than or equal to 1} contains four vectors; the set B[subscript 2] := {b[subscript i] : R[superscript 2] = b[prime][subscript i]r[subscript i] greater than r[prime][subscript i]r[subscript i]; 0 less than R[superscript 2] less than or equal to 1; R[superscript 2][lambda][subscript p] less than or equal to r[prime][subscript i]r[subscript i] less than R[superscript 2]} contains an infinite number of vectors. When p greater than or equal to 3 (and [lambda][subscript 1] greater than [lambda][subscript 2] greater than [image omitted] greater than [lambda][subscript p]), both sets contain an uncountably infinite number of vectors. Geometrical arguments demonstrate that B[subscript 1] occurs at the intersection of two hyper-ellipsoids in [set of real numbers][superscript P]. Equations are provided for populating the sets B[subscript 1] and B[subscript 2] and for demonstrating that maximum enhancement occurs when b is collinear with the eigenvector that is associated with [lambda][subscript p] (the smallest eigenvalue of the predictor correlation matrix). These equations are used to illustrate the logic and the underlying geometry of enhancement in population, multiple-regression models. R code for simulating population regression models that exhibit enhancement of any degree and any number of predictors is included in Appendices A and B. (Contains 2 figures.",

        "description":"We performed theoretical studies on the systems NH[subscript 3] times HF times mH[subscript 2]O, NH[subscript 3] times HCl times mH[subscript 2]O, with m = 0, 1, 2, and 6. The molecules with m = 0 form hydrogen-bonded adducts with little tendency to form an ion-pair structure. The molecule NH[subscript 3] times HCl times H[subscript 2]O cannot be characterized as either a hydrogen-bond adduct or an ion-pair structure as it has a flat potential energy surface for motion of the hydrogen atom N . . . H . . . Cl. The molecule NH[subscript 3] times HCl times 2H[subscript 2]O clearly behaves as an ion-pair NH[subscript 4]Cl times 2H[subscript 2]O. There are sixteen arrangements of the cubic array NH[subscript 3] times HCl times 6H[subscript 2]O and all sixteen exhibit the ion-pair NH[subscript 4]Cl times 6H[subscript 2]O. The molecule NH[subscript 3] times HF times H[subscript 2]O does not form the ion-pair NH[subscript 4]F times H[subscript 2]O, nor does a second added water molecule facilitate ionization. However, of the sixteen arrangements of NH[subscript 3] times F times 6H[subscript 2]O, twelve are categorized as greater than 80% ion-pair character NH[subscript 4]F times 6H[subscript 2]O, two are about 60% ion pair, and two are about 30% ion pair. We also have completed similar studies on the dimers and tetramers (NH[subscript 3] times HF)[subscript n] and (NH[subscript 3] times HCl)[subscript n], where n = 2 or 4. Dimers (NH[subscript 3] times HCl)[subscript 2] and tetramers (NH[subscript 3] times HCl)[subscript 4] form ions (NH[subscript 4]Cl)[subscript 2] and (NH[subscript 4]Cl)[subscript 4], as do tetramers of (NH[subscript 3] times HF)[subscript 4], which are therefore actually (NH[subscript 4]F)[subscript 4]. But the dimer (NH[subscript 3] times HF)[subscript 2] remains as neutral molecule adduct. These results illustrate hydrogen-bond cooperativity in determining the outcome of a chemical reaction.

        "description":"The objective of this study is to assess whether children's needs are taken into consideration in female patients who are admitted to an adult psychiatric hospital. A retrospective case note audit of 100 female inpatients aged between 18 and 55 years over a 6-month period were randomly selected. The medical and nursing case notes of patients with children aged between 0 and 17 were assessed using a proforma. The information collected on mothers consisted of diagnosis of illness, type of admission (whether voluntary or detained), duration of admission, previous psychiatric admissions, patient age, marital status, whether or not employed, relationship with partner, mental health of partner, history of violence, medical history of relevance, family history of mental illness, and whether other agencies were involved. Children data collected consisted of number of children per patient and their ages, an enquiry into the child's welfare, emotional and behavioural development, educational/cognitive development, physical health and development, relationship with family and peers, children's knowledge of parent's illness, alternative care arrangements for child during mother's admission and their relationship to carer, child's involvement in their parents' illness as a carer and actions taken on behalf of the child. Of the 100 patients, 62 had children aged between 0 and 17 years. There was an enquiry into children's welfare in 15 (24%) cases and an enquiry into children's knowledge of their parents' illness in three (4.8%). Actions were taken on behalf of children in 13 (21%) cases, in five cases this was not necessary as children resided elsewhere, and in one case a social work assessment was requested but no subsequent documentation of this being completed. There was no documentation of actions taken in the remaining 43 (69.4%) cases. The results of this retrospective case note audit suggest that children's welfare is not routinely enquired about in female patients admitted to psychiatric hospitals. Actions taken on behalf of children occurred often when there was social services involvement. As a result of this study guidance was issued to all new junior psychiatric staff as part of their induction process to make enquiries about children and their welfare.",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to gain insight into the views of Kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) teachers regarding the responsibility they have for cultivating the self-efficacy of K-12 students. The study encompassed the four primary sources of self-efficacy beliefs: mastery experiences, vicarious experiences, verbal persuasion, and emotional and physiological state, as theorized by Canadian-American psychologist Albert Bandura (Alexander, 2019). Specifically, the study examined K-12 teachers' perceptions of their responsibility in cultivating self-efficacy in K-12 school students. The target population was K through 12th grade teachers in the Orange County School District The primary data collection source was based on a cross-sectional survey research design. One hundred and nineteen teachers participated in this research study (33.6% with 0-9 years, 33.6% with 10-20 years, and 32.8% with 21 or more years of teaching experience).This quantitative study provided an understanding of teachers' beliefs in the benefits of student self-efficacy. In addition, the study determined if teaching experience impacts teachers' beliefs in the benefits of student self-efficacy training. This research adds to the current body of research pertaining to Social Emotional Learning, specifically in the area of learner self-efficacy. This research provides administrators, both district and local, with feedback on the benefits of learner self-efficacy and how to best meet their teachers' needs as they promote and develop learner self-efficacy. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine whether there were any statistically significant differences among groups based on years of teaching experience (0-9 years, 10-20 years, and 21 years or more). A Shapiro-Wilks test of normality was conducted and indicated that responses in all three groups were significant, which means they are all significantly different from normal, or not normally distributed. This study utilized a quantitative method and employed a descriptive and inferential design. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

Data reveal that 70 percent of Galicia's population lives in rural areas, the economy remains primarily agricultural, Galicians earn less than the national average and have the largest number of public assistance recipients, and there is a 40 percent failure rate in the schools (higher in rural areas). The program aims to prepare parents to create a conducive educational environment in the home and to choose activities that support their children's development in all areas. The families of 2,658 children aged 0-6 are currently involved in the program, which has 22 counselor teachers, 4 volunteers, 19 aides, and 6 municipal councils. Meetings are held with parents and  children every 2 weeks and include presentations of children's home learning activities, instructions for parents on home learning activities, planning for future activities and learning themes, and discussion of child rearing issues. Other program activities include a parent newsletter, radio programs for parents and children, a weekly half-hour television program for parents, resource materials concerning child rearing, and the publication of booklets for parents on various subjects. Program evaluation reveals that meetings have enhanced the self-esteem of parents, improved the quality of family life for participants, led to better use of local resources, and resulted in parents' active participation in their children's education. Additionally, children displayed improved communication  skills, increased self-esteem, and independence. (LP)",

        "description":"The acculturation of developmental timetables for autonomy from parental supervision and in social relationships was studied in a sample of 220 ethnic German immigrants to Germany from Romania, Poland, and countries of the former Soviet Union. The acculturation rate was predicted to be related to prior differences in parent-adolescent interaction and the frequency of adolescents' activities outside the home. Across four waves of semiannual questionnaire or interview assessments for newcomers (0-18 months residence in Germany) and experienced immigrants (18-36 months), a gradual acculturation of timetables was observed, resulting in considerably earlier ages at which autonomy was attained. Higher levels of conflict and permissiveness reported by parents and lower levels of  monitoring and more frequent out-of-home activities corresponded to a more accelerated acculturation to earlier timetables for autonomy from parental supervision. With regard to autonomy in social relationships, the results were less clear, presumably because prior interpersonal experiences were less strongly associated with this facet of autonomy. Prediction of autonomy was not possible with adolescents who had resided in Germany longer than 18 months, presumably because higher levels of the family variables promoted &quot;escape&quot; from the constraints of the newcomers' provisional homes and thus provided opportunities to make contacts and adopt the lifestyle of adolescents from the general German population. For the group of immigrants who had resided in Germany for at least 18 months, such  escapes no longer served this purpose because they had access to other opportunities not measured in this study.

        "author":["Fouladi, Rachel T."],
        "description":"Covariance structure analytic techniques have become increasingly popular in recent years. During this period, users of statistical software packages have become more and more sophisticated, and more and more researchers are wanting to make sure that they are using the &quot;best&quot; statistic, whether it be for small sample considerations or for issues of nonnormality. At present, none of the confirmatory structure analytic programs include small sample modifications such as the k-factor Bartlett multiplier (1950) or the Swain multiplier (A, Swain, 1975). They do however include modifications to address distributional nonnormality. EQS offers the Satorra-Bentler scaled statistics (A. Satorra and P. Bentler, 1988, 1989); it does not yet offer the Satorra-Bentler adjusted statistic. AMOS,  on the other had, offers a bootstrap alternative, however, it does not yet offer either of the Satorra-Bentler modified statistics. This Monte Carlo study addresses whether resampling-based procedures provide improved Type I error control over the modified test statistics such as the k-factor Bartlett modified, Swain modified, Satorra-Bentler scaled, and Satorra-Bentler adjusted test statistics. The study provides evidence on the relative performance of the Beran-Strivastave bootstrap procedure and demonstrates that this procedure does not provide as good control of Type I error under conditions of extremely mild distributional nonnormality as the 0-factor Bartlett or Swain modified maximum likelihood procedure. It does show improved Type I error control over the standard maximum  likelihood procedure. (Contains 7 tables, 6 figures, and 42 references.) (Author/SLD)",

        "title":"The State of Mathematics Achievement in Virgin Islands: The Trial State Assessment at Grade Eight.",
        "description":"In 1990, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) included a Trial State Assessment (TSA); for the first time in the NAEP's history, voluntary state-by-state assessments (37 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Virgin Islands) were made. The sample was designed to represent the 8th grade public school population in a state or territory. The 1990 TSA covered five mathematics content areas (numbers and operations; measurement; geometry; data analysis, statistics, and probability; and algebra and functions). In Virgin Islands, 1,326 students in 6 public schools were assessed. This report describes the mathematics proficiency of Virgin Islands eighth-graders, compares their overall performance to students in the nation (using data from the NAEP national  assessments), presents the average proficiency separately for the five content areas, and summarizes the performance of subpopulations (race/ethnicity, type of community, parents' educational level, and gender). To provide a context for the assessment data, participating students, their mathematics teachers, and principals completed questionnaires which focused on: instructional content (curriculum coverage, amount of homework); delivery of math instruction (availability of resources, type); use of calculators; educational background of teachers; and conditions facilitating math learning (e.g., hours of television watched, absenteeism). On the NAEP math scale, Virgin Islands students had an average proficiency of 218 compared to 261 nationwide. Many fewer students (Virgin Islands-0%;  U.S.-12%) appear to have acquired reasoning and problem solving skills. (JJK/CRW)",

In Colorado, 2,897 fourth-grade students in 122 public schools participated in the reading assessment. The sample of students was directly representative of 95% of the eligible student population in participating schools in Colorado. Data were summarized on the NAEP reading proficiency scale ranging from 0 to 500, and results were reported according to three achievement levels at each grade--basic, proficient, and advanced. Major findings were that: (1) the overall average proficiency of the  students was 218, about the same as that of students across the nation (216); (2) the lowest performing 10% of the fourth graders had proficiency levels below 175 while the top 10% of the fourth graders had proficiency levels above 257; (3) 60% were at or above the basic level, 22% were at or above the proficient level, and 4% were at or above the advanced level; (4) White students demonstrated higher proficiency that did Black, Hispanic, or American Indian students, but about the same as did Asian students; (5) boys had a lower average reading proficiency than girls; and (6) 70% of the students were taught by teachers who placed heavy emphasis on the integration of reading and writing.

        "description":"A series of three experiments was conducted for the purposes of (1) clarifying problems of previous research on the relationship between working memory capacity and performance on figural analogy tasks, and (2) exploring developmental issues concerning executive strategies, working memory capacity, and perceptual processing. Directly manipulating the amount of available memory capacity a subject has while solving figural analogy problems, the first experiment required 29 fifth-grade children in Ontario, Canada to solve nondegenerate and semidegenerate figural analogy problems while counting backwards aloud by ones from 10 to 0. The second experiment investigated the possibility that children with a low level of working memory capacity who are unable to solve a high-level problem  may lack necessary task-specific perceptual skills or cognitive operations. A random sample of 44 children selected from junior-kindergarten, kindergarten, and first-grade classes were presented with a series of nondegenerate figural analogy problems, broken down into prerequisite tasks. The third experiment tested the possibility that failure of subjects to solve such problems was due to lack of understanding of the nature of the conjunctive response concept underlying the bidimensional comparison strategy. A total of 24 first-grade children were administered pretest, treatment, and posttest sets of pictures of people and/or geometric figural analogy problems. Subjects were read names of features required for a correct conjunctive response. Treatment also consisted of a verbal  facilitation procedure. Results indicate that young children have difficulty applying analogical reasoning to figural problems because of insufficient working memory capacity after carrying out the encoding elements of the task and because of perceptual encoding errors.

A total of 268 randomly selected students at Aurora State College of Technology were involved in the study. Survey questionnaires were used to obtain data and information which were subjected to statistical tests. The students had a moderate knowledge level on biodiversity with a mean score of 6.65 out of 10 items (SD = 1.50). Their perspective on biodiversity was leaning toward its protection and conservation, with a mean score of 7.2 out of 10 items (SD = 1.29). Factors affecting the students' knowledge were gender (p =0 .003) and academic department (p = 0.003). Females and those associated with the Department of Forestry and Environmental Sciences and Department of Industrial technology were found to have more knowledge than the others. Males, on the other hand, were found to have more positive perspectives towards biodiversity. Knowledge and perspective had a weak correlation with r = 0.39. Students were not well-aware, but were in support of the Philippines' biodiversity-related laws, which could help shape their mindset and actions towards biodiversity conservation and protection. Thus, the college administration must revisit the curricula of all degree programs and ensure that students from each degree program are environmentally educated, emphasizing biodiversity conservation.",

        "description":"Background: Child development and life outcomes are partly linked to prenatal and maternal conditions such as mother's age at birth. Thus, the issue of teenage motherhood has attracted significant concern from researchers and policymakers because of its potential implications for children. The existing literature on effects of teenage motherhood on children is typically limited to weight at childbirth. Other studies are mainly descriptive in nature and do not account for selection bias associated with teenage mothers and their deprived environment resulting in their children also being brought up in similar environment. Aim: This article examined the effects of teenage motherhood on child outcomes, specifically on children's education, economic well-being, reported health status and body mass index (BMI). Setting: Children (0-14 years) of teenage mothers (less than 20 years at first birth) in National Income Dynamics Survey (NIDS) data constitute the subjects under investigation in this study. Methods: Using NIDS data, the study applied pooled regression, random effects model and propensity score matching (PSM) technique to examine the effect of teenage motherhood on child outcomes. Results: The study confirms that the PSM method is more robust to selection bias than pooled regression and random effect techniques. The findings from this study reveal that teenage motherhood significantly increases child grade repetition and economic dependency. However, teenage motherhood association with child health and BMI is found to be insignificant. Conclusions: Teenage motherhood has far-reaching effects on children outcomes, thus proactive, reactive and post-active policies and programmes focusing on minimising the effect of teenage motherhood and enhancing children's welfare are recommended.",

Despite numerous initiatives by key stakeholders to better performance of pupils little has been achieved. A descriptive survey research design and correlation design was adapted. Data collected from the respondents by use of questionnaires and interview guide from target population of 2052 and a sample size of 335. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 25 and results presented in tables and figures. Pearson moment correlation coefficient (r) were computed. The coefficient determination of R[subscript 2] is 0.456 this is an indicator that R[subscript 2] was the coefficient of determination of this model and it depicted that data collection explained 46%. The remaining 54% was explained by other factors. The overall F statistics 233.446 with p-0.00b&lt;0 0.05 implying there is statistically significant relationship between stakeholder capacity building and performance of literacy and numeracy educational programme. The research suggests that stakeholder capacity building is part of the Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation process, so it must be observed at all stages to ensure educational programme are implemented to the latter by bringing on board all the key stakeholders in education and particularly in literacy and numeracy skills aspects.",

        "description":"Purpose: In grading, one of the most common errors is made in combining two or more different test scores. This study aimed to investigate the agreement of grades calculated by weighting raw scores and standard scores. Research Methods: In this simulation study, data were simulated for midterm and final measurements. Nine conditions [3 (class level: poor, average, good) x 3 (standard deviation (SD) difference (0, 10, and 20 units)] were considered. The sample size for each measurement was taken as 60 and the replication number set to 100. The weight for midterm and final measurements was respectively taken as 40% and 60%. The students' norm-referenced grades were calculated in two ways: (1) based on T scores of weighted raw success scores (TWRSS); and (2) based on T scores of weighted standardized success scores (TWSSS). The agreement between TWRSS and TWSSS grades was calculated with the simple percentage agreement, extended (±1 grade) percentage agreement and kappa coefficient. The agreement between grades was compared by conducting two-way ANOVA. Findings: The results showed that the SD main effect was a significant effect on the agreement between grades. The maximum agreement was provided when midterm and final measurements had equal SD. The minimum was provided when the SD difference was at the highest level. Implications for Research and Practice: It was recommended that scores should be standardized before combined in the norm-referenced grading system. The effects of the shape of data (skewness or kurtosis) on norm-referenced grades could be investigated in the further studies.

        "description":"The purpose of the current study was to understand the digital parentship practices of faculty members with an Instructional Technology (IT) major within a qualitative approach. The participants of the study comprised of 13 faculty members from the IT field of any university in Turkey and who has one or more children aged 0-6 years old. The IT academician, in their role as mother or father, participated in the interview process. As digital literates, the participants of the study possess knowledge and expertise in the potential opportunities that technology offer, and also the possible risks that they pose to children. The findings showed that the majority of the participants do not hesitate to allow their children to use screen technology from an early age (from as young as 6 months old) in order to free up time for themselves or to attend to their work. This implies that the participants utilize technology in order to facilitate the role of parenting, even though they may appreciate it is seen as inappropriate. However, the academician parents who took part in this study applied more restrictive mediation so as to limit their children's exposure to technology due to their very young age and owing to the children's inability at that age to understand the potential risks. The findings of the study provided information so as to help understand the digital parentship practices of parents from the technology field, and to make suggestions about parenting strategies for younger children.",

In addition, teachers with high teaching efficacy beliefs create classroom environments where students can be more successful. In the light of this information, the importance of understanding mathematics teachers' beliefs about their competence has to be considered in mathematics teaching. In this study, a relational survey model was used to examine secondary mathematics teachers' efficacy beliefs about teaching mathematics in terms of some variables. The sample of the study consists of 165 mathematics teachers selected with the stratified sampling method. In this study, Mathematics Teaching Efficacy Belief Scale, developed by Enochs, Smith, and Huinker (2000) and adapted to Turkish by Takunyaci and Aydin (2013) was used. The first finding of our study is mathematics teachers' beliefs about mathematics teaching were medium level. The second finding of our study is the personal mathematics teaching efficacy beliefs of male teachers were significantly higher than female teachers, while female teachers' efficacy beliefs about outcome expectations in mathematics teaching were significantly higher than male teachers. The third finding of our study is efficacy beliefs of mathematics teachers working in private high schools about the outcome expectation in mathematics teaching were significantly higher than the mathematics teachers working in public high schools. In the last finding of our study, it was found that the personal mathematics teaching efficacy beliefs of mathematics teachers with professional seniority of 11 years or more were significantly higher than teachers with professional seniority of 0-5 years.",

        "description":"The aim of this research was to designate and compare the pacing profiles of the Turkish and Non-Turkish female and male athletes completed and ranked in the first tenth (n = 79) in the determined half-marathon road races held in Turkey. The pacings of the athletes were divided into 5 separate segments (0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-21.1 km) and calculated on the basis of their average transition speed (min:sec/km). The differences both between the pacing profiles of the Turkish and Non-Turkish athlete groups and between the successive segments within the groups were examined separately for women and men with the variance analysis for mixed patterns. According to the results, there was no statistical differences between the pacing profiles of both female and male Turkish and Non-Turkish athletes (p &gt; 0.05). In addition, there was also no difference between the successive segments within the groups (p &gt; 0.05). According to these results, it can be said that the pacing profiles of the Turkish and Non-Turkish elite athletes were similar and close to even pacing profile without a last sprint. Although it was not statistically significant, all the athletes had small decreases in their pacings in the first 15 km of the race. In the last 6.1 km segment, while small increases in the pacings of the Non-Turkish female athletes were observed, the pacings of the Turkish women athletes were more even with small decreases. Considering the whole race, it was seen that the athletes showed pacing profiles close to positive and reverse J-shaped pacing profile.",

HOTS is one part of the skills that need to be developed in the 21st Century. This research is a quantitative study with a meta-analysis approach to the mean with random-effects models. Generally, the steps involve formulating research problems meta-analysis to be performed, collecting studies, calculating the effect size, test of heterogeneity, data analysis (summary effect, forest plots, funnel plots, test the potential for publication bias), and concludes. The research sample of 42 research includes international journals and national, international, and nationwide proceedings and a thesis student. The analysis using random models (random-effect model) obtained a mean value of the effect size of aggregation or summary effect amounted to 77.37, standard error weighs the mean 12.36, the upper limit of 53.14, and the lower limit of 101.60. Analysis of the null hypothesis (Ho: actual effect [theta] = 0) leads to rejecting Ho because the Z value of the summary effect is 77.37 with the one-tailed p-value (0.00) smaller than the [alpha] value (0.05). Analysis of publication bias tests from Funnel Plot, Rank Correlation, Regression Method outputs, and &quot;Trim and Fill&quot; shows no potential publication bias regarding conclusions drawn. So the findings made based on the random effect model on the application of innovative learning affect HOTS students achievement (analyzing, evaluating, creating, critical and creative thinking skill aspects) are valid. The implication is that teachers or other practitioners can use innovative learning to improve students' HOTS.",

While the population of this descriptive type cross-sectional study was constituted by 1217 active camp leaders working in the youth camps, the sample was constituted by 400 active camp leaders. The personal information and the questionnaire form which composed of SE scale adapted into Turkish by Gözüm and Aksayan (1999) were used as data collection tools. Pearson's chi-square, independent-samples t-test and one-way ANOVA were used in the analysis of the data.

The mothers of 52.8% and fathers of 42.5% of the camp leaders graduated from primary school. 75.3% of camp leaders have been working in youth camps for 0-4 years. It was determined that SE levels of the camp leaders were higher than the mean score and age, marital status, education level of the parents, income level of the family, duration of duty in the youth camp and status of doing sports were also the efficient factor. As a conclusion, it is advisable to organize activities and training programs to improve the SE levels of camp leaders.",

        "description":"This study investigated the effect of van Hiele Phase-based Instruction (VHPI) on Ghanaian Pre-service Teachers' (PTs') geometric thinking in terms of the van Hiele Levels. A pre-test post-test quasi-experimental design was employed. There were 75 PTs each in the experimental group and the control group. Van Hiele Geometry Test (VHGT) was administered to all PTs as both pre-test and post-test. PTs in the experimental group were taught two-dimensional geometry using VHPI while the control group was instructed by conventional instruction. Chi-square results showed that the PTs in both groups had increment in their post-VHGT as compared to the pre-VHGT. However, the PTs in the experimental group achieved better levels of geometric thinking as compared to those in the control group (X[superscript 2] = 58.949, p&lt;0.05). Again, results from paired samples t-test indicated a significant difference in mean scores between control and experimental groups favouring PTs in the experimental group (t = 30.776, p&lt;0.05). The significant improvement in the performance of the experimental group having more PTs at level 3 and 4 than at level 0, 1 and 2 suggest that the VHPI served a useful pedagogical approach, impacted positively on PTs geometric thinking levels and has the potential of improving teaching and learning of geometry in schools than the conventional approach.",

Type of the study is relational screening and its sample comprise 78 typically developing children between 60-77 months who attend a Kindergarten affiliated to the Directorate of National Education in Süleymanpasa district of Tekirdag province. The obtained data about several demographic features of children &quot;General Information Form&quot; and &quot;Incomplete Doll Family Story Scale (IDFSS)&quot; which was developed by Cassidy (1988) and adapted to Turkish language by Seven (2006). Data frequency, percentage and distribution were found with General Information Form and data was found typically distributed. In statistical analysis, t test was used in cases where number of groups was two and one-way variance analysis in cases where it was three or higher. Data was analyzed in SPSS 22.0 at 0.05 significance level. Total attachment score of children aged 60-77 months was found 21.38 at the end of the study. Avoidant attachment was observed in 53.8 of children while 15.4% were negatively and 30.8% were securely attached. Thus, it was found that 69.2% of children were insecurely attached while 30.8% were securely attached. Study findings suggest that attachment level of children differed in favor of girls with regards gender while it did not differ in terms of other variables such as number of siblings, family type, socio-economic status of families, post-natal working status of mothers, caretaker person between 0-1 ages.",

The study employed a qualitative design and data were collected through a questionnaire administered to 146 part-time students on this programme. These students were teaching in different contexts: urban, rural and, township high schools. The findings indicated that teachers within the 0-3 years' professional life phase expected to gain knowledge of the curriculum. The student teachers did not believe that they possessed adequate content knowledge, despite their previous undergraduate training and thus expected to learn the subject content knowledge from the programme. Many of the students however had adequate understanding of teaching practice although they still expected to learn more, including learning about aspects of professional teacher attributes. The core-educational modules in the programme exposed students to knowledge of curriculum and assessment requirements. However, these findings suggest a need to establish individual needs of students to ensure that their classroom practice needs are addressed by the time they graduate. Given the link between teacher content knowledge and student achievement, and the need to improve the content knowledge of PGCE part-time teacher-students, the study recommends inclusion of content knowledge in the curriculum.",

(2009) suggest that mental toughness is more a function of environment than domains, and as such, mental toughness is potentially important in any environment that requires performance setting, challenges, and adversities. Due to vital importance of mental toughness in sports and particularly in soccer, this paper focused on the comparison of sport mental toughness levels of soccer officials with their age group, education level, refereeing category and sports experience years. Mental toughness was checked by Sports Mental Toughness Questionnaire (SMTQ). The SMTQ was applied to soccer officials (159 licensed referees) who all were registered to the Turkish Football Federation (TFF). The sample consisted of 146 male subjects, mean age was 29.10 years (SD = 7.54, range = 19-54) and 13 female subjects mean age was 22.82 years (SD = 4.71, range = 19-27). To determine the difference of Sport Mental Toughness level among soccer referees One-Way ANOVA was used for normal distribution and Scheffé Test was used for determining the differences across groups with through SPSS Package 21.0 and the significant level was set at 0.05. The findings of this research paper showed that there were significant differences between soccer officials' three sub-factors (confidence--constancy--control) of mental toughness and their officiating experience years. This could be attributed to the fact that 15 and above years experienced officials were mentally tougher than those with 0-5 years' experience and those with 6-10 years' experience. There were not any significant differences between other variables (refereeing categories, education levels and age groups) of soccer officials and their mental toughness levels.",

        "description":"The conflict situations that have afflicted parts of Kenya every five years, in the wake of general elections, since 1992 were most prominent after the disputed presidential elections of 2007. The magnitude of the clashes, loss of life, destruction of property and internal displacement of people were hitherto unwitnessed. The situation of Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) in Kenya has continued to be of national and international concern. The 2007/2008 post-election violence exacerbated the dire situation of OVC in Kenya. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimated the number of children displaced by the 2007/2008 post-election violence (PEV) in Kenya at 100,000 and those orphaned at 300,000 high. Some of the OVC lost both parents during the violence. Many more were born during and after displacement, and have no knowledge of their homes or origin. They do not understand or even remember the circumstances that caused their parents to be displaced. A survey by UNICEF in 2010 noted that on the overall after 2007/08 post-election conflict, about 15% of orphans were 0-4 years old, 35% were between 5 and 9 years old while up to 50% were 10-14 years old. This paper identifies the challenges the OVC are experiencing in schools as absenteeism, lack of physical infrastructure, insecurity, psychological trauma, among others. The paper also proposes strategies and programmes that various stakeholders have, and should put in place to assist OVC.",

        "description":"This study aims at developing an assessment scale for identifying preschool children's communication skills, at distinguishing children with communication deficiencies and at comparing the communication skills of children with normal development (ND) and those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Participants were 427 children of up to 6 years of age with ND (45% female, 55% male) and 76 children from ages 1-6 years with ASD (25% female, 75% male. Exploratory factor analysis and principal component analysis were applied to maintain construct validity. The total loads of factors were between 65.32% (0-1 module) and 75.75% (4-5 module). The Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient value was high for all the modules (a[subscript min] = 0.93; a[subscript max] = 0.97). The items in all the modules are highly correlated to the total score of the module (r[subscript min] = 0.35; r[subscript max] = 0.91; p &lt; 0.001), and the high/low groups of the items included in all the modules are distinctive (t[subscript n] = -9.95; t[subscript max] = -52.67; p &lt; 0.001). Results of the independent samples t-test applied to compare children with ND and children with ASD revealed the difference in the means of all the modules is significant (t[subscript min] = 6.30; p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, all the modules in the parent form are sufficiently reliable and valid; thus, the form can be used to distinguish children with ND from those with ASD in terms of their communication skills.",

        "description":"In the process of developing a conditionally-dependent item response theory (IRT) model, the problem arose of modeling an underlying multivariate normal (MVN) response process with general correlation among the items. Without the assumption of conditional independence, for which the underlying MVN cdf takes on comparatively simple forms and can be numerically evaluated using existing reduction formulae, the task required the development of a computationally fast, tractable, and accurate approximation of MVN orthant probabilities for general correlation--&quot;rho(sub ij)&quot;. Previous technical reports by the present authors have provided such a method, based on C. E. Clark's (1961) approximation of the moments of &quot;n&quot; correlated random normal variables. Research continues in the area of  applying this algorithm to problems in IRT. This report focuses on the application of previous research results to another problem in statistics--the generation of simultaneous confidence bounds for multiple correlated comparisons. C. W. Dunnett's test for multiple treatments compared to a single control is generalized to various unbalanced cases. There is a large amount of statistical literature on this topic. However, as in IRT, the solutions have been based on reduction formulae that are limited to special cases, which arise in the comparison of multiple treatment groups each of size &quot;n(sub i) = m&quot; to a single control group of size &quot;n(sub 0)&quot;. More general problems, such as obtaining simultaneous confidence bounds for regression coefficients cannot be solved using these existing  methods. This report illustrates how the results obtained in the IRT context can be applied to simultaneous statistical inference problems of various kinds. (Author/RLC)",

The following recommendations concerning the young child (ages 0 through 9) are outlined: (1) prenatal risk factors can be reduced by providing health care, nutritional guidance, and parenting education for pregnant adolescents; (2) birth is the optimal time to make a diagnosis of the infant's health care needs and the family's ability to meet those needs, and to respond with follow-up health care and parenting education; (3) the ability of families to meet the needs of preschool  children varies and families may require day care, parent education, social service outreach, and early childhood education; and (4) the condition and support of the family are important components of children's early school success (preschool, kindergarten, and first grade), requiring high-quality school-based early childhood programs, careful monitoring of student progress, parent participation, and support services for children and families. Recommendations concerning the middle learning years (ages 10-14) are outlined for the following areas: (1) school reform or restructuring of all the elements of middle school education; (2) developmentally appropriate curricula and instruction; (3) adequate resources, facilities, and staff; (4) ongoing evaluation; (5) school-based decision making;  and (6) partnerships. Recommendations for the high school years are outlined for the following: (1) administrative vision and leadership; (2) provision of special programs; and (3) revision in current schooling practice.

        "description":"In fall 1987, a study was conducted by the Learning Assessment Retention Consortium (LARC) to closely inspect the reading courses and programs currently offered in the California community colleges. All 106 community colleges in the state were surveyed regarding testing instruments used, the number and level of reading courses offered, entry and exit criteria, and course content. Study findings, based on responses from 62 colleges, included the following: (1) the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, Stanford Diagnostic (Blue), and the ASSET test were the tests used most often for course placement; (2) 77% of the reporting colleges offered reading courses at the 0-4th grade level, 84% at the 4th-7th grade level, 98% at the 8th-10 grade level, and 87% at the 10th-12th grade level; (3) 32% of  the colleges offered a degree-applicable course in critical/analytical reading; (4) the three major program models were individualized reading programs leading to classroom instruction at higher levels, classroom-lab and individualized instruction spanning all levels, and classroom or classroom-lab only; (5) in all colleges, students were placed in reading courses using standardized reading tests, though initial placement could be refined by reading instructors; (6) vocabulary improvement was treated at all levels of reading instruction; (7) some aspects of reading comprehension were treated in all courses at the 4th grade through college levels; and (8) in the higher level courses, greater focus was placed on critical thinking and analytical skills, while in the middle level courses,  study skills, vocabulary, and comprehension were treated and the lowest level courses emphasized phonics and spelling in addition to other skills. The survey instrument is appended. (WJT)",

Attention is directed to fine motor behavior during the first year (vision, grasp, and release and reaching), and behaviors developing at 13 months (the interaction of fine motor and cognitive skills). An introductory section considers the behaviors that occur in the first year of development. In following a developmental approach, the guide identifies goals and objectives, and explains the relevance of the objectives to overall growth and development. Activities are suggested that will describe how to increase the student's fine motor skills.

Developmental levels ranging from 0-6 months to 49-60 months are covered. Language correlates of the activities and ideas for group homes and family environments are also presented. The following goal areas are included: reaching for and grasping an object; using the skills of reach, grasp, and release as a way of relating to objects; using a pincer grip to manipulate objects; using a fisted grasp to manipulate objects; using two-hand coordination to manipulate objects; using refined, upper extremity movements to manipulate objects; improving eye-hand coordination; and improving finger dexterity.

It is noted that once students begin to acquire these critical skills, they can become active participants in group learning activities, rather than waiting for their turn in individual sessions.

Learning behaviors important for the severely handicapped student are covered: attending to sensory stimuli, gestural imitation, ways of relating to objects, and object permanency. It is suggested that the teacher become familiar with Piagetian theory and the developmental norms and assessment of information generated by this theory, since  the behaviors included in the activities comprise the sensorimotor stage of cognitive development identified by J. Piaget and others. Information is provided for each of the learning behaviors and for the following developmental levels: 0-6 months, 7-12 months, and 13-18 months. For each behavior and developmental level, goals and objectives are identified, the relevance of the objectives to overall growth and development is explained, and activities to teach the objectives are indicated.

        "description":"The Appalachia Educational Laboratory (AEL) conducted an assessment of microcomputer-related needs for basic mathematics in the four-state areas of Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia in 1984-85. The primary input came from teachers from each of the states who participated in a needs conference in their home state. When each of the 344 needs statements generated during the conferences was rated on a scale of 0 (low) to 5 (high) by all of the conference participants, it was found that many top-rated concerns were common for the entire region: access to hardware for teachers and students; information about software sources and reviews of software; high quality software; software that addresses topics of concern to teachers; methods of integrating computers into  classroom activities; and training in computer operations and instructional uses. In addition to a description of the DAP Process of needs assessment, which was used to conduct the study, and a report of the results, this document contains four papers suggesting strategies for addressing identified needs: &quot;Software Issues and Answers for the '80's&quot; (M. D. Roblyer); &quot;Hardware Issues in Using Microcomputers in Education&quot; (Charles R. Sanders); &quot;Computer Training for Teachers&quot; (John Cook); and &quot;Computer Planning and Integration Issues&quot; (Jose Mestre). Three appendices contain a manual for the needs assessment process; lists of need statements from the state conferences; and descriptions of 10 brochures addressing priority needs of classroom teachers.

        "description":"This report contains the latest official population forecasts for Kentucky. Population projections are revised periodically, based on the emergence of recent demographic trends that are inconsistent with assumptions used in earlier forecasts or the revelation of major developments that would impact future population growth. Recent trends are analyzed through annual population estimates derived from recorded births, deaths, and indicators of migration, taking into account changes in the fertility and migration components of the projections model. The 1980 census counts, the 1985 estimate, and projections for the years 1990, 1995, 2000, 2010, and 2020 are presented for the state, its 15 area development districts, its 7 metropolitan statistical areas, and its 120 counties. Tables  present detailed population projections by gender and five-year age groups through 85 years and over. Age summaries are also presented for the population 0-18 years and 65 years and over. A cohort-component model projects the household population and the group quarters population aged 65 years and over in each county. Annual estimates 1981-1986 and annual projections for 1986-2020 are available by single year of age and two racial groups, white and nonwhite. The projections anticipate slow growth in Kentucky for the next few decades, with 21 counties expected to lose population. The state's non-metropolitan areas are expected to grow by 7.5 percent, whereas the metropolitan areas are expected to experience only a 4.6 percent increase. The state's number of elderly people is expected to  increase, comprising 13.7 percent of the total population by 1995. This report also details its forecast methodology and includes locator maps.

        "description":"A study examined when young children begin processing phonetic cues for reading. Subjects were kindergartners selected and classified by their ability to read preprimer and primer level words on a 40-word list--prereaders (0-1 words known), novices (1-11 words known), and veterans (11-36 words known). Subjects were given reading practice with words with simplified phonetic spellings and with words that achieved visual distinctiveness although no letters corresponded to sounds. Children were told the spoken word corresponding to each spelling and were given several trials to learn the words, and then administered a posttest. Results indicated that novices and veterans learned to read the phonetic spellings more easily than the visual spellings, while results were the opposite for  prereaders. Findings suggest that phonetic cue reading is possible at the outset when children first begin reading words out of context, and that visual cue reading characterizes how prereaders read words. Findings also suggest that learning to spell contributed to beginners' ability to read words, enabling children to process phonetic cues in the words. Since word reading and word spelling skills develop in stages, classroom instruction and practice in invented spelling promote learning to spell and read words. Allowing children to practice what they know about the English orthographic system by inventing spellings of words does not appear to inhibit development but rather to enhance progress in learning to spell and read.

In this study, the effects of cooperative learning on the abilities of the preservice art teacher candidates to plan lessons were emphasized. For this purpose, 32 art teacher candidates were selected for the experimental group, and 32 art teacher candidates were selected by random sampling method. An evaluation rubric was developed to evaluate the lesson plans that the art teacher candidates prepared. Points that increased two by two from 0 to 10 were included in the rubric. A cooperative learning program was developed for application in the experimental group. Samples of lesson plans were taken for a pre-test purpose before starting the program. The program lasted for three weeks, and four hours each week; and at the end of the program post-test works were taken from the candidates. The rubric was scored by three people, including researchers. Cooperative learning method was applied to the experimental group, and traditional learning method was applied to the control group. The candidates of both groups were requested to focus on planning a lesson. The results of the research shown that there was no significant difference between the pre-test points (P&gt;0.05), however, there was a significant difference between the post-test points in favour of the experimental group (P&lt;0.05).

Children in the ECE are mostly confined to verbal communication which, to a certain extent, restricts their imagination and inventive ability. Loris Malaguzzi, the founder of the Reggio Emilia educational philosophy, initiated the Hundred Languages of Children (HLC) as a pedagogical approach to enable children to interact and communicate. Aim: This study aims to explore the role of HLC through the experiences and views of the four ECE practitioners in the Gauteng province. Drawing on Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences, the author argues that ECE children possess different kinds of minds, and therefore they learn in different ways. Setting: Two Early Childhood centres in the Gauteng Province of South Africa were selected for this study because they had adopted Malaguzzi's HLC approach to constructing concepts to help children structure knowledge and organise learning. Methods: The author used one-on-one interviews to get ECE practitioners' experiences on using Malaguzzi's HLC. To corroborate the interviews' data, the author conducted classroom observations and document analysis. Results: The participants viewed Malaguzzi's HLC as an enabler to meet the requirement of the two sets of curricula from the Department of Social Development (the National Curriculum Framework for children from 0 to 4 years) and from the Department of Basic Education (the Curriculum Assessment and Policy Statement for 5-year-old children). Conclusion: The findings show a paradigm shift, as children become active constructors of their own knowledge.",

        "description":"Recreation, which means relaxing and pleasant activities that people do voluntarily in their free time, is a concept that provides the physical and psychological renewal of individuals. The study was conducted on a total of 497 students, 248 men participating in recreational sports activities and 249 men who did not participate in any recreational activities. For this purpose &quot;Leisure Constraints Scale&quot;, which was developed by Alexandris and Carroll (1997) and was conducted in the study of the validity and reliability for Turkish Society by Karaküçük and Gürbüz (2007) was used. Statistical analysis of the study was performed by using SPSS 22,0 package program. The normality hypothesis of the data was analyzed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Since all variables showed normal distribution, parametric tests were applied to the independent variables related to the sub-problems and the leisure time scale subscales. Independent t test was used for paired comparisons and Pearson correlation was used for the relationship between variables. Statistical results were evaluated at 95% confidence interval and p &lt;0.05 significance level. As a result, statistically significant differences were found between the students participating in sportive recreation activity in the field and those who did not participate in any recreational activity in terms of leisure time barriers in terms of Individual Psychology, Social Environment, Service and Transportation, Time, Lack of Friends and Lack of Interest.

It was designed based on survey method and conducted with four sampling group consisting of 956 prospective primary school teachers at Education Faculties in Turkey. First sampling group was consisted of 404 prospective primary school teachers and 96 out of it were involved in the application of open-ended questions and 308 were involved in exploratory factor analysis. 305 prospective primary school teachers in the second sampling group participated in the confirmatory factor analysis, 108 prospective teachers in the third group were involved in criterion validity and 139 prospective teachers in the fourth one participated in the test-retest reliability analysis. As a result of the principal component analysis of the Mathematics Teaching Anxiety Scale (MTAS), it was found that the scale indicating single factor structure and consisting of 31 items (47.43% of the total variance). After suggested modifications, the scale MTAS was constructed with 19 items. 12 items were removed from the scale and the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was carried out with 19 items. According to CFA results (0=X2 / df = 1.483=2, RMSEA = 0.040, RMR = 0.050, AGFI = 0.908, TLI = 0.972, CFI = 0.976, IFI = 0.976, GFI = 0.928, NFI = 0.930 and RFI = 0.919), it was confirmed that the scale structure was consisting of 19 items and one dimension.

An investigation of a 2009 provincial examination written by matric pupils was conducted on both the curriculum elements of the test and learner performance. In this study we supplement the prior qualitative investigation with an application of Rasch measurement theory to review and revise the scoring procedures so as to better reflect scoring intentions. In an application of the Rasch model, checks are made on the test as a whole, the items and the learner responses, to ensure coherence of the instrument for the particular reference group, in this case Mathematical Literacy learners in one high school. In this article, we focus on the scoring of polytomous items, that is, items that are scored 0, 1, 2 … &quot;m.&quot; We found in some instances indiscriminate mark allocations, which contravened assessment and measurement principles. Through the investigation of each item, the associated scoring logic and the output of the Rasch analysis, rescoring was explored. We report here on the analysis of the test prior to rescoring, the analysis and rescoring of individual items and the post rescore analysis. The purpose of the article is to address the question: How may detailed attention to the scoring of the items in a Mathematical Literacy test, through theoretical investigation and the application of the Rasch model, contribute to a more informative and coherent outcome?",

        "author":["Gorgulu, Recep"],
        "description":"The aim of this experimental study was to test Wegner's (1994) theory of ironic processes in a basketball free throw task under pressure. More specifically, Wegner (1994) predicts that when instructed not to perform in a certain manner performers' performance will break down where it is least desired way which is the main hypothesis of the current study. More specifically, it was hypothesized that when basketball players were instructed &quot;not to throw the ball'' into the certain zone on the backboard would decrease their performance in ironic fashion especially under manipulated high-anxiety condition. The sample of the present study comprised 37 male (M[subscript &quot;age&quot;]=22.30, SD=2.89) experienced university basketball players. Participants' anxiety was measured using MRF-3 (Krane, 1994). In a basketball free-throw task; the numbers of targets, non-target non-ironic balls and ironic error balls were counted and overall performance was also calculated in order to measure participants' performance. Based on the scoring system, participants gained +5 points for throwing into the target, scored -5 points making an ironic error and 0 points for throwing the ball to anywhere (except the target and non-target ironic error zone) on the backboard. Results revealed that when instructed not to throw in a certain zone, performers' overall performance changed in ironic fashion across anxiety conditions. Findings suggest that understanding the mechanism of ironic processes of mental control theory may be a useful theoretical framework for examining the relationship between anxiety and performance in sport, physical education and motor control studies.",

The sampling of the present research study consists of 182 graduate theses. The study relies on the retrieval of the desired data by document analysis through a systematic examination of the available theses by using a thesis examination form developed by the researchers. The results revealed that 85% of the authors were female and almost half of the supervisors were assistant professors and moreover 59% of the supervisors were female. The study also showed that a great majority of the examined theses contained 0-10 research problems, results and suggestions. It was also figured out in the study that the focal point of the theses is majorly qualifications of preschool teachers, characteristics and tendencies of parents, effects of different approaches/methods on early childhood education, characteristics of children in early childhood education or at preschool age. It was observed that 68.1% of graduate theses were quantitative studies and that the least employed research method was observation (0.5%), case study (1.1%), interview (1.6%) and phenomenological method (1.6%), while the most frequently administered data collection tool, accounting for 65%, was questionnaire.",

        "description":"Dietary habits are developed through a combination of biological, environmental, socioeconomic, and psychosocial factors. However, these dietary habits can also be influenced by access and education. College undergraduate years are important for the development of life skills including the ability to select nutritious meals. This is of vital importance for students who are from communities that are classified as food deserts and food swamps, where positive nutrition behaviors may not be supported. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the food options at two minority serving institutions in New Jersey to determine the amount of healthy options available. A content analysis was completed by assessing the menus of the selected dining services at the respective institutions and determining their health impact. Twenty-seven food establishments were analyzed. The food locations were categorized into healthy dining (7.4%), unhealthy dining (14.8%), healthy fast food (7.4%), unhealthy fast food (40.7%), healthy café (3.7%), unhealthy café (18.5%), healthy prepackaged (0%), and unhealthy prepackaged (7.4%). Healthy eateries made up 18.5% and unhealthy eateries made up 81.4% of the food offerings. This significant difference in healthy compared to unhealthy offerings is a call to action to improve food choices on the campuses of minority serving institutions. Chronic diseases continue to impact people of younger ages and contribute to health disparities. Colleges have a unique opportunity to positively influence the lifestyle behaviors that can decrease these chronic disease rates. Future studies should investigate the food options at minority serving institutions throughout the United States.",

Besides, what needs to be discussed is what kind of assignments should be given to students, and how they should be evaluated. The aim of this study is to investigate the views of science teachers about homework assignments. The survey method was preferred for this study. A questionnaire was developed by the researchers, and 100 teachers were reached online and via social media. The data obtained from the study were evaluated through quantitative and qualitative analyses. This study shows that the majority of the teachers do not support banning homework, and they consider it as necessary. Teachers mostly assign homework assignments for repetition and reinforcement. Project assignments and research presentation assignments are the most commonly assigned types of homework. Teachers give homework to students which they can do mostly at home spending 0-1 hours together with their friends. According to the teachers, homework provides the most benefits for reinforcement, repetition and learning. In the study, it was found that the majority of the teachers did not use portfolios. According to the teachers participating in the study, the factors that mainly affect student motivation are concentration, reluctance and insufficient knowledge. In order for students to develop their skills properly in the 21st century and be successful in international examinations such as TIMSS, their understanding of homework must also change to meet the requirements of the age.",

The aim of our study was to examine the relationship among these three abilities. 79 football players voluntarily participated in the study (height: 177,96 ± 5,4cm; weight 73,72 ± 7,85kg; training age: 10,59 ± 2,94 years; age: 21,90 ± 2,66 years). Participant's tests have been taken on non-consecutive days in RT (visual reaction test, Lafayette, Moart Reaction and Movement), Speed (Total 15m; Fusion Sport, Smart Speed), Start speed (0-5m; Fusion Sport, Smart Speed), and acceleration (5-15m; Fusion Sport, Smart Speed). The first 5m is start speed, 5-15m is acceleration phase and total 15m is speed. Significant correlation has been found between star speed and speed (p&lt;0,01); training age and start speed (p&lt;0,05); height and last 5m performance. Otherwise, the adverse correlation has been found between the second 5m and last 5m performances (p&lt;0,01). There is no significant correlation between reaction time and 15m speed performance (p&gt;0,05). There is significant correlation between acceleration and 15m speed (p&lt;0,05), and between second 5m (p&lt;0,01) and third 5m performances. The football players who have good rates of start speed times have good speed performance due to their physical capabilities. The rate of ground reaction forces is the most important factor that affects acceleration. Hence it's recommended that activities including Olympic weightlifting be performed to increase the rate of ground reaction forces.",

THE STATE'S POPULATION WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE, BUT AT A DECREASING RATIO. THE 0-19-YEAR-OLD POPULATION WILL CONTINUE TO REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE TOTAL POPULATION. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TREND IS THE RURAL TO URBAN MIGRATION. FROM 1960 TO 1966, AN ESTIMATED 63 COUNTIES LOST POPULATION WHILE TOWNS OF 2,500 OR MORE INCREASED THEIR SHARE OF THE STATE'S POPULATION FROM 49.1 TO 51.8 PERCENT. GRADE 12 ENROLLMENT INCREASED FROM 17,484 IN 1963 TO 24,698 IN 1965, A 41 PERCENT GAIN. THIS GROUP IS EXPECTED TO APPROXIMATE 26,000 THROUGH  1975. THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL POPULATION WILL STABILIZE BUT GAINS AND LOSSES WITHIN COUNTIES WILL CONTINUE TO OCCUR. THE TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION OF ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL ENROLLMENT IS CLEAR, BUT BOTH WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE PRESSURES AND PROBLEMS RELATED TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN STUDENT ENROLLMENTS. DATA WERE FROM THE 1962-65 ANNUAL FALL ACCREDITATION AND APPROVAL REPORTS, SUBMITTED BY EVERY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOL EACH FALL. ENROLLMENTS AT EACH GRADE LEVEL FOR EACH COUNTY AND THE STATE WERE CALCULATED, AND STRAIGHT LINE PROJECTIONS WERE MADE THROUGH 1975. THE APPENDIX CONTAINS TABULAR DATA ON THE ENROLLMENT FOR THE STUDY PERIOD AND PROJECTED DATA FOR THE 1966-77 PERIOD FOR EACH OF THE 92 COUNTIES.

        "description":"This volume discusses the conceptualization and measurement of the health status of children (0 to 13 years of age) in terms of physical, mental, and social health and general health perceptions. The discussion is based on Health Insurance Study (HIS) questionnaire data collected from a sample of 8000 people (enrolled in one of the HIS insurance plans) from five sites across the United States: Seattle, Washington; Fitchbur and Franklin Counties, Massachusetts; and Georgetown and Charleston Counties, South Carolina. Chapter 2 includes a literature review that describes the ways other investigators have conceptualized and measured children's physical, mental, and social health, and general health ratings, and critically evaluates the measures in terms of their apparent usefulness  as indicators of health status in general populations of children. Chapter 3 describes the content of health status measures fielded for children in the HIS, summarizes demographic and socioeconomic characteristics for children and their families in HIS sites, and outlines the plan of analysis used to scale measures and study their reliability and validity. Chapter 4 presents the results of HIS scaling analysis for children, including descriptive statistics for scale scores, reliability and validity of the scales that were developed, and sociodemographic correlates of health status. Finally, Chapter 5 discusses the findings of children's HIS measurement studies as compared with those reported in the literature, describes additions to the HIS mental health battery, and suggests further  analyses and refinements in measurement of child health status in general populations of children.

        "description":"Presented is the final report of a 1-year project designed to determine the possibility of coordinating services for handicapped children in the Baltimore (Maryland) region by providing technical assistance to coalitions of decision makers at the local and regional levels. Some of the findings and conclusions drawn from the project are listed such as that successful coordination requires staff support. An overview of the project covers such topics as the coalition approach; the problem of lack of coordination; the role of Models of Delivery Systems Inc., a nonprofit corporation; project objectives; and interdependence of coalition and the model. The establishment of coalitions for handicapped children at the city, county, and regional levels are reported on separately. Described  is a document developed during the project which is noted to contain information on direct services which exist specifically for handicapped children, identified gaps in services, and assessment of the interagency network in each jurisdiction. The two project models, one designed with the consumer in mind and the other designed to meet agency needs, are reviewed. Results from questionnaires for evaluating the project are cited, and it is concluded that the project was successful. Attachments are provided which include a table on the population of handicapped children (0-21 years old) in three local jurisdictions, an overview of the coalition approach project, a table on coalition members, copies of county and city project proposals, and a sample coalition project questionnaire form.

        "description":"The controversy over school segregation and student achievement has drawn heavily on evidence derived from the 1965 Equality of Educational Opportunity Survey (EEOS). This paper tries to remedy the two principal limitations of Coleman et al.'s original analysis of the EEOS data. Since the EEOS was not a longitudinal study, we cannot compare the initial and final achievement of individual students at two points in time. We can, however, compare first and sixth graders in the same elementary schools. We can also compare ninth and twelfth graders in the same high schools. If we assume that the first graders entering a school in 1965 had test scores comparable to the sixth graders' scores when they entered the same school in 1960, we can determine whether the sixth graders' test  scores rose or fell relative to national norms in the interval. We can do the same thing at the high school level. Such reanalysis has produced results suggesting that the test performance of students in 51-75 percent of white schools improved relative to national norms between first and sixth grade. This applied to both black and white students in such schools. Black students' performance relative to national norms seemed to decline slightly if they were in 76-100 percent white schools, and to remain constant if they were in 0-50 percent white schools. The racial composition of a high school did not appear to have had any appreciable effect on either black or white students' test scores between ninth and twelfth grades. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Presented are papers from a 2 day conference in 1972 on screening and assessment of high risk children, 0 to 5 years of age, to detect developmental disabilities in physical, cognitive/intellectual, socio/emotional, and language areas. Briefly reviewed are legislation, reports, and programs which have concerned children's development in the last decade. Two papers consider physical screening and assessment; one paper focuses on screening devices such as the Rapid Checklist; the other paper indicates preference for use of medical histories, developmental screening tests, and eye screening tests. Presented in one of two papers on cognitive/intellectual screening is a procedure for measuring heart rate and electroencephalographic responses of newborns to stimulation to evaluate  children's neurological functioning, and focused upon in the other paper are limitations of infant mental tests. Discussed in relation to screening in the socio/emotional area are approaches to using observational information for assessment purposes, and ethical problems encountered in design of measures and implementation of mass screening, respectively. Considered in the first of two papers on screening in the language area are issues and problems such as the primitive nature of assessment technique instruments; stressed in the other paper is the difficulty of screening for hearing ability. Recommendations of the conference include the need for an improved confidential system to compile data on each child's tests and development. Touched upon in the summary of the conference's  proceedings are such points as insufficient manpower for mass screening and expense. (MC)",

        "description":"To identify selected personal and social characteristics of those from whom low-income homemakers sought advice and information in family living, data were gathered from 131 homemakers who were enrolled in the Expanded Food and Nutrition Program in Cincinnati, Ohio, and from 30 opinion leaders who were identified by the homemakers. A descriptive survey utilizing individual interview techniques was the main procedure used in gathering data, and a few mailed questionnaires were used to obtain information from the opinion leaders. The opinion leaders were those who were named by two or more homemakers as persons from whom they would seek advice and information, based on 10 different hypothetical situations. A self-designation technique of identifying opinion leaders was also  utilized, allowing both homemakers and opinion leaders to score themselves on a 0-6 scale. Specific conclusions reached were as follows: (1) There was no significant difference between the ages of the homemakers and the opinion leaders; (2) Opinion leaders had achieved a higher educational level; (3) Opinion leaders had a significantly higher income than the homemakers; (4) Magazines and radio were utilized by more opinion leaders than homemakers, but television and newspapers were utilized similarly by both groups; (5) Relatives were used more often by the homemakers as a personal source of information; and (6) Opinion leaders had a higher socioeconomic level than the homemakers. Recommendations are made, and a bibliography is provided. (DB)",
