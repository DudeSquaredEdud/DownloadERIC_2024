        "description":"This 4-volume research guide to New Careers programs, which was derived from personal interviews with approximately 100 respondents in individual and group sessions, is intended to serve a variety of uses, such as: (1) to encourage program planners and operators to utilize research as a means of contributing to problem solving, and (2) to stimulate and assist those researching various aspects of New Careers programs. The contents, which reflect many of the major suggestions and needs expressed by those who are involved in some aspect of New Careers programs, are organized in the following volumes: (1) Assessing the Impact of the New Careers Program, which proposes research studies that deal with considerations necessary for launching a New Careers program, (2) The Design and  Operation of New Careers Programs, which proposes research studies that deal with ongoing operational problems of New Careers programs, (3) Assessing the Impact of the New Careers Program, which proposes research studies to assess the success of the total program rather than the effectiveness of individual components, and (4) Implications of the New Careers Program for the Field of Education, which cites areas where research efforts may be applied to planning and operation activities of New Careers educational projects to suit the needs of those served.

Ronan, puts the emphasis on the &quot;student&quot; evaluation of teaching performance. Two reasons given for this are: (1) The students are in direct relationship with teachers and can and do observe actual teaching and all its behavioral elements; and (2) There is evidence to show that observers and students do not agree on teaching performance. The critical incident technique (CIT) has been applied to college teaching in four separate studies including this one. A wide sampling of incidents of &quot;best&quot; and &quot;poorest&quot; teacher performances in their general dealings with students, was collected. These were put into two categories, Effective Behaviors and Ineffective  Behaviors, with six subcategories under each. The subcategories under the major headings are: Personal Relationships With Students; Classroom Administration; Student Participation; Classroom Presence; Organization and Presentation of Material; and Evaluation of Student Performance. The Evaluative Behavioral Statements questionnaire is presented along with a bibliography and current ERIC entries on related subjects. (See ED 056 647 for the original document.) (LS)",

It is pointed out that two versions of this program have been developed. The first is for an IBM 360/370 computer. This version has been operational on a production basis for nearly a year. Four installations of this version have been made by RIC for the State Educational Agencies in Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, and Texas. The second version is for mini-computers using the BASIC programming language. This version, still in the developmental stages, is operational only on a Digital Electronics Corporation PDP-12 time-sharing mini-computer. Numerous programming modifications to improve the performance of this version, as well as documentation of this  program, are underway. A third version, a combination of the other two versions appears to be economically most attractive. This &quot;hybrid&quot; approach uses a 360/370 computer for performing the logic and the mini-computer for printing. The manual places emphasis on how to utilize the RIC program to perform searches; consideration of some technical aspects is given in the Appendices. The approach taken by RIC, utilization of the ERIC Descriptor Postings, provides one alternative to the computer search program, QUERY. (Author/CK)",

It is pointed out that these books fail to nurture a sense of respect and understanding for children of minority group cultures. The textbooks were classified into the following categories: (1) Books in compliance with the State Education Code Sections 8553, 8576, 9002, and 9305, and (2) Books not in compliance with the State Education Code. Of those in compliance, there were two categories: (1) textbooks in which no changes were recommended, and (2) textbooks in which minor changes are recommended. Of those not in compliance, there were also two categories: (1) textbooks in which moderate to major modifications are necessary, and (2) textbooks in which total rewriting and restructuring are  necessary. It is concluded that children of all races must be granted the opportunity to study and appreciate their own culture. It is proposed that steps be taken by the state of California to require schools not in compliance with the State Codes to conform to them. (Author/CK)",

It is pointed out that some 10 projects have been undertaken. The number of persons attending the literacy courses has risen from 5,500 to about 400,000 during the period 1967 to 1971 and the number of teachers has increased from 200 to 8,500 during the same period. The approach used in teaching literacy is one oriented to the solutions of the problems arising out of a particular environment. Thus, the teaching of reading, writing and arithmetic, vocational training and the rudiments of socio-economic training are closely integrated. Special attention has been given to the evaluation of results; a handbook was  prepared for the evaluation of experimental projects in functional literacy training. The point is made that the phase of post-literacy work will require a great deal of attention on the members of UNESCO. It is suggested that regional groups be set up, under the authority of the Committee, for the purpose of guiding literacy activities. (CK)",

This report is based on available statistical data along with results of small group interviews with returning veterans and meetings with officials responsible for programs affecting veterans. Problems include the reverse cultural shock confronting the veteran upon his return home. In addition, the veteran discovers that the unpopularity of the war is a social disadvantage for him and that his absence from civilian life is a handicap when applying for a job. Inadequacies relating to employment programs include: (1) lack of program coordination, (2) information gap, undue emphasis on higher education, and (3)  under-utilization of young veterans. The following profile characterizes the returning veteran: (1) He is between 20 and 24 years old and is from a lower middle class or disadvantaged background; (2) He holds a high school diploma or less and is unlikely to take advantage of his GI educational benefits; and (3) He saw military service in Vietnam and received little or no training in civilian-related skills while in the military. It is recommended that: (1) The Administration coordinate all public and private programs of assistance; (2) A national public information be launched and greater emphasis be placed on vocational education under the GI Bill; and (3) Greater use be made of Vietnam veterans in implementing these programs.

This determination of need was undertaken to determine the feasibility of offering programs of professional preparation in continuing education for persons engaged in continuing education in the health professions. A questionnaire consisting of seven items related to the need for training in continuing education was distributed to health science professionals in the United States and Canada. Eighty-six percent of the respondents indicated that they thought it necessary or desirable for those involved in planning or conducting continuing education programs to have professional training in continuing education as well as in a  health specialty. Almost 75 percent of the respondents added that they would like their present personnel to receive some professional training in continuing education. Conclusions include: (1) There was a need expressed by those in the field for programs of professional preparation in continuing education for the health sciences and this expressed need existed at a fairly high level; (2) The willingness to support programs of this sort is related to the number of persons currently employed in the field and financial support from non-university sources would be required; and (3) Several types of programs would be required and there should be an emphasis on the practical application of principles related to adult learning.

Three non-cognitive factors varying with age are loss of speed, health, and motivation. Studies on learning in relation to age have not controlled for non-learning factors. Perceptual and psychomotor studies are not consistent in indicating whether learning rates vary with age. There are clear performance differences which are independent of learning ability. Other research has compared age groups with respect to the relation between immediate and old recall and have found that immediate recall falls off more rapidly than does old recall with age. The available research suggests that both learning and non-cognitive deficits occur with age. Three problems  face the educators of older people. These are (1) What do they want to do? (2) What can be done to motivate them? and (3) What principles can be carried out in educating the aged. Seven principles have been developed. These include: (1) Work through existing senior citizen centers and groups to satisfy the needs of the elderly as they see them; (2) Establish a curriculum that recognizes the need for immediate rewards and useful courses; (3) Utilize instructors who are knowledgeable in the field of aging; (4) Provide courses at minimal cost; (5) Offer courses in safe, convenient location; (6) Avoid formal arrangements; and (7) Insure that participants understand that their success depends upon their commitment.

Traditional family therapy, even when long-term, has not been notably successful in ameliorating these problems. Three sets of parents, with a total of six children between the ages of five and eleven, were taught to administer a token economy within their home, similar to the Achievement Place model. The parents received instruction in specifying desired social and chore behavior, communicated these behavioral goals to their children, took data on their occurrence and managed a point system. Data is reported on the measurement and modification of  fifteen problem behaviors in Family 1, five in Family 2 and six in Family 3. Multiple baseline and reversal research designs were employed to demonstrate causality. All 26 behavior changes were rated as significant improvements by the parents. (Author)",

The primary question to which the symposium addressed itself was: \"What is a value?\" Subjects of the study were 611 children from grades one through three. They were tested in the fall of 1970 and retested in the spring of 1971. Two categories of criteria were employed in an attempt to validate factor scores derived from the VIC. Results were reported in terms of (1) sex comparisons, (2) grade comparisons, (3) ethnic comparisons, (4) predictor criterion relationships and, (5)  interclass comparisons with respect to teacher-class congruities. The overall conclusions was that values do play a part in the adjustment of the child to school and in his achievement, although it is impossible to determine exactly to what extent they contribute over and above the child's ability since no precise measure of ability is available.

Therefore, aggressive behavior depicted by a human model in a real-life setting might be predicted to have greater effects than cartoon sequences in which both the models and stimulus conditions are imaginary. The subjects were 180 lower elementary school children enrolled in two suburban middle-class schools. Since previous research had indicated that children were somewhat inhibited when they did not know each other, they were  generally assigned to pairs within classrooms. The results of this investigation support the prediction that modeling effects depend upon both the degree of realism of the model's performance and the similarity between the observer's task and the model's behavior.

Some findings were that while the employment level in the Bay Area had grown enormously during the sixties, the labor force had grown younger, presenting problems of supervision and \"employability\". Agency managers as well as school counselors felt that neither their staffs nor potential employees had sufficient knowledge of the local labor  market. In response to this situation a study of the \"Requirements and Design of a Comprehensive Labor Market Information System for a Large Metropolitan Labor Market Area\" was begun.

It is concluded that girls learn language earlier, and may continue to have a very small lead over boys. In spatial abilities, it has been found that by the fourth grade, boys begin to excel and that the sex difference increases in high school students. It is noted that there may be an artificial compression of the sex difference in which girls and an exaggeration of the difference where boys excel because of the differential dropout rate. New physiological hypotheses about sex different are also  presented. Factors discussed are hormones, prenatal administration of sex hormones, cognitive style related to hormones, and brain lateralization. It is concluded that alternative explanations are different to separate, since the usual picture is that better infant care and less sex-role differentiation occur together. Suggested for further research are areas of self-esteem and sex differences spatial differences and analytical abilities, and differential sex-related reinforcement patterns. (BW)",

A discussion is presented on the need for improvements in education based on appropriateness.

Other concepts explored by the author include human worth, dignity, failure, freedom, developmental movement, current needs, and societal change.

One group of 39 was identified as middle-income or higher and the other group of 32 was identified as lower-income. The children ranged in age from kindergarten through third grade. The teaching task was adapted from the Eight Block Sort used by Hess, et al. (1968). No reliable differences in mothers' teaching style occurred as a function of the age of the child, but there were marked differences in the teaching styles of mothers as a function of socioeconomic scale. The general results of this study are similar to those found in earlier studies of maternal teaching behavior. The finding that differences in mothers' teaching style are so clearly a function of socioeconomic background should provide clues to the  dilemma of why the low income child so often has difficulty adapting to the typically middle income school system and structure.

The program takes 20-30 hours of faculty time and is oriented toward problem solving in the classroom and in the school as a whole. Several schools accepted the program on an experimental basis; the experiences of four such schools are discussed. Indigenous leadership of the training activities is basic, and little reliance is placed on outside consultant skills because the latter is so difficult to find and  may encourage dependence.

The subjects consisted of 60 black, first grade children from a lower class urban neighborhood school. The experimental design was a 2x3 factorial with the first factor being the levels of frustration produced by either presence or absence of both low and high valued rewards. This study began with a consideration of the possible positive effects of reward presence, and attempted to dispel the child's frustration by inducing him to think about the rewards in the context of their getting temporally closer. One finding was that subjects given a concrete representation of \"time remaining\" were able to delay  the onset of frustration longer than subjects with no reward present to frustrate them. The results generally support the hypothesis that the presence of rewards is typically frustrating because subjects in the \"toys present\" control condition waited for shorter periods than subjects in the \"toys absent\" control condition.

Subjects were 377 students and 19 teachers from two elementary schools: one, urban and characterized as low socioeconomic status; the other, suburban and characterized as high socioeconomic status. Nine emotional expressions were tested-fear, disgust, happiness, surprise, suffering, anger, contempt, determination, and joy. They become the stimuli for eliciting expressive affective meaning as interpreted by subjects through the adjective pair scales of the Semontic Differential. Independent variables were Status (teacher and student) and school socioeconomic level  (SES). Results of data analysis indicate that depicted emotions of fears and anger elicited different interpretations from teachers and students, suggesting the need for teachers to know which kinds of non-verbal cues pupils tend to perceive as they do, and which they do not.

This paper presents evidence that negative feedback and threats of punishment also decrease intrinsic motivation. Subjects solved puzzles during the first part of the experimental session, after which observations relevant to their intrinsic motivation were made. Subjects in the negative feedback condition were given more difficult puzzles to solve than were the controls so that they railed more frequently than the control subjects. Those in the high failure condition showed less intrinsic motivation following their puzzle-solving session than did  control subjects. Subjects in the threat condition received an aversive buzzer each time they were unable to solve a puzzle, while the control subjects did not.

The more intensely a subject processed the memory information at any given point in the memory task, the less the residual capacity he could devote to the RT task, and the longer his RT to a signal occurring at that point should have been. Thus, RT served as an index of expended processing capacity. (EPC). Viewed collectively, the results shed considerable light on EPC during information input (list study) and output (recall). Input processing  was enhanced by learning, list organization, input clarity, low information load, and an imagery memonic. Output processing was enhanced by learning, list organization, low information load, freedom of recall order, recency of input, and high item imagery.

The subjects were 147 fifth graders from two schools within a middle-class community. Obvious, remote and flexible divergent thinking were measured by three tests selected from Guilford's battery. The risk taking situations involved a game of chance and an academic task. Obvious divergent thinking correlated significantly and positively with academic risk taking, while remote and flexible divergency correlated with it significantly and  negatively. With academic risk taking as the dependent variable, IQ accounted for 13% of the variance. There were no statistically significant relationships between any of the variables studied and risk taking in a game of chance. The findings add additional support to Guilford's research in that they suggest that semantic divergency is not one-dimensional. It is composed of obvious, remote, and flexible factors. (Author)",

The students were assigned to classes of approximately equal size by a computer on the basis of remaining space. The mean I.Q. scores for the class sections were compared as a partial check of the assumption that assignment was unbiased. The results of this investigation showed that: the proportion of learners who successfully acquired both subordinate informational concepts, A & B, did not  differ significantly between treatment through written programmed learning material concerning on one day and material B on the next day versus treatment of written programmed material of A & B on the same day.

It was constructed to measure behavior as it is rated by other group members and attitude as it is rated by the individual. The Tennessee Self-Concept Scale (TSCS) was the second instrument used to measure attitude. All subjects received a classroom lecture for two hours and then divided into four discussion groups for one hour. The subjects were randomly assigned to the  discussion groups and the experimental treatment of direct formalized feedback was randomly assigned to two of these groups: All groups were given a pre-test during their second meeting and a post-test during their twelfth meeting.

The basic approach used for this study was one of designing a study that would experimentally obtain data on how disadvantaged students used and responded to selected student services. It was thought that data obtained in this manner would more directly relate to the interests of the Office of Education and student personnel workers. In the end, a series of generalizations were developed which could help individuals in a wide range of settings and positions. These generalizations included the following: 1) Discussion of the types of research approaches to be used; 2) Reconceptualization of the focus of disadvantaged research; 3) Strategies for  the elimination of &quot;Disadvantagedness&quot;; 4) Implications for the student personnel worker.

        "description":"The relationship between parental preferences and school functioning in 10 elementary schools in the Boston Public School System was analyzed. The educational preferences of 400 parents were determined through survey research methods. School functioning at the 10 schools was determined by classroom observation, interviews, and written questionnaires. While a moderate relationship between parental preferences and school functioning was found across the 10 schools in educational methods, none was found in educational content. Analysis of the process of responsiveness and parental attempts to alter school functioning indicated that responsiveness of school functioning to parental preferences is greatly limited within the school system. Non-responsiveness was found to be a function  of the inability of parents to organize for collective action, the inability of principals to influence teachers, the power of senior teachers to select their school, the lack of perceptual accuracy of teachers about parents and their educational preferences, and the lack of legitimacy many parents, teachers, and principals hold for parental influence over teacher behavior.

An outline is presented of the development of the law concerning the authority of local boards of education, the reasonableness of specific rules and regulations, the exercise of suspension and expulsion, and the need for schools to adopt reasonable rules and disciplinary policies which will stand-up under court review. An attempt is also made to suggest alternate strategies for dealing with misbehaving and disruptive students to replace the ubiquitous use of suspension and expulsion. Topics covered include (1) the 'in loco parentis' doctrine; (2) regulation of children's activities; (3) freedom of speech; (4) the consitutional applications; (5) dress and appearance  regulations; (6) marriage and pregnancy, and (7) the right to a hearing prior to suspension or expulsion. Part II deals with the juvenile court process. In view of the high percentage of juvenile delinquency charges based on school truancy, incorrigibility and misbehavior in school, the author believes that school personnel should be aware of significant procedural changes in the juvenile court procedure.

The premise that urban schools exist to teach children the three R's seems inaccurate in the face of evidence that many low income and minority group children are not reading at acceptable grade levels. The appropriateness of the medical diagnostic model in an educational setting seems suspect considering educators' lack of agreement in classifying behavior coupled with their tendency to project varying frames of reference upon the behavior they report. The deficit model of instruction for \"disadvantaged\" youth overlooks both teachers' errors in assessing the language production of children and the possibility that existing school environments might neither elicit the language production nor  promote the language development of all children. Finally, though a visual perception deficit is often cited as a major cause of reading failure, some research indicates no difference between the success rate of retarded readers with perceptual deficits and those with none.

During the first year large group techniques were used in directing exercises in vocabulary development, critical reading, and grammar fundamentals. Small group work became possible in the second year with the addition of a graduate assistant who gave considerable help to the poorest readers. The difficulty of motivating more nearly &quot;average&quot; students prompted complete individualization of instruction during the third year, while the fourth year featured structuring of the grading system and  institution of student records of daily progress. Data indicate that significant improvement occurred during the first and third years in vocabulary, comprehension, and total reading achievement; statistically non-significant positive changes occurred during the second year.

Other objectives included an examination of transfer effects of perceptual motor training on reading achievement, an analysis of characteristics of children likely to experience success under a given treatment, and an analysis of the relationships among the variables studied. Ranked by age and reading achievement, subjects were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: PMT, IRRI, and  general activity (placebo control). Training consisted of five 35-minute sessions per week for six months, and pre- and post-tests were administered. Conclusions derived from an analysis of the data are: (1) PMT did not transfer to reading performance, (2) long term IRRI was more effective than PMT in developing reading achievement and adjustable school behavior.

Diagnosis, though important, cannot consume most of the teacher's time. At the beginning of the year the teacher may ascertain a child's instructional reading level by consulting school records and by administering informal reading inventories and teacher-made exercises. Further, the child's basic area of weakness should be assessed, though his strong skills should be utilized in improving weak areas. During ensuing learning experiences notations about the  pupil's reading performance should be made, perhaps on 3x5 cards for periodic summary on a profile card. Teachers hesitant about full commitment to complete individualization can increase the flexibility of their instruction by offering a considerable number of independent activities for the majority of the class, freeing themselves to work with smaller groups. All pupils deserve opportunities to spend time in reading widely--regardless of their reading proficiency. (Author/RD)",

Comparison of word lists can in turn lead to compilation of new lists based on specific requirements for various purposes. The program can also be utilized to research word associations, to score responses to programmed material, and to determine the comprehensibility of textual passages.

It is stated that a child cannot become proficient in reading if he does not master the skill of associating printed letter symbols with the sounds they represent. Instructional procedures which augment the alphabet with letters and involve respelling of words are, it is suggested, confusing, and the claims of proponents of this methodology are contradictory. Another instructional approach creates dependency on charts for translations of letter to color to sound. A linguistic method rests on the assumption that a child should learn initially only those words which have regular spellings, thus neglecting 61% of 5000 basic vocabulary words with irregular  spellings. Programmed reading materials have the advantage of allowing students to work at their own pace, but are lacking in emphasis on reading as a meaning-making activity. Over emphasis on word analysis skills can lead the student to resist reading for meaning or enjoyment. It is concluded that word analysis skills are necessary to reading ability and should therefore be taught systematically, but that reading for meaning and enjoyment should be given equal emphasis.

Child language begins with single word utterances to name things or to express needs and feelings. With a two-word utterance, the child can describe relationships more precisely: he has a \"topic\" of conversation and a modifying \"comment.\" He begins to use the linguistic conventions of intonation and stress to define meaning. The child then begins to add grammatical structures to his language, and mastering the simpler structures before the more complex. The child is able to make generalizations about the language he hears and is able to form structural descriptions or rules spontaneously. By school age  the child possesses a vocabulary of 2,000-3,000 words, and he can generate a variety of types of sentences. His language continues to become more precise and rich. The most important linguistic development from kindergarten on is the acquisition of more and more complete descriptions of relationships within and between sentences.

Memory of material read is enhanced when the learner utilizes structures inherent in the text and his own subjective schema, cognitive maps, and knowledge structures. Periodic review assures retention of information, and cultivation and utilization of \"prompts\" aid in its recall. The immediate means for studying problems of information storage and retrieval is the resource unit, but the concept of such a unit needs to be developed in terms of the individual student's  information needs.

Though the role of the black reading specialist includes all the tasks of the typical reading specialist, the black reading specialist has the following additional major responsibilities: (1) becoming more involved in the activities and functions of the major reading organizations, (2) contributing to research efforts to discover better ways of teaching disadvantaged children to read, (3) recruiting and training black potential reading specialists, (4) working with community groups and agencies, and (5) serving as consultants to local school districts  and institutions of higher learning. The black reading specialist should attempt to work within existing organizations (reading, college, community) to strengthen the black role in these organizations. Special interest groups within organizations such as the International Reading Association could, it is suggested, help pool resources of black reading specialists. Black college students, particularly males, should be encouraged to go into the field of reading. (References are included.) (AL)",

An understanding of the respect for the learner's cultural and behavioral patterns can establish group empathy, instrumental as a base for enlarging oral and written communication. Rather than deprecating the learner's dialect, the teacher should be familiar enough with it to know when corrections are called for and when they are not. By capitalizing on the dialect both semantically and syntactically, the teacher can broaden the learner's comprehension skills; furthermore, by using reading materials which reflect the needs of the learner, the teacher can increase  the learner's willingness to use his language as a more effective means of communication. The teacher should be reminded of the importance of the learner's understanding and use of context clues in developing strategies appropriate to the nature of the materials on hand and for unlocking ideas in print--both of which lead to the successful completion of reading tasks.

The first guideline urges the teacher to remember that reading necessitates a total complex thinking process, one which will prevent persisting at one level of instruction longer than is necessary. Secondly, students should be encouraged to read at levels appropriate for them and be engaged in activities that will involve them in a greater percentage of actual reading. Furthermore, to keep students from comparing themselves with each other, the teacher should define success so that students have a sense of achievement derived from their individual rates of progress. At the same time, the class should be told the reason for a given activity so that it  can share responsibility for learning with the teacher. Another guideline stresses the importance of the language experience approach (e.g., relating reading to real life problems), so that students can use their everyday environment to generate their own reading and look to books as a means by which they can solve some of their problems. It is hoped that with the direct application of these various guidelines, day to day decisions about specific methodologies can be more effective and consistent, and reading skills strengthened.

Consequently, teachers should be free to select materials and methods most appropriate for children for whom they are responsible. In planning instruction so that the child's reading development phases with his over-all development, the teacher should keep several basic considerations in mind: (1) Development and maintenance of a positive self-image are vital to the child's academic growth as well as to his personality development. (2) Children differ in their preferred sensory modes of learning. (3) Programmed materials do not provide  opportunities for a child to question, share ideas, react to situations, or test ideas on others. (4) Some research indicates that differences in interest patterns are more important to reading development than those of age, sex, intelligence, or reading achievement. Providing properly for that difference involves both presenting materials which match the child's interests and those capable of broadening and advancing them. (Author/RD)",

To avoid the destructive syndrome of wasted time and unnecessary rote review, the teacher should assign each child reading materials on the basis of his achievement level (rather than his grade level) and, using a criterion-referenced reading system, concentrate on those particular skills which the child has not yet mastered. This can be accomplished by designing tests and lessons for each specific reading objective--the teacher should initiate instruction only after first having ascertained what each child does not know.

Vocabulary can be developed by using all the communication processes: reading, writing, speaking, listening, visualizing, and observing; and vocabulary deserves emphasis throughout elementary and secondary grades. Though language inheritance, background, and competencies are outgrowths of out-of-school factors, attempts must be made to compensate for deficiencies of these sorts when encountered. Because children learn words individually and in relation to personal conceptual systems, vocabulary instruction should be viewed as concept building. Thus the generative potential of words, the  commonality of roots, prefixes, and suffixes, and the utility of given words in numerous contexts should be emphasized.

In spite of this increase, the average number of literal questions and responses remained the same in the 1960's as in the 1930's. Also noted was that in all  materials except one, the actual number of vocabulary responses increased greatly. This analysis of materials appears to reflect the more recent emphasis on critical comprehension; nevertheless, literal comprehension questions still account for approximately 50% of the total number of comprehension questions surveyed. (Appended are a reference list and tables indicating percentages of literal and critical responses.) (HS)",

Built on the premise that erudition should be an extension of the search for self-knowledge, both units involved the students in a general discussion of how aggression (or death) is apparent in our daily lives and analyzed the ways in which we cope with these problems. Following the reading of a specially prepared article (e.g., high interest, low vocabulary), as well as more literary articles for information on the topic, a reading guide was used to further language skills and an understanding of the issues. Group discussion and student interviews with the author of the special article encouraged a deeper analysis of the  subject. Finally, the students were asked to complete one of five possible independent projects. An initial evaluation of the unit on Aggression showed the need for more student participation; consequently a \"Think and Do\" section (involving questions and activities) was added to the unit on Death. It was generally felt that a discussion of any topic works best by looking first to the needs of the students, and then to the available materials. (HS)",

Subsequently, the preparation the teacher gives students before they view the programs and the activities into which he leads them after the viewing can deepen both enjoyment and learning; but the teacher must be flexible enough to capitalize upon potentially fruitful though unexpected turns in class activity. Such projects as creative dramatization, newspaper analysis, puppetry, and poetry composition have engaged the interest and talents of elementary school children whose class work has been planned in conjunction with  educational television programs.

S's were 27 second graders (1-10 years, mean IQ 116) and 29 fourth graders (9-11 years, mean IQ 107) randomly selected from Natick, Massachusetts, schools: all possessed middleclass families, spoke a standard dialect, and had received adequate reading instruction. White's Free-Sorting Classification Task and replications of items from Rigney's pictorial test of cognitive development were utilized in the experiment.  Results indicated that good classifiers tend to be good readers and that poor readers tend to be preoperational. A child having problems grouping pictures according to varying criteria or dealing with part-whole relationships within a set of categories might have difficulty classifying the letter-sound generalizations necessary for efficient reading.

In a highly mobile community of 75 per cent Appalachian background and generally low level of education, 70-80 per cent of the children tested below grade level on standardized tests. The program had two primary goals: (1) to aid teachers in current and future identification and prevention of reading and learning disabilities, and (2) to increase the achievement level of students in areas of interdisciplinary science-math. Aspects of the contract program included hiring a specially trained teacher and teacher aides, remodeling a classroom, inservice teacher education, and initiation of individually prescribed instruction based on  standardized test results. The study compared a group under the contract system and a group in the regular instructional program. Comparison was made using results from a battery of achievement, intelligence, and self-appraisal tests. The results of the tests showed that the contract program was not considered a success in the lower elementary grades, but was successful in the upper elementary grades. Further evaluation was suggested before recommendations for the future of the program were considered. (Tables of data included.) (AL)",

Data was collected by means of two self-report instruments, i.e., the Coppersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (SEI) and the San Diego County Inventory of Reading Attitude (IRA). Each of the twenty-one classes used was tested within a three week period. Findings demonstrated that: (1) a child's attitude toward reading is positively related to self-esteem, (2) perceptions boys have of themselves in relation to peers and parents seem less related to their attitude  toward reading than do their general and academic self-esteem, (3) correlations are highly significant at the fifth grade level, and (4) for each sex and at each grade level the child's self-awareness in the academic setting is related to his attitude toward reading.

Three self-report interest scales and a peer interest rating were administered in a pretest post-test format. The results indicated only slight attitude change as an effect of the teaching techniques employed in this program. Generally, the workshops seemed to produce more favorable attitudes than lectures; however, having both lectures and workshops together was less effective than either alone. Moreover, initial reactions as well as attitude change were more favorable toward acting than any other performing art. The author suggests that acting and workshops produce more favorable responses  because of the direct physical and emotional involvement inherent in the two forms.

Initially, the reviewer analyzes the participation question as an element in the \"individual vs organization\" dichotomy, following which various statements by writers on participation are scrutinized. The author shows that the terms employed by these writers fit a polarity of organization description that can be labeled \"mechanistic vs organic.\" A discussion of this polarity ensues, emphasizing (1) the value orientations involved and (2) the facts derived from research findings.

The next presentation deals with the critical factors required to implement project management capability in a school district, and examines the advantages and limitations of project management and the uses of project management in a public relations function. The final presentation emphasizes the kinds of information needed to support organizational modification in a local school district. One important consideration is the premise that major  change in school districts must be supported by an organizational structure that facilitates the communication flows and the human interactions necessary to implement change.

This paper discusses human relations in both its broader as well as in its narrower focus. In human relations, the problems that develop are fairly consistently a function of emotions, and in the area of emotional issues, the school board must assume a leadership role. Unfortunately, the problems of prejudice complicate the task of school boards and administrators in developing effective programs to deal with human relations. However, in dealing with prejudice, boards should (1) acknowledge the limitations of people and the role of prejudice; (2) assure the system of good management and effective supervisory practices; (3) acknowledge the power of expectations, particularly in the  area of human relations; and (4) become involved in whatever programs are developed. Specific examples of various approaches to the problem used in several different human relations programs are cited, and the paper closes by providing some guidelines for dealing with the \"gap\" of understanding between people.(Author)",

The analysis focused on identifying some of the social processes that operate to produce resistance to educational innovations reflecting social change. The paper focuses on those changes reflecting the transformation of the learning process. Innovations implemented in the Eastport schools reflect the local school's vulnerability to extra-local influences. Parent resistance to these changes were found to be a reflection of the tendency to adhere to expectations formed through previous group identification and socialization. The author suggests that maintenance of the traditional  school-parent role relationship at the local level, with professional domination of authority, is inconsistent with the changes that have occurred in the district and with the expectation of active parent participation required in the modern learning process.

        "description":"This paper analyzes the relative impacts that geographic and social class differences have on the participation rates in a country's educational programs. The author reasons that while regional disparities are common in many countries and differences between rural and urban areas are large, socioeconomic distributions account for most of the regional variation in school attendance. The paper indicates that rates of educational participation are directly related to social class and that upper strata youth are highly over-represented, especially in higher education. The author concludes that even if disparities in participation were to narrow or to disappear, differences in kinds and quality of education would create gaps in education equally as important as those now observed with  regard to participation.

        "description":"One of the strongest common assumptions in most Western societies is that education is the key to upward mobility. The few studies to the contrary have been easily dispensed with by reference to flaws in theory or methodology. It is only when an attempt is made to fit some of the key pieces from various areas together (to focus particularly on consistency among a variety of findings) that doubts about the adequacy of this assumption begin to emerge. This paper is an effort to juxtapose pieces of evidence from several areas of the economics of education. The paper argues that there is still substantial doubt about important aspects of our understanding of the role of education in society. Further research needs to be accomplished before the role of education in social and economic  change is fully understood. Related documents are ED 057 470 and EA 004 427. (Author/RA)",

Since absence is an important aspect of productivity, it is important to understand better the dynamics of absence. Absence could be conceptualized as contractual relationships within a social exchange framework. Within that framework, collective legitimacy and organizational attachment appear as promising explanatory concepts. The type and the length of absence are seen as indicators of legitimacy, while frequency of absence is seen as an indicator of attachment. The findings are consistent with the proposed sociological formulation and suggest that rules and regulations may confirm rather than initiate patterns of  absence behavior. (Author)",

The Center for the Study of Evaluation confronted this problem and produced the CSE Elementary School Evaluation KIT: Needs Assessment as a partial solution (see ED 058 673.) Within the framework of the KIT, the need for school norms and that of accounting for various demographic differences between schools arose. By using a multiple regression approach, six demographic variables were singled out as important predictors of achievement on a standardized test (the SCAT). Using these variables to create 64 school types, percentile correction factors were determined by using once again the regression technique. The problem of converting a school score to a school  percentile with only a norm table for individuals was also studied, and a procedure for converting a percentile score from an individual's norm table to a school percentile was outlined. This procedure was based on successive average of the ratios of variability between school scores and individual scores as reported in the technical manual of these tests. (Author)",

Four training programs in the areas of curriculum development and the design and conduct of local educational change programs are under development and test. Each area includes one short term program (6-week institute) and one long term program (two or three years). This document--an introduction to the training program--is followed by five papers that focus on the program of training in the design and conduct of local educational change programs. (For three of these papers see EA 004 409-411.)

        "description":"To develop the methodology of designing local educational change, the R & D center staff first identified four critical weaknesses leading to the failures of changes attempted in schools. These weaknesses were categorized as (1) change made without prior analysis of its effects on the whole system, (2) change imposed externally without regard to specific local needs, (3) change made for the sake of change without regard to fundamental reform, and (4) no organism within the system with specific responsibility for the design and maintenance of the change. Independently, a multicomponent closed system was modified to work within the system model to prevent the critical faults from occurring. The modification resulted in an 11-step task flow. Finally, packages of interpersonal,  analytical, and information-gathering skills were developed to aid the change specialist in performing the tasks. This paper describes the development of the task flow. Related documents are EA 004 408, EA 004 410, and EA 004 411. (Author)",

Current schooling often involves inappropriate learning goals, ineffectual curricular and instructional materials, discriminatory organization for instruction, and authoritarian and hostile social/emotional school climates. The participants in the training programs concerned with local educational change were introduced to the concerns for relevance as related to teaching problem-solving thinking, stressing personal/social development, organizing and conducting instruction for mastery of learning tasks, and individualizing instruction. The training programs stressed that  students, instructional staff, administrative staff, and community members should be involved in the developmental, the implementation, and the evaluate stages of the local educational programs. The long term program offered intensive training for leadership in designing and conducting change programs meant to increase the relevance of instruction offered inner-city children.

The content of the three programs is consistent with the theoretical and methodological bases for designing local educational change programs as described by Simonds and St. Lawrence (1972). The developed units reflect a heavy reliance on readings and lecture/discussion sessions. Individualization and relevance have been attained through the use of individual conferences, job-related projects, and practicum  experiences. The weaknesses of long term university-based programs have been partially overcome by making students productive before they finish their formal instructional program and by recruiting students with some professional experience in education. The employers who were financially supporting the participants in the short term programs were assured of an immediate payoff if they allowed their \"employee-trainees\" to implement their program-developed proposals on the job.

This early influence of social class affects dropout and enrollment rates in higher education and subsequent occupational opportunities. The author examines the relative influence of genetic, social, and school factors on school achievement. The author's investigation reveals that genetic factors account for the greatest amount of variation in achievement, social background explains the next greatest amount, and that school variables explain a relatively small amount of the variation in academic achievement. The major conclusion is that education, rather than erasing genetic and class differences, reinforces them, thereby  reinforcing differences in occupational opportunities.

(VIQ) and Performance I.Q. (PIQ) scores: a high performance-low verbal group, a verbal equal to performance group, and a high verbal-low performance group. The three groups were equated for age and Full Scale I.Q. The performance of these subjects on selected measures of verbal, auditory perceptual, visual perceptual, problem solving, motor, and psychomotor abilities did not yield the same clear cut differences observed in previous studies with older (9 to 14 year old) children with learning disabilities who had been divided into groups on the basis of VIQ-PIQ discrepancies of an  identical magnitude. The results of this study argue for very guarded clinical interpretation of VIQ-PIQ discrepancies of this magnitude in the case of younger children with learning disabilities. (Author)",

Findings are results of individual monaural pure-tone air-conduction audiometric tests, conducted as part of the Health Examination Survey of 1963-65. In the survey 7,119 children were examined as representatives of the American child population. Survey findings were limited to test results for the better ear. Detailed statistical results in relation to selected demographic and socioeconomic characteristics were provided in terms of the 1951-American Standard Association reference values. No consistent pattern of differences between white and Negro children was found. White children were found to have  better hearing on the average than Negro children at the middle of the test range. In general, children living in the South were found to have somewhat less sensitive hearing, while children from the West had more sensitive hearing. No pattern of differences between urban and rural children was reported. The major significant finding was that hearing sensitivity increased with parent education and family income. (CB)",

Seven ways of using the learning wall are discussed; these  include conventional, viewing of movie or slides, touch response in which the child identifies part of a projected picture by touching that part to develop body image, a stick-on technique which enables the child to superimpose pictures on a projected background picture (like a large flannel board), drawing on the screen surface with felt tipped pens, reflection in which the child sees a reflection of himself or an object, light beam projections, and three-dimensional pictures used in rear projection.

The project report was divided into four major sections: review of literature on current theories of mental retardation and cognitive functioning, and evidence on learning disabilities and performance and behavior variance of children classified as retarded; presentation of research methodology used; presentation of clinical data based on evaluations of children and  teachers the first year and remediation attempts during the second year; presentation of selected portions of group data; and summary and conclusions. Representative major findings of the study were that almost half of the 48 children scored higher on the Stanford Binet Intelligence Test than was thought possible, that learning disabilities frequently consisted of multiple, not single, intellectual dysfunctions, and that some children did not show a pre-established hierarchical order of skills.

The model was reported to provide an explanation for the relationship between handedness and specific learning disability, and handedness and cerebral dominance for speech. The model stated that the incidence of PLH will increase as a function of early brain injury. It was demonstrated that the ratio of PLH to pathological right-handedness was independent of the magnitude of the value of manual switch. The two hypotheses which could not be tested involved the manual switch value and the relationship of the incidence of familial sinistrality, in pathological left-handedness groups, to that in normal  right-handed control groups. Hypotheses said to be tentatively proven focused on the probability of brain lesion in the left hemisphere if the subject is left-handed and is retarded or epileptic, the probability that such a person is a pathological left-hander, the incidence of manifest left-handedness in brain-injured populations with perinatal or early post-natal injury, and the incidence of pathological left-handedness in comparison to that of natural left-handedness.

The most important results were as follows: the performances of the young normal, old normal, and old brain damaged groups were superior to that of the young brain damaged group; there was no significant differences between the performance of the old normal and the old brain damaged groups; the set index formula was not more effective in differentiating between the performance of the young brain damaged and young normal groups or between the young brain damaged and old brain damaged groups than were other, more easily  derived, indices. The results of the current investigation were highly similar to those obtained in previous studies which employed visual reaction time procedures (Czudner & Rourke, 1970, 1972). The results of all of these studies support the contention that, with advancing years, brain damaged children of the type used in the present study may adapt to and/or recover from the deficit(s) involved in the inability to develop and maintain a state of readiness to respond.

Follett, who suggests that selection of tools may be simplified by understanding the uniqueness of the individual learner and his educational needs. Frank C. Stuart then recommends the use of closed circuit television in higher education courses, especially courses required of a large number of students. Television as an effective educational device for utilization in the teaching-learning process is discussed by Henry Hubinger.  John A.

It is thought that the handicapped child may show more creative behavior and may become increasingly more self-regulative and internally controlled in the open classroom than in the traditional rigid classroom. The project described involves examination of six open classrooms in a neighborhood of Philadelphia. The classrooms are all located in an inner city neighborhood. Children were  observed for about 5 hours; their activities and duration of activities were recorded. It was found that a major portion of each hour in the open classroom is spent in peer interaction. Successful children were found to spend almost one-sixth of their time participating in academically-related activities and conversations with their peers.

The possibility of some central nervous system dysfunction is thought to be the major etiological factor for the majority of the children. Principles and procedures are based on behavior change principles and reinforcement theory. Topics discussed include discriminative stimulus, reinforcing stimulus, recording progress, trials, experimental approaches, reversal, baseline, use of consequences, use of tokens, time out from positive reinforcement, antecedent events, programing stimuli, stimulus support, and  modifying social interaction. Illustrative case studies are presented throughout the report. Emphasis is on the application of an experimental approach to the modification of language behavior. The role of recent research in language acquisition as well as the relationship of the language training to the social environment is questioned and discussed. (Author/CB)",

General program goals are identification of gifted students, a humanities oriented curriculum, a structure permitting much student discussion, child development, and a continuous  program evaluation. Fifteen fourth grade students were chosen for the program. The children studied the ancient cultures of the Greeks, the Romans, and the Judeo-Christians and focused on three basic principles of Athenian humanism, the Roman concept of rule by law, and the Judeo-Christian idea of brotherly love. Various academic, social, and personal learning activities are described. Concluding the report is a section on necessary resources and their allocation. (For related studies, see also EC 042 227-9.)

Additional findings were that children from the South and West had better binocular visual acuity at distance and near than children from the Northeast and Midwest. Also,  visual acuity at distance and near tended to be better among white than Negro children in the Northeast and Midwest but the reverse in the South and West. Children living in rural areas were found to have better visual acuity at distance and near than did their peers living in urban communities.

It is noted that there is little, if any, research indicating the superiority of graduate training over undergraduate training. The need for program changes is mentioned, followed by a statement that recent trends in mental health services available to children suggest that an undergraduate training program can train students for a variety of roles from classroom teacher to community mental health worker. A special problem of undergraduate programs is thought to be the provision of a variety of experiences sufficiently long and intense. The proposed model for undergraduate training is described to  consist of 4 calendar years, to involve careful screening and selection of students, to provide financial assistance, to entail extensive practice situations, to have competent staff, and to evaluate the program.

The method involves breathing control and attention training which employs biofeedback and operant conditioning principles designed to help the child develop control over excessive and distracting motor behaviors and maintain attention in learning situations. Since breathing records are highly sensitive to numerous behaviors relevant to the desired behavior pattern in learning settings, the use of respiration as a focal behavior in the training procedures sharply reduce the number of simple motor behaviors requiring monitoring and reinforcement in comparison to the typical behavior modification program. Six children (age 6 to 8  years old) from a private school for children with learning disabilities participated in the study. Three were assigned to a group given the breathing control and attention training and three were assigned to a control group. Measures obtained before, during, and after training included respiration indices, performance, attention and vigilance test scores, and teacher ratings of classroom behaviors. The study was concluded to be successful. (Author)",

The ERIC Clearinghouse on Vocational and Technical Education has been trying to develop an effective information network within that field by developing information resources, producing a guide to information systems, conducting a user study, and administering training workshops. In so doing, it has discovered several problems. 1) The vast audience of practitioners at the local level are unfamiliar with ERIC, although they are spending a lot of time seeking information and are dissatisfied with their results. 2) Information products are frequently in the wrong form. Teachers like journals and magazines, but researchers prefer original reports.  3) ERIC products are not reaching the local practitioners. 4) Information users need training in ERIC, as do information specialists who want to serve these users. Commitment to developing an information dissemination system at state and local levels is lacking.

As an exploratory investigation of these hypotheses and also to explore the feasibility of instructional metacommunication, instructors in a team-taught graduate course in self-directed learning had students develop behavioral objectives for improved interpersonal  communication, and elicited feedback about the effectiveness of their communication behavior after lecture-discussions.

The independent variables in the study were message sidedness, evidence, counterpersuasion in a small group setting, and source credibility. The subjects, 518 college students enrolled in a basic communication course, were randomly assigned by class to the 16 experimental conditions, and then  further randomly assigned within each class to three discussion groups. Each discussion group in the counterpersuasion condition was assigned a confederate to insure that counterpersuasion would be introduced in the small group setting. Pretest attitudinal questionnaires were administered, and both immediate and delayed posttest measures of attitude change were obtained after presentation of the persuasive message.

An investigation of semantic principles as they are applied in industry today shows that although Korzybski's emphasis on differences between objects and individuals may have been useful when first formulated, it is less useful today than stress on similarities. Also, problems of &quot;future shock&quot; seen in industry mean that generalists, who can see the whole of a problem, are vitally needed. Such a unified view is hard to achieve in an educational system which too often fragments rather than synthesizes the many aspects of an issue. For instance, some conventional and widely-accepted behaviorists fail to recognize the importance of language. But language is unique in  facilitating any communal relationship, from small groups to complex industries. Therefore, managerial semantics, which brings together various disciplines that have a bearing on management, is one way to provide the synthesized training needed in industry today. (JK)",

In any approach to analyzing communication networks, the following concepts would appear to be important: the communication structure, the communication load, the rate of message flow, the amount of redundancy, the efficiency of the actual pathways of messages, the extent of message distortion, and the different pathways of messages according to their different functions. Five different approaches--the duty study, the use of observers, the cross-sectional interview, the \"small world\" technique, and the study of the diffusion of selected messages--each offer distinct  advantages and disadvantages for measuring the different concepts in communication networks. It is only once we know how the organization is currently responding to its environment that we can make recommendations about how it might respond more effectively. Of the above approaches to analyzing the system, the message diffusion approach seems to be most suitable for collecting data relating to almost all of the concepts that are central to evaluation.

This training should help the student focus on the message receiver. Using behavioral objectives means creating criteria of competency. Until experimental efforts yield empirical data needed to establish these, carefully thought-out subjective judgments must be used. If  behavioral objectives have been established, greater flexibility in choosing methods to reach those objectives will be allowed. (JK)",

However, studies using more complex learning tasks have suggested that delays of up to at least a day actually benefit learning. A study was designed to investigate the optimal feedback delay for different types of mathematical material in an undergraduate mathematics course taught by CAI. The results indicated that immediate feedback was not superior to delayed feedback, although the optimal delay is very much dependent on the type of material involved. The more complex the material to be learned is, the shorter is the feedback delay which can  be tolerated without a decrement in retention. Thus, the implication of this study was that time-shared CAI systems need no longer be concerned about the resulting delays in input-output processes. (RH)",

A pretest and posttest evaluated by means of an eye camera the subject's use of his eyes, recall tests were given at the end of each learning trial, several  standard ability measures were administered, and demographics were obtained. Results showed that pictorial supported audio-visual associative learning is superior to printed word supported learning, and that adding eye movement variables to prediction equations using more conventional predictors greatly increases the amount of variance accounted for.

However, while these capabilities are or perhaps will soon be technologically feasible, the cost of implementing these services may be prohibitive. The main question to consider in relation to cable's unique and practical capabilities is the sorts of services that can be made to pay for themselves, given the high costs of the  necessary terminal equipment for home and possible business use. Some factors which must be taken account of in approaching this problem are the potential &quot;critical mass&quot; problems of two-way hookups, the possibility that subscribers will not use services offered, and our lack of experience for determining how best some of the services can be provided.

The paper is written on with a pencil that goes with the tableau, and the visual information is transformed into narrow banded signals which are sent simultaneously with a verbal explanation by normal longwave radio transmitters. Visual and verbal information are thus transmitted across long distances at very low cost and can be received by normal radio and television receivers with special adapter. The tele-blackboard was designed for instruction in developing countries. It requires prior preparation of short, well organized teaching phases and high concentration by the pupils, while at the same time releasing the teacher from the anxiety of being on television.  Other advantages offered by the tele-blackboard are the opportunity its use provides to develop original and modern forms of fundamental education, the reduction of loss of information which verbal information alone is subject to (particularly when the language used in the presentation is a second language for the students), and the capacity for producing dynamic content and concepts.

Personal contact questionnaires were also completed for 844 contact nominations. Reciprocated contacts were  entered into matrices by content-function so that groups and liaison agents could be identified. Results of analyses of the data showed that liaisons perceived themselves to have more contacts, to possess more potential influence and more information about the organization, to possess more control over message flow, to feel that the work situation was more open, and to feel more satisfied with the management communication system.

From these, four listening personalities were conceptualized and a composite ideal listening personality defined.

If not actual experience, then visual experience through television can provide a good view into the perspective of other cultures. Television has an obligation to provide education of this sort, particularly for the ghetto child who has the intelligence and potential to learn, but is held back by our print-oriented educational process. The mass media must be convinced to provide a socializing situation for the child, and to provide the problems of the real world as the learning problem. Further, this sort of education or communication should be also intended for adults, both advantaged and disadvantaged, so that understanding will be  increased. The first task, however, is to make a dent in the hopelessness that ghettoized Blacks--to bring some bit of reality, as opposed to the oft-broken promises, to the dream that there is some hope for their children. If television has shown the suburban promised land, it also seems necessary that television could show people how to reach that land. (SH)",

        "description":"The results of a comparison of television programming for children in the United States, Canada, Japan, and the democracies of Western Eruope are presented. It was found that: in European countries no advertiser is allowed to sponsor a children's program, almost none of these programs carries commercials, and except in Italy, no host of a children's program can make any type of TV commercials. The networks have either individual children's departments or coordinators of regional children's departments; these departments make about 58 percent of the children's programs shown. For Canada, the United States, and Japan, only the United States has no weekday afternoon network children's program; only the U.S. has more advertising on afternoon children's programs than on adult evening  programs; the U.S. carries at least twice as much advertising on these programs as do Canada or Japan. Other differences noted also point to deficiencies of U.S. programming for children. Appendixes discuss children's programming in Australia and present charts and figures which summarize the data.

        "description":"A Statistical Experiment Simulator (STEXSIM) has been developed which permits one to stimulate on a digital computer a wide range of experimental environments. As a teaching aid in applied statistics, it provides a means for an instructor to define a completely crossed factorial model with up to seven fixed or random main effects, three two-factor interactions, and one three-factor interaction. A student designs an experiment which probes this model in order to draw appropriate inferences. STEXSIM reads the design and &quot;conducts&quot; the experiment he has specified providing the resultant &quot;observations&quot; which the student then analyzes. This report discusses in detail the program including input specifications and output interpretation. Sufficient detail is presented to permit one to  use the model himself. (STEXSIM is programed in FORTRAN IV.) The report also describes the formulation, execution, and analysis of 30 &quot;student&quot; experiments run using seven different &quot;instructor&quot; models.

From the replies four types of electronic technology were identified: electronic piano studios, electronic music studios, computer-assisted music instruction, and modular training stations. Thirty music schools were visited. Schools in which electronic activity was well known were not visited, but a bibliography of published material documents their efforts. IT was found that schools visited were not availing themselves of the opportunities offered by these new technologies. Electronic music was confined to only its own area in the curriculum and had yet to make an impact on other  courses. The investigator states that sooner or later educators must design a training rationale which incorporates electronics in training and electronic music in the tradition concepts and procedures.

        "description":"Two studies attempted to determine whether a programed instruction booklet on a task in algebra would be more effective if the units in the program were presented in a sequence suggested by a hierarchical analysis of the task than if units were presented in a reverse or a random sequence. In the first study, a program was made up, based on the Princeton Algebra Program, in which blocks of frames made up units corresponding to the competencies in the hierarchy developed by Gagne and Paradise. Three versions of the program--forward order, reverse order, random order--were used with groups of eighth-graders in a school with a large proportion of disadvantaged students. The results yielded many trends in differences among the three versions of the program, but few were statistically  significant. The second study was a replication using older students from more advantaged background and only the forward and random order programs. The forward version of the program resulted in better performance for the older and more advantaged children than for the younger ones in the first study. The highest retention scores however came from younger, less advantaged subjects who had the random sequence in the first study. These results and other significant findings are discussed in some detail. (JY)",

It should be possible to find that apparently dissimilar social behaviors identified in different social groups can be derived from identical deep social structure underlying representations which have been subjected to culturally or group-specific social interactional transformations. The shape such analyses might take is sketched in broad outline in this paper. (Author/VM)",

Language development proceeds most efficiently, both in functions as well as structure, when motivated by powerful communicative intent. The group instructional environment must be natural and less didactic; it should be possible to maximize familiarity in child-adult relationships and guarantee that the children who need talking time with adults get it.

        "description":"It has been determined by previous studies that student uprisings and demands could not be successful if the college faculty were not in support of the cause. The present study was conducted to verify certain expectations of the author concerning student-faculty relationships and attitudes. In particular, it was expected that faculty and student perceptions of the attitudes and orientations of others would be correlated with their perceptions of institutional functioning and of institutional response to student pressures for change. Specifically, the author expected to find that student and faculty perceptions of institutional functioning and of institutional response to student demands for change would be correlated with: (1) their perceptions of the numerical strength of  various faculty and student types within the institutions under study; (2) student faculty nonprofessional statuses such as politics, sex, and religion; and (3) the faculty and student major field of study. The conclusions reached in this paper are tentative since analyses of the study data are still continuing. (HS)",

In the present study the investigators sought to determine the factors associated with decision and indecision regarding collegiate major and career choice. Thus, the authors developed the Career Decision Readiness Inventory (CDRI), a 36-item questionnaire intended to sample factors previously identified as relevant to decisionmaking behavior. The factors include: need for information, risk-taking propensity, self-confidence, ego involvement with choice, manifest anxiety, independence-dependence, subjective uncertainty, and fear of failure. The CDRI was administered during the summer of 1970 to 1,137 incoming freshmen at the  University of Texas at Austin. The survey revealed that 3 source factors are determinants of student decisionmaking: (1) goal-orientation, or a propensity toward direct concern with the attainment of a career objective; (2) self-orientation, or a propensity to give primacy to attaining increased self-awareness and personal growth; and (3) indecisiveness-orientation, or a propensity to find all types of important decisions difficult to make.

For the purposes of this study, intellectual commitment is defined as an intense and persevering involvement with intellectualism that is manifested by actively pursuing intellectual activities. The investigation focused on the university and the university student, since the university offers a multitude of opportunities for fostering intellectual commitment and the university student is probably developmentally ready to devote himself to something such as intellectualism. The first major hypothesis was strongly  supported. That is, pre-university behavior or behavior in high school is a definite determinant of an individual's intellectual commitment. The second hypothesis was also strongly supported. That is, in addition to pre-university behavior, the university environment, through the influence of the individual's associates, is a determinant of the individual's intellectual commitment.

This can be achieved through the nonresidential school in higher education that emphasizes student-environment interaction. If the nonresidential school is to be a successful alternative to the traditional college campus, the method of representing knowledge for student consumption must reflect advancements in instructional psychology. This approach would require the development of a large body of high-quality curriculum materials known as courseware, and the redefinition of the role of the teacher as a subject-matter expert involved with developing the courseware. With the subject-matter expert at the  head, a team would be organized to develop courseware products that exhibit both efficiency in student time and effectiveness in amount learned and retained. Like the correspondence schools, a student would receive most of his course materials through the mail. A typical package contains a considerable amount of exposition, illustrated by diagrams where necessary. Unit tests and assignments completed by the student are sent to the school to be machine marked or to a correspondence tutor to be personally checked and returned to students. (Author/HS)",

The independent variables in question were: (1) social origin or class, (2) secondary school, (3) university, (4) religious sect, and (5) acceptance (or rejection) and practice (or non-practice) of one's religion. That membership in a religious sect should prove to be the absolutely strongest determinant of political attitudes is no surprise given the specific sociopolitical context of Lebanon. Religion dictates the type of school one will attend, what type of office one may hold, and where, in many cases, one must live. Of minor influence over students' political beliefs is the factor of social class. This is surprising in view of the  influence of religion, but this too may change with time. (HS)",

But there is pressure from public agencies and the public in general for higher education to explore and use these techniques for improved management. The new environment for higher education includes competition with other social programs for funds, an interdependent economic system, and the acceptance of PPBS by federal, state, and local governments, and by business. A PPBS formulation can provide additional insight into program changes by identifying resource requirements and developing costs by program tends to improve understanding of objectives and outputs. Three methods of implementing of PPBS are listed in the present document: planning studies,  evolutionary development of PPBS, and the \"turn-key\" changeover to PPBS. This paper concludes that an institution should begin implementation of PPBS cautiously, but that the PPBS technology would be useful to college administrators in developing their management art.

The experience of higher education must be continuous, dynamic, and active rather than sporadic, static, and passive. Within this context, academic relevance involves a meaningful experience where the student can, in many problem-solving situations, see the clear relationship of what he is asked to do in light of his own goals. Programs must offer a variety of alternatives, which include flexibility of time, flexibility of scheduling, flexibility in the use of space, and flexibility in the use of personnel. Rather than knowledge for the sake of knowledge, special attention and focus must be given to what is now popular known as the affective domain. This stress on the emotional  tone of the student's behavior may be the most difficult task of all because of its affinity to values and the process of valuing. The phenomenon of academic relevance involves a framework of values intimately associated with success and failure. The student who adheres to the norms for a successful experience in higher education is regarded in like measure for his efforts. (HS)",

From these assumptions several implications emerge: (1) it is imperative that a valid theoretical and practical approach for the  training, education, and development of black administrators be conceptualized and implemented; (2) short- and long-range recruitment efforts to increase the supply of black administrators must be mobilized; and (3) training opportunities must be developed or revised that will help prepare young black men and women for the multiple roles that they will be called upon to play.

Students' reasons for using and not using drugs, students' attitudes toward legalizing, using, and selling drugs, as well as the University providing drug related services were also studied. Results indicate that less than half (47%) of the students have used any of the drugs and that evidence of heroin use is minimal (1%). Students use drugs and marijuana for the same reasons (to get high, feel good, and experience things more vividly). Students refrain from using marijuana because of either no desire or its illegality, but refrain  from using drugs because of no desire and potentially harmful effects, both physical and psychological. Students' attitudes indicated strong support for increasing drug-related services at the University, and showed a greater distaste for selling drugs than using them and a greater distaste for hard drugs than for marijuana.

A control group of 8 subjects received no supervision. Supervisory sessions focused on increasing levels of empathic understanding. An analysis of empathy ratings indicated that learning empathy was not contingent upon receiving the preferred mode of supervision. Type of supervision received was a significant factor. Subjects receiving didactic supervision were rated higher in levels of empathy than subjects in other groups. Interaction effect between supervisor and  supervision method was also significant.

The first half of the 1960's witnessed an unprecedented growth in Federal funding of R&amp;D; this growth was followed by a period when funding leveled off and then declined. For 1972, however, the proposed budget for Federal research and development indicates a significant reversal of the downward trend. Agencies other than those concerned with defense, space, and atomic energy are scheduled to obligate 23% of the 1972 R&amp;D total, compared with 9% in 1960. These are agencies that are devoted to health and education services, the reduction of poverty, the improvement of transportation and communication, the prediction of the weather,  better management of crops, forests, livestock, mining, and fisheries, and the preservation of a sound environment. This report is the 20th in an annual series that has recorded the data on which the foregoing trends are based. It provides comprehensive statistical information on the size and scope of Federal obligations for scientific activities and the types of institutions and purposes to which such funds are directed.

More and more institutions of higher education are working together on problems they can no longer solve alone. The strongest reasons for moving away from total independence are: rising demand and runaway costs; the knowledge explosion; the influence of technology; educational and social ferment; and renewed pressures from funding agencies. Most colleges and universities are engaged in voluntary joint ventures of some sort. These range all the way from simple, informal agreements to formal consortia--some with complex structures involving dozens of institutions, millions of dollars, and multiple areas of cooperation. This document presents examples of  programs and experiences in effect at various member institutions of the Academy for Educational Development. It offers ways to provide better and more diversified learning opportunities and services without a corresponding rise in budget.

Admission policies have varied from highly selective to open admissions. Most UWW units have been concerned with students' motivation and life-achievement more than with test scores or academic grades. Each student follows a program tailor-made by the  student and his adviser, who is considered a learner-facilitator. Students use a variety of learning experiences to achieve their objectives: regular course work; internships, apprenticeships, and field experiences; independent study and individual and group projects; programmed material, cassettes, and other technological material.

Critics of foreign study programs feel that the movement for international and intercultural education has expanded too quickly and without proper guidance and supervision. They further feel that intensive evaluation of existing programs is the only way to ascertain that the programs are beneficial to those they serve. Such an evaluation program would become costly if financial and manpower resources are not pooled. Thus, a cooperative venture of several regional accrediting associations is suggested as a means of study abroad program evaluation. Such a venture would not be  looking at the programs as a separate institution to be accredited, but rather as a program within an institution with regard to its management, its effectiveness, and its necessity.

Such a program, called the Experimental Freshman Year Program (EPP), was implemented at the University of California, Davis. The program was housed in a coed dormitory and centered on the theme \"Self in Society,\" Since the desired changes in students were behavioral and attitudinal, a means of evaluation called the Student Orientations Survey (SOS) was developed. The impact that  the EPP had on freshman students is considered highly desirable according to the results of the SOS. Students seem to feel that they were more a part of the learning experience, had purpose in studying other than the reward of a grade, and had achieved a means of organizing thoughts and selves.

Factor scores were obtained on each dimension and all subjects who scored more than a standard deviation above or below the mean were  selected for further analysis.

During the first half of the semester, faculty members lectured on the topic of women, and the second half of the semester was devoted to student reports on special projects and studies. In an evaluation of the course it was decided that the course lacked determined objectives and tried to take into account too much material for the prescribed time. In addition, it was felt that men should be enrolled in the course to encourage a diversity of  student perspectives, and that a wide age differential in participants would be advantageous.

Interms of actual academic reform, the students were more interested in the spirit in which things were done than in specific goals, programs, and structural changes. The students generally felt that the present system would work well as  it is if the people running it were differently motivated--if they oriented programs toward the individual first, last, and foremost.

The author or the present document was asked to carry out a special study and analysis of the employment of women at Stanford University; to review the status of women at all levels of employment; study university policies and procedures that are applicable to this matter; and provide recommendations for policy changes needed to achieve the elimination of sex discrimination in employment actions. On the basis of the findings of the author, it is evident that an affirmative action program must be instituted at Stanford in the very near future. Thus, the author recommends a 20-point affirmative action program that requires an  active recruitment program for women, an assessment of salary levels by sex, and a fair policy for the reappointment and promotion of all faculty members.

It was found that the State is confronted with 2 major problems in planning for the dental manpower supplies that will be required to meet the future care demands of its residents: (1) the geographic maldistribution of private practitioners in the State; and (2) an increasingly greater reliance on out-of-state schools to provide dental training for  future New York practitioners. The first problem, that the majority of dentists living and practicing in the urban communities, could be solved by active recruitment efforts of dental school graduates to outlying areas to attract them to those areas in need of dentists. With regard to the second problem, if out-of-state schools were to adopt admissions policies that would effectively be seriously jeopardized. It is suggested that dental training facilities in the State be expanded to meet the demand for more dentists. (HS)",

A random sample of 60 men and women was selected from among the freshmen of 2 undergraduate colleges at Rutgers University. Results of the study show that the insufficiently developed level of logical thinking of regularly admitted college freshmen puts them at a disadvantage to benefit optimally from higher education and to cope with life problems that require such thinking. The experience  of the college freshman year does not have a material effect in raising the level of thinking. The brief intervention on a small sample did yield significant results that warrant further study, especially with longer-term intervention. (Author/HS)",

The increasing intensity of our urban problems and the growing public awareness of them have made these problems a top domestic priority. At the same time, universities, once perceived as cloisters for ineffectual academics, have come to be viewed as a powerful resource for the practical solution of all sorts of national problems, especially those peculiar to the urban environment. The University of Pittsburgh (Pitt), long committed to solving urban problems, has instituted the University-Urban Interface Program (UUIP). The major thrust is to study, chronicle, and concurrently evaluate Pitt's community relations efforts and innovations, their successes and  failures. Early in the preparation of the program proposal, it was decided that 5 representative projects, from among an unmanageable array of potential issues and opportunities for research and public service, should be carved out for study. Emphasis was to be on research about action programs, not on actual operations. The 5 projects ultimately selected were: (1) minority and community services; (2) campus development; (3) communications; (4) long-range Pittsburgh goals; and (5) university governance for community relations.

As an example of university-urban interaction, the program attracted the attention of the University Urban Interface Program as a candidate for study under the Minority and Urban Services priority. Because it was operational and provided ongoing services to the community, the  opportunity to document its achievements, to help systematize its procedures, and to raise issues pertinent to future plans warranted its inclusion in the Operation Outreach Studies of UUIP. Accordingly, 3 tasks reported on here were agreed to for study: (1) an historical overview of the SCP; (2) a manual of procedures for the consultant; and (3) a report on problem areas within the areas of communication, control, information flow, and analysis.

Many professionally trained managers are ill-prepared to deal with conflict in their environment. They often do not see it as a part of their managerial function. It is the contention of this paper that the management of conflict can and should be taught in a formal curriculum aimed at the preparation of managers. The paper is organized into 6 sections. The first section presents a new definition of organizations that incorporates conflict possibilities, thereby changing the manager's expectations about his role. In section 2 current definitions of conflict are examined to see what they offer by  way of assistance to the manager in identifying and coping with conflict, and in section 3 areas of conflict are identified. Pittsburgh as a setting for conflict is examined and brief conflict examples are cited in the fourth section. In section 5 a rationale is provided for the University to assume a role in the education of managers in the utilization of conflict, and the final section presents a proposed curriculum model for this type of education (HS)",

Indeed, leaders in government and law in the black community programs give this issue the highest rating from among the 28 changes studied. Major suggestions for such reform include: (1) a complete overhaul of the bail system; (2) an adequate public defender system; (3) reorganization of the courts; (4) elimination of the backlog of cases; (5) rehabilitative rather than punitive justice; and (6) standardization of penalities and sentences for similar crimes and offenses. Some of the community leaders  emphasize the need for better provisions in the whole system of administration of justice for the poorer and less educated citizens.

Questions were asked of the panelists regarding the role in the home, the role as primary breadwinner, etc. It became clear that the women in the couples game fit the stereotyped role of wife, mother, and housekeeper regardless of whether they held jobs themselves. Comments by male participants at the conference show that they came away with a new insight as to the needs of women as professionals. Comments by students indicate that the conference gave  them a feeling of community with other women and an insight into what their future might hold beyond childbearing. (HS)",

For too long society has held that women are less rational than men, less capable than men, and thus that educating women is less useful than educating men. Replacing myth with fact is the responsibility of everyone. What the Women's Center hopes to contribute is, first, a dialog about the problems, the place, and the potential of women in contemporary life; second, new bonds between a college and women away from college; and third, fresh insight for undergraduates about what it means to be a woman in modern times. In this brochure are a series of brief remarks about men, women, and society, and about women and Barnard and the Barnard Women's  Center. The comments touch on the necessity for Women's Studies; Barnard's research collection; women and the academic world; women and work; and the cultural context into which the Women's Center fits.

The findings of the SSHA indicate that the majority of entering freshmen at Montgomery College do not know efficient study methods, may not have sufficient motivation for studying and may not have attitudes found to be important in the classroom. Multiple regression analysis showed a significant relationship between high school rank and GPA, but suggests that the SSHA is not an effective predictor of GPA or persistence for students at Montgomery College. Four recommendations were presented to improve student academic performance: (1) counselors should  encourage students to enroll in study skills classes, (2) students not enrolled in these classes should take advantage of the services provided by the counseling staff, (3) students should be informed of books and materials available in the Student Services Building that could improve their study skills, (4) more of these books should be provided to the students and kept in a &quot;Study Skills Library&quot; in the Student Services Building.

In addition, student-perceived educational benefits were assessed by administering five standardized instruments rating Vocational Benefits, Humanistic Benefits, Critical Thinking Benefits, Human Relations Benefits, and Overall Change to a sample of 59 students. A comparison with national norms led to the following conclusions about the SBCC students: (1) they perceived a greater proportion of benefits in the areas of \"background for further education\" and development of \"vocabulary, terminology and facts\"; (2) they also  perceived a greater gain in aesthetic sensitivity and appreciation; (3) they showed a lower proportion of growth in quantitative thinking; (4) they had lower gains in \"friendships and loyalties\" and \"social development\"; and (5) the majority reported significant growth and change while at SBCC. Other findings indicated that of the graduates, 41.4% intended to transfer, 62% were male, 27.3% were 20 or younger, and 41.8% were 21-30. (RN)",

Descriptive statistics are provided for students at Golden West College, Orange Coast College, and for the two colleges combined. Findings included: (1) young full-time students are more likely to continue in college than their older counterparts; (2) few differences in terms of continuing student characteristics or former student responses exist between the colleges; (3) though many respondents indicated a desire  for a college degree, few named a specific short-term goal; (4) most respondents indicated that they intended to return to college at some time; (5) the most frequent reasons given for discontinuing college were financial and personal factors, though close to a third discontinued only after completing their program or goal; and (6) more students reported class activities as their most valuable college experiences, and non-class activities as their least valuable. It was also concluded that telephone interviews do not result in a remarkably higher response rate than mail questionnaires. The data may be more reliable, however, since bias introduced by differences between responders and non-responders is virtually eliminated. (RN)",

It was further realized that the rich descriptive data base that Nor Cal had collected could be of use to the entire academic community. Although grand totals for the Nor Cal consortium data by category of response have already been reported, it was decided that a more detailed representation of this data base should be produced and disseminated. The computer printouts for phases 1, 2, and 3 were collected and the data were arranged by college in tables for each of the questions in the original Northern California Junior College Cooperative Study instrument. While all data is available for phases 2 and  3, some of the data for phase 1 has been lost. Although the descriptive data is presented by college, the schools were randomly assigned alphabetic code letters to insure anonymity. Summary tables for the three phases of the Nor Cal Study are presented in separate sections of the report. (Author/AL)",

Ten cognitive variables and 15 non-cognitive variables were examined to determine their relationship to persistence, defined as the number of academic hours attempted over the 2-year period. Results indicate: (1) first semester grade point average was the best single predictor of persistence; (2) adding the total score of the Florida Statewide Twelfth Grade Test to the equation improved prediction for both sexes; (3) significant differences between the means of graduating and non-graduating students were found for all cognitive variables and for a variety of  non-cognitive variables; and (4) a large proportion of successful (at least 2.0 GPA) students did not persist at SPJC.

The conclusions indicate that: (1) CGP scores in general are related to overall success in college course work; and (2) it is reasonable to use CGP performance as a predictor of specific course and overall success. The second study compared the ability (as measured by the CGP scores) of CVCC students, students in the Virginia Community College System, and students in all public comprehensive junior colleges for fall of 1970 and 1971, to help determine the academic progress  of students at CVCC. There appears to be a clear difference in ability at entrance among community college students at the three levels (local, state, and national).

A significant proportion of students felt all courses were too long in terms of time spent  in class, although many judged the 5-week courses as having too few weeks in the session. The most frequently cited reasons for enrolling were to get a degree or finish a program sooner. Faculty opinion showed little agreement as to the relative importance on enrollment of: (1) available summer employment for students, (2) the variety of courses, and (3) the length of the session. The study seems to indicate that a combination of long and short terms would be the most accommodating arrangement. (RN)",

The two proposals analyzed are administrative viewpoint and faculty opinion. The purpose of this paper is threefold: (1) to measure the implementation of SB 696 against the purpose of the bill and the guidelines developed by the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges; (2) to attempt to compare administrative and faculty opinions regarding evaluation; and (3) to compare both proposals against the suggested evaluation system of educational theorists. The goals of SB 696 depend on several factors: (1) whether the legislature will give the academic community  enough time to experiment and devise sound techniques; (2) whether the local boards are willing to make financial investments on the implementation of SB 696; and (3) whether the teachers themselves view this process as a useful one for the improvement of instruction.

This study postulates that: (1) definitions of indexer consistency should consist of the indexer's perception of indexable concepts and his choice of terminology; (2) both parts of the definition can be measured separately; (3) there will be a large difference in the degree of each; and (4) indexer consistency scores should contain both elements. For the study, five indexers read 550 journal articles and labeled the concepts discussed in each article. Findings from this exercise indicate a need for a re-examination of the problem of indexer consistency and its relation to: (1) tests of the effectiveness and  efficiency of indexing languages and systems; (2) index tools and methodology; (3) index research, much of which has concentrated on terminological relationships to the neglect of concept-related problems; and (4) indexer consistency as a factor in indexer-user consistency in choice of concepts or terms for the retrieval of indexed information.

Cognizant of the interrelationship of the library and media fields, the proposal was adapted to include aspects of children's and school library service, and community service. The program seeks to train enthusiastic college graduates who are interested in the potentials of media use in child development and training, and who can become effective practitioners of early childhood library methods. Additionally, graduates of the program are expected to possess the capabilities for initiating, organizing, and maintaining early learning collections and programs. While  the primary function of the program is that of an academic agency concerned with the preparation of professional liberty personnel, it is in an enviable position to make an impact on the community at large. The participation of the five pupil-subjects and the Oxford Manor project confirm this role of The Early Childhood Specialist Program.

Total library media service to the young people of the community presupposes effective working relationships at a decision-making level for both resource centers. The functions of each library program are clearly distinct in the educational scheme of every municipality. Neither can presently  provide nor should attempt to provide the services of the other. The local public library cannot hope to provide the necessary materials either in the proximity or the perspective which is required of a good education program. At the same time a school library/media cannot hope to provide the kind of service which may be found at the local public library.

        "description":"At the beginning of the 1970s, American university libraries can look back upon a decade of phenomenal growth. Serious problems of organization and administration often resulted from this growth which have not received the attention deserved. The traditional hierarchial structure of university libraries with one head librarian at the top is no longer sufficient. Many librarians have recognized the need for a look at how libraries are organized and managed. Much of the investigation centers around three main points: (1) the need for greater staff involvement in library decision-making, (2) the need for some form of academic governance for professional staffs, and (3) the prospective unionization of library staffs. Whether through faculty governance, greater staff involvement on  committees or other structures, or through unionization, the stress is upon staff involvement in library decisions. (Author/SJ)",

Part II, a description of the Vancouver area political structure, is important for library development because of the key role of the Regional District form of government. Part III analyzes some aspects of library service and relates it to local and national,  social and library trends. Parts IV, V and VI deal with special problems of the region while Part VII outlines a development plan designed to mesh with a similar plan for the rest of British Columbia being worked out by the Five Year Plan Committee.

The purposes of this project were to determine the status and role of the librarian and library paraprofessionals and aides in the schools of the region and to determine future employment needs. Six survey instruments were prepared and administered to superintendents, supervisors, principals, librarians and paraprofessionals. Interviews were conducted with a sample of principals, librarians and paraprofessionals using a structured interview questionnaire and other individuals (State Library  Supervisors, college personnel, etc), who were acquainted with the problems of the area. The results and conclusions of the study indicated that there is a need for additional professional and paraprofessional employees for the school libraries of the region. Administrators and librarians are very much interested in the expansion of existing programs, through the employment of additional personnel. The employment picture for the next ten years indicated an expanding job market for library personnel. (Author/SJ)",

The students, grouped according to age into four groups, were tested first on an open-ended situational dilemma using three situations with three levels on a closeness-to-self dimension. The students' written responses were judged according to the extent to which they met criteria for abstract thinking. A second test, Elkind's replication of Piaget's conservation of mass, weight and volume tasks, was administered one week later to test conservation of volume. The successful completion of  the test was considered as evidence of the ability to think at the formal operational level. Test data were analyzed using contingency tables and the Chi-square method. Results indicated the following: (1) successful completion of the conservation task and a high rating on the situation task were independent; (2) there was a significant positive relationship between the mean age of each of the four groups and the number using abstract thinking, with the older groups scoring higher on the situation task; (3) there was no significant positive trend between mean age and successful completion of the Piagetian task; (4) collapsed cross-age groups and analyzed by sex, more females than males used abstract thinking on the situation task, with the opposite being true on the conservation task; and  (5) no trend was found in the use of abstract thinking among conservers on the three levels of closeness-to-self.

It is hypothesized that kindergarten pupils who study mathematical concepts in a planned, sequential, systematic, but non-workbook (informal) type program will gain more in mathematical concepts and skills than kindergarten pupils who study mathematical concepts as they are presented in a workbook program. Two groups of pupils (experimental and contrast) were used to compare the results of both programs by administering an evaluation instrument. The groups were comparable in age, attending the same school and sessions, had similar socioeconomic backgrounds, were taught by the  same teacher, and were similar in levels of general ability. The abilities measured by three sub-tests of matching, number, and copying were regarded to be related to mathematical skills, knowledge and understanding. The comparative tests indicate that children in the experimental group: were better in matching skills; had greater number knowledge and skills; and were better in motor control skills than children in the contrast group. It is concluded that informal learning activities and experiences can be successful in helping young children learn mathematics, and that efforts to develop such activities and experiences should be continued.

In Experiment I, children, who were taught to prompt themselves as needed by referring to a picture book, attained almost perfect scores, significantly more than a group who learned through trial and error without the information source. To reduce errors of over- and under-prompting, an incentive was introduced in Experiment II. One group was differentially reinforced for correct responses only when made on the first attempt without prompting. A second group was reinforced for each correct response regardless of amount of self-prompting or previous errors. The unexpected finding that the  indiscriminately reinforced group performed significantly better on the posttest, coupled with the significantly greater variability in book use by the differentially reinforced group, was interpreted as reflecting the heightened anxiety which this risk-taking situation involved for many youngsters.

          "Michael, William B."],
        "description":"The purpose of this investigation was to ascertain whether the age specific expectations of Piaget's theory (1965) regarding the development of moral judgment in children from four to seven years of age were modifiable through use of a certain adaptation of Bandura and McDonald's imitative learning paradigm which had utilized adult models. In this study of pro-social learning of pre-school and first grade children, an adaptation of the social learning paradigm involved the introduction of a 20 minute film (1) using glove-type, hand manipulated puppets as models to act out Piaget-type stories, and (2) affording vicarious reinforcement from a six-year-old peer throughout the treatment in an effort to maximize the resultant acquisition of those moral judgments that involve the  distinction between social acts of intentionality or accident. Studied were 80 children enrolled in six public and private schools from middle class socioeconomic backgrounds, in the area of Redlands-San Bernardino, California. Pretest results showed that there were no significant differences between the subjects across all age categories from four- to seven-years. The variable of age, for both the two-week delayed posttest, yielded no significant differences in average performance. It is concluded that the use of the film was a vehicle for promoting moral development and that the posttest results afforded a basis for questioning the age-specific expectations of Piaget's theory.

Four experimental groups received enrichment through the MMPIP curricula, while 2 control groups did not. A fixed-effects 3-way analysis of variance with independent replications was used to analyze the results of the Conceptual Oral Language Test and the Michigan Oral Language Productive Test. Scores were significantly higher for those students who had contact with the MMPIP materials through  classroom instruction and also for those students who had contact with MMPIP materials through tutorial instruction. No difference was shown between tutorial instruction and classroom instruction, except that non-bilingual students performed significantly better than bilingual students when given tutorial instruction. It was concluded that MMPIP materials were effective in helping children with English language difficulties to have a significantly more effective use of the English language than children with the same types of problems who do not use the MMPIP materials. Included are 4 figures and 6 tables. (Author/MJB)",

A small community profile (SCP), appendix A, was designed to provide information on the governmental, economic, physical, and social  characteristics of the community and to serve as a methodology whereby such information could be obtained and analyzed concurrently and subsequently by professional staff having familiarity with Federal programs. The SCP and the community study methodology covered 3 types of information: (1) information and data in the &quot;real&quot; characteristics of the community; (2) information on community capabilities; and (3) information on problems as perceived by the community. Twenty-three recommendations for strengthening community programs were put forth, and the SCP and study methodology were recommended for use in the analysis of other communities. (LS)",

Three groups (the Indian orientation students, and control groups of Indian and Caucasian students) were compared on 3 instruments to determine if the orientation program aided Indian students in their college major choice, in development of mature vocational attitudes, and in development of improved self concept.

The 34-week program consisted of 3 elements: (1) a daily half-hour television broadcast, (2) weekly home visitations by trained paraprofessionals, and (3) a traveling classroom which provided for weekly group experiences. Data were collected on 121 children from southern West Virginia divided into 4 treatment groups with approximately equal numbers of children of each sex and age level in each group. Group 1 experienced intervention through television broadcasts, home visits, and traveling classroom; group 2, through television broadcasts and home  visits; group 3, through television broadcasts only; and group 4 experienced no intervention. The experimental groups performed significantly better than the control group on the following mathematical behaviors: number terms, geometric figures, cardinal number and sets, and matching forms. Behaviors that did not differentiate among the groups were knowledge of age and birth date, cause and effect, classification, positional and spatial terms, and time relationships. It was concluded that the television element was effective only in combination with one or both of the other elements. Recommendations are presented for program revisions, for a follow-up study of the same children, and for application to other rural areas.

The purpose of the study was to gather a variety of data on psychological and sociological variables and to investigate the relationship of those variables to achievement. A sample of students drawn from 21 high schools in 7 states was stratified on the basis of sex, grade, and geographic area, with approximately equal sex ratios. Tests administered at various times over a 4-year period (1966-70) were: the California Achievement Tests; the California Short-Form Test of Mental Maturity; the Mooney Problem Check  List; a questionnaire to obtain personal and familial data; a semantic differential on attitudes; the School Interest Inventory; the California Psychological Inventory; the Value Orientation Scale; and the Vocational Aspiration Scale. No reliable differences were noted in terms of achievement between the 4 types of schools. For the 45 categories for which significant achievement differences were registered, rankings were so variable that no hierarchial pattern or evidence of particular superiority or inferiority emerged. Appendices include tables of mean scores of criterion and control variables with analysis of covariance and adjusted criterion means by school type and by geographic area. (FF)",

An interviewing team inspected dormitories, visited classes, and interviewed dormitory students and staff, non-Indian students, townspeople, and school superintendents, faculty, and board members. A total of 407 dormitory students (grades 8-12) and 225 school teachers were interviewed. Among the findings were that grade point averages and class rankings are somewhat  lower than those of students in other types of schools; Bordertown students generally attend schools with excellent facilities, well-qualified teachers, high scholastic standards, and broad curricular offerings; and the average cost of educating a Bordertown student was $1921 as compared to $1176 for a Bureau of Indian Affairs student (1969-70 fiscal year).

Information was also obtained from program administrators and staff to determine (1) program policy and services, (2) interpretation of findings, and (3) assessment of  the community service network. Findings indicated that (1) a large proportion of addicts were males, (2) the largest number were between 23 and 27 years of age upon entering the program, (3) they were in their first marriage and had dependent children, (4) most were Catholic and Mexican American, (5) most were from barrios and had received 8 to 11 years of education, (6) most had relied typically on illegal activities for income (those with legitimate jobs had unskilled labor occupations), (7) heroin was the most common drug problem, and (8) most had been arrested 3 or more times and were convicted 1 to 2 times. Recommendations were to design an outreach program to attract female students and to continue to locate rehabilitation programs for Chicano addicts in barrios. (NQ)",

As the system dynamics are described, the writers also attempt to extrapolate those aspects of the process which are common to other attempts at innovation, whether in education, health care, technological developments, or in seemingly unrelated areas like religion. The chief concern is to provide some sociological understanding of the mutual interaction, effects, and consequences of the interplay between the school system and community institutions. The manner in which innovations evolve, the mechanisms used for eliciting community reactions to them, the resulting problems for school personnel (teachers, students, and administrators( and community  members, and the resolution of these conflicts may provide insight (1) at the theoretical level regarding innovation as a social process and (2) at the practical level in terms of a set of guidelines for those involved in innovation in other locations. The study includes a descriptive section on the nature of the innovations the system is attempting and the nature of the communities involved, a view of the decision-making process from the perspectives of teachers and administrators, a comparative view of school life as perceived by students and teachers, and the construction of an empirically-based model of innovation as a social process.

The objectives of the instructional component were achieved to a significant level;  however, the attempt to develop Spanish written language skills failed. Testing indicated the need for an entire year to develop Spanish oral language skills. Staff development and parent involvement objectives were met. Procedures for the attainment of these objectives were deemed practical, but the evaluation design was thought to need further development owing to the lack of adequate measurement devices in Spanish language development.

The study focused on 2 objectives: (1) to determine pupil changes in self-concept, attitude toward school, and reading achievement and (2) to determine aspects of the migrant education classrooms which are effective in promoting change. The study sample consisted of more than 800 pupils aged 5 to 12 from 69 classrooms representing 19 projects conducted during the summer of 1971. Pre- and post-testing provided no evidence that performance levels or measures of self-concept, attitude towards school, or reading achievement are associated with the length of time spent in the classroom. No special effects related to the level  of self-concept concern or performance change concern were noted for any of the variables. Incidental findings were: (1) migrant pupils tend to be positive in statements about themselves, (2) they indicate positive attitudes towards school, (3) within-class variations with respect to age and reading achievement levels tend to be high, (4) reading achievement is less than that expected by age, and (5) silent reading performance matches or exceeds age-level expectations up to the third grade.

The children in those classrooms averaged 8 years of age, and 90% of all pupils had Spanish surnames. There was a significant gain in their ability to speak standard English over the summer. Teachers tended to shape the interactions of pupils and aides over time to a more consistent pattern of behavior and to encourage group responses over single pupil responses. Those teachers using choral response and a balanced amount of both positive and negative reinforcement obtained the highest gains. The areas of linguistic interference  with which pupils seemed to have the most difficulty were medial sound pronunciation, past tense, past participle, and the comparative. There was an improvement with age in subject-verb agreement, plurals, and the past participle. Recommendations suggest that teacher training aim at instructing teachers in maintaining consistency in instruction, encouraging group responses, and balancing positive and negative reinforcement.

The Navajos in Ramah had never constituted a unified and tightly knit community until 1950. Since that time much has taken place among the Navajos in Ramah which has served to give new meaning and purpose to their life together.

In this survey of The People's experience in the Ramah area, consideration is given to the general nature of the geographical region, its Navajo residents, and their way of life. The history of the Ramahs is treated in 4 phases: (1) settlement and stabilization (circa 1869-1919), (2) land allotment (1920-39), (3)  definition--political awareness (1940-69), and (4) a new sense of community (1970-?).

        "description":"Project \"Hacer Vida\" is a bilingual educational program developed jointly by 7 cooperating school districts in Riverside County, California, with a combined enrollment of over 18,000 students, of which 50% have a direct need for bilingual education. The project's main goal is the development of bilingually competent individuals with sufficient bicultural appreciation to function as closely to their true intrinsic potential as possible. The goal requires development of skills within individuals and development of attitudes among both individuals and the community. The project will serve over 3,600 students in a 5-year period during which a full primary and secondary bilingual curriculum will be developed. The data presented in this evaluation report are organized according to  program components which are: materials acquisition, staff development, parent/community involvement, and instruction. The instructional component evaluation is further organized by grade level and by subject area with each objective evaluated, first, as measured by criterion referenced measurements and, secondly, as measured by standardized instruments. The program management and summary and conclusion sections are presented in narrative form. Evaluation instruments, test results, and cost information on instructional materials are included in appendices. (Author/NQ)",

The project was directed to kindergarten children from low-income disadvantaged homes; of 63 participants, 53 were Spanish-speaking children and 10 were monolingual English-speaking children. Project staff consisted of a bilingual teacher, a native English-speaking teacher, 3 bilingual teacher aides, and a bilingual director. The project, located at Kelley Elementary School, was evaluated in terms of its administrative component, instructional program, and community support. Pre- and post-test data were obtained using the following instruments: (1) Short Test of Educational Abilities, (2) Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, (3) Tests of Basic Experiences, and (4) Check-List of  English Words. The greatest weakness of the project was the evaluation design used, which was not an integral part of the instructional program. The greatest strength was the project's uniqueness of size, which permitted individual contact with all personnel. Included in the report are tables of test results. (NQ)",

The research methods employed in the study are described here. Phase 1 utilized a stratified random sampling of school districts (300 or more pupils or 1,204 districts) in Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. Results from 3 questionnaires were tabulated by state, school grade level, ethnic composition of school, and size of district enrollment. Phase 2 used schools (575) which enrolled over 10% Mexican Americans. One questionnaire was sent to district superintendents, and  1 to a random stratified sample of school principals. The data from superintendents were tabulated by state, enrollment size, proportion of Mexican American enrollment, and grade levels served. The tabulated data from principals included the above data, as well as information on the non-Mexican American composition and the socioeconomic status of the school. In Phase 3, limited to California, New Mexico, and Texas, areas having substantial Mexican American enrollment and encompassing rural, urban, and suburban schools were randomly chosen. Grades 4, 8, 10, and 12 were then visited in these schools, using 6 instruments to interview, observe, and record factual data. Tabulations were by state, grade, and Mexican American enrollment. Included are 6 tables, and 11 appendixes. (MJB)",

The experimental sample included approximately 500 children in grade levels 1 through 4, who were placed in special classes. Both objective and subjective measures were used; the subjective measures came from opinionnaires and questionnaires given to parents, pupils, teachers, and other school personnel and from observations by consultants; the objective methods consisted of the school unit's regular testing program, along  with special standardized and individual tests. Major results of the evaluation were that (1) parents were satisfied with their child's attitude and progress, (2) teachers were in favor of the methodology used, (3) children involved demonstrated a positive attitude toward school, and (4) the Wilkes County Board of Education decided to continue the classes.

A 22 item questionnaire, designed to elicit responses concerning the composition and functions of NCSB, was sent to 320 NCSB members representing 44 boarding schools, 10 day schools, 4 dormitories, and 2 Navajo-contracted schools. Questionnaires were completed and returned by 192 subjects. The findings, based on these responses, are presented, and are used in making comparisons between NCSB members and members of general public school boards. Conclusions state that NCSB  members represent Navajo interests rather than national politics, that the Navajo tribe is actively involved in community schools, and that the tribe is seeking operational control of their own affairs. Recommendations are that the NCSB Manual be revised, that the NCSB be given decision-making power, and that the training of NCSB be stepped up. Fourteen tables and 2 appendixes are included. (FF)",

Thirty-four individuals completed questionnaires designed to measure the extent of their participation when they were 4-H members and to learn the reasons for termination of their membership. Examination of the data collected showed that many had been relatively inactive members, that 4-H lost in competition with other clubs, and that some thought members should have more responsibility for program planning. The major recommendations for membership retention were (1) more active participation on the part of the members, (2) more dedicated leadership by qualified leaders and parents, (3)  better timing of meetings to prevent conflict with other clubs, and (4) better programming.

Small group and individual instruction are encouraged, and many suitable learning activities are suggested. Section A is introductory and covers number names, one-to-one correspondence, ordinal and cardinal numbers and familiarization with the Cuisenaire materials. Section B develops the operations of addition, multiplication, subtraction and division in terms of the rods and their color. Equality of different combinations of rods, and manipulation of these combinations are stressed. Mastery of this section is emphasized as a prerequisite for later success in the arithmetic program. The aim  of Section C is to translate the relations between rod lengths (found in Section B work) into relations between the numbers from one to ten. Included in Section C is work on recording, manipulating and solving equations, both with and without the support of the manipulative materials. Fractions are also introduced in this section. (MM)",

Two categories of introductory level courses are recognized: one kind attempts to familiarize students with current environmental problems as its main goal and the other has goals more closely related to traditional physics, with the understanding of environmental problems being secondary. Examples of these approaches are described, including the author's course,\"Energy and the Environment,\" at the University of Maryland.

For the purpose of studying these relationships, a computer-assisted instructional program was developed to teach the identification and use of behavioral objectives in science. The sample (34 experienced elementary school teachers and 26 undergraduate elementary education majors) was given a pretest and posttest on both the Teacher Concerns Statement and Behavioral Objective Achievement Test. After the pretest, each subject worked at the computer terminal with the computer program, and then, as a group, was administered the posttest. Major findings were: individuals without  teaching experience tend to have a higher level of achievement than those with teaching experience; there was no significant relationship between the level of teacher concerns and achievement in identifying and using behavioral objectives for either experienced or inexperienced teachers; there was a significant positive correlation between teaching experience and teacher concern level; and teaching experience and teacher concern levels were not useful in predicting teacher achievement.

There follows the development of the laws of conservation of momentum and energy, including a discussion of energy in biological systems, and culminating with a discussion of the kinetic molecular theory. The major objective of &quot;Chemical Reactions,&quot; part two, is to build some of those basic chemical concepts that are necessary for the analytical approach in parts three and four of the third year course: &quot;The Chemistry of Living Matter&quot;  and &quot;Energy Capture and Growth.&quot; Some of the topics considered in part two include the mole concept, equation writing, energetics associated with chemical reactions, the dynamic nature of particles and their interactions, and the application of energy and equilibrium to chemical systems. The Harvard Physics Project textbook and the Chemical Educational Materials Study (CHEMS) textbook are used for most of the reading assignments in the second year course.

The assignments relate to these topics: waves, light, electricity and magnetic fields, Faraday and the electrical age, electromagnetic radiation, the chemical basis of atomic theory, electrons and quanta, the Rutherford-Bohr model of the atom, and some ideas from modern physical theories. Topics for part two, &quot;The Orbital Atom,&quot; are read from the Chemical Educational Materials Study (CHEMS) textbook and include: many-electron atoms, ionization  energy and the periodic table, molecules in the gas phase, and the bonding in solids and liquids. In addition to the reading assignment lists, the student guide contains two major entries: an experiment on optics dealing with reflection, refraction, images and related factors; and an extensive discussion of the electron structure and related quantum properties of the orbital model of the atom.

It has focused on a specific kind of learning task: acquisition of science process skills. Direct manipulation of materials by kindergarten children was determined to significantly increase their attainment of process skills. However, the attainment of science process skills by third grade children directly manipulating science materials was not significantly better than the attainment by children not manipulating these materials. It was concluded that the influence of direct, first-hand, manipulative  experiences in the development of process skills may well be more important for the early primary grade child than for older children.

The topics in this supplement include the erosional process, the depositional process, the formation of rocks, the dynamic crust, interpreting geological history, and landscape development and environmental change. Each set of topic investigations is preceded by the Investigations-Understandings Matrix which illustrates the relationship of the investigation to the major understandings. It can also be used to relate multimedia materials to the topic. The laboratory investigations are presented in two forms: teacher laboratory guide sheets and student laboratory guide sheets, which  may be easily duplicated to provide structured procedure for the students. The level of difficulty of each investigation is indicated on the teacher guide sheet as easy, challenging, or difficult. Although these activities are in a supplement, they are considered essential to the core of the course. (PR)",

        "description":"Twenty second- and third-grade children were tested on their ability to make judgements of certain area and volume equivalences. The children were then presented a conservation-of-liquid task. Of the 17 children who gave correct conservation responses, only two had solved the area and volume problems. Thus, contrary to what is suggested by learning theorist R. Gagne, knowledge of area and volume relationships is not a prerequisite for conservation of liquid. Gagne also suggested that acquisition of conservation of liquid in one type of container (e.g., rectangular) might precede conservation of liquid in another type of container (e.g., cylindrical), but no child was found who gave the correct response for rectangular containers who did not also give the correct response for  cylindrical containers. The answers children give when asked to explain how they know that the quantity of liquid is the same after a transformation can be categorized as: (a) Identity (\"It's the same water; nothing changed.\"); (b) Compensation (\"It's fatter but lower.\"); and (c) Reversibility (\"If you poured it back, it would be the same.\"). Identity was used by 78 percent of the seven-year-olds and 68 percent of the eight-year-olds, with 93 percent of the ten-year-olds using Compensation. These results are interpreted to mean that the initial acquisition of conservation of liquid is not dependent upon knowledge of geometry. (Author/PR)",

Teacher characteristics were classified into five categories: knowledge and organization of subject matter; adequacy of relations with students in science class; adequacy of plans and procedures in science class; enthusiasm in working with science students; and techniques of methods of teaching elementary science. The sample included 43 children from the fourth, fifth and sixth grades, 38 preservice teachers having no teaching experience, 20 preservice teachers with teaching experience, 43 in-service teachers in urban and suburban schools, and 33 in-service teachers in rural schools.  The data were collected with a fifty-item Q-sort, with ten items for each of the five teacher characteristic categories. All groups, except one, ranked \"adequacy of personal relations in science class\" as the most important expectation of the ideal elementary school science teacher. \"Enthusiasm in working with students in science\" was ranked second. These first two items were reversed (the one exception) by in-service teachers in the urban schools. The students ranked \"subject matter\" as third, while all other groups placed \"teaching method\" third. (PR)",

A pilot study of 77 students was used to decide that only a transfer test and time to criterion measure would be used. The final study involved 249 second-year algebra students in Waco, Texas, randomly assigned to either an analytical or a graphical treatment. Four classroom periods were used for the study. The treatments were found equally effective, with no interactions between any aptitude variable  and either treatment. Item analysis produced no class of transfer test items exhibiting ATI. Thus, the study was inconsistent with Carry's, and ATI's are concluded to be more complex than originally believed. Recommendations for future ATI studies include use of many varied criterion measures, a study of differential aptitude variables, item analysis for consistency of transfer and retention tests before use of the scores, and development of homogeneous tests and longer instructional treatments.

According to Piagetian theory, conservation is attained successively for number, length, area, and, finally, volume. It was hypothesized that success on the number conservation tasks involving length, area, and volume would follow the same order suggested by Piaget's research. To test the hypothesis, a constructed probability distribution derived from Piagetian theory and a scalogram analysis were used. Eighty children from four to seven years old composed the sample. The hypothesis was not confirmed. In particular, relative to the constructed probability distribution analysis, the order of development of number  conservation involving length, area, and volume is individual in nature, while the scalogram analysis suggested no one general order of difficulty of the tasks.

The last eight chapters contain policy recommendations. Those on education, child-bearing, and child-rearing are designed to maximize understanding of human reproduction and its implications for the family, to enlarge opportunities for  fertility control, and to improve the setting in which children are raised. Population stabilization and immigration perspectives and recommendations provide opportunities to devote resources to problems and needs relating to the quality of life rather than its quantity.

An examination of four curricula, on \"hominid evolution,\" on \"marine science,\" on an \"environmental ethic,\" and one urging students to \"take action\" on environmental problems allows identification of some methodological inadequacies which lead to learning outcomes at variance with the notion of critical thinking. Curricula such as the first two above are aimed at \"knowledge;\" the latter two are aimed at \"action.\" The two types are not equivalent in their methodologies: knowledge curricula require an \"enquiry\" orientation and action curricula are concerned with\"deliberation.\" However, both enquiry and deliberation have some similarities, e.g., they are both interpretative processes. Recognizing the differences and similarities, it is possible to build science curricula that allow knowledge claims to be treated in the appropriate methodological framework, enhancing critical thinking skills, and providing practice in enquiry and deliberation.

The main purpose of the experiment was to develop a program which would relieve low achieving junior high school students from the burdens of computation as much as possible. The experiment was also designed to determine what effect this program had on the participating pupils with respect to mathematics achievement and attitudes toward mathematics when compared to similarly grouped pupils enrolled in the more traditional programs for low achievers. It was found that the more traditional programs improved the students' computational abilities to a higher degree than those students in the experimental program. However, in the author's opinion, the experiment did help  the very low achievers to learn some significant mathematics and also created in them a desire to learn.

Six significant attitude differences were found and used to group students into eight attitude groups. The identifying characteristics of these groups are discussed in detail. The number of teachers represented in each group is considered, as are the number of boys and girls in each group. Mean scores of the groups on ability, algebra achievement, and attitude are compared. No significant differences for any of these scales were found which hold for both of the samples considered.

Other objectives were to determine the relationship between student mathematical ability and conditional reasoning ability and the effectiveness of quantifying teacher verbal behavior with respect to time for speaking. Twenty teachers of seventh grade mathematics were audio-taped for five classes each. Those ranked as the top five (TWHR) and the lowest five (TWLR) in the frequency of conditional moves were used to identify student subjects for the testing of hypotheses. The students were administered the \"Cornell Conditional Reasoning Test\" at the beginning and end of the  semester. The TWHR students out-performed TWLR students on the total test, on suggestive content items, on negation items, and on the principle \"p only if q, not q : not p.\" Mathematical ability was found to be highly correlated with the three fallacy principles of denying the antecedent, asserting the consequent, and asserting the converse, and with the total test. No interaction of mathematical ability and teacher frequency of conditional moves was found. The length of time for speaking was not closely related to the length of the transcription. Results indicate that future studies of adventitious learning could be useful to educational practices. (Author/JM)",

Patterns of culture have evolved in response to environmental conditions. Though cultural traditions vary from one society to another, all groups of people attempt to use nature to create a better environment. Each theme introduces young learners to the characteristics of a particular geographic region. To develop insights into the ways in which men respond to natural conditions, pupils undertake case studies of two cultural groups presently living within similar geographic regions. These studies foster an understanding and appreciation of cultural similarities and differences through conceptual teaching rather than  memorization of facts about a group of people. The teacher will also make a conscious effort to help pupils use these understandings to build a global frame of reference by placing emphasis upon human ingenuity and inventiveness in shaping societies and cultures. The course of study guide contains an introduction, suggested learning activities, six themes for teaching areas, a bibliography and an appendix covering basic concepts and skills in the social studies.

The objective of the paper is to show the relationship between the political system, the public school, and the political socialization process, and, moreover, to show how they can be studied. Concern is given to the development of political values as they relate to civil liberties. By adapting Easton's model of a system to the educational sub-system for explanation purposes, the authors analyze the way in which the political system influences the political values taught in schools. Schools,  the most important institution for the furnishing of political values and knowledge, do not have the same impact on children of different socio-economic classes. Most schools are middle-class institutions governed by middleclass individuals and in the service of a middle-class value system. Lower class pupils, authority oriented, derive a civil education that differs from the process-oriented middleclass child. (Author/SJM)",

This program in the first five years of its operation has been a totally locally developed project, and has been completely funded by the P.T.A.'s of the participating schools. It has grown from involving one sixth-grade classroom camping out in 1967 to 33 sixth grade classrooms in 1971. The environmental problems in Montana which need instruction are: air pollution, water problems, urbanization and land use. The significant role of the school system in these problems is  to help young people understand their total environment, help them learn how to find out about the essential ingredients of problems, and, lastly, help them develop the attitudes and abilities that lead to responsible citizenship exercised in actions toward solving problems.

A brief review of MACOS is included -- objectives, teaching techniques, learning theories upon which the course is based, and implications of previous research described in ED 045 561. Questions that helped to organize the evaluation strategies are: Do students as a result of the course: gain understanding of themselves and others; gain cognitive knowledge; emulate and use anthropologists' techniques;  and see a difference in the new teaching approach and, moreover, in learning and class activities? Five major strategies described for an evaluation process are: the small group interview, classroom environment checklists; creative formats; content questionnaires; and classroom observations.

Classes and teachers were randomly selected from communities of differing sizes to participate in the field tests. Teachers were supplied with materials for the \"Economic Man\", program and were asked to administer to their students the Otis-Lennon Mental Ability Test, to yield a dependable measure of general intelligence, and pre-/post-IRC tests, to measure economic knowledge and application. Methods of investigation created two additional variables, grade level, and order of  testing. Based upon differences between observed and predicted scores, findings indicate that location and socio-economic status were not significant variables affecting acquired economic understanding and that grade and order of testing were significant. Results show that, for ability to gain knowledge from a classroom economics program, location was significant, rural students scoring higher than urban or suburban students, and that grade level was also significant.(SJM)",

This definition assumes that the criteria for curriculum selection and development in social studies should come from the social sciences and not from an independent view of what the social sciences should be about. Hence, social studies educators are caught between uttering commitments to education for rational citizenship and creating curricula based on criteria that seem mostly irrelevant to these objectives. A more adequate definition of social studies is needed--social studies education as that part of the general education program which is concerned with the preparation of citizens for participation in a democratic society. Social sciences have much to  offer in the way of analytic concepts for determining factual claims about social issues, but offer little where a choice must be made between conflicting values. Several obstacles impede the adoption of a more viable definition of the social studies--certain myths about the learning process, teacher insecurity, and fear over community reaction. We should be directing our attention to questions of what social studies education should be and how we can best accomplish this objective with students of different abilities and interests, regardless of whether they are in a vocational or college-prep program.

Too often social studies are a simplified instructional adaptation from the social sciences in which curricular decisions are made on the basis of dictates of the social science disciplines and of college prerequisites. A social studies course must have a different rationale than a social science course and should not be confused with social sciences or vice-versa. Rather, secondary social studies should offer a general education relevant to all students and prepare them for effective citizenship responsibility and participation. Elective social science courses can meet special college preparation needs. In contrast to the present erroneous emphasis on structure in the  social sciences, the evidence indicates that learning improves when concepts and data reflect relevant societal problems. In conclusion, despite the belief that social sciences alone are inadequate as a source of concepts for a curriculum because intellectual styles of the social scientist are not generally appropriate to the analysis of problems faced by the adult citizen, the probability of continued emphasis on the social sciences is forecast.

Group A were given the &quot;shorter test&quot; comprised of six scale questions and six composite questions, and B were given the &quot;full test&quot; comprised of composite questions on each of several maps. Among the suggestive results are: 1) eight year olds can understand conventional signs and direction questions; 2) the  visualizing of relief from contour lines, the use of grid reference systems, and teaching of the location of individual buildings can be introduced at the age of about nine or ten; 3) more difficult problems such as understanding of scale, require the pupil to be 11 plus.

During that year, five economics institutes were held. The 175 participants in these institutes were involved in a variety of programs, including one on labor management problems, one on economic theory, and another involving the preparation of economic education material for the DEEP Program. All of the institutes used a combination of lectures, guest speakers, and study groups to present a theoretical framework for the analysis of economic problems. The report analyzes the institutes in terms of: a) needs and objectives; b) personnel; c) content; d) balance between content and  educational techniques; e) organization; f) follow-up; g) participants; h) physical arrangements and facilities; i) observers' and participants' evaluation; and, j) conclusions and recommendations. Among other things, this last section notes the importance of the skill and personality of the director as a factor in the success or failure of an institute.

Objectives include answering four questions on how attendance at the institute affected each participant's: 1) intellectual interests; 2) teaching of history; 3) professional activities; 4) relations with colleagues and school administrators. The survey consisted of two questionnaires that complemented one another: a framed mail questionnaire and an interview-in-depth. A majority of the respondents indicated that the institute: offered intellectual stimulus, motivated participants toward continued intellectual development, changed the manner in which  participants viewed history, and helped them to change course content and form. Fifty five percent of those interviewed increased their pattern of professional activities as a result of attending institutes. Participants judged that institutes were well organized and directed, offered valued subject matter instruction, and provided contact with other participants and offered suggestions for future institute programs.

The premise is that a discipline of physical geography does not now exist and that traditional physical geography consists of nearly independent topics treated without common process or methodology. The suggested alternative interface system, defined as the study of the workings of the environment at the interface at the bottom of the atmosphere, focuses on the role of location or \"place\" in the different work accomplishments of environment and upon work allocation and budgeting. The unifying focus of this alternative is the timing (and, eventually, the amounts) of these work accomplishments -- energy flows  and conversions--by systems which share the energy and material endowments of the interface, where man's enterprises are found. Physical systems and society's dependence and effects on them are both included in the alternative. In conclusion, it is suggested that the proposed alternative to physical geography could provide the basis for a unifying discipline if a significant number of physical geographers report work accomplishments of environmental systems.

A description of simulation is explored in chapter three, while chapter four introduces computer simulation. The fifth chapter presents a model of spatial diffusion. Chapter six discusses gaming situations. In chapter seven a collection of  urban gaming situations are presented and discussed. The first of three games, LOCO, ECOLOC, and URBLOCK; focus specifically on the locational behavior of attitudes in the urban environment.

Offering three brief descriptions on theoretical models illustrating how change occurs, the author portrays: 1) The Social Interaction Model; 2) The Problem-Solver Model; and 3) The Research, Development, Diffusion, and Adoption (RDD&A) Model which provides a framework for the field agent program. Change in education is slow, according to this theory, not because of a lack of basic research or development of new products, but, rather, because of problems at the diffusion and adoption stages. Problems occur in the diffusion process because potential adopters are not aware of innovations, depend on personal  sources for information, and need help in evaluating innovative processes. During the adoption process, a trial process consisting of the innovative program being applied on a small scale, sustained assistance at the local level is needed. To conclude, field agents can increase the rate of diffusion and adoption in numerous ways, thereby contributing to educational change. (SJM)",

An international committee first meeting in Hamburg, Germany, in 1966, decided to treat the subject conceptually in terms of universalities. National Centers were asked to supply information to 20 basic questions regarding the major goals of civic education. After receiving replies from these centers the international committee met to determine which curriculum elements were of common importance cross-nationally. Cognitive test specifications were designed to measure three different levels of population education and of abstractions. 1500  cognitive items, clarified by content, topic, and abstraction level, were developed for use at three educational levels. Following the identification of certain common areas of political processes through the systematic content analysis of national materials in the area, various types of student attitudinal measures were developed as a result of the IEA dry runs. Several hundred questions will be measured during 1972 through analysis of data and the results published sometime in 1973. (Author/SJM)",

Believing that decisions regarding the environment and pollution control are not technical but socioeconomic, crusaders have refused guidance by competent technical persons. Many erroneously believe that environmental problems can be reduced simply to laws, regulations, and prohibitions. Another problem is in our traditional approach to problems, which tends to ignore or lose sight of basic objectives. Proof of this is gained by an analysis of any of the environmental programs. There is a lack of definition of the terms ecology, environment, and pollution; legislative and  administrative units have defined these in whatever ways they choose. We have no planned environment--rather it is the result of many bureaucratic programs coupled with private interest activities. Pollution can be corrected once there is a definition and the money appropriated to competent persons. True controls are population distribution, availability of food from land and water, and availability of minerals from land, water, and energy. These need competent, extensive appraisal.

        "description":"Described here is a curricular effort to respond to the need for more adequate preparation of students in the areas of negotiating skills, cooperative efforts, and the nature of professional work. Successful cooperative and negotiative efforts require a high level of skills--skills that the isolated nature of our educational structure seldom develop. The arrangement described is the outcome of three successive quarters of development and experimentation in a foundations of education course. Students were asked to find, define, study, and report on some real problem in a real school or group of schools. The study required them to talk to students, parents, school teachers, administrators, and community organizations. Each report had to be produced by a randomly organized  committee. The results have been that students get involved in issues typically handled by professionals in their work, and have lots of actual situations which call for cooperation and negotiation.

        "description":"This dissertation suggests that the role of social studies teachers should be to introduce new alternatives, values, and ways of thinking in civic education. One thousand three hundred seventy elementary teachers responded to a questionnaire on: 1) background; 2) liberal-conservative attitude; 3) degree of political and professional activity; 4) risk; 5) permissiveness toward political controversy in the classroom; 6) undergraduate role and activism on campus. Analysis of data shows that although most teachers place themselves as liberals on a scale, and participate in educational and local politics, the majority are not willing to engage in discussion of conflict and introduce political reality into the classroom. Instead, old models of civic education are implemented in the  classroom. Teachers actively involved in campus politics as undergraduates, however, introduce political controversy into their classroom. In conclusion, schools tend to play a conservative role in the political socialization process, not adequately preparing students to deal with political problems or function in modern society. Teacher education must develop social science teachers who are skilled practitioners in the art of politics, who will feel secure in handling analysis of the problems of the modern society, and who play the role of change agent.

Objectives are for students to grasp economic principles which serve as fundamental tools needed to analyze basic facts and institutions of modern economic life. Focus is upon the basic economic problem: In all nations a scarcity of resources along with expanding needs and desires exists; therefore, society must make choices that are influenced by culture, government, and individual self-interest resulting in the various economic systems. Techniques involve students in gathering, organizing, and classifying data, in making inferences, posing hypothesis, and ultimately formulating  generalizations. Four sections are presented in the 12-week unit, with a student manual being incorporated into each section of the guide. Human Material Wants and the Economy is studied in section one which deals with family, city, and national consumption expenditures, differing and changing human wants and economic goods.

        "description":"The paper presents an evaluation to determine the effectiveness of small student learning groups and, moreover, to identify factors that contribute to small group learning in the overall flexible modular plan. Fifteen schools comprising a total of 91 small groups using flexible modular schedules participated in the study. Techniques to determine group effectiveness included: 1) classroom observation of behavior to gather data on student satisfaction, talk, participation, and involvement; and 2) administering of a questionnaire in addition to ten scales of the Learning Environment Inventory (LEI) to small groups by teachers. The criteria of effectiveness are expressed in both judgmental and observational terms. The findings show that there is no correlation between group  effectiveness in relation to optimism class size, sex of teachers, mod length or number of mods, and little relationship between the observational criteria and students' perception of classroom environment. However, the findings do indicate that small groups are likely to be effective when they indicate high cohesiveness, satisfaction, goal direction, and democracy, while at the same time possessing the characteristics of low friction, cliqueness, and organization.

The objectives of the modification were: a) to improve methods for determining student learning; b) to determine the relationship between student achievement and student characteristics; and c) to use this initial information as a factor in determining the content and format of the course. A precourse questionnaire was administered, and on the basis of this information it was decided to emphasize urban situations where possible, and minimize use of mathematics. At mid-course an ungraded test was given, and student reaction to the course elicited. Bloom's taxonomy was used as an aid  in constructing the mid-course test. On the basis of this information and discussions: pacing of the course was revised; more class discussions were held; lectures clarifying various theoretical positions were inserted; and outlines of the student-originated proposals for term papers were distributed. At the end of the course, students were given an exam, the College Course and Teaching Evaluation Form, and a supplementary questionnaire. The experiment certainly had value for the professor and course monitor, and undoubtedly for the students, although value for the students was more difficult to assess. (Author/JLB)",

Three major decision points provide a framework for curriculum development. First is adoption of an input model that focuses on process education, rather than cognitive learning that answers to behavioral objectives. When used for evaluation the behavioral objectives approach sets up preconceived notions of intended achievements. Advocated in this non-objective approach is the tracing of the different outcomes and the linking of patterns of effects to patterns of teaching. Second is the selection of content. The content has implications for the aim of the  project, which is to develop an understanding of social situations and human acts and of the controversial value issues, for student achievement, teacher role and response, and for schools which must be non-authoritarian. Handling controversial issues implies not only a discussion method but, moreover, an objective, democratic teacher. The third decision point is to produce a curriculum which challenges teachers rather than a curriculum which is teacher proof. (Author/SJM)",

Mineral-poor states in Africa must rely on limited prosperity coming from an expansion of agricultural commodities. The problem is that despite the prevalence of an agriculture economic base, most African leaders are committed to industrial development. The foundations of this antipathy of Africa's educated leadership and masses toward agriculture can be traced back to the period of colonialism when imperial interest created fluctuating monoculture states, status problems, agricultural coercion without incentives emphasizing authoritarian rules and orders, and disastrous agricultural experimentation. Migration to urban center and influences by the European boarding school system  alienated Africans physically as well as psychologically from agriculture. Independence, then, exposed a dilemma in Africa between a passion for education and a reluctance to acknowledge the critical role of agriculture. Suggested strategies for improving attitudes toward agriculture include reorientation and political risks on the part of leaders, imaginative programs, encouragement of local participation in decision making, provision of economic incentives, possible land consolidation, creation of agricultural programs in all levels of education, and development of community schools.

The purpose is to prepare students to make intelligent decisions as adults in the community, country, and world. A brief overview of topical content is given for the two semesters at each grade level K-12. The program in kindergarten focuses upon developing the child's understanding of  himself in relation to his immediate environment. Grades 1 and 2 move outward to study the nation, and analyze communities. Grade 3 attempts an in depth study of American history. Grade 4 emphasizes economic and geographic concepts and includes the first of the topic-linked area studies which appear in each of the following grades up to the 12th. (Author/SJM)",

As a replacement for the manpower training/selection approach, we need education as assistance in child development; as a replacement for the educational bureaucracy, we need a dynamic structure designed for individual and organizational growth and development. For environmental education to be effective in inducing/supporting necessary social change, it must derive its theoretical foundations from a restructuring of the pupil's environment. My own efforts in this area have involved developing an approach to teaching about human behavior and social processes for pupils between the ages of 12-18. It can be briefly characterized as using the classroom, school, local community, and  foreign classrooms as one's laboratory. In this process, the teacher and pupils pose questions about man and society. Both classroom situations and data gathering from the community can relate to these questions. This kind of program can have several useful outcomes: 1) shift the direction/basis of inquiry to the student himself; 2) diminish overly simplistic views and stereotypes; 3) expose a wide variety of research methods. In terms of environmental education, the pupil realizes his power and sense of responsibility while developing knowledge and skills for putting them to work. (Author/JLB)",

A program Improvement Proposal (PIP) was then formulated to solve implementation problems for this program, stressing use of the city as a learning laboratory. Objectives of the proposal were that teachers in schools involved in the project would: 1) initiate a course in urban studies in the fall; 2) develop an urban studies course outline; 3) and 4) use at least 75% of both the kit and innovative teaching/learning strategies from the High School Geography Project entitled \"Geography of Cities\"; 5) incorporate community and government resource people into their courses. The state also approved a special Title II Project which provided for  acquisition of HSGP materials. A ten day inservice teacher workshop held in August, 1971, offered featured speakers; work with HSGP and other materials; participation in an all day, city field experience; and planning of course outlines and lesson plans. Preliminary feedback from project teachers suggests that the workshop was successful, particularly in the development of useful materials and the use of a laboratory approach to teaching/learning, and what was learned in the workshop was highly transferable into the classroom.

Planafam I is a card game which utilizes role-play techniques. A primary purpose is to increase the student's personal awareness of social norms and biological constraints in fertility behavior. Players trace the entire reproductive lifespan of a couple from rural India, making decisions which influence their family size and composition. The teacher functions as a roving provoker of discussion, asking questions, keeping students within the framework of Indian culture, etc. Materials required are: a large piece of paper or cardboard; a marking pen; three decks of ordinary playing cards. Planafam II is a role-play simulation designed  to help students and young adults span the gap between large scale and personal perspectives, and to facilitate consideration of factors involved in reproductive decision making at the personal/family level. The role player (part of a group numbering from 3-10) takes the role of a woman whose reproductive life provides the focus for the game. Materials needed are: a large piece of stiff white paper; three sets of double-six dominoes; two decks of playing cards; marking pens; and ordinary buttons. Complete instructions and suggestions for possible discussion are provided for the two games. (Author/JLB)",

Teachers were graduate assistants conducting discussion sections in social-behavioral science courses. At the beginning of a semester, 55 teachers and their students described themselves on the Gordon Personal Profile; at the beginning of the next semester, 51 teachers described themselves on the Gordon Personal Inventory, while students used the instrument to indicate the traits they preferred in their teacher. Major findings were that 1) classroom behavior was more closely related to students' perceptions  of teacher personality than to teachers' or students' self-described traits; 2) teacher skill, teacher support, and student involvement were correlated positively, while negative affect in the classroom was correlated negatively, with students' perceptions of teachers' vigor, original thinking, and personal relations; and 3) the greater the discrepancy between students' preference for and observation of teacher traits, the less favorably they rated teacher skill, and the more negative affect they reported. Implications for professional training and improvement of college teaching were described. Appendixes, tables and a 26-item bibliography are included. (Author/MJM)",

Seventy-nine principals evaluated 252 teachers in urban, suburban, and rural schools in lower Michigan. The sample was representative of employing communities and proportionate to the total number of elementary, secondary and special education teachers graduated by CMU during the calendar year 1968, 1969, 1970. Eleven criteria were used in the evaluation. A factor analysis yielded three factors in the evaluation: the skill factor, the human factor, and the academic factor. The evaluation form had both content and construct validity. Three of the  eight conclusions of the study indicated that teachers prepared at CMU are better than average in their third year teaching, teachers prepared by CMU were satisfied with their education, and the way teachers feel about their instructors affects their satisfaction with their education. Further studies should be done using matched pairs of teachers surveyed and principals' evaluations of teachers based on behavior criteria.

The target population included all K-12 school systems in Illinois with the exception of the Chicago Public Schools. Data were obtained by use of a) personal interviews with superintendents, b) a Principal Information Questionnaire sent to a random sample of 35 teachers, c) staff lists and other printed material provided by the school districts, and d) a review of background studies. Variables affecting the extent to which teachers believe they are able to influence the course of events in the school system include a) the level of academic training of teachers and  superintendents, b) teachers' personal characteristics-age, c) prior tenure of the superintendent of the district, d) teachers' responses to the position of authority, and e) the specialization of functions throughout the system. All variables except the level of academic training for teachers are negatively related with teachers' sense of power. The question of the effect of school system bureaucratization and teachers' sense of power remains unresolved; failure to resolve this might indicate bureaucracy must be seen as a unitary rather than a multidimensional concept.

Four documents formed the basis of this study: TSPC's \"Interim Report of the Master Plan for Teacher Education\"; The \"Comfield Model For Elementary Teacher Education\"; the Certification Plan for the State of Washington; and A Statement From the Deans and Directors of Teacher Education Regarding the TSPC Master Plan. Seven common directions identified in the documents formed the criteria for the study. In order to identify elements of teacher education programs that might be included in the study, interviews were conducted with department chairmen and deans of all the schools of education  in Oregon. The pattern of interviews consisted of a basic format: a) written materials explaining the study which were sent in advance of the interview, b) a review of the study's purpose with institutional representatives, c) a review of the criteria for element selection with institutional representatives, and d) the completion of a one page form by the institutional representative for each element which he felt met the criteria. The results of the study provide a state of the art with regard to program development. This in turn provides baseline data for studying future developments with regard to these themes.

Responses were solicited during a seminar session 6 weeks after the start of student teaching. The first questionnaire, Barret-Lennard Relationship Inventory, measured student teacher perceptions of the quality of the interpersonal relationships existing between the student teacher and the cooperating teacher. Areas of concern were the supervisors': regard for student, empathy,  unconditionality of regard for the student, and congruence. The second questionnaire, Supervisor Behavior Style Scales, measured student teacher perceptions of cooperating teacher supervisory behavioral style. Students were asked to rate the amount of emphasis they: a) saw their teachers putting on nine behaviors and b) wished their cooperating teacher would place on each behavior. To maximize supervisee-perceived learning and productivity, results indicate that high quality interpersonal relationships should be the supervisors' primary objective.

Preobservation prepares the supervisor to observe; the supervisor comes to the classroom with recording instruments during classroom observation; the  strategy session plans and prepares for analysis; the analysis session enables teacher and supervisor to meet and analyze instruction; and the post-conference session analyzes the supervision.

A questionnaire, mailed to the school districts with 750 or more students, requested information pertaining to the negotiation process and fringe benefits in monetary amounts and for a copy of the 1968-69 contractual agreement between the teacher organization and the board of education. Information from the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction showed internal budgetary amounts, assessed valuation data and teacher salary.  The chi square statistical procedure was used to analyze categorical variable such as educational practices. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze continuous variables such as wealth of the school district as measured by the assessed valuation of the school district, size of the school district, and mean years of teaching experience of the teachers. The residuals of the multiple regression were then used to conduct a one-way analysis of variance. The study indicated that a) future administrators had better be prepared for some \"hard\" negotiating when they accept positions as superintendents, b) professional negotiations involve non-monetary as well as monetary concerns, and c) the decline in the teacher job market and in financial support in education will place a greater  emphasis on job security.

The reviewers represented school and community groups, school administrators and teachers, critics of  teacher education, associations for professional groups in education, and university faculty and administrators. A total of 70 abstracts was mailed and 38 were returned. Reviewers also suggested ideas which they felt had been overlooked. Results indicated three items rated as critical concerns by 80 per cent of the reviewers: establishment of performance-based teacher education programs, development of measuring instruments for knowledge, skills and observation of teaching methods and personalization of teacher training programs. Five additional items were rated critical by at least 60 per cent of the group. Additional suggestions and concerns are included. (Related Document 005 318) (MJM)",

Three major areas of concentration are a) systems for training education personnel, b) in-service staff training, and c) inquiry oriented instructional systems. Systems for training education personnel emphasize special techniques to promote greater awareness on the part of the teacher of self, pupils, and others. The program currently comprises modules of instruction to equip teachers to understand the needs of inner-city pupils and to develop skills to improve inner-city education. In-service staff training identifies clusters of elementary and junior high schools in a neighborhood that feeds into a high  school. Teachers in each cluster receive 20 hours of instruction designed to promote staff unity and help students to develop a positive self concept. Teachers are taught to develop curriculum around modern social realities, and teacher behavior is explored using role playing and intensive seminar discussion. The inquiry-oriented instructional system is composed of six components developing skills by which a teacher can measure and analyze the effect of his behavior on the students, the effects of student behavior on each other and learn to modify these effects to more desirable ones.

Instrumentation included the Conflict Assessment Questionnaire (CAQ) and the School Organization Inventory (SOI). Item content on the questionnaire  concerned administrative, student, and staff relations; decision sharing; personal non-material opportunities; work conditions; material inducements; and school priorities. The SOI measured three dimensions of bureaucracy: hierarchy of authority, rules and regulations, and impersonalization. Findings support the assertion that factors in the organization that are external to the individual determine the perceived level of bureaucracy. Because the other research variables were not predictors of bureaucracy, the conclusion that the SOI is a legitimate independent measure of the school structure seems appropriate.

The cognitive concepts of analysis and evaluation and the affective concepts of commitment to learning and constructive sense of self were considered of the highest priority. Learner outcomes which represented these concepts were filmed. An instructional system was subsequently built around the film with a series of three films developed for each concept. An additional task involved efforts in developing  a taxonomy of learner outcomes enabling the trainee to place learned concepts into an evolving conceptual system. An extensive field trial of the system was planned at several teacher training institutions; however, implementation of the evaluative plan was uncompleted during the project year.

Seventeen essential components, composing the operationally successful classroom, are presented. The roles of the teacher in an open classroom include a cooperative facilitator, sympathetic supporter, resource person, a diagnostician, and an available and knowledgeable aid in the child's pursuit of education. Twelve responsibilities of teachers in the open classroom environment are pinpointed. To evaluate individual response to open education, a section of Roland Barth's dissertation, \"Open Education,\" is presented; 29 statements concerning children, learning, and knowledge indicate  potential teacher success. Thirteen expectations for a child in an operationally successful open classroom are presented. Successful implementation is, however, a gradual process. When classroom procedures become more consistant and the definition of roles and goals clarified, the teacher will begin to observe a smoothness of procedure and concrete evidence of learning and growth. The paper concludes with thoughts on common misconceptions concerning open education. A 31-item bibliography is included. (MJM)",

Over a 3-year period the project was designed to improve the self-concept of the child within the school environment by providing him with opportunities for success. The first year of the project concerned first year students in four comparable schools. At the end of the operational year, it was evident that social success experiences for children could enhance their self-concepts, but such experiences could not be isolated from the total school environment. The second year program focused on academic as well as social experiences of second graders. During the third year the project was continued with one experimental school and grades K-6. This report concerns the  first two years of the project. The main areas of concern included classroom management, developing effective personal relations with children, and motivating positively to learn. Other general areas covered were techniques developed, school response to the program and administrative concerns. The findings indicated that drastic changes could occur in schools through use of the simple techniques concerning self-concept developed in this project. The Inferred Self-Concept Scale used by the Orange County public schools is included. (MJM)",

It highlights measures to correct present shortcomings that exist because there is no strong linkage between the educational researcher and the practitioner. The paper discusses the nature of an educational researcher and the reasons why innovations in this field frequently fail, the necessary components of an educational catalyst organization, and the various activities which can be projected for such an organization. It synthesizes findings on change and innovation to posit guidelines for training, for personnel management, and for support  functions within a catalyst organization, and it urges assumption of the catalyst role by the extent Regional Laboratories or some other innovative structure. The paper acknowledges that much research has been done in this general substantive area, but indicates that little specific action has been taken as a result. It thus recommends that such action be taken at this time. A 39-item bibliography and appendixes are included. (This paper was previously cited in the August 1972 issue of RIE as ED 061 991.)

The subjects included 230 male fifth and sixth graders from six randomly selected public elementary schools from a lower-middle class income area of Van Dyke, Michigan. The Arithmetic Computation Test and the Arithmetic Application Test of the Stanford Achievement Test Intermediate II Battery were used as the arithmetic assignments respectively. A Student Expectancy Form, which reported student subjective expectancy for performance on grade equivalent arithmetic problems was verified and pre- and post-tests were administered. The experiment took three sessions, each session occurring on a separate day. When the post-test was completed, the subjects were given  an induction check and the experimental manipulations were explained so that all false or negative implications were withdrawn. Results indicate a) teachers should examine other variables in addition to student expectancy in order to determine how they can effectively report their own expectations toward students if they desire to improve students' academic performance, b) there is an optimal level of arousal for each student as it relates to the task in affecting maximum achievement performance on that task, and c) further investigations of those mediating factors which affect the intellectual performance of students in studies concerning teacher expectancy of student performance is necessary.

Two experiments were involved, both consisting of two microteaching cycles--one for a verbal skill and the other for psychomotor skill. Subjects were 80 beginning educational psychology students enrolled in a large midwestern university. Forty-eight students participated in the first experiment. Subjects were divided into groups of from three to five members according to their teaching fields. Each group was randomly assigned to one of two experimental treatments. Treatment one (AT) involved feedback in the form of student rating sheets, self-evaluation, and supervisor criticism based  on the playback of audio tape. Treatment two (VT) involved the same feedback except the playback of audio-video tape was substituted for audio tape. Thirty-two students, participating in the second experiment, were randomly assigned to groups and to either AT or VT treatment. The first experiment emphasized evoking student-initiated questions and variation of the stimulus situation by the teacher. The second experiment emphasized silence and non-verbal cues and questioning techniques. Questionnaires, interviews with supervisors, and student evaluation of teachers provided data for analysis. Results indicated, in general no difference in the effectiveness of audio and audio-video tape as forms of feedback for both verbal and psychomotor skills.

A review of related literature indicates the prospects for understanding the relationship between what the school does, as represented by the teacher and the curriculum, and what happens to the student. Five contributions of sociologists to classroom learning suggest 1) Structural factors in the organization of teaching vary so greatly that the possibility of creating a systematic understanding of the conditions of teaching effectiveness based on teacher talk and student learning appears limited. 2) Participation rates of students suggest that a tutorial model of  teacher-student interaction will prove inadequate. 3) Studies of the effects of classroom status systems conditionalize any statements concerning teacher effectiveness. 4) The teacher's role as a bureaucratic authority figure varies with each class. 5) The school and teacher's use of authority may affect learning through the organization's effect on the student's sense of control of his environment. Results of the study indicate the need to develop and test propositions stating the conditions under which we expect observed relationships between teaching and learning to hold.

This 7-year program developed new knowledge about major educational problems and devised new applications of existing knowledge for solving problems. The average contribution of the Federal Government to each project was $50,000 for a 2-year project or $25,000 per year. The amount contributed by colleges, universities and state departments of education varied widely but was used for services, facilities and differential overhead. During the first 4 years of the program only basic and applied research projects were supported; however, in 1961 the program was broadened to include field demonstrations and developmental projects. Until 1962 a nine member research review committee evaluated  proposals; four five-member technical review panels were established in 1962, to evaluate the basic and applied research proposals. Dissemination of information concerning the program was achieved through printed media and by staff members at conferences and seminars. A list of approved projects gives information concerning project number, investigator and location, title, and duration of the projects.

This report deals with Facilitating Inquiry in the Classroom, a teacher training program, focusing on instructional skills needed to stimulate and sustain students in self-directed inquiry. The major goal of the program is to develop teacher responses which will produce a) a classroom climate, b) self-directed discovery, c) knowledge building, and d) evaluative processes by the students. Participant manuals, audio tapes, and demonstration equipment form the framework of a five-step sequence of activities. This five-step sequence is repeated three times during training, once for each of the three major areas:  allowing inquiry to happen, facilitating student reception of inquiry processes, and tuning in to student reception of inquiry processes. This report also includes further information in areas concerning background, development, diffusion, adoption, and future of the product. The summative evaluation of the program indicated that relatively inexperienced trainers could successfully use the materials. A 6-month follow-up indicated that secondary teachers tended to value inquiry highly and achieve a significantly higher comprehension than primary teachers.

The intensive experimental study of the individual (N-1) is discussed as an intimate research strategy appropriate to humanistic concerns. Freedom is viewed as the power to control the variables that influence one's behavior. Behavioral self-control by means of self-observation, individual programming, and environmental planning is offered as a means of developing humanistic behavior. An initial translation of humanistic concerns  into action (response) is offered.

The second paper describes specific PBTE programs at the University using the previous paper as a frame of reference. Emphasis is placed on the conceptual and management domains of program development in teacher education. A baseline of  information concerning program development since 1967 and an analysis based on the collective experiences of program participants are provided. To present a programmatic perspective, this paper provides program rationale and development; three approaches to program design for 1971-72; and a critique of program development since 1967. The conceptual and management domain presented in this paper have proved to be viable organizational structures for program development.

Analysis of classroom verbal interaction was executed from tape recordings of 44 science sessions, representing 11 fifth grade science classes from five widely separated and diversified schools in the Houston area. A 42-item verbal interaction analysis category scale oriented toward creativity was implemented. Creative activities were identified according to the following criteria: 1) the expression by the student, of an idea which the teacher did not present; 2) expressed preoccupation with an idea or preoccupation with an idea or problem; 3) a statement or contribution which clarifies or summarizes the ideas of the teacher or fellow student; 4) the expressed  desire to explore a problem or project beyond current knowledge or classroom material; 5) the expression of an idea which relates classroom discussion to unmentioned or unsolved problems, or vice versa; and 6) penetrating questioning. Nineteen of the 42 verbal interaction categories were defined as dialogue categories.

Data were gathered by means of a series of interviews based on peoples' memories; no running record of experimental classroom practices was kept over the years. The interviews were designed to obtain answers in an open-ended manner; interviewees were encouraged to talk. Three interview schedules were used: a) Interview Schedule One was for the faculty teaching at Bright Meadows, b) Interview Schedule Two was for the former faculty, and c) Interview Schedule Three was for the 10 non-teaching staff members in the school.  The sample consisted of a total of 92 respondents. The information collected was coded and placed on the computer; each question was analyzed for frequency distribution. Results of the study indicate that teachers at Bright Meadows feel positively toward the school and think that the goal for students contributes to their own professional freedom in the school. Eight factors are presented on a supportive environment in which teachers can grow. The informal socialization which occurs at Bright Meadows is considered insufficient to prepare teachers to effectively implement the school goals. Continuous in-service training and clear leadership are recommended. Appendixes and an extensive bibliography are included. (MJM)",

This thesis deals with four novels which have aroused substantial controversy when taught in the schools. The novels are: \"The Catcher in the Rye,\" by J. D. Salinger, \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\" by Mark Twain, \"The Grapes of Wrath,\" by John Steinbeck, and \"1984\" by George Orwell. These novels meet two criteria. First, they have frequently been attacked by censors and banned from the schools. Secondly, they are novels which teachers have attempted to defend and which literary critics have often praised. The thesis examines differing viewpoints of these four novels, showing how censors react to certain aspects of  the books, how these reactions are alike and different from the reactions of professional literary critics, and what censors and critics both imply about the function of literature in the schools. This thesis, in conclusion, summarizes and examines more closely certain intellectual positions concerning the function of literature in the schools. It considers the novel's role as a means of entertainment and edification. Finally, it is pointed out that teachers must learn to defend their choice of literature as censorship is unlikely to cease.

For two weeks prior to the unit and throughout a week of introduction on aspects of folklore, each student worked at home on an individual folklore project. Among the aspects of folklore discussed were: Modern Urban and Suburban Folklore, Black Folklore, Children's Folklore, Folk Music and Politics, and How a Man Becomes a Myth. Each student project included an oral presentation to the class, a written analytical essay of the material collected, and either a taped or written collection of the material gathered. Each project was evaluated on the thoroughness of the collection, the insight into folklore expressed in the essay, the  style and form of the project, and the interest level and thoroughness of the oral presentation. This unit served to bridge the gap between the subject of English and some student underachievers. (DB)",

Enrollment figures are given for (1) the top 20 schools in number of journalism students; (2) the top 10 schools in number of doctorate students; and (3) the top 20 schools in terms of graduate students. A total of 7,968 bachelor's, master's, and doctor's degrees were granted during 1970-71, compared with 7,601 during the 1969-70 period, an increase of 4.8 percent. The 14 schools that granted more than 100 BA/BS degrees during 1970-71 are listed. A total of 45 doctorates were granted by 14 of 162 schools. Other schools granting 20 or more graduate degrees are named. All  enrollments for each undergraduate year were up over the 1970 figures; only graduate student enrollments declined in the 1971 tabulations.

        "description":"Results of research performed to determine whether or not newly enrolled freshman students improved after one and one-half quarters of composition instruction at Western Illinois University are presented. Using an essay-type placement test given at initial enrollment as a pre-test, 158 students were selected as the experimental group to write post-test essays after one and one-half quarters of composition had been completed. Both the pre-test and post-test essays were subjected to an analytic evaluation which numerically rated each student on the areas of content, organization, style, mechanics, and overall score on the essay. A paired &quot;t&quot; test and a Duncan's Multiple Range test were used to analyze the essay scores data. The general findings and overall conclusions drawn from  the study indicated that freshman students do improve their writing ability after one and one-half quarters of composition. That the improvement was due solely to composition instruction cannot be confirmed since no control group existed to control maturation and other possible extraneous variables. A total of 30 null hypotheses were tested in this experiment. Statistical data are presented in 16 tables and in three appendixes. (DB)",

        "description":"Two studies were conducted with English speakers to investigate (1) the facilitative effects of melodic features of speech, and (2) whether poor readers (without evidence of sensory defect) show a greater impairment than good readers when melodic features are made unavailable in the speech input. It was hypothesized that when melodic cues are not available, sentences of high syntactic complexity are harder to process than sentences of lower syntactic complexity. A modification of the Savin and Perchonock (1965) \"overflow\" procedure was employed. An auditory verbal stimulus was presented, followed by a digit list. The subject was asked on each trial to recall both sentence and digits. Half of the sentences had melodic features. Subjects were 40 fourth grade children randomly  assigned to Sentence Type groups. There were 25 trials per subject. Results showed (1) melodic cues facilitated processing for Regular Sentences, and (2) these cues were relatively more important for sentences of greater complexity. In a second study, it was hypothesized that selected poor readers would have greater difficulty than normal readers in processing spoken language when melodic features were absent. A modification of the method used in the first study was used. Poor readers had greater difficulty in processing all stimulus types. Serendipitous findings suggest that standardized group-administered reading and intelligence tests are confounded measures. (Author/DB)",

To explore these similarities, 8 groups of 24 high school students read instruction units under different conditions, recalled main points from the units, and answered essay questions. The effects of the following variables on recall and understanding were investigated: sorting cards bearing main points obtained from the instruction units into piles of related vs. unrelated items; number of piles (categories) used in sorting; and use of subject developed or experimenter imposed sorting criteria. The relationship between number of sorting piles and recall,  consistently found with word lists, was found only for females in this study and appeared stronger when sorting items were less thematically related. Recall order did not reflect the organization put on the items during sorting. Some weak evidence that self-developed organization produced higher essay scores is provided. The results show that various research techniques and concepts, useful in studying word list recall, are inadequate for studying learning from prose. They also raise questions about some claims made for &quot;Structural Communication.&quot; (Author)",

The report also specifies the form of the in-service education program for teachers that, of the various ones tried at the Center, seemed to the staff to offer the best possibility of successful use elsewhere. The report makes clear the precise ends in  changed teacher behavior that were to be sought; and it shows the necessary relation between such ends and the means that were developed, independence as the end being indissolubly linked with the growth of independence in and through the means.

        "description":"An examination of models which have been employed in making predictions about the interference effect is made. It is pointed out that investigators mainly have relied upon the paired-associate model borrowed from classical studies in the field of verbal learning. This basic paradigm, represented as A-B, A-C, A-B, has produced fairly consistent results with learning tasks consisting of words and nonsense syllables, but has not served as an effective model in making predictions when meaningful passages of prose have been involved. The possibilities of another model from verbal learning are studied. It is suggested that subjective organization, which has been useful in predicting retention in free recall tasks, may also have relevance for explaining the forgetting of prose material.  The notion that retroactive interference or facilitation might be predicted on the basis of passage organization was suggested in a recent study in which an artificial structure was imposed on the prose materials by constructing passages on the basis of Venn diagrams. It is concluded that if prose materials having an inherent hierarchial structure are used in a study of retroaction, the same type of thing may happen between the original and interpolated learning phases. That is, recall may suffer if subjects are forced to rearrange the elements of an established hierarchical structure. (Author/CK)",

The questions are: \"Do kids really want to be bored?\" Why is their background so limited?\"\"How do we motivate students without being hams?\"\"Why do kids have to be entertained in every class?\" and \"Should we drop all boring English classes?\" The following points are part of the responses made to these questions. Students are often bored by a dull teacher. Most students have limited background only in the sense that they don't know everything teachers would like them to know before they appear in their classes. Being a ham is a fine idea if it helps the student to acquire a sense of the excitement involved in literature. Good education is entertaining in one sense or  another most of the time.

Program objectives include: (1) Increase achievement in specific areas of music, such as singing, rhythms, listening, and playing instruments; (2) Encourage self-expression or creativity; and (3) Develop an interest in extracurricular music activities. Intermediate classes in 30 elementary schools were included in the project; eight special music teachers were assigned to work in sixteen schools. The evaluation study was designed to obtain: (1) pretest and posttest measures of pupils' achievement in specific areas of music, (2) classroom teacher judgments of children's development and achievement, and (3) principal reactions relating to the effectiveness of the program. For comparison purposes, a  control group consisting of 21 classes not involved in the program were selected for pretesting. All grades made statistically significant improvement when results of the initial test were compared with posttests in both the experimental and control groups. Differences for between the grand mean for each grade for the experimental groups and control groups are statistically significant at the .05 level indicating that these differences would occur by chance factors only one time in twenty. The greatest contribution to the special music teachers to pupil achievement, according to classroom teachers, was in providing special opportunities for pupils to participate in choral ensembles and perform for an audience. In general, the subjective evaluations of the principals of the schools  involved and of the regular classroom teachers at these schools, indicated that the program was meeting a definite need for musical instruction on a broad basis.

The procedures used have three features: anonymous response, iteration and controlled feedback, and statistical group response.

The two basic issues examined were: (1) a comparison of face-to-face discussion with the controlled-feedback interaction, and (2) a thorough evaluation of controlled feedback as a technique of improving group estimates. The results indicated that face-to-face discussion tended to make the group estimates less accurate, whereas, the anonymous controlled feedback made the group estimates  more accurate. Other results include: (1) the insight gained into the nature of the group information processes, (2) the fact that a meaningful estimate of the accuracy of a group response to a given question can be obtained by combining individual self-ratings of competence on that question into a group rating.

A questionnaire on educational background, experiences with the GED current status at college, attitudes toward various issues, and future plans was mailed to each or 1,367 junior and senior college students. The average subject was a 28-year-old male veteran who learned about the program in the armed  services. Results include: (1) The performance of nontraditional students was significantly higher than that of graduating high school seniors on all GED tests except English; (2) Students who enrolled in senior colleges earned slightly higher scores on all tests than those enrolled in junior colleges; and (3) The relatively low intercorrelations of the tests suggest that each test is measuring a unique skill. The results suggest that the GED tests are useful for the admission and guidance of college candidates who have not formally completed high school. Recommendations include: (1) Colleges should encourage nonhigh-school graduates to take the GED and to present satisfactory scores as evidence of ability to undertake college-level work, and (2) A greater amount of publicity on the GED  should be aimed at those segments of the civilian population that are most likely to profit from taking the tests.

        "description":"The feasibility of using an observational rating schedule to elicit information about parent-child interaction was studied. The Parent-Child Interaction Rating Procedure (P-CIRP), focusing specifically on parent-child interaction with a structured teaching task, was developed for this purpose. The interaction setting is teaching the child simple two-dimensional sorting tasks. Three tasks were used: a toy sort, an eight-block sort, and a nine-block sort. Each task involves a three-part session: the examiner explains the task to the parent; the examiner leaves the room and the parent teaches the child the task; and the examiner returns to test the child's task performance with the parent present, but not intervening, so that the behavior of both the parent and child can be rated.  All three parts of each session are videotaped. The P-Cirp, developed for assessment of the videotaped interaction, is composed of three parts--a general information section, a rating form section for the parent-child teaching period and the session, and a rating form section for the parent-child-examiner testing period. Information recorded for each section is described. Rating procedures and usability are discussed and illustrated. Preliminary analyses of data obtained from about 100 preschool children (1-1/2 to 5 years old) and their parents over a 3-year period indicate that the P-CIRP is equally appropriate for the diverse groups with which it has been used and that it does provide a sensitive measure of parent-child interaction.

The main questions that were examined were: (1) Does the changing of responses to test items (presumably based upon item reconsideration) result in better test scores?; (2) Is the amount of changes related to the score a person receives on the test?; (3) Is the pattern of changes related to the score a person receives on the test?; and (4) Does item difficulty correlate with the probability of changing a given item? Subjects were 178 university students taking final exams. The tests were composed of true-false and multiple-choice items, and most students had more than adequate time to reconsider items. All subjects were made aware of the nature of the research. The  results are presented as to the effects of response changes on test scores, relationship of amount of changes to score, relationship of pattern of changes to score, and relationship of item difficulty to response changing. The current research underscores a previous finding that students who change their responses raise their scores; however, repeated changes on the same item did not improve their scores. The results also show that item difficulty is positively correlated with the probability of changing a given item, indicating that reasoned reconsideration of items was involved rather than chance misreadings of items.

        "description":"The two main purposes of this study were: (1) to determine the effectiveness of a teacher training program \"Minicourse 9: Higher Cognitive Questioning\"; and (2) to compare the relative effectiveness of two instructional techniques in changing teacher behavior-observation of videotaped model teachers displaying classroom skills, and reading of transcripts derived directly from the videotapes. A group of 54 teachers took Minicourse 9. A separate group of 24 teachers served as controls. A pre- and post-measure of each teacher's discussion behavior were collected. The two student response measures--frequency and length of higher cognitive responses--both increased favorably as a consequence of the Minicourse. The study indicates that the course was ineffective in changing teachers'  use of refocusing. It also indicates that the written version of Minicourse 9 is at least equally as effective as the video version. On some course indices, such as probing questions, the written version is clearly superior. However, the written materials used in this study were developed directly from videotapes, and as a result, probably had greater realism and interest than if composed by a writer who created the classroom dialogue.

The methods and results of the following four phases of the study are described: (1) design of a MK I flowchart model based on a review of the literature; (2) assessment of the MK I model based on interviews with seven developers of multi-media instructional treatments; (3) development of a MK II model featuring a small group tryout and debriefing procedure as the main method of identifying instructional problems and developing appropriate revisions; and (4) empirical test of the revised (MK II) model involving three separate experimental-control group comparisons. Conclusions of the study  are that the MK II model is highly valid in terms of both identification and remediation of major instructional problems in prototype multi-media lessons, and that it is effective in terms of facilitating statistically significant differences in student achievement and attitudes favoring the revised versions of multi-media lessons.

These data were gathered on students enrolled in a black and white monoracial school and a multiracial school at each of three grade levels (1, 3, and 5). A total of 240 students were selected at random. Each volunteer tester tested 12 students. Biographic, academic, and attitudinal data were also collected on the testers, and comparisons made between black and white testers. Four main effects (ract of testers, race of examinees, school type, and grade level) and their interactions were tested. Data were  analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance. Significant differences were found for the main effects of examinee and school type. Significant interaction effects were found to be testers by examinees; examinees by school type; examinees by grades; and schools by grades. (DB)",

In addition to the Stanford Achievement tests, tests of conservation were administered individually, using Piaget's traditional clay tasks first and then Lovell and Ogilvie's (1960)  procedure for testing conservation of volume using solids, bricks and water. Subjects were classified on the formal level if they met Piaget's criterion of formal level on the clay task and Lovell and Ogilvie's criterion for the conservation of volume tasks. Subjects were classified as concrete if their judgments were based on perceptual differences rather than understanding of abstract relationships. A Chi Square test of independence between level of thinking and achievement test performance showed superior performance by those on the formal level on total score for Word Meaning and Arithmetic Concepts.

Subjects were 101 undergraduates enrolled in one section of an introductory measurements course. Forty multiple choice items were selected on the basis of their relationship to stated course objectives and according to their ability to discriminate between levels of achievement. Data from this research indicate that true-false items, particularly those items which are in fact  true, result in a less reliable test than had a four-option multiple choice format been used. It also appears that when the correction for guessing formula is applied in order to equalize scores relative to items correctly answered on a pure chance basis, the multiple choice item is the easier of the two formats to answer, with items keyed true easier than those keyed false with regard to the true-false format.

By a unique splitting process maximizing the between sum of squares for the categories of each variable while minimizing the error sum of squares (within group sum of squares), AID-4 seeks out that variable which has the largest between sum of squares and splits the original group into two mutually exclusive groups on this variable at that category where the maximum between sum of squares occurred. The major advantage of using AID-4 is that the maximum squared composite correlation is obtained without the task of attempting to  identify the various relevant combinations of linear and non-linear interaction terms by trial and error necessary in the full model of the multiple regression technique.

To counteract criticism of evaluation efforts, an approach to the examination of the multiple issues involved in curriculum product evaluation across the usual developmental cycle of educational products was developed. Curriculum products typically move through a developmental sequence comprised of five stages: Initial State, Hot House - the initial tryout of a prototype product, pilot test, field test, and public diffusion. Each stage represents a milestone in the life of a product. In the course of evaluation, various audiences are acquired: the sponsor, the institution, the developer, consumer representatives, and advisors. There are five major  dimensions of a comprehensive evaluation of curriculum products: Desirability/Feasibility, (2) Management/Procedural Cost, Product Worth, Usability, and Generalizability. Issues relating to the continuation or termination of a program concern statement and fulfillment of objectives, establishing a rationale for the use of particular measuring instruments, determination of whether or not different effects result from alternative procedures. When the product enters the diffusion stage, formative evaluation is ended and summative evaluation ought to begin. It is pointed out that true summative evaluation is consumer protection and is a three tiered process operating wherein: (1) The product developer establishes the criteria; (2) some agency of the federal government examines the product;  and (3) Local education agencies research the products.

Certification would serve the interest of school districts best if it provided for substantial participation by school districts and the profession in the training and certification processes, if the certification involved multiple levels, required periodic updating, and were based on proficiency levels.

        "description":"The construction and validation of a theoretically based sign system for the analysis of teaching roles in childhood education is described. A theoretical and empirical approach to validation were developed. In the first, the general concept of teacher role was identified as a viable construct for investigating characteristic patterns of classroom teaching behavior. Four recognizable roles were derived: acquisition role mother-surrogate role, inquiry role, and authenticity role. After extensive field testing, and revision of the measurement instrument, 84 items were assumed to be congruent with the theory of teaching described by the role paradigm. The instrument was designated the acronym TRACE - Teaching Role Analysis in Childhood Education. Empirical validation was attempted  by making observational records of the classroom behavior of teachers in selected Follow Through models which were tentatively identified as prototypes for three of the hypothetical roles, i.e., all except the mother-surrogate role. A seven-model sample was selected to provide empirical validation of both the theoretical framework and the discriminative power of the classroom observation system TRACE. For three of the specified teaching roles, the predicted mode of teaching emphasis emerged as predominant within the patterns of behavior characteristic for the groups of teachers in the first sample. For the mother-surrogate role group, the predominant mode of teaching behavior was maneuvers to induce Conformity and Compliance. Results of the data analysis indicate that the observation  system TRACE has great potential for discriminating among teachers' classroom behaviors. Both theoretically and empirically, the observation system seemed to be a valid measure of the construct teaching role. (CK)",

        "description":"A study of whether the effects of block scheduling on student achievement and attitudes are more advantageous than traditional scheduling was made. The block scheduling treatment involved three required courses on each of four grade levels--freshmen through senior in high school. Interdisciplinary teaching teams were responsible for instruction. The traditional scheduling treatment involved each teacher with three classes of 30-35 students for 40 minutes each day. The basic schedule design involved three teachers, 19-110 students for each grade and subject over a period of 140 minutes. Each team of three teachers met with two groups of students, a morning and an afternoon session. Data for analysis included the scores on objective, teacher-made tests covering the material taught  in the instructional units and the ratings filled out by students on their interest and attitudes toward learning. An analysis of variance was performed. Since only two of 30 possible F-ratios were significant when the attitude and interest scores were analyzed it was concluded that the two treatments did not differentially affect these variables. The findings of this study suggest several questions concerning the effectiveness of block scheduling. These relate to teacher difficulty in handling the flexibility in time and group size, the importance of time and group size flexibility, and the need for maturity on the part of the learner. (CK)",

Publishers' catalogs, test review, journals and other measurement documents have been examined to obtain a list. After extensive examination of existing tests, other taxonomy schemes, and discussion, a classification scheme based on four outcome domains--affective, cognitive psychomotor, and subject matter was constructed. An additional concern of the survey was a classification of the response methodologies with which certain early childhood educational objectives were being measured in the tests surveyed. The following categories of response methodologies were devised; matching,  recognition, identification, written production, oral production, manual production, categorization, ranking, pair or N-item comparisons, ratings by others, ratings by child, and estimation. Next, characterization of other features of tests was made. Included were: accession number, minimum age and maximum age appropriate for tests, alphabetical character denoting domain, numeric characters denoting concept area and response methodology, alphabetic character denoting group or individual, and \"I\" if continuation is necessary. Advantages of this classification system are ease of retrieval and ease of cross-classification. It is intended that the final results of this survey will enlighten preschool educators about the availability of existing instruments and that these instruments will be  utilized. (CK)",

A pool of 150 items was developed using the \"Dictionary of Occupational Titles.\" Special emphasis was put on the worker traits of occupations. The items were given to a panel of experts to establish content validity. The resulting 64 items of the inventory were separated into two forms of 32 items each and the two were field tested in four areas: rural, urban, suburban, and inner-city. Based on the findings of the initial phase, the remaining items of the two forms were grouped into a final form and a new Occupational Awareness Inventory was field tested. The number of items on the final form is 30. At this point the  instrument was turned over to personnel of the Department's Bureau of Educational Quality Assessment for inclusion in their 7th grade test battery. The Occupational Inventory was administered as part of the Educational Quality Assessment package to 2,640 pupils in 90 schools during the fall of 1971. Together with the test battery, information was collected from pupils with respect to several variables: sex, race, type of community, and father's occupation. The Occupational Inventory responses were submitted to an item analysis. The intent of this work is to make available a multi-grade level measure of a pupil's awareness of occupations and his opportunities to move into them. (CK)",

A brief review of Di Vesta's work in the development of semantic differential scales is presented. He selected 100 children in each of grades 2-6; they came from two suburban elementary schools in a predominantly middle class school district. A list of 100 nouns was read to the children and they were asked to write the first word that they would use to tell about each noun. He then computed (a) the overall frequency of occurrence of each modifier (b) the number of nouns modified by an adjective, and (c) a joint index of frequency  and diversity. In the first part of the investigation, the focus was on obtaining a set of adjectives used by the population of interest; and in the second opposites were obtained. A set of 1,300 adjectives was obtained; of these, 87 were selected for use in Part II. A second sample of pupils provided the opposites for the 87 adjectives, and a set of 71 potential scales was developed. Twenty five appear on previous lists but many of the others seem more appropriate for use with the target population. (CK)",

        "description":"An approach to analyzing and evaluating strategies for teaching science concepts at the first-year university level based on B. O. Smith and co-workers' conceptual framework of teaching was explored. The study assumed that teaching is a type of goal-directed activity. Specifically, this paper offers a description of a methodology for analyzing and evaluating concept teaching in university science courses using Smith and coworkers' framework and explores the usefulness of the methodology for teaching. The methodological bridge has four phases: (1) identify aspects of Smith and co-workers' conceptual framework which appear useful for analyzing the actual teaching of science concepts; (2) characterize a record of actual teaching strategies employed; (3) Analyze and evaluate the  results of Phase II; and (4) Suggest specific problems arising from this study having general application to university science teaching which need further investigation. A general conclusion of the study is that the theoretical framework used appears to be potentially useful for analyzing and evaluating certain aspects of classroom teaching. The venture and move categorizations of the framework proved tractable for analyzing actual teaching strategies performed in a lecture-type teaching situation. Other useful parts of the methodology include: (1) classifying and organizing the information introduced by the various moves of a venture, (2) tabulations of the information introduced about a concept, and (3) analyzing conceptual ventures.

To clarify the rationale of the first hypothesis, an explanation was offered for the commonly observed greater stability of extreme items and extreme subjects. Both of the hypotheses were supported. For the second hypothesis, however, it was demonstrated that a single index of test homogeneity was only partially adequate. The separate contributions of items and of subjects to total test homogeneity had to be considered for the most meaningful interpretation of the results.

Absences of evidence of critical influence have resulted in the underfunding of evaluation. Common problems faced by evaluators can be attributed to the current state of the art and to the present status of education. Social action programs have three major characteristics: (1) The goals or intentions of the programs seek to effect changes in society as a whole; (2) The programs are outgrowths of social theory and due to the changing nature of social theory often fail to be accompanied by operational prototypes; and (3) The programs are action-oriented  and fail to provide time for indecision. Problems to be dealt with by evaluators of social action programs arise from the uniqueness of the program goals or from the developmental nature of the programs. Problems faced include: (1) the presence of value conflicts and the absence of procedures for negotiation, (2) inability of decision maker to identify total information needs, (3) unrealistic schedules or goals, (4) length of time required for completion of programs, (5) measurement of uncharted relationships, and (6) inability to analyze complex interactions.

        "description":"Recent theoretical developments have suggested that understanding the thoughts contained in prose material and storing the information contained in prose material are the same thing. A test which was purported to measure the information stored during the reading of prose passages was found to correlate .98 with subjective estimates of the percent of thoughts understood while reading the prose materials. Another technique has been developed which automatically produces tests of information stored on any prose material. This measurement technique is being manually implemented now. In the future, a carrel could be located in one's home or work, thus eliminating the need to physically travel to another location to learn and to receive credit for having learned. The point is made that  individualized learning and individualized credit for learning will probably become more important as time goes on. In relation to this development is the need for the selection and procurement of appropriate instructional objects, such as textbooks, films, workbooks, and tapes. An answer to this need would be the establishment of learning clinics. A person in need of knowledge in a particular area would go to a learning clinic and receive help in collecting information. For this service, he would pay a fee. The advantage of this system of learning is that it could easily supplement any existing or future non-residential system. (Author/CK)",

        "description":"During the past decade both the Guilford and Torrence groups have developed numerable measures to assess creative potential. Many of these measures purport to evaluate &quot;creativity&quot; but one element seems to be lacking in each: i.e., the last of &quot;reality-based, real world measures&quot; which would allow relevant response tendencies to emerge. To meet this need the Hobby-Accomplishment Information Questionnaire (HAIQ) was designed. The HAIQ, based on a layman's concept of creativity, consists of 70 items; of these, 29 were selected as having internal consistency as well as a positive correlation with the total score. The HAIQ was administered to 166 male and female college students along with measures of convergent thinking. A four factor solution was chosen to illustrate the factorial  structure: I convergent thinking, II originality production, III creative fluency, and IV drive. It is concluded that psychologists and educators should become aware of the probability that intelligence and creativity are independent. (Author/CK)",

        "description":"Instructional System Technology in recent years has been characterized by an increase in individualized instruction and the modularization of the curriculum. In traditional systems the learners are forced to take blocks of instruction the size of entire courses and these are much too large. The courses can now be broken down into conceptual subdivisions and these into series of modules. Each module has clearly stated behavioral objectives regardless of the nature of the intellectual performance prescribed in it. The test items of the module are derived from the objectives rather than from the instructional materials currently in use to attain them. The instructional materials for a module may be offered on different tracks which feature different levels of abstraction thus  accommodating the different learning characteristics of individual learners. Most instructional system developers today are looking ahead to a time when good modules will be developed at many localities and circulated widely for use at various institutions. There is a growing need for a valid and widely applicable method of evaluating modules of instruction. Three basic criteria are relevant to the evaluation of a module of instruction: (1) the amount of learning that results, (2) the dollar equivalent cost to the instructional organization of providing the module, and (3) the amount of learner time consumed by interaction with the module. An example is given comparing three different versions of a module. (CK)",

The impetus for this study came from the research reported by Ebel (1971) on the same topic. Subjects were selected from six public high schools. Three phases of testing were required for instrument development and data gathering. Phase I involved collecting item analysis data for one item conversion method and Phase II was used to try out the true-false items. The final phase of testing included 1018 students responding to eight final test forms. The social studies and natural science multiple choice items employed in this study appeared in a widely used battery of achievement tests. The original 70-item multiple choice tests  SM (social studies) and NM (natural science) were each administered to a minimum of 100 subjects. The four true-false test forms were each administered to a minimum of 50 subjects in Phase II. The eight final test forms varied according to subject matter, item conversion method, and item form order. The results of this study support the notion that students respond to more true-false than multiple choice items in a given period of time. However, the data indicate that the multiple choice tests were more reliable though they tended to measure the same thing that the true-false tests measured. (CK)",

For this study, an underachiever was a child who had not gained in  reading at a rate comparable to others at his reading level. Table II identifies the predictor variables utilized by the discriminant model and the coefficients and constants which enable the model to discriminate among the groups of interest.

The statements are to be accepted or rejected by the respondent teacher. This paper reports the procedures and results of a third field test and the design of a fourth field test. The third field test instrument consisted of 244 items. It was administered to 320 teachers in eight schools. Two hundred of the items underwent statistical treatment: item analysis and factor analysis. The next step was to identify which of the 200 items correlated with data from classroom observations. Four observation instruments were used. The raw scores from the observations, combined into sets and converted into ratios were then correlated with the paper and  pencil item responses of the 40 teachers. Five statistical criteria were computed by which to check the strength of each paper and pencil item. Through these criteria 97 items were eliminated and 103 emerged. Of those that emerged: (1) Four-fifths of the items correlated both statistically and logically with one or more sets of observation data; (2) Forty-five of the items loaded in factors; (3) Twelve neither correlate with observation data nor load into factors but were retained because they discriminate well between high scorers and low scorers. When the instrument is fully developed it will be used as one part of a pre-training inventory procedure by which teacher trainees can obtain an estimate of their general competencies and a diagnosis as which to need development. Finally,  systematic observation of classroom processes discriminates between teachers in many useful categories. (CK)",

The model is based on an extensive review of the literature of organizational theory and differentiated staffing and upon systematic observations in schools. It treats Process Variables, Product Variables and five categories of Essential Characteristics. Three of these categories form the basis of the present instrument. The SSS attempts to quantify Individualism, Collegiality, and Professional Disposition. Individualism represents the self-image of the individual and his identification with the organization. Forty-two items were selected for this categpry. Collegiality focuses on interpersonal relations among  individuals in the organization. Twenty-three items were selected for this category. Professional Disposition reflects commitments to the students to an area of expertise, and to the public trust. Twenty-one items were selected for this category. An item sampling procedure was used to obtain contingent product-moment correlations within and between nine subscales. Revision of the SSS was based upon item analysis, subscale intercorrelations, and the need to bring the administration time down to the practical limits of a class period. Five subscales resulted: self-concept, frequency of interaction, collegiality, professional practices of school, preferred professional practices. Results of unidimensional analysis show that self-concept is the highest valued. Results of factor analysis show  the highest loading to be on self concept. (CK)",

A review of the literature is made. Several computer simulations were performed to investigate the utility of the jackknife. The theory of the jackknife implies that the jackknife statistic is approximately distributed as a Student - t variate with the appropriate degrees of freedom. Results include: (1) The direction of the difference between the theoretical and actual cumulative proportions of jackknife statistics which were at or below  the 10 percentile points of comparison varied across the different values of p(TX, TY); (2) The jackknife was sensitive to changes in the values of the reliabilities for each combination of p(TX, TY) and N;. Conclusions include: (1) It is unlikely that a mathematical model can be formulated to describe the sampling distribution; (2) The performance of the jackknife was sensitive to changes in the values of the input a parameters; and (3) The jackknife can be used to set approximate confidence intervals.

The objective is to determine whether the cognitive or personality tests are better able to distinguish between more creative and less creative writers. A review of the literature was conducted. Thirty-four graduate student writers were tested. Two professors rated each subject on the creativity he had shown in his writing. Each subject was individually tested with the California Psychological Inventory (CPI) and the Study of Values (Allport), and with a battery of Guilford's divergent production (DP) tests. The following hypotheses were tested: (1) Writers' scores on certain personality scales will be positively correlated, and on  certain other scales negatively correlated with professors' creativity ratings; (2) Writers' scores on Guilford's tests of divergent production in the semantic content area will be positively correlated with professors' creativity ratings; and (3) Multiple correlation between personality tests scores and creativity ratings will be greater than that between divergent production scores and creativity ratings. Hypotheses were confirmed at varying degrees. Results of both simple and multiple correlation analyses provide evidence for the view that personality characteristics rather than cognitive abilities hold the key to predicting creative potential in writers.

The problem investigaged in this study is find z when given P(z). The difficulty is that expressions which approximate the integral from minus infinity to z are not readily solvable for z. A number of investigators have derived algebraic approximations to the inverse Gaussian. The most widely used algebraic  approximations of the inverse Gaussian function are those derived by Hastings. The Hastings approximations are valid only for values of P(z) greater than 0.50, and a computer program must make logical provisions for the situation where P(z)0.50. Burr approached the problem through the use of a cumulative moment theory and also derived two approximations. Burr's approximations have the advantage that they are valid for all values of P0. They are also conveniently expressed in one FORTRAN statement. It was the objective of Byars and Roscoe to develop an approximation of the inverse Gaussian which was both more accurate and more efficient than previous transformations. A final expression was obtained from the solution of approximately 4300 equations in six unknowns. The three sets of  approximations were compared on accuracy and computational efficiency, and the Byars-Roscoe approximation was found to be superior to the others. (CK)",

Four tests were used on a pre-post basis in the evaluation of the project and control group children. Language acquisition was measured by three instruments: The Comprehension of Directions, Tests of Basic Competence in English and Spanish, and The Test of English Grammar and Vocabulary. School readiness was measured through five categories of the Inventory of Developmental Tasks (IDT). An analysis of the correlations among the project developed instruments  revealed low intercorrelations among the tests, thus indicating that they are measuring separate skills. Children's family and background data were collected from a parent interview. Findings include: (1) In the area of oral development in Spanish, both the three and four year old bilingual project preschool students demonstrated greater growth than three control groups; (2) On a performance task for four and five-year olds involving the correct use of the past tense in Spanish, ten out of 26 second year bilingual preschool children were able to perform successfully as were five out of 14 bilingual kindergarten class children.

An attempt is made to redefine course evaluation in light of recent work on educational evaluation, and suggest a model for a course evaluation system. First, terms are defined and the aspects of a course which should be evaluated are delineated. This \"ideal\" is compared to existing course evaluations and the need for new emphases are explained. A systems design is then presented. Evaluation is defined \"as a process of examining certain objects and events in the light of specified value standards for the purpose of  making adaptive decisions.\" Current course evaluation questionnaires do not specifically relate to specific goals and standards for a particular course. A model evaluation system begins with a specific definition of the purpose of the course evaluation by all those who will use the information and judgments made public from it. An assessment of whether real and significant changes will be possible if evaluation is conducted must be guessed. Next, the various subgroups served by the course are identified. The intended goals of the course are specified and an initial list of intended inputs, processes, and outputs for a course is drawn up. Observation methods, tests, checklists, simple frequency counts, and other measures which can be pre-designed are constructed. Findings, data, and  evaluative judgments are written up in report form and a mini-experiment can be run by taking evaluation reports to decision-makers and discussing results with them.

It was hypothesized that students given control over the number of modules studied would select fewer modules and that given learner control over tests, students with learner control in instruction would select more modules for study than would students under program controlled instruction. The context of the experiment was a  computer-assisted program in precalculus mathematics called \"Math-S\". Two topics of the program: exponents and dimensional analysis, were covered. The program was run on an IBM Instructional System. Complete data was collected on 97 college physics students. The complete experiment constituted a 2 x 2 design: learner control and program control in diagnostic tests, and learner and program control in the instructional modules. All subjects were administered a pretest and a posttest. Pretest score did not interact with the diagnostic test variable in either exponents or dimensional analysis. Posttest scores were found to be insensitive to diagnostic test variable. No interactions with pretest scores found in either exponents or dimensional analysis. It is concluded that while learner  control may well have a facilitative role in computer assisted instruction, further research is required to define the characteristics and limitations of that role.

        "description":"A comparison of two projects involving CAI was made and the advantages and disadvantages of the approaches employed at each installation during their developmental and operational phase was made. The two projects are in Kansas City, Missouri, and Wakulla County, Florida. Both installations are located in public schools and were originally funded through Title III of the ESEA act. The original plan of the Kansas City project was to develop a series of short, half-hour, single concept enrichment lessons. Each of these lessons was designed such that a student would bypass a sequence if his performance was on the pretest indicates he had already mastered the concepts involved, thus minimizing the time spent in remedial lessons. The Wakulla County project attempted to upgrade and  maintain student achievement at a satisfactory level by providing individualized instruction via CAI. Two primary goals of the project were (1) to implement computer-assisted instruction in mathematics and reading for southern rural students, and (2) develop and implement oral language materials to add standard speech patterns to the colloquial patterns of the students. The results of both methods indicated that the students held a favorable attitude toward CAI. Results in Wakulla indicated that across the board overall improvements in performance from fall 1968 to spring 1969 were attained with the most substantial increases reflecting the concentration of CAI treatment at the second and third grade levels. Both projects were particularly different with respect to staffing, operations,  and a philosophy of curriculum development. This comparison emphasizes a need to visit more than one installation before forming an opinion of what CAI can and cannot do. (CK)",

The main focus is with the analysis of relationships among several different partitions of the same items for the explorations as well as confirmation of structural relationships. A partition is defined as a set of mutually exclusive clusters of items; however, this paper deals with overlapping or conjoint clusters also. The terms \"clustering\" and \"partitioning\" are found in the context of both data collection and analysis. The major impetus for the present method was the problem of studying how an individual (manifest) partition might be examined in relation to a single derived (latent) partition in the context of latent partition analysis (LPA). In the process of studying characteristics of the distribution of  the principal statistic, there was also developed an approach to the organization of a set of partitioned data with respect to any specified target. Data were analyzed first with respect to an a priori target which had been generated by the investigators on the basis of characteristics of the Morse Code symbols, with no regard for the letters themselves. It was found that: (1) The organization and display features of the proposed strategy may be of greatest significance, especially when stimuli or items are complex and when sorters are heterogeneous in terms of how they formed their categories; and (2) There are several other possible indices of association for comparing matrices.

        "description":"A major problem encountered by both teachers and authors of instructional materials is the sequencing of instructional activities. A review of the literature is given and it is pointed out that there is substantial evidence to support the general theory of the hierarchical structure of knowledge. A learning hierarchy for the computational skills for addition of rational numbers with like denominators was constructed. Based on the hypothesized ordering of the subordinate levels, a test was constructed to assess mastery at each level in the hierarchy; it was administered to 163 elementary school children in grades 4 through 6. The pass-fail relationships were analyzed using the following indirect validation procedures adaptable for use with test data: item difficulty, the AAAS  approach, the Guttman technique, pattern analysis, and correlation analysis. Materials consisted of an 11-lesson programed booklet on the addition of rational numbers with like denominators. Fourth grade Ss were selected to participate in the study on the basis of their performance on two pretests. The hierarchical orderings of the 11 subtasks generated by each of the indirect validation procedures are given in tabular form. A pattern analysis technique was used to determine the index of agreement of each ordering with the expected patterns. This index was above .86 for all orderings except the textbook and random sequences. Neither planned nor post hoc comparisons showed any significant differences between the logical sequence group and the other sequence groups on achievement, transfer,  or retention. Careful analyses of instructional objectives to reveal the prerequisite subtasks is an adequate procedure for developing a valid hiererchy. (CK)",

Two characteristics define the criterion-referenced measure: the presence of a performance criterion, and test items keyed to a set of behavioral objectives. The performance criterion, in an educational setting, is usually a relative standard of performance. There are two ways of constructing items for a criterion-referenced test: the item-form approach and the specification of objectives. Item reliability can be assessed by calculating the proportion of subjects whose items scores (pass or fail) are the same on a posttest and a retest, or on a posttest and a parallel form. A measure of score reliability can be obtained by calculating the mean item reliability; it may also be assessed using the concept of within-subject  equivalence of total scores. Another index that can be used to assess item and test quality combines the concepts of reliability and validity. The most important part of a criterion-referenced measure is the set of behavioral objectives the measure is based on. These objectives set the stage for judging the effectiveness of the teacher's instruction, and evaluating the student's learning. (CK)",

        "description":"Performance-based teacher education (PBTE) is a promising new approach to the pre- and inservice training of teachers. The program develops performance skills generally evaluated using process and product measures rather than traditional verbal measures. There are four major factors in the organization of a PBTE design: (1) research, (2) development, (3) implementation, and (4) evaluation. In research and planning, some of the essential steps are (1) Establish a time line; (2) Identify Objectives; and (3) Establish a scope and sequence for the program. In development, a modular or learning package design must be conceptualized and then all the learning materials created to follow the design. An adequate PBTE program will also utilize seminars and field experiences. In the  implementation of a PBTE program there are three major concerns as: (1) logistical considerations, (2) utilization of a learning laboratory, and (3) intern selection. No matter how effective one may think a program will be, pre-planned evaluation procedures should be built in to document results and provide data for making decisions relative to all aspects of the program. In PBTE programs evaluation concerns should be primarily related to: (1) module effectiveness, (2) intern effectiveness, and (3) criterion testing. Hopefully, a PBTE program will not only improve teacher effectiveness from the point-of-view of improved professional skills, but also improve teacher-teacher and teacher-pupil relationships.

An information process analysis of tests of mental abilities and concept learning led Costello and Dunham (1971) and Costello (1971) to postulate that three intellectual processes underlie performance on these two types of tasks. After testing, the process measures were found to highly correlate with performance on several tests of mental abilities. Using errors on the concept learning problems as a dependent variable, the following types of relationships should exist: (1) Ss supplied with  hypothesis information should perform better on concept learning tasks; (2) There should be a significant treatment group by Hypothesis Generation (HG) interaction, and (3) There should be a significant HG by Hypothesis Evaluation (HE) interaction. Introductory educational psychology students were administered six intellectual process measures. All Ss worked two concept learning problems and each Ss worked one practice problem and one experimental problem. Two one-hour sessions were used to collect the test and concept learning data. The scores of the six process measures were factor analyzed by the principal-axis method. An analysis of variance was performed. Results revealed a significant treatment main effect, a significant interaction between HE and HG variables. (CK)",

A set step in the area of individualized instruction should be the development of an appropriate methodology for recording and analyzing a student's performance. This paper is an attempt to provide the recording procedures which will aid in achieving such a measure. Under the proposed methodology, a precise measure of a student's performance is obtained by isolating the three components in a performance movement: response emitted by the student, the question, and the interval between the termination of the question and the initiation of the response. Five college psychology students were used in the experiment. A control reader was used to  present the reading material to the subjects. The reader controls the speed at which the reading is presented to the subject. Subjects were told to answer 10 questions that would be presented to them via flash cards immediately after reading the selection for that session. Subjects were instructed to read the questions aloud. A cumulative record of the performance of the subjects is presented. Changes in the duration of the components show a definite pattern of variation. On the stimulus duration component there is consistently a reduction in duration from the first to the second session. The number of correct responses increase for all subjects on the second session. The results of the experiment indicate that the recording model advocated has the necessary precision to reflect the most  minute changes due to experimental manipulations. (CK)",

The rationale for measurement contains only a sample of possible definitions of this goal and the inventory measures only a sample of possible behaviors. Based on the findings from grade 5 and grade 11 assessment data, a decision was made to use the nine items common to the inventories of both levels as the nucleus of an item pool for a grade 7 instrument. An item example is: How would you feel about sitting in class next to a person whose skin color is different from your  own? Item construction was subject to the following restraints: the situation described in each item should be both possible and plausible and related to an individual stimulus rather than a class of stimuli. In order to score the sociometric instrument, the race, IQ level, socioeconomic level, religion and physical handicaps of each of the students in the two 7th grade classes were obtained from school records. It is concluded that this study present a model for future validity studies. The attitude measure produced can serve as a reasonably reliable and valid measure of 7th grade pupils' attitudes toward others who are different from themselves on the dimensions of race, religion, IQ, socioeconomic status, and physical characteristics.

        "description":"Four cases of school integration illustrate that eliminating racial isolation has been shown to have no detrimental effect on majority children. Minority children can be benefited by increasing their achievement levels and IQ scores. All groups can benefit attitudinally. These gains, however, occur only some of the time and only under favorable circumstances. They depend on how the problems of integration are handled by the school district. In Sacramento, California, the schools made a commitment, had a plan, and evaluated what was actually occurring every year, revising and improving their plan as they went along. They called upon and received community support. Both they and the Berkeley schools utilized bus transportation. In Pasadena, the Unified School District sent out  mailings to help the parents of their school-aged children become aware of just what desegregation, accomplished via bus transportation, in Pasadena schools would mean to them and what changes it would mean in their lives. The Shaker Heights schools provide another case of effective integration planning. Shaker Heights is a wealthy suburb adjacent to the east side of Cleveland. Between 1955 and 1963 another section of Shaker Heights known as Moreland began to receive a large number of black families. It was evident that something would have to be done to change the racial mix at Moreland and at almost all the white schools. A two year study was made to accomplish this, the results being presented at a large public meeting attended by almost 900 people. (Author/JM)",

Mexican-Americans measure lower than other major ethnic groups in feelings of self worth. There is evidence from social investigations, however, that segregation produces feelings of \"imposed inferiority\" among minority group children. If integration is seen as an opportunity to build a pluralistic society representative of all cultural groups that come together, there is no question that ethnic identity and self worth will be better served after desegregation occurs. The experiences of school districts that have achieved racial balance show that the first step toward equal educational opportunity is total desegregation, not only racial and ethnic but  also socioeconomic. Minority children must be taught the basic skills needed to become educated: integration must begin at the beginning. There is no question that minority children can benefit when racial isolation is eliminated. The concern is how to make it occur. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Illich will not succeed in disestablishing the school, but he is teaching us to deschool our values. Proponents of deschooling are not only offering a brilliant critique of contemporary schooling but are also stimulating us to make education freer. Without basic political change we cannot disestablish the school; nor do we think it desirable to do so. Meantime, we should attempt to find out what some of the educational effects of partial deschooling would be. We can develop experimental programs to test the results of freer education on selected groups of people, disadvantaged and privileged, educationally stimulated and apparently unmotivated. We can also examine the effects of deschooling on the secondary level. If a voucher system is tried experimentally, we can evaluate the  effects of changing the locus of educational control from school and state to family and informal community. A voucher system would afford parents the right to choose among various alternatives for schooling their children: minority moral education, integration, technical education, apprenticeship, self-motivated learning, etc. It will, however, need to demonstrate its ability to encourage democratic pluralism rather than to license discriminatory division. With these experiments and others that freer learners, parents, and educators will be stimulated to devise, we can cease to justify educational freedom solely by declaring it an &quot;inalienable right.&quot; (Author)",

No single program exists but rather different fund allocation patterns are noted over the 17 participating schools. The evaluation was designed to collect data relevant to program objectives. Conducting the evaluation involved interviewing all Title I funded personnel and making on-site observations. Achievement, attitudinal, and demographic data  was obtained from a random sample of 510 students. A group of 50 parents was also interviewed to determine their perceptions of child's progress and orientation toward school. Among the conclusions reached are the following: (1) Title I funded services are generally a necessary part of the current program in the schools surveyed. (2) The impact of the program on academic achievement is not as great as anticipated in the program objectives. Data suggest a limited program impact on academic achievement. (Author/JM)",

The project is designed to provide a link between home and school for 15,000 such potential dropouts by having the Family Assistants serve as models for the students, in a ratio of 150 to 1, under the supervision of the school administration. Visitations are made by these paraprofessionals to the homes to teach the parents what to expect from the school, and what to do to help their children adjust and achieve. The Family Assistants are recruited from the target neighborhoods and serve 18 schools throughout the city. They work five hours a day, and  when home visits are not possible in the daytime, evening or weekend visits are arranged and made. Briefly summarized, the major findings are that the program has contributed over the period of this evaluation to: (1) a reduction in absenteeism; (2) a reduction in class cutting; (3) a reduction in class tardiness; (4) a reduction in school dropouts; (5) no discernable improvements in academic achievement; (6) positive school-parent relations; and, (7) positive student attitudes.

There is a great need for redirecting guidance and counseling at all levels, because in order to choose a career one must first know how to make occupational decisions. Career education does not favor any group but is for each  child and young adult and also for anyone of any age who wants to raise his potential.

Selected as representative of rural, rural-urban, and urban settings in Kansas for use in similar school situations, the Clay Center, Lawrence, and Kansas City school systems carried out inservice teacher education and &quot;real-life&quot; student activities focusing on self awareness, occupational awareness, community resources, job clusters, and specific employment skills. Innovative techniques in this exemplary project included on-the-job training, field trips, resource speakers, audiovisual programs, and new curriculums in industrial arts  and home economics. Background information for each community and school system is provided, dealing largely with socioeconomic factors. Quantitative, qualitative, and product evaluations are summarized, as well as staff perceptions of the programs. Tables present the data, gathered from school reports, staff and teacher interviews, class visits, and questionnaires. (AG)",

Written as a monograph by a professor, tentative construct validation for a Cognitive Openness Scale is provided to demonstrate the utility of generating hypotheses as implications from formal theory. A theoretical overview of the individual and his relations in a community presents a psychological view of man within the conceptual framework of a systems approach. Field tested by means of 240 interviews in a random area sampling, item analysis and analysis of internal  consistency reliability were conducted for 65 belief statements in the Cognitive Openness Scale. A second sampling gathered 324 usable Cognitive Openness Scales in addition to Household Survey Schedules as a data base for their validation. Confirmation of the majority of hypotheses about the openness construct by factor and trend analysis substantiates the validity of the Cognitive Openness Scale as an operational measure of cognitive openness. Implications for education are drawn. Extensive resource materials, including maps, are included. (AG)",

Empirical evidence suggests that crime control is better served by informal sanctions than by the formal procedures of arrest, conviction, and punishment. Sociological and criminological theories of deviant behavior are detailed. Law enforcement procedures and correctional  institutions are discussed, focusing on the roles of the police, the courts, and the community. Innovative training for the change agents involved in crime control and the planning and implementation of improved correctional systems are two major recommendations of this research study.

Included in the findings are: (1) There was a small difference between teachers' attitudes and perceptions of their principals' attitudes toward selected concepts related to school programs for disadvantaged pupils, (2) More than three-fourths of the teachers reported that they had reached at least stage IV --anticipated trial-- in  adoption of the list of 36 teaching practices, (3) Few of the teachers showed interest in using personality tests to help identify their students, and (4) Slightly negative correlations were found between total scores of teachers regarding practices and years of teaching the disadvantaged, size of school, and type of school.

Despite problems in defining teaching competencies and agreeing on appropriate levels of competency for different teaching roles, teacher education curriculums must provide the teacher with basic competencies both for current and future educational needs. Vocational educators  also have difficulty in determining the relative importance of the potential competencies. Performance criteria in teacher certification and teacher education stress accountability, yet do not constitute a sufficient basis for achieving role expectations and teaching skills.

First, the 2-year institutions should initiate a more intensive dialogue with senior colleges and universities with regard to the transfer of academic and career-related credits. Second, community colleges should encourage senior institutions to take a page from their book in recruiting professional staff who have had work experiences. Third, both junior and senior colleges need to work more closely with high schools, particularly with their guidance counselors, to steer students into pre-college courses that mesh more systematically with their own post-secondary offerings in  the academic and career fields students expect to enter. Fourth, both two- and four-year colleges should reach out to the community with continuing education programs that serve the total population. (JS)",

A secondary school program based entirely on the formal, descriptive, and prescriptive disciplines will not provide the necessary knowledges and skills for entry into the labor market. On the other hand, a school program geared to isolated occupational practices which may be obsolete within a few years will not meet the demand. A school program which provides a study of the fundamental principles of practice (praxiology) together with selected practice and a hard theoretical base may meet the challenge of the  future. Attempts must be made to determine the basic and significant knowledge of man's practices, and this knowledge must be structured to permit effective and efficient tramsmissions to pupils at the school level.

For each administrative position within the State Divisions of Vocational-Technical Education, salary ranges, job descriptions, educational requirements, and work experience requirements are included.

But even more than these traditional labor standards areas, workers considered problems of job content and work relationships to be of major importance.

Twenty-five representatives of the black community, 60 employers, and officials from 16 private  and public agencies were interviewed to provide insight into socioeconomic factors in minority employment patterns. Housing, employment, education, and poverty problems united the black community in a strike in 1968 which led to expanded programs to improve socioeconomic conditions.

Techniques for determining these standardized times and the component parts were developed in a study conducted at Purdue University and supported by a federal grant. After a preliminary survey of homemaker practices in cleaning living areas of 20 homes, a laboratory study was made which used eight household workers to perform dusting operations under controlled conditions. A work estimation formula was derived from these task situations. A multiple regression model was developed from the dusting and vacuuming of 20 family-living areas of 12 nonrandomly selected households by graduate research and laboratory assistants. Quota sampling was used to select 32 homes in which a  regression equation was used to establish the factors most useful in predicting time use from a replication of the previous tasks by seven household workers. The following independent variables were important in estimating or predicting variation in cleaning time: (1) square foot area of the room, (2) moved-item density of the room, (3) total furniture density, (4) accessory rating, (5) type of heating, (6) percentage of carpet in the room, (7) dexterity time score of the worker, and (8) other variables relating to the furniture and the homemaker.

        "description":"A demonstration project in Boston, Massachusetts, designed to meet critical needs in public service by providing part-time jobs for able women with families, chose 50 mature women college graduates from over 1,500 who were interested and 173 who were interviewed. Working half-time for 2 years in the State Department of Public Welfare, they performed exceptionally well, carrying an average of 42 family cases compared to an average of 78 cases by the full timers, with 89 percent as many personal contacts--fewer home contacts, but more telephone and office contacts. The attrition rate was 14 percent, about one third that of the full-timers, due to their maturity, commitment, and other personal factors. A 6-month feasibility study following a national survey developed recruiting  procedures and chose a site for the program which was sponsored by Catalyst, a national non-profit educational service organization. The typical woman recruit was a 45-year-old mother with three teenage children and an annual family income of between $15,000 and $20,000. This differed from the full-timers, who were 29.4 years old on the average, 32 percent of whom were married. Professional training and program acceptance by the full-timers insured its success and helped make flexible job scheduling for women an accepted practice. (AG)",

The testimony of over 230 nationally representative groups is summarized, supplemented by information from experts in the areas of consumer activity and education. Over 700 trade associations, labor unions, professional societies, and other groups were invited to submit their opinions and cost-benefit estimates concerning a possible future conversion to the metric system. The organizational summaries are grouped into seven categories: (1) labor, (2) consumer affairs, (3) education, (4)  construction, (5) engineering-related industry, (6) consumer-related industry, and (7) natural resources, transportation, health, small business, and others. The advantages and disadvantages associated with conversion include international standardization, consumer and industrial retraining and education, changing to new tools, and cost. However, 112 of these groups feel that a changeover is inevitable and desirable, although the complexity of the construction industry would require special planning. A majority of these groups favor a nationally coordinated program with some governmental assistance. (AG)",

Including all private nonfarm industries except private household services, the survey data, which relate to a payroll period in April 1970, add a new dimension to the Department of Labor's continuing research program of evaluating the economic implications of the Fair Labor Standards Act. In addition to providing an overview of existing wage and hours structures and differences or similarities when viewed by industry, region,  coverage status, or unionization, the survey provides the basis for ascertaining the benefits and the direct wage bill costs associated with proposed changes in labor provisions. Data, presented in extensive tables, indicate that: (1) The federal minimum wage is more important to employees in nonunionized than in unionized establishments, (2) The wage bill impact is greatest in the South, (3) Total hours worked during the survey week increased as average hourly earnings rose, and (4) Earnings were highest in previously covered industries, metropolitan areas, and the West, and lowest in retail trades, services, noncovered industries, and the South.

Findings from questionnaires mailed to a random sample of local school superintendents showed that consumer education was practically nonexistent in elementary schools and only occasionally available in middle schools. Relatively comprehensive coverage was provided at the high school level through courses in home economics, business education, and distributive education, with some emphasis on consumer education in other disciplines. But consumer education was not generally considered important enough to be included in the  educational programs of all students; only about one-third of the students in New Jersey's public schools had the opportunity to develop consumer skills through formal education programs. The survey indicated a need for more curriculum development, resource materials, and teacher expertise so that all disciplines in the elementary and secondary school curriculum would be involved in consumer education. Tabulated data from the survey give responses by grade level, subject area, and consumer concept. (MF)",

It was found that significant progress had been made toward meeting the overall project goal of creating a career education program in a formerly traditional school system, the David Douglas Public Schools in Portland. Major strengths of the program centered on the career clusters in the high school, the work experience program, and the career awareness program in the elementary grades. However, the critical problem was a lack of understanding by the majority of the staff of the total concept of career education. Exploratory  programs, particularly at the junior level, and additional materials, principally cluster programs and guidance and counseling services, are needed. Future evaluation would be enhanced by the development of objective indicators of achievement and performance. In addition to the questionnaires and data analyses, the appendixes include the complete report of a special evaluation activity designed and conducted by a senior class student who was also a member of the Project VIGOR advisory council. This activity centered on collecting information from ninth grade students about their knowledge and attitudes toward career education, and its findings are incorporated into the evaluation. (MF)",

System approaches to accountability are viewed from the standpoint of first, establishing goals and objectives, and second, developing systems for evaluations, feedback, and corrective action. Specific program approaches to accountability described are external performance contracting, internal performance contracting, the voucher system, external audit or EPA,  systems analysis, and PPBS.

The basic elements of the rationale for each proposed NIE program and the sequence in which they will be discussed are: (1) educational goals to be achieved, (2) variables that can be manipulated to reach the goals, (3) current practice and status of R&amp;D on the variables, (4) new R&amp;D programs that might lead to goal achievement, and (5) management and budget recommendations. The research and development programs derived from this rationale fall into four areas defined by NIE legislation: (1) basic research to increase the fund of knowledge about education, (2) improvement of current educational practice, (3) activities to build the R&amp;D capability of the  country, (4) programs to solve major educational problems. The selection of Learner Goals, Enabling Goals, and Systems Goals is based upon the opinions and work of many people and a wide range of literature sources. Learner goals have three areas: social-emotional development, cognitive development, and physical development. Enabling goals include effective selection and training of persons who work in education and effective dissemination of R&amp;D results. System goals include productivity, access, and participation.

        "description":"This report focuses on the goals of American education and suggested programs for NIE. The goals discussed are those that the American educational systems seems to be aimed at. They are classified into two main categories: output goals, essentially the ends which the system is geared to achieve, and process goals, attributes of the processes through which the putput goals are reached. A series of programs are suggested in Chapter II to serve these goals. In order to approach output goals, Program 1 recommends an intermediate phase: Operation Codify, Blueprint. This would involve collecting relevant data on the costs, effectiveness, and prerequisites of different aspects of the educational system. Program 2 recommends emphasis on expressive tests and indicators. Program 3, Project  Authority: New Styles, would seek new, more flexible structures of authority at all levels. Program 4 emphasizes the need for students to be involved in real situations and to become acquainted with different sub-cultures. Program 5 suggests Educational Concertation Centers, to help collect, coordinate, and disseminate information and resources. Program 6 proposes Technological Shortcuts as a means of economizing. Program 7 suggests Operation Dialogue as a bridge between NIE, local and state school systems, and other educational institutions. The systems approach used in this report identifies the potential barriers to the realization of goals. An analysis of the existing educational system is recommended, in order to discover why the system so often fails to meet its goals and why  educational research helps so little. Some suggestions for improving the present system conclude the report. (For related document, see AA 001 048). (Author/CK)",

        "description":"The question considered in this essay is: Given what we know about research and development in education, what might reasonably be expected from a National Institute of Education (NIE)? Two suggestions are made. One way to figure out what an NIE might be good for is to make up a list of what's wrong with American education and dream up some plausible ways in which R&amp;D might help. A more cautious way of proceeding might be to set out what we know about education and R&amp;D in advance and try to infer from that what might reasonably be expected from a government R&amp;D agency. Subjects discussed include: educational problems, defining goals for an NIE, the knowledge base, utilizing R&amp;D results, and definition of research and development. Consequences for NIE include: (1) Accepting a&quot;major problems&quot; mandate is not likely to reduce the potential for instability in an NIE; (2) Tendency toward political instability will be compounded by the fact that evaluative criteria for educational R&amp;D are murky; and (3) There is a formidable system of constraints and there's no simple way to avoid the problems they pose.

Specific purposes of this project were to use an empirical field-survey study as an armature around which to: (1) Clarify the concept of file partitioning in terms of the mechanisms by which partitioning achieves its effects; (2) Identify technical requirements and prerequisites for effective partitioning of the ERIC data base; (3) Identify alternate possible initial trial ERIC file partitions that would appear to have some reasonable likelihood of success; and (4) Recommend a general course of action to follow in obtaining still more definitive data  on which to base managerial decisions. The project involved three data-gathering activities. These were: (1) a review of current ERIC practices, (2) a review of some current ERIC-related studies, and (3) a questionnaire survey. A comparison of the 15 user-group profiles created by the cross-tabulations revealed some similarities that cut across all groups, as well as a number of differences that set the groups apart. A three-part integrated program is recommended that would provide for the development of the required improvements in the descriptive system and for the testing of candidate partitions. Program parts are: (1) Develop and elaborate nonsubject descriptors for ERIC documents; (2) Develop associations between descriptor and candidate partitions; and (3) Perform selective  dissemination of information experiment.

Library services were defined to exclude routine services such as book lists but include programs and services (1) which are offered specifically for the aging population or (2) in which at least 50% of the participants are 65 years of age or older. State library agencies, state administrations on aging, U. S.

Those identified were subsequently surveyed by questionnaire  and/or field interviews. Material was presented as findings on: (1) the scope, nature, and extent of library services to the aging, (2) financing library services to the aging, and (3) organizational and staff support for library services to the aging. Several exemplary programs and services for the aging were described. The report concludes with overall observations, conclusions, and recommendations. Major recommendations included: (1) special recognition of the aging in library legislation and organization, and (2) coordination of services to aging as a discrete program of library agencies.

Although the validity question arising from the change in student attitude toward testing sharply constricts interpretation of changes in the ACT scores obtained, the following conclusions are supported by both the 1967 and 1971 data: (1) the scores of over half of the Mexican American and  Black seniors were below the lowest quartile for the Anglo seniors; and (2) the higher the socioeconomic status of the seniors' families, the higher the scores.

The Hazelton Pennsylvania Vocational-Technical School has been placing a greater emphasis on students making more mature vocational-technical career decisions since its opening. A problem existed in developing an intensive orientation program of basic skills necessary for success in occupational choice. This was requested because of the significant percentage of students who were underachievers, lacking in basic subject matter skills. It was felt that all tenth grade pupils entering the school should experience success in this program prior to committing themselves to career choices. The purpose of this study was  to investigate the possible cause-and-effect relationship of exposing all tenth-grade pupils (Experimental Group) to a treatment condition (Orientation Program) and compare the results to a control group of eleventh grade pupils. The research conducted to test the effectiveness of the experimental teaching program led to the conclusion that the experimental teaching program was significantly superior to the conventional teaching program.",

A means for carrying out the intention of the Hazleton School District was the use of taped television presentations about selected job areas at the two levels of job awareness/career awareness and job orientation. An attempt was made to determine the effectiveness of the taped  programs in developing more positive attitudes of students toward selected careers. The experimental program was generally evaluated as a success. There was conclusive evidence that the program effected a change in the attitudes of the students. (Author/WS)",

At the present time, hundreds of teachers throughout Vermont and the United States are involved in varying degrees of Self-Selection. From these people many new approaches, ideas and problems have been generated. A number of the more popular ideas are presented. In addition, several problems which have appeared with this approach are discussed. Among these problems is that of helping the public understand the new role of the teacher and the student.

The need for different or innovative counseling is evident when one considers such problem areas as low achievement, the dropout rate, and increasing social disintegration as indicated by drug abuse, suicide, and other negative behaviors. The following problems should be dealt with: (1) Counselors must attempt to work with those who are most in need of assistance. Efforts should be made to staff counseling centers with counselors from a variety of cultural and personal backgrounds. Counselors should become aware of their biases and work toward overcoming them; (2) Counselors must attempt  to communicate understanding. Interest and concern should be shown to clients; (3) Counselors should be accessible to students. Outreach centers and 'walk in' centers should be available; (4) Counselors should be available to adults; (5) Counseling should emphasize prevention. This may be done through exemplary programs, the use of play therapy or working to improve interpersonal skills; (6) Group counseling should be emphasized. The author concludes that counseling is less pervasive than he would like it to be. Present approaches should be improved through a balance between existing methods and innovative practices.

The College and University Environment Scale (CUES) was the basic instrument used to determine whether perceptions of the college campus climate differed after an alternate freshman orientation program. Subjects were 250 college freshmen enrolled in a freshman orientation program in Oklahoma. The findings indicated that the experience of participating in a small group led by a trained peer did not change the perceptions of the freshman in such a way as to be observed on the CUES. The conclusion was reached that the attempted orientation procedures did not make a significant difference on the variables of freshman life as measured. The need  to consider the results of this study with the purpose of ongoing evaluation of programs was recommended. (Author)",

This basic premise set the stage for a joint research project on institutions of higher education which was completed in 1971. The researchers examined institutions from the perspective of members of administrative councils, faculty senates, and student governments. These subgroups' and institutions' organization dynamics (i.e. goal focus, communication adequacy, power equalization, cohesiveness, morale, resource utilization, innovativeness, adaptation, autonomy, and problem-solving adequacy) were found to be contingent on factors of human interaction and development as perceived by those interviewed. Qualities of human development (i.e.  autonomy, self-knowledge, values, allocentricism, interpersonal skills, etc.) exhibited by organizational members were closely related to the degree of organizational effectiveness observed. This program will elaborate on these research activities and share more recent work on use of the concepts. Administrators concerned with the question of organizational development in the context of human development will be given some guidelines of self-study, consultation, and educational development models.

The present study utilizes data which makes possible an analysis of the relationship between student characteristics and their migration to their college of first enrollment. The study contains information about a wide range of personal background variables plus certified data about where students enrolled as freshmen. Comparable data from two independent samples covering a four year span provides an opportunity for viewing the change or stability of the characteristics of migrating students. It was found that students who migrated to college in both 1966 and 1969 were  likely to have the following characteristics: better than average ACT Composite Scores; educational expectations at or beyond a bachelor's degree; a rural or suburban home community; a moderate to high family income; no plans to work part-time; little importance placed on low cost as influencing their choice of college and; more than the average number of extracurricular achievements. Students who attended locally were found to have converse ratings in these areas. (Author/WS)",

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the sequential perception of information received. The factors of expectancy, sequential presentation and context effects were involved in this study. Ninety college students exchanged attitude viewpoints verbally after first receiving written similarity information. Significant effects for attraction and perception of attitudes were found for verbal interaction but not  for the prior attitude information.

The criterion for the findings was composed of four mutually exclusive categories combining variables of course selection and success. The results of the study confirm the hypothesis that successful and unsuccessful students in the academic and vocational curricula differ on many of the characteristics used in the study. Therefore, when discussing characteristics of ninth grade students and their relationship to the vocational vs academic curriculum decision, the distinction between successful and unsuccessful students  is useful and necessary. In order to make the study most meaningful to counselors, a number of possible implications which follow from the findings are given: (1) Unsuccessful academic male students may choose the vocational curriculum and become potentially successful vocational students. (2) By increasing the prestige of the vocational program, more students may choose it and be successful in it. (3) Verbal and numerical ability is less necessary for success in the vocational programs than it is in the academic programs. (4) Factors not mentioned in the study are more related to success in the vocational curriculum. (Author/WS)",

The authors of this paper believe that the non-academic aspects of international education are quite frequently the factors that contribute most significantly to the success or failure of a venture from an academic standpoint. Consequently, it was felt that a report of the experiences of a developing university in exploring international education might be worthwhile. It is stated that non-academic counseling has proved to be essential if an institution is to achieve the desired goals from foreign programs. In addition, it is emphasized that the  non-academic aspects of foreign travel loom so large that it might almost be stated that a program of international education is doomed to failure from the start if considerable emphasis is not placed upon the non-academic aspects of counseling. Three cases of actual experiences taken from a travel study program abroad by the senior author are presented. (Author)",

It is stated that historically women have had to assume an aggressive role to become educated. In addition, as far back as the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, one finds records which indicate that women had to seek opportunities to study and to learn. The point is made that while on the surface it may appear to some that women willingly accepted a more subservient role in education during the early years of our history, one would need to study the culture and attitudes of the time to understand the many barriers which women had to overcome to be permitted even the minimum opportunities to seek education. The question is asked why it is taking so long for women to be recognized as  equals in education. This is followed by a discussion of the major influences upon the Women's Rights movement. The author concludes by emphasizing the importance for women of continuing to work for change and to ensure that institutions be responsive to women's needs. (Author/BW)",

In retrospect, one other function, having a good time in the process of work, was mentioned.

A survey instrument in the form of an anonymous questionnaire was developed and administered to a random sample of 164 college students in 1969. Results of the study indicated: (1) there are still numerous unanswerable questions concerning the multiple of variables related to marijuana use; (2) marijuana users cannot be automatically lumped with other drug users; (3) frequency of use may be a significant factor in attitudinal and behavioral variables; (4) the sample one studies may not be valid to generalize from; and (5) in the  past few years marijuana has been reaching increasingly younger people who mostly agree that their use will continue. Lastly the author raises a number of legal, medical, psychological, and philosophical questions regarding marijuana use. (Author/WS)",

Defense mechanisms, briefly and simply defined, are the unconscious ego defendants against unpleasure, threat, or anxiety. Sigmund Freud deserves the clinical credit for studying many mechanisms and introducing them in professional literature. The vagaries of studying and researching defense mechanisms are many and varied. In terms of rationale, consider mechanisms and the problems of copying vs. defense, instinctual vicissitude vs. defense, dynamic vs. symptom, specific defense vs. general defense, adaptiveness vs. success, basic (first order) vs. complex (second order), major vs. minor, primary gain vs. secondary gain, conscious vs. unconscious, operation unconscious vs.  system unconscious, ego boundary vs. ego, etc. Of course, there is more to defense than defense mechanisms.

These mechanisms have many similarities and have been studied diagnostically and therapeutically.

N. E. Miller did analogue-studies of displacement and substitution with rats, combining psychoanalytic and learning principles.

The process has been discussed and researched in many and varied personal-social contexts. There have been two general areas of concern: identification for positive reasons (often called developmental) and identification for negative reasons (often called defensive). The latter is the true Freudian mechanism, triggered in the unconscious ego because of unpleasure, threat or anxiety. Of course, Freud used the concept identification in different ways, as have others during and since his times.

However, little experimental research has actually been done with reaction formation.

It contains findings by selected demographic and socioeconomic variables. Findings were given in terms of raw scores, and scaled scores for each subtest and in the form of deviation IQ's based on the scaled scores for both subtests. Significant differentials in intellectual development were found for all variables considered. The strongest association found for both of these measures of intellectual development of children was a positive one with the socioeconomic status  of the family as determined by either family income or educational level of their parents. Those living in areas showing an above-average increase in population size between 1950 and 1960 rated higher than those in areas of decreasing size. (Author)",

A number of significant findings are presented. A strong positive relationship was found between rated ability or performance of children and their behavior ratings in school. Those rated above average in either of these two respects were more likely to be described as well adjusted or otherwise better behaved than their peers. Both intellectual ability and academic  performance ratings were related to the rating on the degree of acceptance of children by their classmates. Those rated above average in either respect by their teachers were also rated as being better accepted by their peers as either a team member or leader in competitive group activities than were their less able classmates.

It is mentioned that many recent entrants to these fields have made value commitments in their professionalism without very long detention at the portals of objectivity or neutrality. The concept of advocacy is discussed and comments presented on three problems faced by advocates. These are the problems of career and profession, the problem of cross-cultural and cross-class communication, and the problem of power. It is concluded that the views presented in this paper have two implications for advocates. First, to be maximally effective, local advocacy must look to national levels of resource allocation; and  second, the mobilization of people for action in their own interest is the strategic centerpiece around which advocate's services are auxiliary.

Also discussed are attitudes of peers and teachers which may discourage female students by lowering self esteem and inhibiting the motive to achieve. It is emphasized that years of interaction in which women pretend intellectual inferiority take their toll. A study is described which underscores how total and complete is the put down of the female ego. By the time she reaches college, the woman's image of the ideal female role is one devoid of high academic and  professional success. It is suggested that colleges and universities must not continue to rob female students of a positive self image, but must instead provide a structure and an environment where women can maximize the potential inherent within them.

Demographic variables were also used to compare a group of successful rehabilitated clients with a group whose cases had been closed unemployed. The subjects were 131 clients who had attended the Minneapolis Rehabilitation Center during a two-year period and whose cases had been closed at least one year. Concerning the comparison of MMPI profiles of the unsuccessful  and successful groups of clients, the results indicated that the two profile configurations were \"similar.\" It was suggested that a more profitable research task might be the development of an MMPI profile code type strongly related to rehabilitation failure.

The stimuli used, raters employed, procedure, and results are presented for two studies which were conducted. The results supported the contention that the attribution of emotional meaning from auditory stimuli is based on characteristic patterns of accoustic cues.

Results indicated that both groups were similar at the beginning of the experiment; that the judges' ratings increased significantly from pre-test to post-test for both groups; that, although there were indications that the monitor-modeling supervision was more effective, there were no significant  differences between the two groups on the post-test; and, finally, that the amount of growth from pre-test to post-test was significantly greater for the monitor-modeling group.

When rewards are contingent upon a higher comparison outcome, group task rates increase, and when rewards are contingent upon a lower comparison outcome, the rates decrease. The present investigations examine the effects on group output of reward magnitude during competitive contingencies. The studies, conducted in a special education classroom of a junior high school, demonstrated that the greater the competitive contingent reward, the more likely that group output will increase or decrease according to  the competitive contingency in effect, a reward to group members for a higher or lower task output than another group. The procedure employed that was designed to promote organized participation on \"teacher directed activities\" was the presentation of a \"button press\" task. (Author/BW)",

There was found to be a general lack of awareness, misunderstanding, neglect of children's problems in addition to limited application of existing knowledge. In spite of these barriers, it was emphasized that the child advocacy concept has fundamental appeal when it can be divorced from particular interest groups or levels of government. It was discovered that the parents of unserved troubled children represent the most potent force for change. The public schools were also mentioned as a force in society having  a stake in child advocacy planning.

These four elements are: (1) clinical teams composed of and led by trainees with leadership rotating periodically among trainees; (2) weekly experience group meetings of each team to maximize understanding at affective and cognitive levels the processes affecting team functioning; (3) small group exercises which allow teams to examine the effect of structural and social definitions of the group on its function, independent of the individuals and personalities involved; and (4) the planning, development and executing of projects with an administrative or program development purpose. The author strongly urges that current short-term courses be  modified, wherever possible, so as to include exposure to patients or clients, even if it means reduction in the didactic content of the seminar or institute.

        "description":"Externality (sense of powerlessness), as measured by Rotter's (1966) I-E scale, has been theoretically and empirically associated with low socioeconomic status and a history of insufficient reward. Recently, however, externality among white college students has been increasing. The present study sought to demonstrate the relationship of externality to a variety of measures designed to reflect adherence to new-left ideology. Subjects were 33 males and 39 females randomly selected from the total student population of a highly selective liberal arts college. Subjects were personally contacted by interviewers and responded to a questionnaire containing Rotter's I-E scale, a new-left ideology scale, a check-list of legal and illegal sociopolitical activities, and a drug use scale.  Significant positive correlations revealed externality as one component of an interrelated network of new-left beliefs, attitudes, and behavior. The relationships held only for male subjects and for those items on the I-E scale representing beliefs in personal control. Processes by which white male college students, females, and members of minority groups arrive at a sense of powerlessness are discussed in terms of reference-group identification, Rotter's social learning theory, and factors of personal adjustment.

This paper discusses the development of a program of sequential motor exercises to train and develop the inhibitory function of the hyperactive child. The inhibitory training program is designed to follow the natural development of the child and also to remediate deficits that have developed. It is mentioned that although hyperactivity appears to be multi-etiological, it chronically shows the imbalance of the excitatory and inhibitory processes. A number of psychological implications related to this training are discussed. This pattern of exercises utilizes inhibition at at three levels: (1) the innate response system, such as tonic neck response,  reciprocal response, mechanics of movement, grasp, stato-kinetic response; (2) the general motor system, using unilateral, bilateral and contralateral abilities; and (3) the special motor systems of eye-hand coordination and hand combinations.

The study examined instruments which may prove useful in the detection of change in an objective and quantifiable mode which can be subjected to statistical analysis. The subjects were undergraduate students who requested an encounter group experience. Three personality measurement instruments were administered to each of the subjects at the group's first, fourth, and eighth meetings. The results were inconsistent, but indicated that self-ratings of individuals do change over time when rated on a semantic differential scale. Proponents of the encounter group experience state that this experience  is capable of changing the way a person orients himself toward others. The results of the two groups in this study indicated the general stability of interpersonal orientations. The authors concluded by suggesting possible directions of future research. (Author/BW)",

Such an effort concerns all phases of the life and program of a community college. Particularly, however, the college turns to the counselor for expertise and leadership on how to help a student succeed academically, to work out career problems on both a short- and long-term basis, and to deal constructively with personal difficulties. Two workshops are described in this report which deal with this issue. Both workshop sessions were structured on the premise that cross cultural counseling is not only  possible, but successfully operative in both direct and analogous ways. It was suggested that since it is possible for a young counselor to deal with a geriatric population, cross-cultural counseling is also possible. (Author/BW)",

The SLD child whose learning and behavior problems are significant and are due to some visual-perceptual or organic problem and not emotional disturbance, disadvantagement, or gross sensory deficit probably accounts for no more than 3% of the school population. Changing the child's behavior is one way of improving the situation. This can be done by supplying the parents and the teacher with specific techniques for controlling behavior. The psychologist's role in this process is to get the parents and teacher to accept responsibility for developing and enforcing the structure agreed upon. The structure must be suited  to the needs of the individual child involved. The psychologist's goal is to get the parents and teacher to a point where they can control the structure being imposed and have the flexibility and insight to anticipate behavior changes. (Author)",

The project will compare the effects of treatment in this special facility with those of \"usual\" treatment in a community mental health center. At Soteria House, psychosis is viewed as a crisis in development--the organism's attempt to achieve homeostasis in the face of overwhelming stress. Because the psychotic experience is thought to have great potential for natural healing and growth, no attempt is made to abort, rechannel or quell it before it has run its natural course. In keeping with this philosophy, a staff of nonprofessional therapists have  been selected for their ability to tune into the patient's crises and have been specially trained to provide reassurance, help in problem solving, support and protection. The treatment approach requires of the staff a tolerance for regression as a sometimes necessary precondition to further psychological growth, as well as prolonged, intensive and intimate contact with patients.

Data was collected only for the IPI math program. During a four month period, a measure was obtained for each student of the degree to which they used deception in self-scoring their own math work pages. It involved deliberately inserting incorrect but plausible answers in the students' self-scoring keys and then the careful evaluation of the way in which each student handled the error. The results of this study indicated some  evidence of inconsistencies between the student's attitude toward misusing self-scoring opportunities and their actual behavior. (Author/BW)",

Also presented is a discussion of positive preventive interventions from the behavioral sciences.

It was found that both experimenter-imposed and subject-generated sentence and image mediators improved performance at acquisition, and that these effects persisted when subjects were tested again one week later. Moreover, children  who had been instructed to generate their own mediators transferred this strategy without further instruction to a new list given during the second session a week later. To evaluate the importance of mediator recall to response recognition, children in imposed mediator conditions were asked to recall the provided mediators after they had been retested (during the second session) for recognition of all responses. The proposition that recall of the mediator was a necessary but not sufficient condition for the occurrence of the facilitative experimental effects was essentially supported. (WS)",

Diagnosis of pupils referred by the schools is conducted by a team consisting of a reading clinician, psychologist, nurse and speech and hearing specialist. Based on the diagnostic screening, a highly organized instructional plan is written for each child. The child receives his individually prescribed remediation from a certified reading clinician for 1 hour a day, 5 days a week, for his assigned term. The ultimate objective of the clinic is to enable each child to benefit from regular classroom reading instruction upon completion of his remediation term. Children who test within a year of their  reading expectancy level are released from the clinic and provided with followup service by special consultants. Inservice training, provision and interpretation of diagnostic and remedial information, and consultative assistance are additional services the clinic provides. The clinic diagnosed about 730 pupils during the 1969-70 school year and remediated 532 of these children. (Author/WR)",

Children who have the potential to read at grade level but were achieving a year or more below grade level are selected for the program. In 1969-70, Project Conquest served 1,089 children in four \"reading programs\" (grades one, two, and three) and three \"reading clinics\" (grades four, five, and six). Forty-five minute sessions of remedial reading instruction are offered 4 days a week at the reading rooms and twice weekly at the reading clinics. The  inservice training component of the project prepares regular classroom teachers to use diagnostic and remedial reading techniques. At the end of a year's training the classroom teachers return to their home schools to help problem readers in their classroom and disseminate information to the school staff. On the basis of reading achievement gain scores for the children it was concluded that the program was successful in improving the reading achievement of the pupils it served. (Author/WR)",

Selection of students was based on objective criteria, defined by specially derived formulas. In general, students selected were of average intelligence but were reading from 1 to 1.5 years below their grade level. The majority of the target population served is Mexican-American. Language difficulties often associated with their background complicated the students' reading problems. Remedial labs located in each of the  target area schools are staffed by special reading teachers. Students are taught in small groups of about eight pupils for 50 to 60 minutes each day. Classroom procedures are based on the use of individually prescribed instruction. Results of teacher evaluations and follow up studies of students showed an improvement in attitudes toward self and school, and an increased ability to handle grade-level subject matter. (Author)",

Alpha One is a commercial initial reading program designed to teach first grade children to read and write sentences containing words of one, two and three syllables, and to develop and strengthen the child's self-esteem in terms of his language skills achievement. A control class of comparable first graders, instructed by an equally qualified and experienced teacher, used the school's regular reading program--the Stern Structural Reading Program. Both programs were selected to meet the special needs of the PS 115 youngsters, many of whom could not speak fluent English when they enrolled in school. At  the end of the academic year, the two groups were compared on the Sentence Reading and Word Recognition subtests of the Gates Primary Reading Test. The Alpha One group scored significantly higher in both areas than the Stern group. At the end of the first grade, the Alpha One group was reading at better than the mid-second-grade level, while the Stern group was at about the norm. (Author/WR)",

Children served by the program are located in seven target area schools, each of which has a full time remedial reading teacher. Students are admitted to the program on the basis of standardized reading results, daily classroom performance, and the evaluation of teachers and principals. The program utilizes intensive small-group instruction and uses materials and techniques different from those  used in the regular classroom. Evaluation of reading achievement improvement was based on pre-test and post-test results on the Word Knowledge and Reading tests of the Metropolitan Achievement Test battery. Test data for academic years 1968-69 and 1969-70 indicated that the program was successful in producing statistically and educationally significant reading gains in second through fourth grade children.

For one group two of the displays shared a common feature and were paired with the other response button. This common feature condition required a subject to learn only two associations if he perceived and used the two as a collative principle. For another group, the four displays shared no common feature and the four associations had to be learned. Following the original learning task, both groups were given four new displays, with common features for each of two pairs. The displays for half the subjects were printed words having a common feature of rhyme and spelling pattern. For the other half, the displays were pictures  representing the words, so the rhyming names of the pictures were the common features. When the displays were words, the fifth graders performed better than second graders. When there was no common feature, fifth graders did not excel second graders. When displays were pictures, fifth graders showed a significant transfer effect. It was concluded that ability to use a common feature economically increases with age and that common spelling patterns have little saliency for second graders. (See CS 000 176.) (Author/WR)",

The experiments involved verbal stimulus materials and employed college students as subjects. The two types of organization investigated were category clustering, or the tendency to remember conceptually related items together, and subjective organization, or the tendency for subjects to develop a relatively consistent sequence of responses across successive recall attempts. The main focus of several studies was the evaluation of the theoretical view that the amount that can be remembered is critically dependent upon the degree of organization imposed in recall by the subject. While three studies  supported this view, the results of two experiments ran counter to it. These findings suggest that a general proposition that memory is crucially dependent upon such organization is, at best premature. Studies comparing the two types of organization indicated that conceptual clustering was used more extensively than was subjective organization. Furthermore, the two types of organization appeared to reflect relatively independent strategies, and similarities were found in their temporal characteristics. (Author)",

Almost all modern methods for teaching reading include letter-sound learning somewhere in the teaching sequence, although the amount and exact placement of this training account for the central disagreement between methods.

A more valid experimental procedure might be to work with existing (or new) programs, altering small, discrete segments of the materials and methods and measuring marginal gain.

The present state of research knowledge deals with the incidence of teachers' questions, the relative frequencies with which various types of questions are asked, and taxonomies describing questions which teachers ask. Suggested contributions which can be made by researchers interested in improving the quality of classroom teaching include development of taxonomies based on the types of questions which should be asked; identification of desired changes in student behavior; determination of whether new questioning strategies have the impact on student behavior which is claimed for them;  implementation of effective teacher-training programs in the strategy and use of questioning techniques; and the fostering of inservice training programs in questioning skills.

The long-range goal is the development of a reading program to meet each child's individual needs in the public schools. Realizing the importance of the principal's role in the success of such a program, the Bureau of Elementary and Secondary Education sponsored inservice training programs to strengthen the elementary principal's supervisory responsibility to the Miller-unruh specialist teacher reading program. Each of the regional conferences focused  on the following aspects: (1) common techniques for administering the program, (2) organizational patterns in the elementary schools, (3) current research findings that have implications for inservice training, (4) current trends in program development, (5) evaluation designs pertinent to academic and affective measures of reading achievement, and (6) program direction to be considered for the coming school year.

Correlates of reading achievement, sex, IQ, age, and interest were also considered. A six-week reading rate training program was completed by the three experimental classes randomly selected in each of grades two, four, and six in Havre, Montana, schools. Standardized pre-tests and post-tests of reading rate and comprehension were administered to the nine experimental classes and nine control classes, involving 407 students. Results indicated that pupils in the grade two experimental group made a significant gain in comprehension following six weeks of reading rate training. Variation of age within the second grade experimental group showed an inverse  relationship to comprehension gain. In grade four the experimental group evidenced both a rate and comprehension gain significant at the five percent level of significance. When the groups were equated on the variable of IQ, the significant differences on rate and comprehension in grades two and four remained. None of these differences appeared to be differentiated by the sex variable or affected by the interest factor during the rate training period. (Author/WR)",

Its primary assumption was that information would help anyone who is interested in reading--regardless of his approach to the subject--determine for himself how well Americans read. The results of this assessment are reported according to a number of themes which unite groups of exercises assessing different aspects of the reading process or different skills involved in the development of reading ability. Nine basic themes were developed: (1) word meanings, (2) visual aids, (3) written directions, (4) reference materials, (5) significant facts in passages, (6) main ideas and organization of passages, (7) inferences from passages, (8) critical reading of passages, and (9)  reading rate. Objectives were developed for each of the nine themes, and they became the framework for which the reading exercises were developed. The results for both themes and objectives demonstrated that some groups exhibited a higher achievement than others on specific reading skills and that any given group exhibits higher achievements on some types of reading skills than on others.

The discussion of these assumptions may allow the controversy to be continued with a degree of cogency usually lacking. Those who condemn such books feel that the image of the college will be tarnished. This is a \"public relations\" problem in that a book, if it has an important place in the heritage of thought and culture, should be represented regardless of the community's expectations; however, the college must have rational grounds for its conduct. Three assertions remain: (1) literary choices are to be made in moral terms and on moral grounds; (2) a college should seek to impart moral or spiritual enlightenment to its  students; and (3) the justification of college study lies in its relevance to the contemporary world. Since the issues of today are extreme in their intensity and the authority of the church has diminished, the college may be tempted to assume the responsibility that religion once assumed. The adoption of these assumptions is to assume impossible expectations, and in so doing, the one task there is hope of performing could easily be deserted, i.e., the encouragement and development of the \"health of the intellect.\" (JF)",

        "description":"Two new aspects of English composition were studied in a 10-week project involving 104 Grade 7 pupils and 4 teachers. One method, the Speaking-Listening-Writing approach involved the use of dictation equipment used by students and teachers in the audio-instructional program. The second experimental method of composition involved a transformational sentence-combining program to replace instruction in formal grammar. Four different conditions of composition instruction were included: (1) audio-instructional approach to composition using sentence-combining instead of a traditional curriculum; (2) audio-instructional approach with a traditional curriculum and sentence-combining method; (3) sentence-combining model, no machines nor teacher feedback used; and (4) \"conventional\" grammar  and composition program. The results indicate that a method of composition instruction which allows the student to speak their ideas before they write them and also allows the teacher to give individual changes. No indications of any favorable changes in syntactic patterns were found. The consensus concerning the Speaking-Listening Writing approach is that further research is needed. The appendix includes references on transformational sentence-combining, audio instruction, and general information. (GR)",

Books included in the study were identified by one or more of the following factors: (1) book title and bibliographic data; (2) Sears Subject Heading; (3) grade reading level; and (4) annotation or resume. An examination of the titles revealed three identifiable themes: Tales and Legends of Ancient China (8 titles); Stories of Pre-WW II China, circa 1920-1935 (7 titles); and Chinese Americans in U. S. Chinatowns (3 titles). The titles are grouped by theme and listed by date of imprint. No picture books were identified as showing life in contemporary China  or Taiwan. Results of the survey show that (1) for the most part, the Tales and Legends of Ancient China have been well executed and that Bishop and Wiese's \"The Five Chinese Brothers\" remains the best known and most popular, exerting strong influence on young children's perceptions of Chinese people; (2) as a group, the stories of Pre-World War II China are old-fashioned and in some cases outdated; Handforth's \"Mei Li\" was found to be outstanding in this group; and (3) the stories with a U. S. Chinatown setting contain occupational stereotypes; overgeneralize the culture and traditions of Chinese Americans; and show no interaction with the dominant American society, with the exception of Hurd's \"The White Horse.\" It is recommended that authors and publishers be encouraged to produce high  quality books that present Chinese and Chinese Americans authentically.

The design included segmentation or focal unit (letter, chunk, whole word), audio (audio, no audio), and word type (List 1--pronounceable chunks, List 2--pronounced in running speech). Subjects were 48 students in Grades 3, 4, and 5 spelling classes. Computer-assisted spelling drills were utilized for the experiment, in which misspelled words were given one of the six treatments. Retention tests were given at two weeks and six weeks after acquisition. Analysis of variance on learning rates and retention revealed that List 2 words were acquired faster than List 1 words and no variables reached significance on retention tests. T-tests, computed for acquisition of  words in single sessions versus acquisition in more than one session, showed that 40 percent were massed and 60 percent acquired in more than one session. Overall t's were significant on the first retention test, indicating that distributed practice was superior to massed; however, on the second test, words were not differentially retained. Analyses of misspellings showed there were no differences in the percentages of misspellings involving errors within the four categories (additions, substitutions, omissions, and reversals). Substitutions were the most frequent error. Latency analyses indicate that correct responses have shorter mean word latencies than incorrect responses. (JF)",

The paper admittedly is not objective. The implications of two hypotheses are discussed: that learning systems are not necessarily a threat to the teaching of English and that learning systems may in fact serve as allies of English teaching. Topics considered include: the distinction between means and ends, teaching machines, systems, computer-related learning systems, reevaluation from teachers and the cybernetics industry, individualization versus individuation, education and control, systems teaching and behavioristic control, reappraisal of educational technology  business, and general evaluation of computer-involved learning.

They were interviewed and tested to measure their competence in spontaneous speech, oral and written comprehension, oral reading and explicit grammatical knowledge in Standard English morphemes often missing in Black English. The data show large individual differences in ability to use standard forms and low but significant correlation between speech and reading performance.

Results of the study  indicated that the guidelines used to plan the verbal medium complementing the nonverbal lesson resulted in students acquiring the largest amount of abstract understanding of a technical principle.

An effort was also made to validate a procedure for measuring the influence of a divergent dialect upon written free expression. Divided evenly into an experimental and control group, the students were required before and after the semester to write from dictation 50 sentences which contained 98 opportunities to make dialectally derived errors and to write a three page essay on a selected topic. Non-dialect and dialect errors were tabulated and  between-group differences computed. Results indicated a mean reduction of six errors by experimental group students in free writing. They made 8.69 fewer errors per student in the dictated sentences, while the control group reduced the average number by only one.

He proposes analysis of postpersuasive discourse as an intermediary ground encompassing these two approaches. Postpersuasive communication is conceptualized as the elements of ethos (credibility) which are separate from the verbal message but contribute to the acceptance of the message. Thus, postpersuasive messages tend to be perceived as either informational or meaningless because of their repetitive or ritualistic nature. The author discusses three situations where postpersuasive transmissions are likely to occur: dyadic, small group, and mass communication. He cites Edward T. Hall's theory of congruence as important in determining the level  and verbal quality of transmissions. The author examines the nature of television news with regard to its possible postpersuasive characteristics. Finally, he maintains that communication is an interdisciplinary study, rather than a field independent of others. (Author/RN)",

He concludes that traditional approaches are inadequate because they view evaluation as either a static measure of information comprehension or as a coercive tool. The author, instead of viewing education as static, linear communication, suggests that education is a transactional process between professor and student. Evaluation consequently would involve assessing the students ability to decode the professor's message and encode new messages, rather than simply measuring information comprehension. Instead of underestimating the student and using evaluation as a coercive or motivational tool, the author proposes that students possess self-direction and self-control and  are capable of setting their own educational objectives and assessing their progress. The author describes several industrial appraisal systems which have served as a basis for developing alternative methods of student evaluation. He reports the results of his actual applications in the college classroom. (LG)",

        "description":"One of the central issues in the philosophy of Gabriel Marcel is the distinction between &quot;problem&quot; and &quot;mystery.&quot; The author claims that speech communication scholars find it necessary to objectify elements of communication in the framework of a problem in order to find answers in the form of systematic theories to explain the phenomenon in question. Marcel, however, treats communication as subjective, which classifies it as a mystery and, therefore, not open to objective methods of investigation. The author explains Marcel's analysis of communication as a facet of man's participation in existence. She concludes with the question as to whether the communications scholar inquires out of curiosity about a problem or, in fact, out of wonder about a mystery. (RN)",

As an alternative, the author proposes the oral method, which focuses upon student-centered interaction situations. Such situations would provide the student with opportunities to develop and strengthen his language performance skills through self-motivating and group activities. Using this approach, the teacher would establish an environment which stimulates child discourse. Thus, the elementary classroom would be changed from a teacher-dominated environment of listeners to a dynamic verbal environment in which children explore their language by using it. (LG)",

The rationale is based on the goal of the course, which is to modify the student's communication behavior and his sensitivity to the forces which affect the communication process. The author reasons that this goal can best be accomplished if the student is exposed to a situation as similar as possible to a nonclassroom situation. The student in the basic speech course can best be assisted in self-discovery through an inductive approach, whereby data on audience responses to his speaking activities functions as the basis for his discoveries. In the second section, the author presents five examples of audience measurement  procedures: the Hovland attention, comprehension, acceptance scale; the Likert-type attitude scales; a general rating scale; a source credibility scale; and a demographic profile, with a sample presented in the appendix. He also provides guidelines for applying audience rating scales in the classroom. (RN)",

He views the theatrical event as an auditory, graphic, and kinetic stimulus complex derived from prolonged, violent, emotional situations. The theatrical event is conceptualized as a sign process in which a specific line of dialogue or piece of action functions in a dual manner--cognitively to identify the stage situation and aesthetically to evoke spectator response to the art on its own terms. The author concludes that the theatrical director must not be content to treat characters, events, motives, or dialogues as terminal considerations, but as part of an aesthetic \"whole\" with inherent, appreciable values.

One hundred eighty students in all-white speech classes from four Illinois high schools were placed in three categories--prejudiced, moderate, and favorable-on the basis of pretest attitude assessment. Subjects were randomly assigned from the three categories to four experimental groups and a control group. Treatment folders containing the same Black culture materials but with different instructions were distributed to the four experimental groups--(1) Exposure (reading of materials), (2) Forced Compliance (writing a pro-black persuasive speech), (3) Forced Choice Affirmative (writing an  affirmative debate brief), (4) Forced Choice Negative (writing a negative debate brief). The control group received unrelated materials and wrote a speech. Comparing pretest and post-test results, the experimenter concluded that no speech activity was clearly superior to others in causing attitude change and that Black Studies materials were most successful in changing attitudes of the most highly prejudiced students.

The study focused on the behavioral outcomes for students exposed to the open plan schools' programs. Three control county elementary schools were matched with the four open plan schools on age, socioeconomic conditions in attendance areas, and general geographic location. Students were randomly selected from these schools and observed as unobstrusively as possible during an entire school day by members of the observation team of seven principals and two master teachers. Observation results indicated a trend for these behaviors to be more readily observable in open plan schools than in the control schools: (1) pupils initiate activities that reflect their personal interests and  these activities are given a chance to flourish in the day's activities; (2) pupils make (generally) good use of opportunities to display personal responsibility; (3) cooperative planning (teacher-teacher, teacher-pupil) takes place, and (4) pupils demonstrate the spirit of inquiry by raising pertinent questions. The document contains 10 representative cases out of the 18 made and the 15 completed for the study, a selected bibliography, an explanation of the study methodology, and the principals' statement of the open plan schools' common purposes. Data from all 15 completed case studies are included in various summaries in the concluding chapter. (Author/MLF)",

However, influential groups (administrators), a precipitating event (a study report, etc.), a strong personality, a problem situation, and general predisposing factors (overcrowding) entered into the reasons for the decisions. The results of the questionnaire and the personal interviews indicate that attempts are being made to implement a developmental  concept of a middle school in up to 75 percent of operating middle schools. Respondents state that one problem is the lack of adequate teacher preparation and that teacher training should emphasize the use of technical skills for instruction, the use of media, and the development and use of new curriculums appropriate for use in a developmental school.

Results of the 3,000 person survey are presented both as comparative findings for the 11 SCSD schools involved and as response profiles for each of the schools. Survey data is summarized in graphical form for each school. The second study concerns an attempt to develop a model for an ongoing study of the intricate relationships between the physical environment and educational and behavioral objectives. The purpose of the program studied is to develop a method whereby the science teachers of Oak Grove High School, an SCSD school, may study and improve conditions within their department. Sample  survey questionnaires for students and teachers are included at the end of the report. (Photographs may reproduce poorly.) (Author/DN)",

According to the report, under certain conditions such as high financial rating, low debt service, and favorable voter approval, the GO bond usually bears a slightly lower interest rate than the authority bonds. When the financial rating of the school district is poor, the use of SPSBA bonds would probably, according to the author, save the district  interest.

Major results for the five classrooms indicate that (1) although all classrooms provide at least some form of individualized instruction, they offer widely different interpretations of a student as his own agent in the learning process; (2) subject areas are not generally integrated; (3) teachers are enthusiastic about multi-age grouping; (4) competition is  more pronounced in those classrooms that emphasize group instruction; (5) most children treat failure as a natural occurrence rather than as a threat; and (6) the teacher's role varies considerably in the five classrooms.

Data for the report were taken from the Civil Rights Commission's 1969 survey of education for Mexican Americans in the southwest and the Department of Health Education and Welfare's 1968 survey of the ethnic composition of school staff and enrollment. According to the data, Mexican American school districts in Texas are handicapped by (1) lower property valuation in Mexican American districts, which results in less revenues although higher taxes are levied; (2) overburdened lower-income Mexican Americans, even at an equal tax rate, because no tax relief is provided; and (3) the failure of State aid under the  Foundation Program to equalize the tax burden and to offset disparities in locally raised revenue. On the contrary, according to the author, the Foundation Program contributes to the inequities in local efforts by requiring Mexican American districts to pay more than their rightful share of Foundation costs.

The purpose of estimating the variable probability of improving student achievement was for use in the specification of a decision model whose purpose is to rank educational goals in terms of priority for curriculum change. To estimate the variable, questionnaires were designed to obtain the opinions of professional researchers and educators regarding the expected improvement in student performance for 40 goal areas and six different school types. The results indicated statistically significant differences among goal areas, but not among school types. However, the differences were so small as to suggest that the  questionnaires were inadequately structured to reflect sensitivity to differences between goal areas and school types. (Author/DN)",

The author looks at barriers to change and strategies for change from an administrator point of view and discusses personnel administration as it relates to educational change. The  characteristics of innovation, the adoption of an innovation, and the process of diffusion through which innovations are implemented are among other topics discussed. (Author/DN)",

These alternatives, which fall into two categories, include: (1) conventional financing through tax incomes including State and Federal aid, and (2) leasing of air rights and/or school facilities and various shared-occupancy solutions where monies are generated in connection with the actual construction of school buildings. The authors use a computer program to summarize the potential transactions between two groups: (1) a school board, the city, the State, and the Federal Government; and (2) public corporations, private developers, and money sources. Broad plans selected from computer  results include: (1) creating special school construction districts; (2) deeding school property to a public corporation and then leasing it back after it is improved; (3) acquiring urban renewal land, part of which to be used for school functions and part of which to be leased; and (4) lease-purchase. Relevant procedural and legal information is included in the discussion of each plan. The authors conclude that lease-purchasing plans, while currently subject to many legal and statutory restrictions, suggest the most promising solutions to St. Louis' educational facilities needs.

Nineteen of the cases concern the right to an education, five the right to treatment, and three placement. Relevant facts concerning the plaintiffs are examined as well as the court pronouncements. Plaintiffs for the right to education seek such measures as a declaration that the provision of unequal amounts of tuition money depending on the category of handicap is unconstitutional, and a permanent injunction requiring educational programs for the retarded in schools,  institutions, hospitals, and homes with all costs being charged to the responsible public agency. Cases about treatment protest such elements of institutional life as overcrowding, questionable medical research, lack of qualified personnel, and brutality. Considered are allegations that black children have been inappropriately classified as educable mentally retarded, and that the disproportionate number of bilingual children enrolled in classes for the mentally handicapped indicates inadequate placement procedures.

The treatment emphasized extinction of pathological behaviors through reinforcement withdrawal, aversive stimuli, or reinforcement of incompatible behavior, and language training. Measures of change included multiple response recordings of self stimulation, echolalic speech, appropriate speech, social nonverbal behavior, and appropriate play, along with Stanford Binet Intelligence Test and Vineland Social Maturity Test Scores. Results were given as group averages  followed by extensive discussions of changes in individual groups and children. Findings were summarized as follows: pathological behaviors (echolalia, self stimulation) decreased while desired behaviors (appropriate speech, play, social nonverbal behavior) increased; all children improved, some more than others; followup measures 2 years after treatment showed large differences depending upon the posttreatment environment; and reinstatement of therapy reestablished original therapeutic gains in the institutionalized children.

Mental retardation is defined as subaverage functioning which originates during the developmental period and is associated with impairment in adaptive behavior. The need for community based residential programs (group homes, hostels, apartments) is said to be underscored by the fact that traditional institutional programs serve only four% of America's over six million mentally retarded. The following aspects of services for the mentally retarded are discussed: emphasis on institutionalization, assumed roles of institutions, meeting the needs of residents in institutions, and the role of parents. It is  asserted that, traditionally, the rights of the retarded in the community (regarding education, marriage, personal autonomy, housing requirements, legal rights) and in institutions (regarding integration of men and women, educational and training programs, exploitation, discipline) have been abused, abridged, or denied.

Discussed are goals of the model, the normalization principle which states that dealing with the retarded in a normal manner helps them develop as  normal persons, and implications of the model for residential programs. Standards intended to be applicable to all facilities providing 24 hour programing services are considered including standards for admission of residents, resident living arrangements, grouping and organization of residents, resident programs, and training and education.

Negative attitudes of direct care, professional, and administrative staff toward innovative programing are considered. Resistance to change from direct care staff is said to result from adherence to established routines, intershift conflicts, loss of motivation through delays, lack of supervisory effectiveness, and lack of respect from professional aloofness. Illegitimate goals and misplaced concerns of administrative personnel are cited. Problems stemming from the bureaucratic system within which the institution operates are  examined. Inservice training programs, redeployment of staff (departmental, unit, and cross modality approaches), and demonstration projects are discussed as means of implementing change.

The following are program components: psychologically and educationally sound materials such as programed materials following a life experience approach, operant conditioning procedures in a personal and social environment, and a structured classroom (limited to 15 students with one special education teacher and two trained teacher aides). The three components are compared to the legs of a stool, all of which are necessary if the stool is to stand. It is suggested that materials build upon past experiences so as to capitalize on student preferences for associative rather than cognitive learning.  Explicitness is urged in programing, goal setting, and scheduling. The following principles of programed materials are identified as helpful: learn and be rewarded, learn in small steps, actively learn, learn with few or no errors, and learn at your own pace. Operant conditioning techniques are said to be important for gaining the control necessary for learning. The following aspects of F. Hewett's engineered classroom are discussed briefly: developmental sequence (attention, response, order, exploratory, social, mastery, achievement), learning triangle (task, reward, structure), classroom design, scheduling, and record keeping.

Each treatment condition consisted of 12 play interviews conducted by experienced therapists, students with eight sessions of training in nondirective play therapy (experimental condition), and students with training in being friendly (placebo condition). Parent evaluations indicated that positive changes were greatest for children in the experimental group, next for those in the placebo groups, and least for those in the control group. The hypothesized superiority of the experienced therapists was not confirmed. This was thought to be due  to lack of strict adherence to the techniques of nondirective play therapy. Performance ratings for the final interview indicated that the experienced therapists consistently scored significantly higher than the student therapists regardless of condition and that the scores for the experimental and placebo groups did not differ significantly from each other. In contrast, analyses for the process variables consistently indicated that the scores for the experimental group were significantly different from those of the placebo group. (Author/GW)",

Parent child and professional interaction is considered in terms of establishing a productive relationship with parents and facilitating parent child communication. Described are the parents' need for help and the teacher's role in providing emotional support in dealing with feelings, in following the prescriptions of professionals, and in developing realistic expectations and appropriate child rearing practices. Parameters of a systematic program for parent information (such as instruction in child development, handicapping conditions, behavior management, and  intervention procedures, materials and equipment) are explained. Suggested are means of helping parents to become teachers, to recognize the learning opportunities offered in the home, and to realize the impact of their child on themselves and their family. Means of developing parent participation through roles as co-experimenter and observer and through group interaction with other parents are examined. Stages in the planning of parent programs are distinguished. Provided are annotations on scope, content, and main use of approximately 40 documents concerning emotional support, information exchange, parent child interaction, and parent participation. (GW)",

Instructional materials (Mathematics, M.W. Sullivan) were employed with 50 students (aged 6 to 11 years) of whom 24 were classified as having learning disabilities and 26 were classified as normal. An effort was made to assess only the contribution of the instructional materials by keeping contaminating factors such as differences in teaching styles or behavior management procedures to a minimum. The system was found to make the following information available for decision making by  teachers: determination of student performance on three major measures by class or type of student, determination of performance on each measure by individual student, relationship of individuals' performance to that of their reference group (those in the same class and/or of the same type), distribution of performance by quartile ranking, and prediction of student performance. For both classes, there was found to be an inverse relationship between variability in performance within and across instructional materials and overall level of performance. (GW)",

Examined was a series of modifications in testing procedures that were implemented to standardize test administration practices with hearing impaired students. Data showed an overall trend for hearing impaired students to achieve better in reading than in other academic areas during the first 1 to 3 years of education. Thereafter, hearing impaired students achieved better in mathematics and in low  verbal subject areas. Data indicated that the severity of hearing loss affected reading comprehension most directly. Students with the greatest hearing loss performed best in low verbal and nonverbal academic areas such as spelling and arithmetic computation. (Author)",

For instance, it is explained that some visually handicapped children acquire mannerisms in their early years because they do not have the variety of activities to exercise their muscles that other children have. Various stimulations are suggested as means of distracting a baby's attention from habitual behavior. Techniques for strengthening confidence for walking are said to include allowing the child to use a rope or a stick as a guide initially and tying a string to favorite playthings. It is noted that deaf blind children are rarely totally deaf and  totally blind and, consequently, that it is important to provide the child with speech, language, and auditory experiences. (GW)",

Treatment effects for subjects receiving treatment plus maintenance generalized to a much greater extent over the long term than did treatment effects for subjects who received only experimental treatment. In the second experiment  five of the children were observed in family interactions in the home to determine whether the children, who were clearly deviant at school, were also behavior problems at home. Children and families examined after treatment demonstrated more child deviancy and parental negativeness than before treatment.

However since system simulation models can generate what appears to be precise data, it is well to remember that results are merely projections of what would be expected to occur if all the conditions of the model were met. Often the usefulness of a simulation model can be enhanced by interdisciplinary cooperation. Although this can cause communication problems, it frequently results in valuable insights. Three kinds of simulation models have been used in rural research; dynamic feedback commodity models, area models, and resource use models. Some of the variables that interact in simulation models are economic, physical,  cultural/sociological, and biological. Using an interdisciplinary system simulation model we should be able to anticipate the effects of a change in a rural development program on a community's population, income, environment, service facilities, and tax structure.

The system provides tools with which the user can develop and then study a nonlogical axiomatic theory along whatever lines he specifies. These tools include a proof-checking program that allows the user to construct derivations by taking advantage of the theorem-proving capabilities of the computer. Results of preliminary investigations using this computer-assisted teaching system in a manner designed to give the student greater control over the organization of his curriculum are summarized, and initial studies on the uses of mechanical theorem provers in  teaching about proof construction are outlined.

The easiest method is individual call-ins to a series of different telephone numbers that each represent a different choice or vote. The only extra equipment needed here is a device that tabulates the total number of calls reaching each number. However any sharp increase in demand for connections to a given telephone exchange can severely overload the telephone system. An alternative is to use an automatic interrogation device that sequentially calls all the participants in a discussion and either asks for their votes or collects votes stored in small attachments on each participant's telephone. Using this technique, some 50,000 participants distributed among 50  central telephone offices could have their votes tabulated and relayed to a central location in about 70 seconds. This technique will be the basis for experiments with citizen feedback in the MINERVA Project being run by The Center for Policy Research. (MG)",

For example a possible obstacle to the orderly development of two-way CATV is competition between CATV and video cassettes. However the two could complement each other if videotape materials were prepared to be sent via CATV to a subscriber's home during non-prime time and recorded on a video cassette for later viewing. There are also several design characteristics that could be built into a two-way CATV system to maximize its long-range usefulness: (1) the subscriber's home terminal could be built so that additional features would be made available by adding rather than replacing equipment; (2) significant changes in the system's central  equipment should bring significant changes in system performance without requiring changes in subscribers' equipment; (3) the transmission path connecting home terminals to the central equipment could have enough capability to meet any foreseeable demand.

Each AMI group viewed their program segment, and then all subjects responded to a written test, both immediately after viewing the program and one week later. The control group saw no programs and responded only to the immediate posttest. Results indicated that subjects in all AMI treatments had significantly higher scores on the posttest than did the control group, and that the  shorter instructional episodes were most efficient in retarding information loss over time. Appended are narration scripts of AMI programs, a log of materials costs for 30 minutes of AMI programming, a log of preparation activities and time expended in each for 30 minutes of AMI programming, and a selected bibliography.

Data gathered about teacher media involvement, student media use, and teacher characteristics suggests that high percentages of teachers use professional materials, participate in selection and consult about materials, but that they use electronic nonprint media less widely and frequently. Their students use media widely and frequently for information, but they are less involved in media presentation and preparation. Extent of media use among teachers was apparently related to previous library and audiovisual course work, academic degree attained, years of teaching, teaching level, and subject area.  Recommendations are for preservice and inservice media education for teachers, education of school media specialists to supply consultation needed by teachers, increased emphasis on creative student inquiry and flexible scheduling, and continued efforts to attain &quot;media programs that will best aid the schools in implementing their educational goals and instructional programs.&quot; (Author/SH)",

The study uses &quot;break-even&quot; analysis to determine when the costs of electronic composition become equal to composition by two conventional methods of hot metal composition and one method of photocomposition. Two equations were drawn to permit cost  comparison. The results are charted here. In general, the scale of production required to achieve a break-even situation over conventional processes for one time typesetting applications is quite high, generally higher than the typical composing firm encounters.

Large gains in learning were recorded for each of the three televised seventh-grade courses--science, mathematics and social studies. Baseline tests administered in four grades of school revealed that urban students developed conceptual abilities more quickly than rural students. Tests of general and reading ability were given to large samples of school children and here again urban students led rural students, and boys led girls. Overall attitudes were highly favorable toward the new educational innovations. Teachers and students who used instructional television were quite favorable at the beginning of the experience and even more favorable at the end. Three  quarters of the research sample of seventh-grade students showed they were aspiring to higher status careers and higher salaries than their parents. And one final conclusion that emerged strongly was the importance of thorough planning and preparation before a new system goes into the classroom. (MG)",

At the conclusion of the training program, all subjects completed a  written examination. Results of analyses of performance scores on the examination showed that the experimental group performed significantly better than the control group.

To help make better use of this technology the Office of Education has changed some of its research priorities, and has created a new unit, the National Center for Educational Technology (NCET). NCET will help to make the focus of our educational technology research more specific, to stop nickel-and-diming a lot of small studies and to start investing in a few comprehensive projects. For example the Rocky Mountain Demonstration Project has been awarded $5  million, half of NCET's fiscal 1973 budget, to try to show that some of the promises of educational technology can be realized.

Thirty-nine of 51 members replied. They recommended that a journalism minor and professional experience, in addition to teaching, be the minimum preparation for teaching journalism. Core courses in a journalism minor should include a survey of mass communication, news writing, copy editing, and newspaper make-up. Additionally, a teacher's education should include another primary teaching area along with some courses in radio/television and English. A secondary school should offer four semesters of journalism, including a one-semester course in the mass media. The courses  should stress journalistic writing and analysis of the mass media more than the actual production of a high school publication. A news bureau staffed by students also is a good idea if the school administration allows adequate released time and compensation for supervising it. (JK)",

Current children's programs are designed for the sole purpose of holding the attention of the broadest age span possible. Today's television fails to enhance the small child's surroundings and fails to show him constructive actions he can copy to resolve his own problems. During one period of monitoring children's cartoons in the San Francisco Bay Area, it was found that dramatic characters engaged in seven times as many destructive as constructive actions, and that 79% of the destructive actions were rewarded. Broadcasters have ignored the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requirement of ascertaining the needs of  their community by disregarding the needs of children. If the FCC insisted that children be included in the process of ascertaining community needs, networks would start providing more adequate programs. Until the FCC starts enforcing its ascertainment requirements, there will be no significant change in the content of children's programing. (MG)",

Varied formats were also planned for the program, and some emphasis was placed on enrolling and identifying certain groups to take the course--school teachers and Girl Scout leaders, for example.

Cost effectiveness techniques have proved to be valuable tools for commercial organizations, but the relevance to educational problems is less than clear. Theory suggests that these techniques can be useful for dealing with small, specific educational problems. (A study of large scale simulation models for university planning concluded that the cost required to implement the model exceeded the savings achieved through the use of the model.) Cost analysis is possible only where objectives can be stated and where more than one method can reach those objectives. Although some educators deny it, this situation does exist in education. At present, however, evidence  indicating the reliability and accuracy of cost effectiveness techniques applied to instructional systems simply does not exist. Empirical data on this question is needed. The technique must be applied before it can be judged. The test of its worth is whether money is saved or lost. (JK)",

An adequate schedule of local, regional, and national programs, they suggest, would cost over two and a half times the system's existing budget, and the situation is likely to grow worse unless planning to prevent duplicative new stations is  introduced. An examination of potential sources of funding did not provide grounds for any optimism -- it appears that the Federal Government cannot abdicate its responsibility for this system.

The primary focus is on the effect of instructional television on that reform. The administrative history of the 1970 school year is briefly reviewed. Learning patterns in the seventh-and eighth-grade television classes are compared with those in traditional classes. An attempt to isolate the contribution of television instruction to student learning and an analysis of the effect of television instruction on certain disadvantaged groups are described. An attitude survey to determine the effect of the reform program on teachers shows a generally favorable attitude toward televised instruction. Surveys of student attitudes and of student aspirations are presented in terms of El  Salvador's overall economic development. The longitudinal data obtained over the past two years, four different student surveys, and an interview study of parents are summarized. Two special projects--one to measure the changes in classroom teaching behavior and the other to obtain quick feedback on student learning in television classrooms--are reported. The text of the report is extensively supplemented by charts, graphs, and data tables. This document previously announced as ED 049 597. (JY)",

A simulation study was conducted at a relatively conservative campus to try to answer in detail questions about the reactions of ordinary students to campus unrest. Four politically neutral students at a time took the role of an ad hoc committee of moderate students during a three-day period turmoil. The students were provided with pre-programed television news reports of either increasing or decreasing violence, telephone access to what they thought were other groups of students taking the roles of the administration, radical students, or conservative students. They also made  decisions on courses of action for their group, which they believed were used in a computer determination of outcomes. Detailed measures of attributions to the various factions of causality, responsibility, competence, strength, activity, hostility, aggression, and support were obtained after each of the six simulation time periods. Perhaps the most interesting result obtained was that the administration was more likely than the radicals to gain political stature with moderate students if the university remained open until conflict ceased.

Twenty-five intermediate level students of treble clef wind instruments participated as subjects in the evaluation phase of the project: all students were given a listening pretest involving aural and aural-visual discrimination and a performance pretest; attended a CAI lab twice weekly which included online listening and coordinated offline practice; and completed posttests which were the same measures administered previously as pretests. Group gains in both listening and performance were significant and dramatic;  since the students had been playing these instruments for five or more years, it is presumed that the results can be attributed to the experimental treatment even without comparison with a control group.

Minimum types of validation data which should be reported to users to assist them in their selections include those which delineate the instructional context of a product: the product's purposes, target population, effectiveness, and efficiency of installation and management. The lack of user-oriented validation data on instructional products is partially related to the myopia of product developers and evaluators (who view the development process as the concern of decision makers who  are not necessarily users), is partially a function of commercial publishers' priorities, and is partially die to a lack of consumer demand.

The Council's membership criteria were reviewed and revised, its potential for service redefined and redirected, its program and operations redesigned and extended, and its support base subjected to exhaustive scrutiny. As decisions were made, the Council immediately began implementation, thus further testing the evolving model. Particular implications of the Council's location at the education/industry interface which were brought into clearer focus were: 1) the Council should assume a more  dynamic role as initiator and sponsor of national forums for constructive, action-oriented interaction of education, industry, and government; 2) it should serve as a disseminator of significant information on the uses of media in education; 3) that it should serve as a sounding board on media matters for the Office of Education.

A seven-year-old Japanese boy's development in English negation structure provides the basis for a comparison with negation usage by peer-group native speakers. The study reveals similarities between the development of both and suggests a strong influence by the peer-group native speakers on the speech of the second language learner. The implication is that any English-as-a-second-language classes involving children below the age of puberty should have maximum peer involvement, peer interaction, and teacher involvement.  (VM)",

There are two major theories regarding the funding of higher education. The first is the individual benefits theory. Those who represent this theory claim that the individual student is the primary beneficiary of the education and therefore that the student should absorb most of the costs of getting an education. Those who support the second theory, the societal benefits theory, claim that society is the main beneficiary of higher education and that society should, therefore, be responsible for the financial burdens. The author agrees with the latter theory and feels that in order for access to  higher education to be truly equal to all persons, society and not the individual must bear the major portion of education costs.

All majors were to be approved by 2 faculty members and a Special Major Committee. The question arose as to how graduate and professional schools would react to this major program when considering a student for admission. It was found through a survey of the 58 graduate departments and professional schools at SUNY-Buffalo that the student who designs his own program will be accepted to a graduate department or professional school provided he can initially compete with others on standardized measurements (grade average, letters of recommendation, standardized exams), and he documents his worth and  that of his endeavor to the admissions personnel. Most graduate departments and professional schools are only beginning to perceive the differences between student-designed programs and university-designed ones. Thus, they are somewhat hesitant, the sciences slightly more so, to embrace these new, less conventional programs. (HS)",

The first is that policy of accepting all qualified students into Yale College, regardless of ability to pay. This policy has met in the past with great controversy in light of the financial problems that higher education institutions all over the U.S. are facing. However, it is felt that the high academic standards of the College would of necessity be lowered if only those students who are able to pay the high tuition are to be granted admission. In addition, it is felt that such a policy helps to perpetuate the great American dream that any person with potential, regardless of financial background, may rise as far as his ability allows. The other policy defended in this  paper is that of granting tenure to senior professors at the University. Arguments have arisen concerning this policy on the grounds that tenure promotes laziness in professors and keeps younger persons with more advanced ideas from joining the teaching profession. It is felt at Yale, however, that those professors granted senior status have been so carefully screened before they are tenured that the University can be certain that tenure will not breed laxity. In addition, the presence of tenure promotes academic freedom that can be achieved in almost no other way. (HS)",

The major objectives of the study were: (1) to examine the long-range effects of academic acceleration; and (2) to evaluate a large scale innovation of this type in education. The general conclusion concerning the effects of acceleration on students is that these students had accepted the opportunity offered by early admission to college and capitalized on it to accelerate the development of careers with minimum  observable ill-effects both during and after college. As a large scale innovation in education, the Early Admission Program lacked 3 fundamental characteristics: a clear direction; a well-conceived research design; and a sound public relations program.

In the state of Texas, the funding formula for 4-year institutions has been broken down into specified areas such as General Administration, Student Services, Departmental Operating Expense, Organized Research, etc. It is felt that 3 areas in the funding formula deserve special consideration when planning for the upper level college. These are student services, library support and faculty salaries. The area of student services should be examined carefully to insure that adequate  funds are available for good, individual counseling in upper level institutions. The formula for library support also needs to be studied carefully to determine whether or not the present formula for 4-year institutions would be equitable to meet the needs of institutions offering only upper level and graduate work. There are distinct differences in the costs of salaries for teaching lower division and upper division courses, since lower division courses are generally taught by less experienced and lower salaried persons and upper division courses are generally taught by more experienced and higher salaried professors. Thus, it stands to reason that a separate funding formula for faculty salaries would be called for. (HS)",

Four major points should be followed closely in developing transfer policies: (1) Upper level institutions should develop programs that cater to the needs and interests of junior college graduates. (2) Upper level institutions should accept without question all graduates of junior colleges who have earned the Associate of Arts or the Associate of Science Degree. (3) Upper level institutions should set up guidelines for the general curriculum junior college students should take, but they must not quibble about specific courses. (4) Upper level institutions should give credit and  accept students on the basis of life experience as well as on formal credits earned. (HS)",

Students are claiming that if they are registered to vote in their college's state, they are legal residents of the state and thus should not be charged out-of-state tuition at state colleges. If this point of view is upheld by the courts, it is estimated that institutional income would drop somewhere between $250 to $300 million a year. It is projected that this would result in the raising of all tuitions to make up the difference, which would in turn result in the abolition of the low tuition principle upon which public higher education in America has been built.

The relationship between the adoption of 4-1-4 and changes in curricular, instructional, and administrative design and operation of these institutions was examined. Analysis indicates that the 4-1-4 colleges participating have not been thorough in defining and implementing philosophy and objectives for their interim terms and in conducting evaluations. Numerous alterations of work pattern, methods of instruction utilization of campus resources, and student-faculty interaction do occur in the interim term. Once the interim term is complete, however, there tends to be a reversion to the more typical patterns that dominate the wing  semesters. The 4-1-4 calendar and interim term curriculum appears to be a viable curricular pattern that has maintained the confidence of those institutions that have adopted it, but which has yet to reach its potential as a creative, imaginative, enriching change of pace experience.

The high percentage of unemployed professionals we are now experiencing brings us to formulate vigorous objections toward certain economic theories concerning the rate of return on education. The expectations of higher education would be less deceiving if a body of information were provided to people concerned. For example, research results about graduates or drop-outs at the beginning of their earning careers would be beneficial. This study would follow up the students in their year-to-year progression, in their graduation and their integration into the labor  force. Such a study would not consider university dropouts as wastage but would follow up these human resources so as to know the reasons why they quit school and to clarify to what extent their partial studies helped them in their jobs.

Findings are consolidated and compared with 3 previously unpublished papers: a 2-year follow-up of high school seniors who continued their educations, a similar 4-year follow-up, and a comparison of responses of two independent samples of high school seniors who took the ACT assessment in 1966 and 1969. Variables analyzed in the present study dealt with students' academic and vocational goals, educational aspirations and expectations, need for financial aid, out-of-class achievements, employment patterns while in college, use of automobiles on campus, and participation in college-related activities. Considerable differences in stability among  characteristics were found; however, the changes seem to be orderly and according to logical expectations. The utility of the findings regarding changes and stability in these characteristics for those who work with college populations are discussed, and possible applications are suggested. (Author)",

The review leads to the following conclusions: (1) Students do not take pass-fail courses in order to avoid evaluation, but once having taken them their performance in both those courses and in traditionally graded courses declines; (2) Students do not take pass-fail courses to explore areas outside of their own major, but rather do so in order to make things easier for themselves in terms of course work; (3) Freshmen suffer most academically from taking pass-fail grades and so they should not be permitted the option or they should receive special guidance when they elect to do so; (4) The elimination of failing grades on transcripts is being practiced more widely than  previously; (5) Most schools do not have major problems with pass-fail grading because they offer it only as a limited option; (6) While students who were graded on the basis of pass-fail can transfer to other institutions and can get accepted to graduate schools, they are less likely to get into the school of their choice.

This has led many people to believe that the amount of time and energy devoted to committee meetings is far greater than is justified in terms of accomplishments. The present study was designed to determine the amount of time spent at and the number of meetings held at Hofstra University. The data indicate that committee meetings are a very pervasive characteristic of life at Hofstra. Much time is devoted to them, particularly by administrative personnel, and they are very costly to the university. Assuming that it could be desirable to reduce the time spent in committee meetings, several  suggestions are made: (1) Reduce the number of committees; (2) Reduce the size of committees; and (3) Reduce the number and length of committee meetings by having them run more efficiently.

Other findings of the study include: (1) During the 1971-72 academic year the 115 predominantly black colleges and universities in the nation enrolled 208,000 of the 8.6 million students enrolled in institutions of  higher education; (2) During fiscal year 1971, 18 Federal departments or agencies provided $3.9 billion in Federal program assistance to the nation's colleges and universities; and (3) Black colleges received 86% of their Federal funds from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare as compared with 66% at other colleges and universities.

More people have been involved in the development of the 1972 plan than any preceding one. In addition to the educational community, the public at large had a voice through public hearings that were held throughout the state. The purpose of these hearings was to elicit the comments of all interested parties, to better meet the needs of society, both individually and collectively, in the area of education beyond high school. In addition, the plan underscores the necessity for optimal utilization of all post-secondary educational resources. It boldly endorses the concept that these resources include proprietary schools,  industrial laboratories, and apprenticeship programs, as well as the traditional public and private higher education institutions. The first division of the document presents the academic plan for post-secondary education, the second offers a review and analysis of master plans by educational sector, and the third division discusses the role of the Regents in postsecondary educational planning.

The successful utilization of computer facilities on a college campus is to a great extent dependent on the leadership, enthusiasm, and outlook of the personnel in charge  of such facilities.

        "description":"This document presents a report of a study that was designed to determine the rate of retention of students enrolled in colleges and universities in Tennessee that physical facility needs of institutions in the state might be determined. The first year of study, 1968, was spent in compiling information on students entering Tennessee colleges and universities. In the fall of 1969, each participating college was sent a list of the students from their institutions who were in the original sample and were asked to indicate whether each student was enrolled as of the first week in October 1969. If the students were enrolled, they were classified as persisters. Those not enrolled were surveyed, and depending upon their responses, were classified as transfers, known terminators, or  non-respondents. A similar procedure was followed in 1970 and 1971, and the data from the 1971 survey are presented here. After 3 years of school, it was found that of the original sample 34% of the students were in their original institutions, 13% were transfers, 13% were known terminators, and 40% were non-respondents.

This paper describes several external degree programs at various institutions across the U.S. Some of the unique factors featured in these programs are: (1) geographically accessible learning centers; (2) few or no residency requirements; (3) student designed curricula; (4) independent study programs; and (5) work-experience programs. Certain fears surrounding the creation of external degree programs mainly concern the deterioration of academic standards that may appear as a result of too little structure. Proponents of these programs,  however, feel that this is not a danger if 3 factors are in line: motivated students; adequate resources; and a process for proper guidance and rigorous assessment of the student.

Thus, many students do not continue their educations past the freshman year, if they even finish that year. Changes, both in academic and nonacademic areas, need to be made on college and university campuses to improve the freshman experience. One higher education institution is now offering special guidance programs and facilities for freshmen students, and another offers a peer-tutor program in which all freshmen participate. Academic innovations taking place generally center around an interdisciplinary approach to introductory freshman courses, with emphasis on close student-faculty contact. Evaluation of such  programs indicates that students are adjusting better to college life and that retention of students in later years is much greater. (HS)",

Spoken criticism and lack of participation are equally as harmful in an area such as women's studies, where total sacrifice and participation is necessary for survival. The people who resist women's studies are so numerous, the affection for intelligent women so frail, the self-destructive impulses within women's studies so tempting, the unanswered questions so complex, that it seems obvious that women's studies is in a position of weakness. In order for women's studies to survive and for women to gain the rights that should be theirs, several things are needed. More needs to be learned about a student's conscious and unconscious  needs. Men and women alike should be taught that a woman has the talent to learn; that society will reward her if she does; and that if society does not, it may be society's fault. In addition, women of differing ages, circumstances, and economic groups need to be brought into the classroom that the defects of middle-class sexual roles might be pointed out and that ambition might be encouraged.

Random samples of freshmen women students from four community colleges were selected according to the type of program in which they were enrolled--human service, business-commercial, or baccalaureate. These groups were examined in terms of four components of their self-concepts: social, occupational, academic and personel. The primary orientation for each respondent was determined, based on interviews at the beginning and end of the freshman year. Data was gathered concerning self-concept, degree of achievement and satisfaction at the end of the freshman year, realism of attitudes, college  attended, and father's occupation. Recommendations were: (1) during the summer after high school graduation, female students should be provided with an intensive guidance-counseling service; (2) the study should be continued to detect effects of different schools and curriculum in terms of student profiles; (3) a study should be conducted regarding the effects of prospective marriage on the orientation of freshmen women toward their future; (4) a follow-up study of community college female students should be conducted; and (5) a comparative study of women entering the work force directly after high school graduation and those who first complete a community college program should be initiated.

This study, conducted by a team of selected consultants, is an assessment of the program based on onsite visits, interviews, and an array of reports and publications. Areas of assessment were: (1) the legal framework, administrative structure and facilities; (2) the college curriculum; (3) the recruitment and enrollment program; (4) student services; (5) the college's self-evaluation program; and (6) the degree of the college's success. Some conclusions were: (1) the curriculum, using an interdisciplinary approach, individualized instruction, and a work internship program, provides a  relevant experience for the student; (2) team counseling has proved to be effective and should be further developed to attain its full potential; (3) there is a pronounced need for additional funding sources to aid the financially pressed student; (4) recruitment methods need to be more comprehensive; (5) the college should continue to seek ways to evaluate the degree to which it is meeting its goals and objectives; and (6) the program merits close study by education authorities in other major metropolitan areas.

A questionnaire to determine pre-course expectations, an evaluation of course procedures, and to compare the course with traditional courses, was returned by 46 of the 54 students in the classes. Some findings were: (1) the major factor influencing a student to take the course was the expectation that he could work at his own pace; (2) individualized instruction appeared to afford the student greater opportunities to assimilate course materials and  interact with the instructor; (3) the flexible scheduling did not stimulate learning because too many students tended to procrastinate; and (4) students favored the individualized course to the traditional courses, although they missed having a class identity and class discussions.

A combination of forces, including the early rise of the private 2-year college, higher education traditions, the work and attitudes of accrediting agencies, the operational definition utilized by the Office of Education, and the impact of recent Federal legislation, all contributed to the acceptance of the junior college as an institution in and of American higher education.

Emphasis is on the expanding functions and changing structure of urban community colleges, the relationship between district office and district colleges, and problems and constraints involved in programing for \"new\" community college students. Several comprehensive exemplary special programs are discussed in a special chapter. Four key problems found were: (1) the great concern about the possibilities of urban campuses \"going black\"; (2) the lack of awareness shown by faculty regarding the daily problems and circumstances of life in the ghetto; (3) budgeting models which are not particularly  relevant to urban educational programs; and (4) conflict which arises over such matters as basic assumptions and directions, staff recruitment and promotions, assignments, authority relations, and office location. Recommendations were: (1) district offices will be most effective if they act as a coordinating body rather than a governing one; (2) inner-city campuses will be more successful if they have a clearly delimited definition of institutional mission and role and carefully preplanned programs; (3) faculty, to be effective, must be sensitive, knowledgeable and adaptable; (4) community support is needed; and (5) additional sources of money are vitally important.

In addition, the costs incurred by the library in collecting fines is excessively high which is mainly due to auditing requirements. There are a large number of small fines processed at high costs. Four ways of reducing the problems were studied: increasing fines, reducing costs by improvements in file maintenance and operating procedures, reducing the amount of overdue material by  changing the length of loan, and collection of outstanding fines. The proposed fines schedule and a description of the applicable files are in the appendices to this report. (SJ)",

An outline of twelve chapters emphasizes that the proposed textbook will aid students in the development of research hypotheses; help them obtain insights into the appropriate procedures for obtaining answers to various problems in each significant mode of research; and provide information to the student on how to collect, analyze, and evaluate quantitative data rigorously in accord with the research question posed in an investigation.

This brief Amicus Curiae deals with the need of the industry and the public generally for remedies on which the growth of the information tools and resources needed to handle the exploding supply of information raw materials today has been based. The real question is whether the resort to state law remedies is in conflict with the copyright policies of Congress. The Brief argues that a state law which prohibits unfair business practices is invalidated by the supremacy clause of the Constitution only if it is in conflict with Congressional policy, and that Congressional intent to not supersede state  laws with respect to duplication of sound recordings is clear. It is concluded that federal preemption of state law is simply statutory construction and that there is no constitutional preemption. In this case there is substantial evidence of Congressional intent, not only to preserve rights created under state law, but to incorporate them as part of a total copyright scheme. (Author/SJ)",

The study was concerned with only certain aspects of such libraries, namely collection development, reader services, physical facilities, and professional staff attitudes and background. Twenty of the universities are in the United States, and two in Canada. The proposal was to examine the campuses at first hand and then interview not only librarians but also a selected number of faculty members and students. The purpose was to try to get a balanced view of the actual status of these libraries. Medical libraries were excluded in order to avoid having too broad a scope for the project. This report describes  the plan for carrying out the project, the detailed results, and some general conclusions. Descriptions of the library systems in the study and copies of the survey questionnaires are appended. (Author/SJ)",

The library should possess accurate information concerning all aspects of its operation and be aware of its measure of usefulness, thus necessitating periodic re-appraisal of the existing situation and assessing questions concerning the attitude and behaviour of the user population, and the efficiency with which services are performed. Our study attempts to determine the effectiveness of the use made of the Industrial and Management Engineering Library at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, and is the first research of its kind to be conducted by this library. Functions of the library are outlined, problems presented, and the pattern and  purpose of library visits are investigated. An attempt is made to explore, analyze and describe, key aspects in the provision and use of services rendered to faculty, staff and students. Chapters deal with data collection by means of two surveys, explain the sample chosen, and methodology of the study. Results are analyzed by means of numerous tables and, where necessary, discussions conclude the sections. The appendices include questionnaire examples and other relevant material used in the survey, as well as statistical tables. (Author)",

The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to this relatively new area. There are serious problems of applying systems engineering to libraries. This is to be expected in the case of a non-profit-making situation where the end product is an intellectual rather than a physical one. Furthermore, although librarians do commonly have an academic orientation, this is usually in the humanities rather than science or engineering. This is quite clearly reflected in library research which commonly includes substantial data collection but no models or hypotheses. Nevertheless, the past few years have seen a significant development in the  application of systems engineering to library problems. The achievement, though real, is still quite limited--especially where the behavioral aspects of library use are concerned. There is, in library systems engineering, a need and a challenge.

Task priorities based on objectives and the significant cost factor of staff time, dictate that alternatives must be examined for arriving at library utilization figures. The objective of this report is to provide an initial step for simplifying the gathering of statistics by determining if there is some relationship between the various statistics collected. The primary focus is upon two of the major time-consuming statistics collected: materials checked out for home use, and materials used within the library. Results  indicate that library use statistics can be predicted based on data collected about home use. It is recommended that the library use statistics recording be dropped using instead a figure computed from the home use count. (Author/SJ)",

Such data, together with a description of the instructional programs, provide the basis for evaluating individual programs and considering alternative programs to achieve a stated objective. With this information readily available, the basis for educational decisionmaking is improved. Also, the administrator who is accountable  to the community, can make explicit the rationale for decisions affecting the programs for which he is responsible.

Inasmuch as schools and innovated education programs are being evaluated by standardized achievement tests, a crucial and immediate need exists to improve test design, concept, scoring, and administration. When student achievement is applied as a criterion of teacher effectiveness, some teacher classroom behavior appears to be consistently associated with better student achievement. Studies of instructional methods used in classroom and  curriculum design have produced few consistent and positive results. Findings indicate that, to be effective, educators must develop methods tailored for individual ability.

The TWX System is not being overtaxed consistently by any of the satellites visited. The centers reported that several of their satellites do not use the system very often while others make moderate but steady demands. Each center and satellite did its best to verify all necessary information for each request. All of the non-member libraries visited reported that they searched their own collection first before requesting materials either by TWX or Interlibrary Loan (ILL) procedures.  Record keeping concerning request success and failure rates varies from library to library regardless of whether they belong to the TWX Network or not. Seventeen recommendations which will assist in improving the TWX service are made. (Author/NH)",

A public library service plays an indispensable part in any progressive educational system. It is particularly essential for the success of any literacy campaign and the adult education program in general. The part the Tanganyika Library Service plays in post-literacy education is the subject of this paper. The Tanganyika Library Service has been given the responsibility of promoting, establishing, equipping, managing, maintaining and developing libraries in mainland Tanzania. Emphasis of the current Five Year Development Plan (1969-1974) is on the extension of services to rural areas. The Tanganyika Library  Service promotes the publication of books by guaranteeing a market for new books through the purchase of multiple copies which are distributed to all service points in the country. The role of the library in post-literate programs is especially important in countries with a small per capita income for it is the only source of free reading material. (Author/NH)",

        "description":"The ability of various Aerospace Materials Information Center (AMIC) information specialists to prepare search strategies for document retrieval was studied by providing ten typical search request statements to seven information specialists. Each specialist prepared search strategies independently. Significant variations occurred among the strategies, although even with these variations reasonably consistent document returns resulted. The experiment indicated that the proper interpretation of a search request and the conversion of the request to an appropriate search strategy even with a well-established thesaurus is a considerably more difficult task than indexing. In another experiment, the consistency of relevance judgments among information specialists was examined. Relevance  judgment is more difficult than indexing and search strategy preparation. Agreement on nonrelevance is better than agreement on relevance. The system of relevance judgment, according to nonrelevant, partially relevant and relevant, appears optimum for AMIC. Communication between the requester, the information specialist and the retrieval system itself are of prime importance. Because of certain human interactions which must occur, some variability is unavoidable. However, current AMIC procedures of searching to achieve high recall and screening the results for relevance provide good results to the ultimate requester. (Author)",

        "description":"To determine if there are discernable effects on children of a group child-care program, the performance of 20 children, 3 to 4 years 10 months of age, who had been cared for in a day-care center from the age of 6 months is compared with that of 20 matched children with no prior day-care program experience. The 40 children participated in activities carried on in three program areas--an active area, an expressive area, and a task-oriented area. For an 8-months period, observations were obtained on all children on a point-time sampling basis; that is, during a set period of one minute, the observer noted the children's behavior in regard to (1) children's choice of locations in the program setting, (2) interaction with peers, and (3) interactions with adults. An analysis of  variance was performed on the data. The findings of the study showed that (1) there were significant differences between children with prior child-care experience and those with no prior experience: children with prior experience were located in the active area more frequently; prior-experience children were located in the expressive area and in the task area less frequently; there was more verbal interaction with a peer by the prior-experience children and they also showed more positive peer interaction; (2) there were no significant differences between the two groups in regard to time spent in snack, invitational, or outdoor play areas; in gestural or tactile interaction; and in any dimension of adult interaction; and (3) there were sex differences on time spent in active and expressive  areas and as recipients of social interaction. It is concluded that the stimulating early day-care programs had significant impact on the childrens' functioning and preferences. Tables and figures present the data. (DJ)",

The second classification, Parent-Oriented Programs, is divided into the following categories: home teaching, use of mass media for  parent education, training parents through group discussion techniques, parent education in pediatric and health facilities, training adolescents for parenthood, and parents as staff. Child-Oriented Programs with a parent component include: training parents in cognitive intervention techniques, training parents in behavior modification techniques, programs to increase parent-school cooperation and communication, and parent involvement in decision-making positions in programs affecting their children.

        "description":"Research to date has provided too few answers for vital educational questions concerning teaching children or letting them learn. A basic problem is that experimentation usually begins by accepting conventional assumptions about schooling, ignoring experiments that would entail disturbing the ordering of current educational priorities. Researchers' own conservatism is also an obstacle to decisive research. It is proposed that a proper function for the educational research community is to debate the vital issues of education, free of the constraints of present assumptions and sustained over long periods of time. One strategy for gaining verifiable convictions is illustrated in a case study which involves engaging in a program of empirical research in cognitive development and in a  systematic reexamination of the available research literature. Five features are critical: cumulative, developmental, experimental, comparative, and realistic research. The essence of the strategy is that basic research can be used to generate instructional hypotheses that are believable enough to gain public support for decisive research involving direct experimentation with instruction. The only way to find out what is teachable is by discovering how and when it can be learned with ease. (LH)",

The community studies focused on the local level delivery of federal day care programs, the availability of proprietary day care services, the participation of social and voluntary organizations, welfare-oriented services, and local economic and labor market conditions as they are related to day care. The centers were located in San Francisco, Des Moines, Greenwood (South Carolina), Milwaukee, Houston, and Sagadahoc County, Maine. They were selected on the criteria of  region, community size, types of industry and female employment, and socio-economic and racial character of the population. The studies confirmed that private baby-sitting is still the most common form of day care, that what little formal day care does exist is unorganized, that care for infants and school-age children is almost non-existent, that mothers need services not available. Other findings dealt with organization, financing, supply, quality, licensing of services, and employer and community attitudes. (LH)",

Experiment 1 compared two types of material; (a) geometric figures, whose central and incidental components were shape and color, respectively and (b) stimuli whose components were separate pictures, as in the typical developmental study of this topic. Incidental learning was found to increase significantly across ages when measures with the colored shapes but not with the pictorial materials. To identify the factors responsible for this difference, Experiment 2 employed these same two types of stimulus along with three others, including shape outlines on colored backgrounds. Again, the task with colored shapes proved to be unique, in that the incidental learning scores for this  measure tended to increase across ages and were significantly higher overall than those for the other tasks. Also, correlational analyses based on data from both experiments indicated a positive relation between central and incidental learning with the colored shapes but not with the pictorial materials. These results were interpreted to suggest that stimulus materials whose components are integrated into a single unit, such as color and shape, are functionally different from stimuli with spatially or conceptually independent components.

The evaluation assessed progress along some 36 primary goals of the show, as well as transfer effects, home background variables, parental attitudes, and socioeconomic status factors. Over 1,300 preschool children were tested, and many were observed as they viewed the show. As &quot;Sesame Street&quot; was intended primarily for disadvantaged children at home who had received no educational intervention, the major concentration in the sampling was on that subpopulation. A content analysis was made of the show; a questionnaire was administered to teachers whose classes viewed the show; and the amount of viewing for all subjects was assessed using four assessment techniques. A follow-up  study was carried out the second year of the specific subpopulation of the first study. In addition, at home disadvantaged children who had not viewed the show its first year were sampled. Results of the evaluation include the following: (1) many tests of young children that are currently in use are not adequate; (2) among the subjects, there were no significant effects due to race; (3) the show had a marked effect not only in the areas of rote learning of basic skills but also in higher areas of cognitive activity, this effect being shown by both boys and girls; (4) amount of viewing was significant in gains made; (5) the disadvantaged tended not to view as much; (6) viewing of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; affected scores on the PPVT, administered as a posttest; and (7) disadvantaged 3-year-olds  learned much of the material taught during the first year of the show.

The program goals were to assure that: (1) by the end of grade 3 or by the third year in the program children who were taught a full lesson on at least 165 school days would exceed national norms on achievement tests in reading, arithmetic, basic language concepts, and logical thinking; (2) the percentage of readers below grade 2 reading level would be negligible; (3) the children in the program would like school and demonstrate a good self-concept and self-motivation; and (4) 20% to 35% of  the parents would be involved in the program operation. The program evaluation was effected by interviews with 65 students from the three grades served by the program--kindergarten (4 classes), grade 1 (4 classes) and grade 2 (3 classes)--by interviews with parents, and by questionnaires completed by 21 staff members. The evaluation findings were as follows: (1) the students are achieving near the national norm in reading and mathematics and are achieving above the large-city norms and the D.C. median scores in both areas; (2) the children appeared happy and liked school; and (3) the majority of the parents responded favorably to the program.

        "description":"This report describes an evaluation program for the kindergartens in Williamsburg County, S.C. for 1970-71. Twenty-five kindergartens, serving 587 children in ten elementary schools in the county, were operated on a full day schedule during the 1970-71 school year. Eighty-one percent of the children enrolled were from poor families. The evaluation included pre- and post-tests. On the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, the average gain for 524 children tested was 19 months, with an average lag of 13 months still existing. On the Caldwell Preschool Inventory, the mean percentile advanced from minus 51 to plus 82, a score significantly above the nationally high average percentile of 72. On the Gates-MacGinitie Readiness Test administered in May, 1971, 513 of the 587 children were  tested. Of those tested, clearly half indicated readiness for work on auditory-visual skills with a prediction for rapid progress, nearly indicated a readiness to begin coding skills, while the remaining appear to need more time on pre-reading skills. The report concludes that the single most important factor contributing to the success of the program was team teaching. (DJ)",

The plan calls for establishing a sound county-wide kindergarten program for five year olds; providing individualized instruction; maintaining at least 90% attendance for every child; developing 90% mastery of fundamental language skills by 90% of all children entering fourth grade; eliminating extreme deficit areas in psycholinguistic abilities; and providing an environment that will enable every child to become an independent learner. To accomplish these objectives, team teachers will use sequential skills development in open classrooms containing skills  centers. Record sheets for evaluation include specific check lists for development of the following skills: gross motor, fine motor, personal-social; language, auditory perception, auditory memory, visual perception, visual memory; verbal and manual expression, phonetic analysis, picture, configuration and context clues, structural analysis, critical reading comprehension, reference skills, independent reading, functional reading, handwriting and 5 math sequences.

Twenty ECEP children were compared to a control group on the basis of a battery of pre- and post-tests after six months of intervention training. Teachers attempted to develop social-emotional adjustment and cognitive behavior. Training occurred in both group and tutorial sessions. Narrative observations, rating scales and observation of test-related behaviors were measures of social-emotional development and a battery of tests measured cognitive skill. Preliminary findings indicate that the intervention program was effective in the development of cognitive skills, especially in language, pantomime,  seriation and train building. Only sex differences are compared for social-emotional development. Boys were more cooperative, defended their possessions and were more aggressive to people and objects than girls. Girls were more compliant to demands and initiated more interactions with teachers. (DG)",

Although primarily intended for legislators and policy makers, the information is also useful to parents, caregivers, day care operators, early education specialists, program developers, and parent action groups. Three major influences shaped the final design: the  need to identify an optimal per-child annual cost for day care; to assess policy implications of the trend to shift day care out of the family home into group settings; and to explore the merits of merging day care and early childhood movements.

Half were supported by client fees, and half used other sources of funding, e.g. tax support, and private philanthropic support. Parents and teachers of 100 children in day care centers in four different communities were interviewed. Sixty-nine percent were highly satisfied and 31% were not. The group not highly satisfied tended to have more education. Satisfied parents had used the same center longer than the not satisfied group. The highly satisfied parents gave a parent-related reason for using the center, while the not highly satisfied group were seeking the center for child enrichment. Although the groups differed little in goals for the day  care program, highly satisfied parents were somewhat more interested in socialization and custody and the not satisfied tended to emphasize information and stimulation. Even though satisfied clients had more frequent staff-client interaction, the not highly satisfied involved themselves more in agency decision making. The study concludes that the not highly satisfied minority may constitute an important potential ally for child welfare planners in upgrading the level of day care service. (DJ)",

The study proposes three classes for the organization of human abilities -- cognitive, perceptual-motor, and physical. It also identifies, defines and illustrates broad categories within each class.

The research is currently focusing on attending, the manner in which infants respond to various stimuli presented to them during their earliest months. Preliminary findings indicate that the length of time of attention gives evidence of the activity levels of the infant's nervous system. Infant's response to an arresting stimulus includes: opening his eyes, expanding pupils, slowing down breathing, slowing down heart rate, decreasing motor movement, babbling in response to social stimulus, stopping babbling in response to non-social stimulus. Changes in response to stimulus  develop about the age of three months. Infants suffering from brain damage do not change their responses. Infants provided with more home environmental stimulation habituate faster to test stimuli, indicating they are more intellectually alive. Experiments relating cognitive development to shortening attentional responses indicate that this factor may be a yardstick of intellectual potential. Further studies will explore cultural implications. (DJ)",

Six of the stimulus pairs elicited significant DS-normal differences--differences related to type of stimulus variation that could not in all cases be due to possible differences in acuity.

The individuality of the neonate then shapes their responses to him and essentially creates an environment which is suitable to his particular needs. Rather than being at the mercy of the environment, the kind of infants a culture produces may perpetuate the culture and its outcome. The powerful intrauterine experiences of malnutrition, infection, and uterine depletion can seriously affect the genotype as it is reflected in neonatal behavior. When the mother can respond with expectation for his recovery, and when proper nutrition can be provided in the neonatal period, the infant is more likely to live up to his  genetic potential. When the extrauterine environment does not provide necessary nutrients and parents cannot respond to their psychological needs, the cycle of poverty and malnutrition must reproduce itself via infants who will be impaired somatically as well as psychologically.

It was hypothesized that the daily rate of social interaction for each child would be highly variable, and that the fluctuations in a child's daily rate would be accounted for by the density with which key agents provided the social stimuli. A behavioral observation coding system which provided a sequential description of each subject's interactions in continuous form was used by two trained observers. With constant monitoring, observer reliability was maintained at 86 mean percent  agreement. (Author)",

By an analysis of multiple regression it is shown that the best prediction of the ability after one year is given by the spoken language, together with tests of general school readiness and tests of reading and writing readiness. In the experiment, the effect of speech training on reading and spelling ability after the first year of school was studied. Taking into consideration the initial level of knowledge, the experimental group showed somewhat greater gains in reading and writing ability than did the  matched control group. (Author/LH)",

The Oregon Preschool Test of Interpersonal Cooperation (OPTIC System), a situational test which permits systematic observations of behavior in realistic contexts, elicits cooperative responses and permits social behavior to be quantified. Several conclusions are drawn: 1) The tendency for children to cooperation varies with situation; 2) The behavior of each member of a pair cannot be treated as statistically independent; 3) Cooperation defined as a complex, heterogeneous concept accounts for a  small but relatively stable amount of variance across situations; 4) The data indicate reasonable internal stability of the measure; and 5) Relationships between age, sex, and frequency of cooperative responses were noted.

The analysis has centered upon the policy issue of choosing the ideal blend of governmental reliance upon the private day care market, governmental support to the private day care market, and governmental funding and operation of day care facilities. This issue is discussed from the perspective of the federal government, in terms of both legislation and regulation, and from the perspective of a local administering agency. For the latter, the focus is on local planning of a day care system. The intent is to provide a framework with which to properly allocate limited resources in such a way as to avoid the usual problems associated with a rapidly expanded governmental  program.

Results of the research include the following: (1) both the general public and special interest groups approve of the concept of child care; (2) almost half of the mothers in the U.S. use some form of supplementary child care, but to a large degree, this is privately arranged care on an  individual basis; (3) day care centers are widely approved of by working women, especially poor ones; reaction to center care for all children is generally less favorable; (4) the specific issues which generate opinions are family vs. center care, cost, location, and transportation; and (5) groups that emphasize educational and child development aspects of day care feel that day care in centers is a right to which all children are entitled; in general, these groups support federally funded centers. A 50-item bibliography is included. (For related documents, see PS 005 969-975, 977-983.) (AL)",

Then the major types of available day care are described. Finally, each type of care is evaluated on the basis of available data concerning parents' satisfaction with and preference for each type of care as a whole, as well as their attitudes toward individual features of each type of care. The purpose of this evaluation is to provide the federal government with some of the information needed to select and design the delivery system that will expand the nation's supply of day care. Existing data on parents' preferences is not adequate in all areas to be considered. More research into differences in preference  among population groups and into the details of those preferences would seem necessary in order to tailor the expanded day care services to individual communities and thus, to assure maximum use nationwide. Three appendixes and a reference list accompany this report. (For related documents, see PS 005 969-976, 978-983.) (Author/AL)",

The demographic characteristics related to the participation of women in the labor force and possible changes in those characteristics are discussed, and two figures present data, as of March 1970, concerning labor force participation rates of married women by education, husband's income, and number and age of children. Attitudes related to the use of day care, past, present, and future, are then described. The final section of the report discusses demographic trends in enrollment in preschool educational programs.

        "description":"This paper presents a prototype for a comprehensive and coordinated child care training program that provides a flexible framework for administration and program design. The prototype is based on the findings of a pilot investigation of a sample of existing child care training programs. These findings suggest that there is a great need for more information in all areas concerned with training programs for child care personnel. There is also a need for more training of child care workers. The prototype has several advantages: it focuses on local needs; it is responsive to and integrated with service delivery systems; and it permits various groups to begin training activities. The training program is flexible and bases credit upon competency. As an initial step toward the  implementation of the prototype, a consortium of federal agencies, personnel of existing training programs, and others interested in training efforts, should be established at the federal level. Secondly, a detailed, nationwide study of training programs should be undertaken to determine the availability and effectiveness of such training.

The problems in defining Open Education are noted, but, in general, the events, relationships, activities and materials in the classroom are seen as being neither standardized nor routinized. Dimensions of classroom practices take into account space, activities of children, locus of activity selection by teacher or child, content or topics, time, and teacher-child relationships. The teacher's role is seen to be an authoritative one. The open-informal methods' promise of co-occurring achievements of academic, intellectual, and personal growth in children is considered to be of major significance. Proposals for  research and development efforts include focusing on preschool and primary education, opening classes which are now traditional or formal rather than opening up new experimental schools and classes, and examining the teacher role and attitudes more closely.

The proliferation of curriculum models that have been developed to stimulate the child are said to have resulted in increasing polarization of curriculum goals: skills, knowledge, and personal strengths and resources. Distinctions are drawn between the authoritarian and authoritative teacher, between teaching and performing, between children having fun and getting satisfaction, and between excitement and learning. Instead of trying to  foster excitement in children, it is stated that a more valuable purpose in education would be to strengthen a child's capacities for sustained interest and effort. Introducing things to children because they are exciting is a pervasive quality of American society, but it is pointed out that this will not produce real learning needed to overcome social, psychological, and economic problems.

To supplement these hearings, the staff was instructed to make detailed field studies following a similar pattern. The field studies published cover the following areas: the Navajo Reservation in Arizona; the State of California; the Fort Hall Reservation, Idaho; the State of Alaska; the State of Minnesota; and the States of New York and Maine. Information contained in each of the reports was gathered from a number of sources and in a variety of ways. In the case of each report except New York, personal visits were made by  members of the subcommittee, or staff, to the particular area under consideration. These visits typically included 4 persons and lasted from 1 to 3 days, preceded by 4 to 7 days of preliminary field work. Their objective was to observe first hand the conditions of Indian education; to discuss with Indian leaders, Indian parents, and Indian students their perceptions of the problems facing Indian education; and to solicit testimony and data from educational leaders and experts in mental health and other relevant fields. The objective was to define the problem and to listen to suggestions for productive new approaches to improvement. (LS)",

The question of organizing the Federal Government's responsibilities for Indian education has 4 principal components: the location in the Federal structure of prime responsibility for Indian education, the internal organization of the agency or agencies responsible, the relationship of the agency or agencies to the  Indians themselves, and the relationship of the agency or agencies to the Congress and to specific congressional committees. Recommendations concerning both the internal organization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the relationship of the Bureau to its Indian clients are made.

Specifically, the paper discusses how communications technology can considerably improve conditions in employment opportunities; educational services; health care; and social, cultural, and recreational pursuits--the major reasons for migration from rural areas. It is stated that by the year 2,000, and at the current rate, 2/3 of the people in the United States will live in 12 major urban centers. More  than 1/2 of them will be concentrated in 3 megalopolies comprising only a few percent of the country's total land area. The studies reveal that pollution and the incidence of crime per unit population increases with the size of cities. A request for the Rocky Mountain States and their Governors to join the New Rural Society project in establishing a planning and action program is included in the conclusion of this paper. (HBC)",

        "description":"Occupational knowledge among high school males from urban and rural areas in eastern Washington was assessed. Over 300 students from a sample of 22 schools were interviewed about occupations present in their region and about job information they had received. Through the use of specially constructed indices (occupational knowledge score, status knowledge scores, salary ranking scores, and salary discrepancy scores), a variety of statistical comparisons were made. The findings indicated little increase in occupational knowledge during the high school years and almost no differences in occupational information possessed by youth from several social class levels. To a limited extent, rural subjects outperformed those from small towns or metropolitan areas of residence. However,  occupational awareness did seem to be consistently related to success in school, as was indicated by higher grade point averages. In general, the findings indicated that the formal system of education had done little to insure that the students obtained an adequate understanding of the labor force. It was determined that further systematic studies of occupations should be provided contemporary youth, that the sources from which occupational understandings are drawn should be determined, and that alternative ways for improving the relationship between schools and the labor force must be found.

Subjects were selected on the basis of various language handicaps, perceptual and motor problems, and educational deprivation. The program's objectives were to provide successful experiences for Spanish American children in the areas of language learning in both English and Spanish and in improving cognitive and affective development. The evaluation design used to assess the effectiveness of REPSAC was a 2-group (experimental and control group) pre- and post-test covariance design. The control group was used to compare changes made in the experimental  group. Among some of the measures employed were developmental profiles, the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities, parent interviews, the Templin-Darley Articulation Test, and the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale. The project evaluation was provided by an independent team consisting of bilinguals; a clinical psychologist; a speech therapist; and early childhood, teacher education, and educational research specialists. Basic data, such as family history and attendance, were recorded by the project staff. The findings of the evaluation report indicate that the REPSAC project has made positive and significant impact upon the major project objectives for a group of high-risk children. Continued observations note increases in the subject's self-concept. Parents reflect positive attitudes.  (NQ)",

The following questions guided the investigation: (1) Is there a significant difference between Mexican American students and Anglo students in terms of their understanding of basic economics at the onset of a principles course in economics? (2) Is there a significant difference between Mexican American students and Anglo students in terms of their understanding of basic economics at the end of the same course? (3) Is there a significant difference in the relative gain in economic understanding between the two groups? The findings indicated  that the significant difference in economic literacy which existed between Anglo and Mexican American students at the beginning of an introductory course in economics appeared to be eliminated upon completion of the course. In the expanded study currently under investigation, the sample size has been increased from 133 to 216 Anglo and Mexican American students.

The Indian inhabitants of the community have been assimilated into the rural Mexican American subculture, which has become increasingly suburban through a process little explored in the literature on suburbanization. The study attempts to document the suburbanization of one community, to describe the problems suburbanization created, and, hopefully, to contribute toward the development of an adequate typology of suburbanization. Data is based on a combination of historical sources and 2 surveys: in the April 1972 survey, 145 interviews were completed; the second survey, completed in October 1972, was composed of 21  interviews with elected officials and influentials of Las Cruces and officers of a unique corporation--Los Indigenes. The conclusion indicates that the Tortugas community and other communities facing absorption into an urban complex do not wish to relinquish either their governmental autonomy or their life style. However, Tortugas appears to be drawn into the Las Cruces urban area by forces that appear irreversible. The people of Tortugas appear powerless to resist whatever fate leaders of the adjacent city may plan for them, be it annexation or re-creation of an Indian pueblo that never existed. (FF)",

The consultants included Mr. Kenneth Begishe, Shonto, Northwestern University; Professor Garland Bills, The University of New Mexico; Professor Kenneth Hale, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Mr. William Morgan, Sr., Navajo Community College; Mr. Paul Platero, Navajo Community College; Professor Bruce Rigsby, The University of New Mexico; Professor Oswald Werner, Northwestern University; Mr. Robert Young, Bureau of Indian Affairs; and Mr. Bernard Spolsky,  Director of Navajo Reading Project. The consultants pointed out the inadequacies of a freely collected sample, the probable need for careful eliciting of appropriate words and forms, and the strategies to be followed in further developments of this study.

        "description":"The Navajo Reading Study has been prepared for a volume describing literacy projects in the indigenous languages of the Americas. In 1969-70, 2 surveys were made to determine the present language situation of 6-year-old Navajo children. For each survey, a simple questionnaire was sent to all teachers with Navajo 6-year-olds in their classes. Replies provided data on 79% of the Navajo children born in 1964, covering 84% of those actually in school. The results for the 2 years were similar. In 1970, 29.8% of the 3,653 children were reported as knowing no English, 39% as knowing a little English but not enough for 1st grade work, 20.7% as being equally at home in English and Navajo, 5.7% as being speakers of English who knew a little Navajo, and 4.8% as knowing only English. Also,  22 adult Navajos recorded tape conversations with 200 6-year-old Navajo children at 10 different locations on the Navajo Reservation. Interviews were transcribed, in normalized orthography, and key punched for computer processing. A total of 11,128 sentences, 52,008 words (tokens) representing a total of 8,775 different words (types), were processed. Results of the processing included a complete concordance giving each word in the context of each sentence in which it occurs and a list of all the different words in alphabetical order giving frequency and range. Also discussed were the history of Navajo literacy projects, Navajo orthography, concurrent programs for adult literacy as a part of bilingual education, the Navajo reading study, and attitudes toward Navajo literacy.

Participants, mostly teachers, at the conference numbered approximately 45. The 5 texts evaluated were &quot;Mosilgai&quot; (School Cat), &quot;Jasper,&quot; Pabii Doo Masi&quot; (Puppy and Cat), &quot;Da'iida&quot; (Eat), and &quot;Hastoi Taa.&quot; Each of the books was discussed in detail by the authors, who presented the rationale behind their work, and then by conference participants, many of whom had familiarized themselves with the books through classroom use. Criticisms were presented not so much in terms of text revision, but rather in terms of future materials preparation. Also discussed were the relationship between spelling and dialect, the possibility of  alternate readers, and better fit for different dialect areas; but the discussion remained unresolved. In addition, some objections to the size of the print, essentially 12 point IBM Directory type, were discussed. It was generally agreed that for beginning readers the type size should be larger (36 point), with reduction to take place in higher level readers. (FF)",

        "description":"The norms of behavior and the expectations of a child's primary groupings were examined to determine if they were consistent with those of the larger, more impersonal society. If the norms and expectations were consistent, then primary socialization was likely to be important in shaping the child's sense of nationality. Thus, the school could be viewed as an extension of the family in achieving that objective, or it could be commissioned by society to resocialize him. This filter-effect theory of schooling was examined by means of a survey conducted in St. Lucia, a small island country of about 100,000 inhabitants in the West Indies. Data was collected from 1,448 pupils whose ages ranged from 13-14. The survey focused on 3 main questions: (1) What national type best represented  the way of life the pupil would most like to follow? (2) What language would the pupil most like to speak well? (3) Which nationality did the pupil value most? The findings indicated that rural pupils exhibited a greater preference for St. Lucian life ways, languages, and nationality in comparison to their more urban peers; and these relationships generally endured across paternal, occupational, and educational levels.

The contention was that data collected on poor children's verbal abilities had been done in incorrect social situations. Prior research had indicated that language development is innate and that disadvantaged children will be nonverbal and/or nonsensical in situations they see as threatening, while in nonthreatening situations they will display an adequate verbal ability. The object of this research was to vary sociolinguistic variables and to create symmetrical and asymmetrical situations in order to test the propositions that such variations will (1) elicit better speech samples from poor children and (2) depress the quality and quantity of speech from middle class  children. Only socioeconomic comparisons were made, though all the children were of Mexican American descent, as adjudged by Spanish surname. The sample of 40 preschool children, aged 4 and 5, was evenly divided between middle class and poor children according to which of 3 day care centers they attended--1 free, and located in the core area; the others having substantial tuitional costs. It was concluded that, when poor children are made comfortable via a symmetrical situation, they speak with greater volubility and grammatical maturity, but that middle class children function well in all social situations. It is suggested that a more accurate definition of socioeconomic status be investigated. (HBC)",

Results of the Spanish Reading and Social Education End-of-Program Tests indicated that 80% of the students attained the desired objective, a score of 80% on the tests. Level I and Level II  ESL program results indicated that if the students in the experimental group and control group had all had comparable pre-test scores, the post-test scores of the experimental group would have been significantly higher than those of the control group.

Major conclusions were that the interactional variables were relatively important for the use of family planning methods; that husband-wife interaction variables were more important than socioeconomic variables; that the higher the degree of perception of equality of men and women on the part of couples, the more likely they are to use family planning methods; that the perception of equality of men and women on the part of couples is more closely related  to the use of preventive family planning methods than their level of education; and that the level of education is more closely related to fertility than is perception of equality of men and women and the level of intimate communication.

        "description":"The purpose of the research is to extract as many common factors as possible which are associated with resistance to change. Two peoples are selected for study, the Navajo Indians and the Trappist monks, both of which are rural and have an extensive history spanning at least several centuries, but which differ radically otherwise. The 2 major perspectives used are cultural and communal. The author's personal contact with both of these people has extended over more than 2 years--living 3 months with the Navajos (in Many Farms, Arizona) in 1965 and 2 months in one of the many monasteries in the United States. Both peoples show that rural &quot;Gemeinschaftlich&quot; systems can exist effectively with industrial technology. Material traits show the least resistance to change, ideas and values  the most. Resistance is selective among both peoples. From the cultural perspective, the core to resistance is found in the religious, sexual-familial, and language systems. The communal perspective also includes the sexual-familial systems, and in addition, spatial factors (particularly isolation) and cooperation--all of which show resistance to change. Both peoples lack conflict-regulating mechanisms, and this is also seen as a factor in resistance. Women are more conservative than men in both cases. The suggested rank-order of importance of these factors in resistance to change is as follows: religion, sex, language, space, and cooperation. These 5 factors emerged as most conspicuous from the comparison study of the 2 rural peoples. (Author/FF)",

        "description":"The focus of this study is upon analyzing effective and ineffective teachers in terms of their behavior in the classroom, not in terms of their personalities or attitudes. It is suggested that 2 fundamental characteristics distinguish effective from ineffective teachers of American Indian and Eskimo students: (1) a high level of personal warmth, especially warmth communicated nonverbally through facial expression, body distance, and touch; and (2) a high level of active demandingness in the classroom--demandingness expressed as an aspect of the teacher's personal concern for the student, rather than a concern for subject matter. This study also suggests the need for pre-service and in-service training for teachers to acquire the type of interpersonal behavior that facilitates  learning among the Indian and Eskimo students. Teachers of Indian and Eskimo students were observed in 2 boarding schools and in 5 integrated urban high schools during the 1970-71 school year. The focus was on teachers of 9th grade Indian and Eskimo students. The teachers were videotaped to permit a more intensive analysis and interviewed to discuss problems of village students and effective teaching methods. The &quot;Supportive Gadflies,&quot; who exhibited personal warmth and active demandingness, appeared to be successful with the Indian and Eskimo students as compared to the other types of teachers (traditionalists, sophisticates, and sentimentalists).

Using this theory, beliefs and disbeliefs and reference category characteristics (age, sex, education, income, etc.) are examined in each study. The theory holds that \"as social actors act upon or interact with referents (things), the action takes 1 of 4 forms: (1) beliefs and opinions, (2) feelings and sentiments, (3) hypothetical responses, or (4) gross behavioral responses.\" Social action is influenced by beliefs and disbeliefs, reference category characteristics, and past  actions and experiences, which are consolidated into one--beliefs and disbeliefs. The studies examined deal with (1) the relationship of beliefs and disbeliefs to social participation in various types of organizations in the United States; (2) the exploration of the meanings of reference category characteristics; (3) the adjustment of Sudanese farm families to a new location; (4) the participation of farmers in a Lebanese village cooperative; (5) the examination of factors related to the consumption of frozen meat in suburbs of Beirut, Lebanon; and (6) community leadership and leadership structure in 2 villages in Punjab, India. Results show beliefs and disbeliefs to be dependable, independent variables in all 5 cultures and reference category characteristics to be less dependable and  more capricious for both prediction and explanation.

        "description":"A theoretical framework for integrating concepts of communication and institutional change based on experience with the Puebla Project in Mexico is given. The Puebla Project is a program to introduce high yield corn technology on a broad scale to 50,000 dry land corn farmers in Puebla, Mexico. The first part of the paper points out how institutional analyses can have limited value when restrictive concepts are used. Events observed in Puebla can be better explained by defining &quot;institution&quot; as a set of rules or norms which govern the behavior of individuals in different roles or positions. Broad scale analyses are facilitated because rules can be classified into groups as can roles. Then communication becomes an intellectual process analogous to problem solving (displaying ideas  so the idea can be transformed, not the person). The second part of the paper describes the Puebla Project in the context of Mexican development and explains the main institutional issues which were taken into account in organizing the field program. The project stresses institutional and operational factors, such as (1) continuous research and evaluation to change operating rules of both technical staff and campesinos; (2) fostering of campesino organization as a means to ensure that rule changes will be relevant, (3) direct involvement of campesinos in communicating new rules and procedures, (4) continuous on-the-job training of new personnel to expand the number of personnel who understand institutional concepts, and (5) gradual change in the rules governing the distribution of  agricultural credit and supply organizations.

The questions to which answers were sought were: (1) What specific changes are achieved over time by nutrition aides visiting rural poor mothers in their homes? (2) Is there a point of diminishing returns with home visits? Homemakers were interviewed in 1970, 1971, and 1972 to determine shifts in their knowledge, attitudes, and nutritional practices, as well as related health and child-rearing practices. Questionnaires completed by aides in 1970 and 1972 and various service records also were analyzed. Variable improvements in knowledge, attitudes, and practices were documented, and specific program components were evaluated. Effectiveness of the Expanded  Food and Nutrition Education Program was shown in relation to limited objectives. The longitudinal data on nutritional, attitudinal, and behavioral effects indicated that the impact of the aide on homemaker improvement diminishes after the first year of contact and that continuing home visits with the same homemakers in the third year are of minimal value. Original gains of the first year were not lost, but further gains were not apparent after the second year of home visits. (Author/HBC)",

The philosophy underlying these various attempts coincides with the Bureau of Indian Affairs plan to transfer their operating day schools to the State of Alaska as soon as it is economically feasible, thus eliminating the dual educational system in rural areas and placing the responsibility with the State.  As a result of the information gathered concerning Alaska's efforts, local area high schools will be developed to allow students to complete up to 4 years of secondary education in their own locality. The scope of the curriculum will be more limited than the offerings of the large regional high schools, but all local and area high schools will give a general academic program of high quality, leading to a high school diploma.

Information on Indian education in the U.S. was included to provide useful background material for a study of the Canadian situation. The dates were chosen arbitrarily to limit the scope of the research. The researchers were directed to gather data in the fields of elementary, secondary, postsecondary, and adult education in order to learn what programs were successful and who administered them. The study was to serve a dual purpose: (1) to provide information for teachers of Indian students, and (2) to find, if possible, a basic philosophy which leads to success or failure in Indian education. The major problem of Indian  educators appeared to be their failure to recognize Indians as belonging to a unique culture, distinct from the mainstream of French and English culture in Canada. Educators have tried to fit Indian students into an alien type of educational program. Included among the list of 15 recommendations for programs, projects, and courses in Native studies are the following: (1) most important, that native cultural content should be included in the educational curriculum; (2) that there is a need for complete revision of all textbooks; (3) that Indian language courses should be instituted from kindergarten through to postsecondary levels; and (4) that social studies (history) courses should be set up to educate non-Indians about the background of the Indian.

The government agencies analyzed which provide this capital are the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), The Farmers Home Administration, The Economic Development Administration, The Small Business Administration, and the Office of Economic Opportunity. Specific suggestions are that Congress (1) authorize and appropriate at least an additional $50 million for the revolving loan fund; (2) inaugurate and  establish a $200 million loan guaranty fund; (3) authorize interest subsidies on guaranteed loans; (4) authorize the BIA to sell existing revolving fund loans to financial institutions; and (5) authorize tribes to issue bonds exempt from Federal income tax for purposes related to the governmental affairs or operations of the tribe.

During the school year 1971-72, funds were provided to 20 school districts, 1 accommodation school, and 9 counties for administrative and supervisory services, special programs, and inservice training for Indian teachers. This report contains the annual report by the Division of Indian Education for the fiscal  year ending June 30, 1972, as submitted to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Statistical data is reported on the following: (1) receipts and expenditures of contract funds; (2) peripheral contract payments; (3) expenditures for State administration; (4) allotment and expenditures by districts; (5) enrollment, average daily attendance, and graduates by school; and (6) tax rates and assessed valuation by districts. The report also includes summary reports on elementary and high school Indian enrollment of Johnson-O'Malley participants. (NQ)",

In order to familiarize teachers with the Southwestern Cooperative Educational Laboratory's (SWCEL) Integrated Plan (a program in language development for 5- to 7-year-old children from different cultures), a 2-week, first generation institute for a team of selected teachers from cooperating school districts was planned. Upon returning to their home school districts, these teams were to undertake the planning, administration, and instruction of a 1-week, second generation institute for 20 teachers to convey to the  teachers the objectives and techniques of the SWCEL Plan. Instructional materials presented in the first institute were to be adapted to fit the needs of the local district. According to this plan, at the end of the second institute, 24 teachers would be able to use the specialized instructional materials, new teaching techniques, and cultural sensitivity training in the classroom. A series of bimonthly in-service training and reaction centers in the local district were to be conducted by these 24 teachers. Interaction, reaction, review, and criticism of the Integrated Plan for evaluation and revision purposes were to be provided by the teachers. (NQ)",

It was hypothesized that mass media would be an important source of information for the community leaders who would disseminate the information through personal contacts to other members of the community. It was further hypothesized that the 2-step flow of communication would be stronger in remote and isolated rural communities than in those located near urban centers. The data were collected from 3 villages at varying distances from urban centers. The sample consisted of 272 cultivators randomly selected from the 3 villages and community leaders identified by the cultivators. Major conclusions were that the mass media were an important source of  communication for community leaders and educated persons; that the cultivators relied heavily on the leaders for information regarding innovation; and that the 2-step flow of communication was more significant in the remote village as compared to villages closer to urban centers.

The survey covered the type of programs in existence, the number of children being serviced, the number of Indian pupils enrolled in such programs, and, if no programs existed, the number of children needing special services. All 24 target schools responded to a 3-page survey. In most cases, the survey was completed by the school principal with the assistance of the special education teachers (the breakdown by individual schools is contained in Appendix A). As a follow-up to this survey,  the results of the survey and their implications were discussed at a 1-day meeting of school psychologists and psychometrists in the service area. Within the 24 target schools, 1,250 students of the total 8,025 student population were Indian, indicating that within the schools surveyed there was not a disproportionate enrollment of Indian pupils in Educable Mentally Retarded (EMR) and Educationally Handicapped (EH) classes. It is stated that this report undoubtedly contains some inaccuracy in the identification of students as being a member of one ethnic group or another; however, this report does represent a good sample of the total number of Indian pupils enrolled in programs for EMR (10) and EH (23) within the 24 target schools surveyed.

Also attending were Humboldt State personnel from the fields of education and psychology. The workshop was intended to bring together the practicing school psychologists to discuss educational problems of American Indian children within the service area. The problems of accurately conducting diagnostic evaluations of Indian students for special education placement or for other such purposes was of primary concern. A pre-questionnaire was administered to determine what instruments and procedures are currently used. The questionnaire was analyzed by  tabulating responses and by running a factor analysis of correlations among responses. The education problem was seen as having 2 basic sources: (1) school--poor teaching, poor expectancies on the part of educators, irrelevant material, vast difference in environment from home; and (2) home and cultural factors--poor use of language by parents, unfavorable perception of education, different goals and values, and so on. The solutions decided upon were to develop a wide range of learning skills, more flexibility in educational programs, preschool work, smaller classes, better diagnostics, special instruction, and stressing of positive aspects of child's performance in communication with the home. The respondents also suggested that better instruments are needed for testing minority group  children. (FF)",

        "description":"Thomas Carroll's address, delivered during 1972 Earth Week celebrations, discusses the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) activities in environmental education. A review of the EPA role in environmental education is given, indicating the need for developing a conceptual framework to improve program planning by EPA and related federal agencies. Such analysis will make known which environmental education programs should receive priority as most likely to achieve pollution abatement goals. The concern for environmental protection, causing a concurrent increase in concern for environmental leadership, has led the Agency to sponsor a number of learning opportunities: formal education, informal learning, and manpower development and training. Activities in each of these areas are  briefly summarized. Formal education taking place in the classroom emphasizes a problem solving approach to the environment and encourages an understanding of the tradeoffs involved in various pollution control activities. Informal learning, which encompasses civic action, attempts to motivate people to act in an environmentally concerned way. Manpower development and training consists of a broad array of programs to develop a highly skilled work force for implementing EPA's mission to abate and control pollution. (BL)",

The preliminary working paper, by Ernest Burkman, James DeRose, and Clifford Swartz, and summaries of the three working groups of the conference are also included. The conference concluded that the present high school science program, with its relatively uncorrelated and inflexible sequence of biology, chemistry, and physics is not suitable for the majority of high school students because it tends to overemphasize &quot;pure&quot; science and  neglect the social implications of science and technology. Conferees agreed that a totally unified program, designed to cross traditional subject boundaries and include materials from more areas of science, including social science, should be introduced. To increase flexibility to cater to individual differences in interests and abilities, a three-year program based on one- to three-week relatively independent units was recommended. This would also allow science to be seen as a subset of a total educational program. (Several pages may be light.) (AL)",

The objectives of the workshop were to study how elements of population and family education can be incorporated in the curriculum of secondary and possible upper elementary levels of education; to prepare a few sample curriculum units in terms of analysis of content objectives; and to develop appropriate curriculum materials. Chapter 1 is devoted to the definition and objectives of population education while Chapter 2 deals with the writing of instructional materials. In Chapter 3 strategies for establishing a population education program are discussed.  These strategies include convincing the appropriate people of the need for the program, planning and coordinating the various program elements, incorporating population education content into existing curricula, and developing the non-curricular aspects as teacher education and research. A summary of major conclusions is offered in Chapter 4. Appended material outlines an approach to population education concepts and content through studies in social sciences and natural sciences at three educational levels.

In addition, an attempt was made to compare testing practices of pre-service science teachers with another population of science teachers. The sample was drawn from secondary science majors enrolled in the science methods course and in student teaching. Two sample tests, obtained from pre-service science teachers, were analyzed and categorized according to the six levels of \"Bloom's Taxonomy.\" The pre-, Post-, and delayed post-instructional data for determining  subjects' attitudes toward the \"taxonomy\" were obtained by means of Word Association Scale (included in this report). The data were analyzed by factorial analysis methods. The results showed that tests prepared during student teaching contained higher proportions of knowledge level items than the tests prepared during the methods course. (Author/PS)",

This program is based upon the creation of behavior involving the realms of cognitive, affective, and normative domains, which is hoped will result in the individual's abstinence from the use of drugs. The program was not written by \"experts\" in the field of drugs and narcotics nor by a professional writer, but by experienced classroom teachers.

Generally, it is written in outline style and organized according to three areas: content, suggested student activities, and resources and materials.

The sample was drawn from a regular high school physics class. During the experiment, no instruction was carried out by any teacher. An auto-instructional system was developed and provided for use by students. Materials included lesson guides, cassette tape recordings, flip-card presentations, and chapter tests. The unit covered during the treatment was selected from Project Physics curriculum materials which were in use in the school. The students had access to a room with independent and movable carrels. Pre-test scores were found to be slightly below the national norms. The post-test scores on the unit learned during the  experiment were slightly higher than the national norm. The experiment was supervised by a non-science proctor who was responsible for coordination and checking the materials in and out to students. Self evaluations after each topic were regarded by students as very helpful. The student opinion survey, however, revealed that students preferred instruction by a physics teacher rather than through the auto-instructional approach. (PS)",

Results of remedial mathematics instruction for disadvantaged students in grades three through seven during the 1971-72 school year are compared. The report describes the CAI program and the non-CAI program; reviews the literature on experiences others have had with CAI; and includes data on the attitudes of students and teachers toward the programs, on comparison of students in each program on the basis of standardized test scores, and on costs of the programs. The study concludes that CAI programs were not more effective than non-CAI programs in generating student development in mathematics,  recommends that both types of programs be strengthened, and makes three suggestions for guidelines for programs in compensatory mathematics funded under Title I.

The purpose of this report is to: (1) identify known research pertaining to environmental education, (2) review critically the identified research, and (3) identify areas for further research. Studies selected (94) include: (1) attempts at objective evaluation of programs, outcomes, attitudes, and administrative procedures, and (2) works related to elementary-secondary school, college or adult levels of educational concern. The review is limited to research completed since  1950 with the exception of certain documents of historic significance. Summary statements indicate that researchers addressed themselves to numerous aspects of environmental education, such as problems of philosophy, program development, evaluation of instructional materials, selection of sites appropriate for learning, and outcomes of programs. None of them, however, appeared to have considered environmental education on other than a local, regional, or national basis.

It is hypothesized that, after controlling for variation in community expectations for educational services, and ability to pay, districts differing in levels of local resource utilization will exhibit characteristic variations in the structuring of political-system processes relating school boards to their constitutents. The paper also examines what structures undertake the processes relating school boards to their constitutents and how socioeconomic-status differences among districts affect the structuring of  political processes. Among the findings, it is noted that referendum is an important process through which community expectations and ability to pay find ultimate expression within school district government and that higher-status communities are more likely to effectively institutionalize a caucus for the recruitment of school board members. The study also identified distinctive patterns of board-community relations in districts differing in levels of local resource utilization. (GC)",

        "description":"A rationale for interdisciplinary elementary social studies materials produced and field tested by the Project Social Studies Curriculum Center is presented in this document. World change is taken into account in courses which focus on understanding culture, valuing human dignity, freedom of choice, and the individual. This emphasis leads to the broad program goal of citizenship education in the social studies and in the school. Inquiry teaching strategies encourage pupils to learn through the discovery process and to set up hypotheses by recalling concepts and generalizations learned by experiences and previous classes. Nine sections included in the booklet are: 1) the need for curricular change; 2) curriculum tasks undertaken by the staff in developing its program; 3) the  social sciences or sources for the curriculum; 4) the philosophical considerations of the curriculum developers; 5) the role of the school in a democratic society; 6) teaching strategies; 7) eight criteria for selecting topics of study; 8) a brief framework of the elementary school program; and, 9) three general principles of curriculum organization used in grades 1 through 4.

        "description":"In determining whether an increase in student cognitions in the content area of international trade is correlated with an attitudinal change toward policy issues surrounding that subject, a microeconomics principles class at Riverside City College was used to test the hypothesis that a change in the cognitive component will cause a change in the affective component. Prior to and following instruction on foreign trade, the class was given a cognitive meaning device to test student knowledge of the subject and an attitudinal survey related to free trade and tariffs. Three control groups were used: an introductory college psychology class given no instruction on foreign trade but given the pre- post-tests, a small subset of the experimental group measured by post-test only (to  control for &quot;sensitizing&quot; as a result of the pre-test), and a class of graduate students in economics (to check on the hypothesis that an increase in knowledge about foreign trade should result in an attitude supporting free trade). It was concluded that cognitive and attitudinal changes had a strong positive correlation and that perhaps just a basic understanding of facts about free trade is sufficient to elicit a definite change and a very &quot;pro-free trade&quot; attitude.

        "description":"To determine short-run effects of experimentally imposed leadership roles, a sample of 221 Boy Scouts (aged 10 to 17) was formed into (usually) 4-man teams that competed in 3 skill games. One member of each team was randomly designated as captain, with power to administer and reward. Captains who were leaders in their troops responded to becoming captains with an increased sense of elan. Captains who were not leaders responded with decreased elan; in some cases, withdrew from relating to others; and were ineffective as captains. (These effects were unrelated to team success.) It was concluded that attempting to confer status on a low-status boy through outside intervention is, in the short run, potentially harmful and does not immediately increase achievement motivation. This  report contains a literature review; discussions of the subjects, apparatus, procedures, games, use of the Thematic Apperception Test and of adjective checklists related to subjects' self-assessments of such variables as achievement and aggression, subjects' reactions to the experiment and its components, study variables, and statistical analyses; results of statistical analyses in terms of such factors as being a captain and correlates of leadership rank; and instructions given to team captains for playing the games.

        "description":"Identification of behavioral correlates of differential teacher expectations for pupil performance is made through a system of dyadic interaction analysis. Observable differences in secondary teachers' behavior with pupils from whom they expect high achievement and pupils from whom they expect low achievement are measured in seven social studies classrooms in schools which serve pupils from a wide range of socio-economic backgrounds and which do not employ ability grouping. Comparison of the findings of this study is made with those of previous studies conducted with experienced teachers in junior high math, reading, and social studies classes, in self-contained elementary classrooms, and in a laboratory study employing student-teachers and high school pupils. The outcomes of  this study suggest not only further research to replicate, refine, and extend these findings, but also efforts to involve classroom teachers in identifying and modifying behavior patterns which might contribute to the fulfillment of their negative expectations.

The procedure involves obtaining individual predictions, aggregating results, presenting results to the individuals, and having individuals evaluate predictions. A RAND Corporation study to predict major developments in population growth, probability and prevention of war, future weapon systems, automation, space progress and scientific breakthrough illustrates the mechanics of the technique. The potential of the procedure for resource forecasting, application of the technique to establish city planning goals, and a discussion of a modified version of the  procedure as used in teaching a graduate course in research methodology indicate the possible value of the Delphi technique in incorporating variables in research and in attempting to identify priorities at various spatial scales of planning.

A curriculum based upon this sequential interdisciplinary content process approach helps students to organize categories of knowledge, to see that there are many ways of looking at a concept, and to glean from all disciplines new and varied understandings. Six sections introduce the topic; define the content-process approach; present conceptual frameworks for the organization and integration of social studies knowledge in economics, geography, history, political science, and sociology; illustrate how social studies concepts can be  meaningfully related to generalizations which evolve from specific content materials at various grade levels; emphasize the importance of inquiry techniques in helping students to realize the desired cognitive and affective objectives; and lastly, provide a model for selecting and evaluating social studies learning experiences.

It is defined as a program which provides for a study of the population situation of the family, community, nation and world, with the purpose of developing in the students rational and responsible attitudes and behavior toward that situation. It is independent of sex education, family life education, and environmental education; related in the sense that each developed as a result of social change and social needs. The approach and attitudes to population education has a recent history, but the real concern in some nations has provided the impetus to develop various programs. An examination of programs in several countries shows difficulties encountered and reveals varied approaches. National  attitudes and support, non-flexible and established educational programs, out-of-school influences (as from religious groups), medical programs, and educators all have had effects on a given nation's efforts, both negative and positive. Integration into existing curriculum is a common approach, with educators being charged with the responsibility. An international approach through an agency such as UNESCO could provide unifying aspects among countries and eliminate duplication of effort. Proper population education should enable each student to make an individual and responsible decision regarding family planning. (Author/JMB)",

Previous citizenship assessment reports are described in ED 049 111, ED 049 112, ED 049 113, and SO 002 917. Citizenship exercises incorporating forty objectives grouped into nine major citizenship goals were administered to respondents who indicated level of parent education. The color of each respondent was noted by the exercise administrator. Earlier National Assessment reports gave results for four sizes of community. A problem which occurs in interpreting results, the fact that characteristics such as color, type of community, and parental education are highly related  in the population sampled, was offset in this study by the use of balancing methodology. Findings for all ages combined show that, in general, respondents from educationally advantaged homes and affluent communities achieve substantially more than those from less advantaged settings. More specifically, findings show that: respondents whose parents had education beyond high school succeeded about 12% more often; those from affluent suburban neighborhoods succeeded about 11% over inner city areas, and over rural areas about 9% more often; and Non-Blacks succeeded about 11% more often than Blacks on the Citizenship exercises.

Problems established prior to the study included: 1) uncertainty about a \"common core\"; 2) the need for special attitude measures as well as knowledge tests; 3) strong out-of-school influences on a child's political socialization; and 4) terminology with political overtones creating difficulties in conceptualization. The development of measures of both the cognitive and the affective domain followed similar stages: A detailed conceptual framework was drawn up, based on content analysis of country documents and pilot interviews; a variety of instruments were designed using different questioning techniques; and the sets of questionnaires were  tried, tested, and revised through pilot stages. One major finding showed that political awareness and perception of community develop only gradually in children. Greater unity than expected was revealed among countries toward attitudes and values. Steps of development are discussed, problems with questioning techniques and solutions are examined, and many sets of questions are included to illustrate how final measuring techniques were created. As the result of pre-testing and analysis, a shortened and improved set of questionnaires was finalized for the evaluation set for 1970. (JMB)",

These items were developed to measure concept attainment using a completely crossed design with 30 concepts and 12 tasks. Conventional factor analyses were performed, separately for boys and girls, for concept scores and for task scores. Three-mode factor analyses were performed. The main conclusions drawn from the results of the conventional factor analyses are that all 30 of the concepts are measures of a single functional relationship existing among the concepts and that all 12 tasks are measures of a single underlying ability or latent trait. The three-mode results indicate that there are no important concept-task interactions for the idealized persons; thus it is reasonable to  regard the concepts and the tasks as being two independent modes.

Several aspects of economic planning and institutional arrangements should be scrutinized if progress is to be made in improving the articulation from school to work. Today's society, with its lack of synchronization among economic progress, educational aspirations, intra-education objectives, world-of-work needs, employment opportunities, and financial resources available to education, poses the need for new appraisals and new  solutions to link education to development and development to education.

Questionnaires and group interviews with teachers and pupils and classroom observation provide the data for evaluation. Investigation and analysis is made in the following areas: the determinants and effects of a pupil's perception of his parents' attitudes toward school; the relationships of peer liking patterns in the classroom to pupil attitudes and performance; the relationship of teacher attitudes to pupil  attitudes and performance; the relative impact of parent, peer, and teacher factors on pupil performance; and the determinants and effects of teacher-pupil compatibility patterns.

The matrix is based upon the decision contexts of content and process and is designed to help differentiate between varying intellectual positions, techniques, and strategies. Patterns of instruction which emerge are labeled: I) scientific, discipline-centered; II) humanistic, discipline-centered; III) scientific, problem-centered; and IV) humanistic, problem-centered. Each paradigm offers a basic curriculum and instruction option to teachers, and each competes with the others for professional recognition and acceptance.

The statement of problems in educational research when education is defined as cultural transmission implies equal interest in all parties involved in educational systems and transactions, as well as in the social context within which learning takes place. In research anthropologists move beyond interests in the cognitive and affective domains of childhood experience and include the study of patterns of cultural transmission.

Although C. E. Black's model is general, i.e. it applies to all countries, the author applies this model specifically to the countries of China and Japan. Black examines a society's entrance into a modern era by using categories of intellectual, political, economics, social, and psychological revolutions. Students can not only adapt this system of comparison, but can go further and investigate the leadership of a modernizing society, analyzing the thrust of such impact through examination of four steps: the challenge of modernity, the  consolidation of modernizing leadership, economic and social transformation, and the integration of society.

The unit on China employs case studies of Chinese communities through which students study the physical setting, real life, and the ideal life of a Chinese community.

The author refutes Horowitz's arguments of bringing Third World nations up to the same production and consumption levels as the nations of the First and Second Worlds and the position of others who offer that technology and education constitute a solution, since the crucial problem is survival. To meet this problem it is suggested that a design for cultural survival such as conceived by Skinner be created requiring  design, investment, and a self discipline implying \"the development of a technology of behavior which prescribes social contingencies that will create behaviors in line with the main cultural values.\" Neither an individual nor a nation has unlimited rights when survival of the world is at stake.

Two groups of subjects--upperclass and graduate students from UCLA--were asked to generate and rate value categories relating to higher education and the quality of life. The initial lists (300 and 250 items respectively) were aggregated by the experimental teams to 45 and 48 items respectively. The subjects then rated all possible pairs of these items with respect to their similarity. The average similarity ratings were analyzed by a clustering routine. Subjects from both groups made estimates of the relative contributions of each of the educational categories to each of the quality of life categories. The primary data analyses concerned  the importance rating. Three aspects were examined: the quality of the distributions of the responses, the correlation between ratings by different groups and different rating techniques, and the amount of change and degree of convergence upon iteration with feedback. The experiment furnished support for the conclusion that Delphi procedures are appropriate for processing value material as well as factual material. The substantive data concerning higher education and individual life also indicated the possibility that current notions of the role of the university are somewhat loosely tied to the basic interests of the students.

Continued evaluation of progress of handicapped and more typical children at the laboratory school training setting indicated that their achievement and self-concept levels have been maintained or enhanced. Evaluation of trainee progress indicated that attitudes were improved and tendency to individualize increased, but that the use of attitudes and skills attained was largely contingent on the involvement and  support of principals and superintendents where they were to be employed. Evaluation of impact on the community and institutions was couched in terms of activities that occurred partially because of project promotion.

Two elementary schools in Surry County, North Carolina, have been operating under the Title III Grant since its inception. Prior to the opening of school in the fall of 1968, a one-week, in-service program was held for all teachers involved in the project. Teachers were assigned in teams of three or four with the service of an aide. The group was responsible for the total instruction of all children assigned to the team. Different methods of assigning students to groups were used, including years in school and achievement levels. Consultant assistance  was used on a limited scale.

The behaviors are asking observation questions, asking interpretation questions, acknowledging and reinforcing pupil responses, extending pupil responses, and probing pupil responses. The manual, Handbook on Questioning and Using Pupil Responses in Teaching Science, was evaluated and revised through field tests with elementary teacher education students who studied the manual and practiced the teacher behaviors in science lessons taught to elementary pupils. An analysis of covariance of the results of a test on classifying teacher behaviors administered in a pretest-posttest control group design indicated that the students who participated  in the main field test improved significantly in their ability to identify the behaviors. Frequency counts of the use of the teacher behaviors were made for 12 subjects, all of whom taught the same topics on two separate occasions. Analysis of the data yielded a pattern in the group's average use of the behaviors in the two lessons. The pattern can be used in establishing performance standards for teacher trainees.

The syllabus format in this bulletin is designed to provide points of view and major ideas and guides for developing teaching plans. A general overview  gives a rationale for each course. This is followed by the main body of the syllabus: understandings and related content. Emphasis is upon teachers devising and using those methods by which pupils are motivated to work with study materials in such ways that the pupils themselves discover the desired understandings. In the seventh grade syllabus Pre-Columbian discovery, exploration, and colonization periods are studied; however, primary emphasis is upon studying aspects of culture in New York state. Grade 8 shifts to the national scene, with the study of United States history from the period of independence to the present. (Author/SJM)",

Historians are constructing new paradigms of the discipline structure by stressing theory, methodology, and by relating historical knowledge to general knowledge, all pointing to the necessity of an interdisciplinary approach to promote good scholarship and analytic history. New perspectives are reflected in historians' works but not in curriculum structure. The profession could incorporate changes, first, by delineating theories of curriculum accepted by history departments, and second, by examining tactics utilized to transform the curriculum, eight of which are: 1) structuring  curriculum to reflect a particular theory of history; 2) introducing new methodology courses; 3) providing alternative courses of study; 4) using senior level interdisciplinary seminars; 5) encouraging a particular approach to history through requirements; 6) incorporating area studies courses into the curriculum; 7) using national history at an introductory level; and 8) developing courses with topical and thematic approaches. Historians and educators, if able to harmonize curriculum structures with the new paradigms in historical thinking, could revitalize higher education. (SJM)",

The major thrust of Unit 2, Developmental and Psychological Bases, is that life stages can best be understood in reference to their antecedents and what may follow. Traditionally not taught as a single unit,  the three concepts of Unit 3, Perception, Learning Motivation, Emotion, have been combined in the hope that effective presentation will raise the students' level of interest. Unit 4, Personality and Social Behavior, most closely matches students' concepts of psychology.

        "description":"The purpose of this research was to perform computer analysis and modification of complex musical tones and to develop models of perceptual and learning processes in music. Analysis of the physical attributes of sound (frequency, intensity, and harmonic content, versus time) provided necessary information about the musical parameters of intonation, vibrato, dynamics, and rhythm. A general purpose digital computer and appropriate analog devices were utilized to analyze and synthesize complex musical tones. The procedures included the transformation of audio tapes of music to digital tapes via a high speed analog-to-digital converter system. The significance of the research is based on the belief that: 1) objectifying certain parameters of musical performance will have a direct  bearing on behavioral goals and methods of music education; and, 2) an understanding of the total problem of human information processing requires a detailed investigation of structured non-verbal stimuli in the auditory mode. Two supplementary investigations are included: Computer Analysis of Musical Performance, by Warren C. Campbell (Appendix I) and The Effects of the Attack Transient on Aural Recognition of Instrumental Timbres, by Ralph C. Thayer, Jr. (Appendix II). Appendix III, Computer Analysis System Software, by Jack Owens, describes a library of computer programs used to perform certain basic mathematical analyses of the digitized musical performances.

The player takes the role of a congressman who discovers that he must engage in \"log-rolling\", acceptance of which is the main dependent variable measured in the study. Three other variables investigated are the student's subjective estimate of the prevalence of log-rolling in congress, his political efficacy, and his intention to participate in the political process. One control and four experimental treatments were employed for this study. The scores show that: 1) both game structure  and role identification contribute to the effectiveness of the game in changing student attitudes toward acceptance of log-rolling; 2) students think a great deal of log-rolling occurs; 3) student political efficacy decreased slightly after playing the game; and 4) student intention to participate in the political process was not significantly affected. The results have implications for curriculum designers concerned about the impact of materials on student attitudes. (SJM)",

The major research problem of the study concerned the possible differences in the verbal behavior patterns of college supervisors while interacting with student teachers and cooperating teachers. The Supervisory Interaction System developed by Blumberg defines 15 categories of verbal behavior that can occur during a conference between supervisor and teacher. Ten categories reflect supervisor behavior, four indicate teacher behavior, and one indicates silence or confusion during the conference. Thirty-four taped conferences between supervisors and cooperating teachers were collected  during the spring semester 1968-69 and served as the basis for this study. Each type of verbal behavior was identified and quantified as a ratio or percentage derived from the analysis of data. Data from each conference were utilized for each of the behaviors relevant to this study. Data analysis revealed that the supervisors utilized in this study did behave differently when they were interacting with student teachers from when these same supervisors interacted with cooperating teachers. This was not true for all behavior categories of the Supervisory Interaction System, but in several different behaviors that do seem to be important in the area of teacher education. Further implications and a 21-item bibliography are included. (MJM)",

Data were based on the Institutional Change Model developed by an Educational Professional Development Act (EPDA) project. Participants of the study were principals of 12 elementary schools. Six schools contained educational consultant teams while, for control purposes the remaining six did not. Schools were selected from among 54 from 18 counties and 21 school corporations within the reach of university-based consultant teams. A two-part empirically validated questionnaire was individually administered to each of 12 participants. Part 1 of the questionnaire consisted of open-ended questions designed to a) identify  innovations, b) determine the cause of innovations, and c) determine the value placed on the innovation. Part 2 of the questionnaire consisted of 24 Likert-type items designed to elicit participants' attitudes toward topics associated with the acceptance of innovation and individualized learning. Each participant was visited twice by the investigator. The results of the inquiry indicated that at the school level there was greater change in the predicated direction among schools using the model than among those not using it. The use of consultants, when an impasse occurred or more training was required, was critical to the successful implementation of the model. A 6-item bibliography and appendixes are included.

Teachers from five randomly selected schools received training in the use of Parsons' Guided Self-Analysis (GSA), the other group became a control group. There were three fifth and three sixth grade teachers in each group. Each teacher was videotaped four or more times after treatment began. The pupils in the classes were pre- and post-Tested, using two published critical thinking tests. The test results and the first and last sets of videotapes were the sources of data used for the  study. The two groups of teachers were not significantly different on 13 variables of teacher behavior prior to treatment. The two groups of classes of pupils were not significantly different on 7 variables of pupil behavior prior to treatment. At the end of 13 weeks of treatment, the two groups of teachers were statistically different on 4 of 7 variables. These differences were attributed to treatment effects.

English schools have developed three methods which supplement the training provided by universities. These three methods of praparing teachers for the Integrated Day include the advisory, teachers' centers, and the teachers' workshops. The advisory consists of 20 people, employed by the County Education Authority to provide support, reeducation, inspiration, and  tangible aids to the county teachers.

Community size and type and percent of white pupils in the teacher's classes were formulated as independent classification variables, along with sex of teacher and teaching level, and were examined for differential effects on teacher perceptions. Three hundred forty-one education graduates from the University of Georgia, identified as being employed full-time in teaching, returned a February, 1970 questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of three sections: 1) classification information about and attitudinal information toward the teaching situation of the  graduate; 2) evaluation of aspects of a teacher preparation program as general education, foundation courses, and professional experiences; and 3) a 30-item Likert-type instrument measuring attitudes toward education. Four major conclusions concerned 1) response of female graduates and elementary teachers to educational philosophy; 2) reaction of suburban and inner-city teachers to items concerning sociological foundations; 3) perceptions of rural teachers and teachers of all white classes concerning preservice preparation and the most subject centered educational attitudes; and 4) response of inner-city teachers and those with less than 50 percent white classes concerning faculty and community acceptance, philosophical congruence, satisfaction with teaching, and adequacy of preparation.

        "description":"This paper presents some teaching components which might serve as a basis for developing and improving teaching skills. Five interactive teaching functions are studied: managing classroom behavior, asking questions, interacting verbally, communicating nonverbally, and reinforcing pupil behavior. Managing classroom behavior deals with the teacher's control techniques and their effect on the conduct of pupils. Asking questions studies a) the way teachers phrase questions, b) the way teachers elicit pupil responses, and c) the thought level of teacher questions. Interacting verbally presents a model for teacher use, the Interaction Analysis Category System. Categories for interaction analysis include the direct and indirect influence of teacher talk, student talk, and silence.  Nonverbal communication includes the use of body language, consisting of facial expressions, gesture and control maneuvers and certain classroom elements such as the use of space, time, and teacher travel. The fifth function studies the reinforcement of pupil behavior using the teacher, pupil, and peer group as change agents. Throughout this study, emphasis is placed on the quality of methods teachers use to implement teaching functions. Knowledge of alternatives and greater discrimination in their use will hopefully aid teachers to perform more rationally and influence more positively the classroom learning behavior of pupils.

        "description":"The Ford Training and Placement Program, organized by the Department and Graduate School of Education of the University of Chicago in cooperation with the Chicago Board of Education, trains and places new teachers in inner-city schools and retrains the teachers already in those schools. The program features a social system's approach to the training and placement of educational professionals at various grade levels and in various subject areas. Five characteristics of the program include 1) function; 2) content; 3) structure; 4) process; and 5) interaction of function, content, structure, and process. The need to specify program functions concerns the problems to be addressed, the frame of reference with which to view the problems, and the functions to be performed. The content  of the program is a four-faceted operation: focused preparation of preservice personnel, co-ordinated preparation (training in common with others who would work in inner-city schools), selection of the induction or target schools, and creation of cadres or teams (university and school based). Structure of the program was viewed in terms of an effective and stable staff. The fourth characteristic stresses a complex process by which the program maintains itself and undergoes revision. The final characteristic is the effective and efficient interaction among the elements in the program. General outcomes indicating the success of the program included the unqualified success of six cadres and a 62 percent return of interns to the inner-city school where they trained. An 18-item bibliography is  included. (MJM)",

A class of 60 beginning teacher trainees was randomly divided into two groups. All subjects were given a pretest that required them to make three oral explanations in response to three questions asked by an experimenter; the questions and answers were tape-recorded. Following the pretest, half of the class received the \"How To Explain\" manual as the basis for training; the other half did not. After training, all subjects were given a posttest consisting of three new questions. Randomly ordered answers for each subject were played to 10 raters, who were seventh- and eighth-grade students. The students rated each answer on four dimensions: a) organization, b) clarity, c)  quality, and d) rank among the six answers for that subject. Subsequently, six experimental and six control subjects were randomly selected, their posttest answers only were transcribed, and these answers were rated and coded by trained judges on six dimensions a) content validity, b) logical organization, c) verbal emphasis, d) rule-example-rule, e) lesson divisions, and f) vagueness--in an attempt to determine whether the explanations of the experimental group reflect the emphasis on these six dimensions in the \"How To Explain\" manual. Results indicate that the manual and the total program in which it was used had significant effects in the experimental group's explanations. A 35-item bibliography and appendixes are included.

The first portion explains five learning centers which are labelled according to purpose: idiosyncratic, social ecology, performing arts, academic, or skills. The principles supporting the need for learning centers include the following: 1) New models of learning are required to provide strategies for collective action and personal developments. 2) New ways of educaton must be developed to support the new possibilities of communications technology.  3) The present educational system was constructed for a status-oriented, slowly changing society. 4) There is a need to increase commonalty and diversity simultaneously. 5) The present classroom setting and teacher role are obsolete. Finally, the principles of this new educational theory and the means to implement these concepts are discussed in relation to achieving the final goal of reconstructed educational institutions.

These strategies concerned three areas: 1) cooperating institutions, 2) system development approaches, and 3) functional context programming. To develop the strengths of several agencies, a consortium of cooperating agencies included 1) agencies with competence in D,D&amp;E installation and maintenance of training systems; 2) a junior college with competence in and commitment to the development and service of vocationally oriented curricula; 3) a college which is willing to develop and provide graduate level programs in D,D&amp;E work; and 4) representation from educational, community, and student interests. Key procedures were the examination of  the problem specification of expected outcomes, conceptual design and planning, prototype development, operational testing, revision and additional operational testing, and packaging for implementation and dissemination. The third area of stress, functional context learning, provides a meaningful orientation to the entire job for which the student is being trained, introduces and organizes topics so that the relevance of each to the whole job can be demonstrated to the student at the time the topic is introduced, follows a whole-to-part sequence in teaching functions and procedures, and programs instruction for each student so that he learns a graded series of tasks.

For each output, the output standards used;  the tasks performed to generate the output; and the knowledges, skills, and sensitivities that enabled the output to be generated were identified. The analyses of the 20 projects yielded 962 project outputs, each classified by the conceptual categories. Results indicated that the greatest response differences were between development and evaluation projects, and the least differences were found between research and evaluation project activities.

Twenty University of Minnesota juniors who were preparing to be secondary school science teachers were randomly assigned to a control group or one of two experimental groups. Each subject taught 10-minute lessons on one of three topics: color, heat transfer, or simple machines. On the basis of audiotapes of the lessons, questions were categorized as low and high level and rates of pupil and teacher talk determined. Fourteen of the original group completed  their student teaching experience and participated in the follow-up study. Each student teacher audiotaped several of what they considered to be their best class sessions. These tapes were analysed for rates of low and high level questions, pupil-initiated content questions, and pupil and teacher talk. Results of the study illustrated the usefulness of operant methodology in teacher education as a means for changing teacher behavior. These behavioral changes were found to be stable over a 1-year period. (MJM)",

On 5- and 35-day retention measures, the advance organizer-only group was significantly better than a no-treatment control. The advance organizer plus learning group was significantly better than a learning-only group on the shorter retention period but not on the longer. The advance organizer-only group was the only group to not decline in score over the 35-day interval  between measures. Results indicate the learners, after learning suitable principles at a high level of generality, are able to generate with some degree of accuracy specific answers to questions. Learners also seem to be able to retain the organizing principle well enough to regenerate answers as long as 32 days without a decrement in score. A 28-item bibliography is included. (Author/MJM)",

According to the author performance objectives are written sets of behaviors that the student may perform in order to demonstrate achievement. A minimal pattern of performance objectives should be mandated for all student teachers. Research suggests a hierarchy of ten levels of role behavior engaged in by student teachers. The students progress from inner directed to outer directed activities. Students vary in their degree of proficiency at the onset of student teaching thus prohibiting structured time periods. Performance objectives and the ten classifications of behavior enable the student to analyze the whole role of the teacher and decide where his  university classroom experiences fit. These objectives help to orient the student teacher to the role of teachers, enable him to interpret the behavior he observes, and help him to act in response to his observations. Performance objectives also serve as a planning guide for supervising teachers enabling them to help the student see the total picture of the teacher's role. Student teachers, supervising teachers, and university supervisors may use performance objectives to improve communication, plan activities, perceive behavior, and assess performance. Ten checklists of performance objectives and an appendix with a weekly behavioral objective report are included. (MJM)",

Further activities of the Task Force included on-site visits to relevant experimental and demonstration projects, systems analysis of Jarvis, simulated experimentation in model building and cooperation with the original model builders and the Consortium of Southern Colleges for Teacher Education in model  refinements and/or development. The most important conclusions are a) that Jarvis Christian College purposes might be more effectively met by the adoption of systems methods in each area of the college's operation, b) that the Teacher Education Program or &quot;new models&quot; program has relevance not only for departments of education but also Arts and Sciences and higher education, and c) that a total institutional thrust is required in the reconstruction of teacher education or any other system component.

The program identifies desirable performance standards for teachers, evaluates the trainees' achievement of these performance levels, and observes the effect of the trainees' performance upon the public school students with whom they work. Ten undergraduates attend morning classes at the theatre and at the college, spend afternoons working as Urban Corps Interns in supervised classes in elementary schools evolving theory out of direct experience, and engage in self-examination during workshops which further such learning aids as group dynamics, play creation, and  role playing. Evaluation of the pilot course by teachers and principals working with students during the 1970-71 school year demonstrated that the competence of any teacher in any discipline for any age level can be greatly increased by an awareness of the use of dramatic technique, especially when supported by the classes and workshops already noted.

During the time they are in school, the students work with children in small groups or on an individual basis. The primary function is to help develop skills such as reading and mathematics. They also aid in other curricular areas, and occasionally they help their supervising teacher prepare and present lessons. One of the program's requirements is that students must spend 8 hours per week working with social agencies and community  projects. Students are also required to enroll in psychology, sociology, political science, human growth and development, and educational methods. Their involvement in these courses is largely integrated with their experiences. The program is being subjectively evaluated by the students, professors, classroom teachers, and community resources personnel.

The report gives a brief statement of definition and of the need for environmental education, then a summary of the objectives, content, curriculum, financing, management, and growth of the program. Teacher, camp counselor, and back-up instructor training; precamp preparation for students; and the content of camp sessions for sixth grade children (instructional components) are emphasized. In the first 5 years of its operation, the program was funded by parent  teacher associations of the respective participating schools--no federal, state, college, or school district money was used. Success of the program was indicated by the local enthusiasm and the growth of the program. The program has grown from involving one sixth grade classroom of 29 students in the spring of 1967 to 33 sixth grade classrooms from 12 schools and containing approximately 900 children in the spring of 1971. Appendixes of related data are included. (Author/MJM)",

Three indicators to ascertain the degree of success were employed: a) intern feedback, b) organization of a competency-based curriculum and c) degree of faculty involvement. Measurement instruments included a questionnaire, opinionnaire, and interviews administered to 36 Teacher Corps Interns. Although 11 of the 36 original Teacher Corps Interns terminated their association with the program for various reasons, it is the feeling of the Teacher Corps  directors that if the competency-based program had been instituted earlier in the program, it would have met with greater success. Data obtained suggested that the interns developed a positive overall feeling toward competency-based instruction and the program. Intern responses indicated that they \"agreed\" that competency-based education was superior to traditional education.

Intern and staff dissatisfaction with the initially traditional nature of the course resulted in a number of innovative changes, the most noticeable of which being the formation of cluster-development teams, consisting of both interns and staff members. These teams worked jointly to design instructional modules and clusters (groups of modules), and to collect, store, and organize the material necessary for the  implementation of these modules. Intern attitudes toward the Teacher Corps program were assessed both at the beginning and end of the 1970-71 academic year.

Five major procedures were incorporated in the process of studying the programs. The first step was to develop a criterion in terms of local needs and for use in the study of the CETEM Programs. Models were reviewed against this criteria. Next, project directors of those models which more closely reflected the criteria development for the study were invited to NSC to conduct a 1-day seminar on their model. Copies of summaries as well as full Phase 1 reports on CETEMS were made available for individual study. Teams of two or more members of the  project staff made on-site visits to two model developing institutions, attended two conferences of developing institutions, and participated in a dissemination conference. Finally a 2-day workshop on the model programs was organized at the campus of NSC which was attended by the project staff, non-educational faculty of NSC, public school personnel education faculties from two other local teacher training institutions, and representatives from the state department of education.

The failure of some subjects to participate in all experimental sessions necessitated the elimination of nine subject pairs, leaving 39 usable subject pairs. Each fifth grade subject was paired with a same-sex third grade subject. Subject pairs were randomly assigned to three conditions: a) evaluation-reward, b) evaluation-no reward, and c) no evaluation. All subject pairs met for five 1-hour tutoring sessions on reading skills. Planned comparisons of pre- and post-experimental data indicated that tutors in the evaluation-reward conditions  were significantly less satisfied with tutoring than were tutors in the other two conditions.

The procedures involved a pilot study with experimental and control groups followed by the complete study. Significance of differences between group means were determined by t-tests. The study indicates that the Kerlinger instruments do distinguish degrees of conservatism or progressivism. Data indicated that the education faculty tended strongly toward progressivism, the cooperating  teachers toward conservatism, and student teachers were about midway between the two. As a result of on-campus &quot;block&quot; courses, student teachers moved strongly toward progressivism, but regressed toward conservatism during student teaching, with regression greatest among elementary student teachers.

Formative evaluation procedures employed in the 1968-69 tryout were primarily responsible for the changes incorporated into the present program. These procedures included teacher interviews, observations of lessons being taught, student tests for each unit of the program, and collection and analysis of pretest and posttest performance data. It is expected that the revised Instructional Concepts Program will be more effective for students and more acceptable to teachers because of the revisions resulting from the formative evaluation procedures.

        "description":"Evaluation techniques were designed to improve learner performance through use of pre-specified popular instructional objectives. Current curriculum planning and evaluation practices are examined. Two common evaluation malpractices are: (1) the tendency to treat the content of the program as the most important criterion for evaluation, (2) the evaluation of desired learner behaviors that occur under certain classroom conditions, but do not represent actual behavior changes. Two steps to aid in the development of desired learner capabilities are: (1) To list those capabilities that the learner should acquire from the course; and (2) To attempt to develop these learner capabilities through appropriate instructional experiences. The use of a standard classification system for  specifying intended educational outcomes and classifying student behaviors is a procedure that has gained considerable acceptance. One such system is the Bloom Taxonomy, which classifies educational objectives &quot;related to mental acts or thinking&quot; into six categories: knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Another system is a Behavioral Classification System published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Instructional objectives are important for two purposes: planning instruction and assessing its effects. Two types of evaluation are formative and summative. The former evaluates programs still under development and the latter completed programs. A need exists for further study of evaluation procedures. (CK)",

Manipulated systematically were number of subtests, number of items per subtest, and number of examinees responding to each subtest. Each item-examinee sampling procedure was replicated five times. Defining one observation as the score received by one examinee on one item, the results indicate that the mean of a normative distribution is easily and efficiently estimated with a relatively small number of observations; the variance, to the contrary is a more difficult parameter to approximate and requires a larger number of observations to obtain a reasonable efficient estimate. The results of this investigation support  the conclusion that, in estimating parameters by item-examinee sampling, the variable of importance is not the item-examinee sampling procedure but is instead the number of observations obtained by that procedure.

The two main reasons for evaluating teaching as given in this paper are (1) to help make decisions about whom to promote, and (2) to improve instruction. In the experimental study, five diverse colleges participated. A total of some 470 faculty members were randomly assigned within each institution to one of three groups--feedback within a week (treatment group); no feedback, with summary of results given at end of the semester (control group); and posttest, which used rating form only at the end of the semester to determine whether simply using the form caused teachers to change, even without feedback. A 23-item form eliciting  instructional procedures or behavior that an instructor could presumably change was used in the study. Results showed that instructors who received student feedback did not noticeably modify their teaching practices. A second aspect of the study was to determine to what extent instructors describe or rate their teaching differently from the students' ratings. Items from the student form were reworded slightly for instructor responses. It was found that there was a significant difference between instructor and student responses to most items, with instructors rating their teaching in more positive terms. The use of student pre- and post-test scores as a means of evaluating the effectiveness of teaching are seen as beneficial to the teacher, but their use as the sole criterion for  determining teaching effectiveness is not advocated. Suggestions are made as to other evaluation techniques. (DB)",

        "description":"Differences between black and white, male and female groups who took the Admission Test for Graduate Study in Business (ATGSB) during February 1971 were examined in three studies. The studies were: (1) a study of the biasedness of the test with respect to the groups, (2) a comparison of the mean criterion scores for those candidates who omit items, and (3) a comparison of the response randomness for the sub-groups involved. The ATGSB in this study consisted of seven separate tests: Reading Recall I, Reading Recall II, Antonyms, Analogies, Sentence Completion, Mathematics, and Data Sufficiency. The tests were conducted in two types of settings, a regular test center which charged a fee and at fee-free centers. A total of 2,930 candidates, who were attending institutions in the  West, North Central, South, Northeast, and Foreign Institutions, were sampled for each research question. The groups and their sizes were: fee-free males 485, fee-free females 370, regular center black--males 630, females 150, white males 995 and white females 300. The results of Study One: Statistically Defined Test Bias showed that if item-group interaction is accepted as a definition of test bias, then each section of the ATGSB is biased in some way. It appeared that racial bias is contributing more than sex bias in each of the subtests. In Study Two: Omit Behavior, the white group mean criterion score was the lowest among the three groups in the majority of cases. Study Three: Randomness of Response results showed the randomness in chosing distractors was greatest in the fee-free  groups and there was more randomness in female groups than male groups.

The experimental subjects were 100 students from grades 7 and 8. Twenty-five students were selected randomly from each grade and sex, out of a total of 571, receiving instruction in French by \"Le Francais International\" method in a mid-western Canadian city. Each of the subjects was rated on achievement by their respective teachers on a 5-point scale. The ALFS scores intercorrelation matrix produced 4 principal factors which were rotated to varimax- and promax-criterion. These factors were interpreted to be pragmatic,  possessive, perseverance, and reflective attitudes. The intercorrelation matrix of the 4 factor scores, motivational intensity, orientations, and achievement ratings, resulted in only one principal factor establishing ALFS factors as correlates of the other variables. A step-wise regression analysis revealed that perseverance factor and motivational intensity were the most effective of the 7 competing predictors of achievement in French, accounting for 26.8% of the variance, whereas the entire set of predictors accounted for 30.6% of the variance.

At each of the four grades, students were given the appropriate level of the Sequential Test of Education Progress (STEP) and the School and College and Ability Test (SCAT). The correlation between grade levels of a verbal factor and a quantitative factor were: verbal factor, .94 (5th grade vs. 7th), .95 (7th vs. 9th), and .96 (9th vs. 11th); and for the quantitative factor, .90 to .93 to .95. The interpretations are: (1) During these two-year periods, U.S. students change intellectually very little; (2) The high correlations result from methods or from  factors specific to each SCAT and STEP test; (3) The high correlations result from the tests' measuring general intellectual abilities which mature without being influenced by differential student experience; (4) Which school a student attends makes no difference; and (5) Each student's growth rate is set early in his life and remains constant thereafter. None of the five interpretations were found to be wholly acceptable. It is concluded that suitable measures of all variables related to the data analysis of each of the probable causal pathways involved in the growth process in question are needed. (DB)",

The plan aids schoolmen of the State in assessing the quality of education their schools are providing in relation to 10 goals, which propose to encourage the students to develop self-understanding, understanding of others, basic language and number skills, good citizenship, good health habits, their own creative potential, an appreciation of broad human achievement, a continuing interest in their own further learning, an ability to prepare themselves for productive vocations, and an ability in general to change within a changing world. In 1968, a pilot program (Phase I) was implemented to test a 10-goal measurement package to assure that each  test was reliable and valid. The variable conditions were characteristics of students, of teachers, and of school and community. Phase II, carried out in 1969, used replies of students and teachers to questionnaires and data from school administrators and the Bureau of Statistics to develop standards for students' performance. Phase III, begun in 1970 and still underway, is the actual assessing of 111 school districts. A case study of one of the school districts is included with a chart of the percentile ranking of the schools on the 10 goals, as well as the actual score for each of the school's students.

The purpose of white administrators was to avoid calling attention to the racial variable being measured. However the instrument is not the entire simulus presented to subjects (Ss). A number of studies have shown that the characteristics, including race, of the researcher can affect results. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of race of the experimenter administering the SAS on obtained results. Results indicated that there were no measureable effects attributable to the race of the person administering the SAS. Ss responded very similarly to Ss in previous administrations, that is  whites generally responded negatively to blacks in personal or social situations. Evidence from this and other studies seems to indicate that the contextual situations provided by the SAS are sufficiently difficult to ignore, so that the S does make a racial response. Also Ss tend not to be distracted by extraneous variables such as race of experimenter, or the particular term used to denote race on the SAS. (Author)",

Phase one of the research examined the utility of currently used predictors and criteria; phase two involved examining currently available variables for use as potential predictors; and phase three will be taking what is learned from the first two phases and working with a variety of blacks on and off campus to develop predictors and criteria that reflect their  experiences. Studies were conducted in the first phases with the following results: (1) Multiple R's in the .60's (using freshman grades as a criterion) are possible for blacks and whites using SAT, high school grades and high school rank, although optimal weights vary by race and sex; (2) Attrition and second year grades may be more relevant criteria for blacks; and (3) Several empirically developed predictors have been identified which bear careful scrutiny and should be restudied and tried out in some form in phase three.

        "description":"Minority and majority groups were administered a special quantitative section of the Admission Test for Graduate Study in Business (ATGSB) under varying time conditions to determine if increasing the time allotted for the test would eliminate any bias which may exist due to an irrelevant speed factor. By a commonly employed definition the special section was found to be moderately speeded for all candidates under normal conditions. Neither the main effects due to time condition nor the interaction between the ethnic and time factor reached significant levels suggesting that increasing the time per item does not reduce any bias which may exist in the test. Although a substantial proportion of minority group scores fell at or below the chance level, these scores appeared to retain  fairly high levels of reliability. (Author)",

Some definitions of the term \"criterion-referenced\" are reviewed, and the position is taken that direct inferences about what a test-taker can or cannot do--criterion-referenced inferences, that is--need not be restricted to tests that are composed of actual samples of the behaviors of interest. Primary attention is given to the criterion of minimal competency in some significant educational area, but other applications are also discussed. Several methods are suggested for validating tests for making inferences to a particular criterion or to several criteria of interest. Some of the limitations of the methods are discussed, and the suggestion is made that  more than one method be used to validate any desired criterion-referenced inference. (Author)",

The similarities are judged in the higher-dimensional space determined by the factor analysis, but otherwise rely on the simple concept of &quot;most like&quot; or &quot;neighbor.&quot; The proposed techniques are illustrated by means of an example involving 110 strains of yeast with measurements on 30 variables. An analysis in terms of six factors is obtained and the six-dimensional factor profiles for the strains are the basis for determining neighbors and classifying the strains into groups. The automatic procedure leads to 32 groups. Then, by applying the procedures again,  only eight second-order groups, or clusters, emerge. (Author)",

        "description":"The levels of performance on tests of black versus white students in 15 North Carolina public universities were examined; the validities of test scores and high school grades for predicting performance in college were also studied. Experimental variables obtained for each student included, as predictors, the SAT-V and SAT-M scores, and the standing of the student in his high school class of graduation. Criterion consisted of the student's first term grade average in college. For each of the four institutional sub-groups separately at each of the 15 institutions and then at each institution for all-black vs. all-white, all male vs. all female, and for all students combined, the zero-order correlations among the predictor and criterion variables were computed. Findings include: (1)  Black students attending traditionally black universities have lower test scores than do black students attending traditionally white universities; (2) Black students at white institutions have lower scores than their white counterparts at that institution, but, in some instances, higher scores than white students at some other white institutions in North Carolina; (3) Black students at traditionally white institutions in North Carolina have higher standings in their high school class of graduation than do their white counterparts at that institution; and (4) the small number of black students found in traditionally white institutions in North Carolina prevent any conclusive interpretation of the data.

Displays of the Item x Group interactions were made by analyzing the item difficulty plots for each language group against a spaced sample of all candidates taking this form of the test in October 1969. A measure of the deviation of each item  from the central tendency of the plot was developed, expressing the degree to which the item was especially difficult--or-easy--for a particular language group relative to the other items.

        "description":"The general purpose of an evaluation workshop is to orient school and state department of education personnel to the basic principles, procedures, and problems associated with evaluating educational programs and to the kinds of information an evaluation can provide for educational decision making. The workshop studied is based on the general evaluation model developed at the Center for the Study of Evaluation at UCLA. It takes two days to run and is ideally suited for groups of 30-45 participants. Workshop materials consist of an exportable leader's manual, a notebook for each participant, and a set of exercises for each team of three participants. Each module of the workshop involves instruction in a facet of evaluation, practice in solving relevant problems in this area, and  feedback and discussion of the correct answers. By the end of the workshop, participants have completed exercises involving the selection, collection, analysis, and reporting of evaluation information for decision making. The development of the workshop began in January, 1969, as an \"opportunity project\" within the Center. Three feasibility studies of it were completed between March, 1969, and April, 1970. A revised version was developed and field tested at five sites with the target audiences during the Spring and early Summer of 1970. Although the results of these and the previous sessions were positive, it was evident that changes were needed. These changes were made, and the workshop was given two special field trials at the end of August. After additional revisions were made, the  workshop was given operational field tests throughout the United States between October, 1970 and August, 1971, with the target populations. The results of these field trials and a subsequent follow-up impact study were positive. (Author/CK)",

The first part of the paper focuses on the R&D process. An overview is presented of the federal R&D effort in education as it is accomplished through the labs and R&D centers and the scope of activities undertaken in one of these institutions. One of the chronic problems of evaluation, the degree of fidelity in the implementation of planned intervention is presented, and some procedures for dealing with the problem are explicated. The second part of the paper focuses on the products that emerge from the R&D  process, a process conceived to be a mapping from the precise definition or characterization of a product at one stage into the definition of a product at a later stage. The minimal definitions or characterizations of products at the basic and applied research stage, the development stage, and the utilization stage are discussed for the physical sciences, and for the social and behavioral sciences by means of a series of three-dimensional minimal definition matrices. The paper concludes with a discussion of the evaluation of the federal R&D effort at the federal level. (Author/CK)",

Subsequently, returns to education for women which derive from their husband's income and their family income are examined. Finally, some implications of the results are discussed. In the first section, data are from the 1/1000 sample of the 1969 Census. For women working full-time, the internal rate of return varies from 6% to 11% for whites, and from 6% to more than 50% for Negroes. Two measures of family income are calculated. The first is the earnings of the woman plus the total income of her husband weighted by the probability that the husband is present at each age. The second measure differs from the first in that only half of  the weighted husband's income and family income appear less susceptible to the criticisms raised earlier about estimates f returns through women's earnings in terms of magnitude and stability. Implications of these results include: (1) College education for women was an attractive alternative in 1960; (2) The returns to graduate training as measured through women's earnings appear much higher than the returns through family income; and (3) A family income maximization model may be useful in further examination of the demand for education by women.

        "description":"Confidence weighting (CW) tends to improve the reliability of easy tests; the Coombs-type multiple-response (MR) option tends to improve the reliability of hard tests. It was hypothesized that, on a test of moderate difficulty, offering both the CW and MR response options would improve reliability more than either alone. Twenty-four subjects took a 20-item multiple-choice test under CW plus MR instructions. MR was used less than CW; 9 subjects used both options. Coefficient alphas computed on four scoring bases showed MR, alone, depressed reliability a little; CW, alone, depressed it a lot; and the two combined depressed it even more. It was concluded that these two previously successful special testing procedures cannot be combined to form an even better one. (Author)",

The program, consisting of 2 three-week workshops and six interim seminars, was designed to achieve 12 goals relating to child development. Courses presented in the seminars were: Human Development, Creating the Day Care Environment, Interaction Effectiveness, Practicum and Observation, and The Parent and the School. The steps in the program-evaluation process were: (1) Formulation of goals, (2) Operalization of goals, (3) Selection of criteria for mastery, (4) Selection/development of tests and measures, (5) Scheduling of testing program, (6) Dissemination and  weighting of program goals, (7) Pretesting of participants, (8) Analysis of pretest data, (9) Formative assessment procedures, (10) Post-testing, (11) Analysis of data, and (12) Uses of evaluation. The findings are in relation to the 12 objectives, together with descriptions of tests administered, the variables used in the assessment process, and the results of each test procedure. The data reveal that 9 of the 12 objectives were achieved as a result of instruction. (DB)",

Affective education is regarded as teaching that has emotions and feelings as its primary subject matter. The three main approaches to affective education are seen as (1) facilitation of emotional insight and understanding, (2) facilitation of emotional experience, and (3) facilitation of emotion-modifying actions. The dimensions for assessment of competency are referred to as knowledge, attitude, and skill. Measurement is considered in relation to these dimensions and the major competency areas--cognitive, experiential, or action-oriented. Technical and process issues are identified. The skill dimension is considered the most critical in measurement. (DB)",

It provides educational administrators several alternative techniques for maximizing desired terminal behaviors. By working with project directors, the evaluator helps to assist the program's implementation, providing prescriptive feedback in the program's weakest areas. Portions of the model have been used by over 50 educational administrators working with 500 teachers in a six-state area in the Southwest. Several different programs have found it successful, and its adaptability to most any program or curriculum makes it important to existing educational administrators and those preparing for roles that will require skill in project evaluation.

These procedures deal with all possible causes of system failures that have been identified in the in-classroom tryout of new materials. Therefore, methods for identifying, controlling, and monitoring all factors that affect academic behavior in the classroom are described. This includes (1) the definition of classroom management rules and ways to monitor their effectiveness, (2) the collection of objective and subjective data to discover weaknesses in both the materials and the classroom environment, and (3) the ways to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of all changes made to the environment. Testing procedures were also defined. They included where to take a test, how to take a  test, and how to score the test. Test performance was used to locate inadequate materials and to evaluate revised materials. Systematic formative evaluation during the in-context tryout of materials was shown to be feasible.

Occupational norms are established in terms of minimum qualifying scores for each of the significant aptitude measures which, when combined, predict job performance. Cutting scores  are set only for those aptitudes which aid in predicting the performance of the job duties of the experimental sample. The GATB norms described are appropriate only for jobs with content similar to that shown in the job description presented in this report. A description of the validation sample is included. (AG)",

The first phase of data collection led to the identification of 343 first graders of 1970 whose older siblings had also been tested with the Metropolitan Readiness Test at first grade entry. The 1970 examinees were classified by sex and by exposure to program materials alone or to both materials and teachers. Two analyses were performed on the data. Results showed a significant difference in favor of target pupils over their older siblings. Neither  sex nor program exposure was significant. (DB)",

Variables used in the process were designated as being either \"univariate\" or \"constructed.\" Examples are given of the procedure used in the development of variables. Procedural issues handled in the process of conceptualizing and developing the constructed variables were: the handling of non-respondents, multiple-response items, the multivariate nature of some variables, the population level at which the particular variable should be run, the type of population over which the variable should be broken, the sequence of embedding, and the types of checks necessary to ensure accuracy of the variable development.

The variables studied were specification of objectives, use of diagnostic-progress (d-p) tests, and use of alternate resources. The study used four seventh grade and four eighth grade classes; each grade classes were pretested each semester on course objectives. There was no significant difference among the classes at the .25 level. Each class took chapter, unit, and semester (posttest) exams based on the objectives. The first semester eighth grade classes received four different treatments: no variables (control class), behavioral objectives, objectives and daily ungraded d-p tests with recommendations, objectives and d-p tests with recommendations that  included alternate resources. There was a significant difference between the control class and each treatment class. Using second semester seventh grade classes, a comparison between a control class and a class using daily ungraded d-p tests with recommendations was significant at the .05 level. The results indicate that the use of either a list of specific objectives or d-p tests with recommendations is sufficient for a significant increase in student mastery of the objectives. The second semester seventh grade classes received four different treatments: no variables, general objectives, specific objectives, and daily ungraded d-p tests with recommendations. There was a significant difference between classes using specific and general objectives at the .10 level. (Author/DB)",

Three dimensions of teacher behavior were compared: cognitive, behavior management, and motor behaviors. Two test teaching situations were employed. One group of students from the Oral Language Program (OLP) trained group taught an OLP lesson and another group of OLP trained students taught a teacher-prepared lesson and an OLP lesson, respectively. The videotaped test teaching situations were observed by trained observers utilizing the Spaulding Teacher Activity Rating Scale (STARS) and the Motor Behavior Descriptive Categories  (MBDC) developed by the researcher. Conclusions include: (1) OLP trained teachers exhibit similar patterns of behavior between teacher-prepared lessons and OLP lessons on the three dimensions of behavior observed; (2) Conventionally trained teachers exhibit consistent patterns of behavior on the cognitive and motor dimensions of behavior on the cognitive and motor dimensions of behavior between teacher-prepared and OLP lessons; and (3) OLP and conventionally trained teachers exhibit similar patterns of behavior on the cognitive and motor behavior dimension when teaching OLP lessons, but the patterns are significantly dissimilar on the behavior management dimension.

The conditions investigated were effectiveness of the sorting cue, the effects of the order of stimulus presentation and the effect of re-sorting. An explicit sorting cue was shown to be a highly significant determinant of the number of manifest categorizations, but not of the quality or nature of these categorizations when compared with an implicit (instructional) sorting cue. The effects of differing explicit sorting cues should be the object of further study. The effects of stimulus ordering were not significant as anticipated, although the treatment means were in the predicted  order. Subjects encountering initial stimuli which were very homogeneous formed more manifest categories (means=7.88) than did subjects sorting decks with initial-heterogeneous (mean=6.45) or completely randomized (mean=6.76) stimuli. Subjects encouraged to re-sort their manifest categorizations formed categories which were significantly different in nature, but not in number, from the categorizations of subjects who were not encouraged to re-sort. In addition, there was a significant interaction effect between re-sorting and type of sorting cue. (Author)",

        "description":"The major objectives of this study were: to determine whether information feedback provided during a difficult task would reduce State-Anxiety (A-State) and whether learner control of feedback would lead to further reductions in A-State. Another objective was to attempt to bridge cognitive and affective domains by examining relationships of the task variables of feedback and learner control by examining the relationships of the task variables of feedback and learner control with anxiety and cognitive abilities, specifically reasoning ability (R) and associative memory (Ma). Three objective-related hypotheses were investigated. Prior to taking the CAI course, each subject received a battery of five tests administered to small groups. The course contained a series of eight sets of  three examples and three test items, illustrating eight consecutive rules comprising the task. A varimax factor analysis conducted on the ability scores produced two factors, R and Ma. A second analysis of variance, multiple linear regression analysis, a two covariable analysis of covariance, and a single covariable analysis were also performed. It was found that real reductions in A-State can be obtained through increased use of feedback. While feedback generally seems to reduce A-State, high A-State appears to interfere with the learner's capacity to utilize the feedback information effectively in performing the task requirements. Learner control seems to offer definite advantages both in terms of anxiety reduction and performance. (CK)",

        "description":"A training effort to upgrade the competencies of classroom teachers in program evaluation at the local school level was undertaken by the Division of Research and Development of the Cleveland Public Schools during the Spring of 1971. The model for this training effort was the Evaluation Liaison Teacher Plan, which provided for assignment of an Evaluation Liaison Teacher to each school to serve as a resource for the school staff in assessment of its programs. The model was implemented in connection with the summer school programming offered in Cleveland's Title I schools during the summer of 1971. This model evolved from involving assumptions: (1) the recognition of the classroom teacher as the key facilitator of instruction and its evaluation; (2) utilization of in-line  administrative channels to support evaluative processes through emphasis of the principal's responsibility at the school level; and (3) Placement of responsibility for instructional evaluation in the classroom. Operationally, major program elements included: (1) assignment of an evaluation liaison teacher to serve each school, (2) design of protocol materials and training mediums in application of evaluation to school programs, and (3) provision of &quot;hands-on&quot; training for liaison teachers in various aspects of evaluation. At the end of the program, questionnaires were distributed randomly to participants and school staff and to 48 evaluation liaison teachers. About three out of four teachers believed the plan should be continued. Sixty-seven percent of the elementary teachers and 72  percent of the secondary teachers were in favor of the idea of an evaluation liaison teacher in each building. At least one out of two fellow staff members of teachers were also in favor of the program. (CK)",

Intent of the study was (1) To study the differential achievement reached by all eligible pupils; and (2) To analyze a selected number of control variables. A modified version of the effect parameter analysis developed by Coleman was used. Data were derived from the records held by the school system on fourth, fifth and sixth grade pupils. Data were organized by: (1) listing all pupils in these three grades enrolled in the program, (2) determining those pupils underachieving at least one year below grade level, (3) determining those underachievers who possess a  measured intelligence 80 and who were enrolled in summer school, (4) classifying all pupils identified as meeting or not meeting the achievement criterion, and (5) classifying all pupils who attended. An analysis of the reading achievement grade scores and an analysis of the mathematics computational grade equivalency scores were performed. Results include: (1) The supportive services had no statistically significant impact on the reading achievement of pupils; (2) Among low intelligence enrollees, the mathematics program component was associated with a diminishing effect on participating pupils' reading achievement; and (3) Pupils who participated in the reading program components improved their reading achievement.

The CIPP model is chosen as a point of reference in order to identify the type of evaluative information to which the concern of this paper is addressed. Credibility gaps are classified as personnel related and organization related. The latter, an Organizational Credibility Gap, exists at each organizational level where the same person is both accountable for a program's success or failure and responsible for the formal evaluation of that program. Three characteristics of such gaps are: (1) They are basically a \"conflict of interests\" relationship between the organizational roles; (2) They are separate from personalities as such;  and (3) The essence of these gaps is that of potential incredulity. Four propositions which may serve as guidelines in the institutionalization of evaluation functions in educational institutions are: (1) Gaps can be delineated in a project's planning stages; (2) Gaps should be minimized; (3) The bridging of each gap should be planned; and (4) The strategy of internal evaluation with external audit provides the balanced use of resources for a long-range development and institutionalization of evaluation functions in educational institutions. A combination of the propositions supports an overall strategy that would support the long-range buildup of in house evaluation capabilities of educational institutions. (CK)",

        "description":"When the task of evaluating student learning is carefully considered, two major problems emerge. One is the gathering of the most appropriate and precise evidence possible about the learning. The other is the setting of performance standards against which this evidence may be weighed and the adequacy of each student's learning judged. This paper has focused on the problem of setting performance standards for use in strategies for mastery learning. The paper began with the argument that a key variable in the design of these strategies are the mastery performance standards which students are helped to attain throughout their instruction. It was pointed out that presently there are no procedures for setting such standards. Next, an attempt was made to formulate one such procedure.  The approach developed utilizes students' future learning, i.e., their scores on a set of desired, end-of-instruction learning outcomes, as a criterion for determining the mastery performance level which students must attain at any stage in their instruction. Finally, the paper reported an experiment designed to explore the feasibility of the approach proposed. The experiment was designed to test the assumption that the performance standard which a student attains over each segment of his instruction has important implications for his realization of the desired, end-of-instruction learning outcomes. In general, the experiment's results confirmed the assumption tested. (Author/CK)",

Based on the reports of the study monitors, the following are among the recommendations and findings made: (1) equal protection of laws is yet not a reality for most black students in the South; (2) at least a dozen major urban, Southern school systems are operating on inadequate and outdated court orders and desegregation plans; (3) some urban Southern school districts are not only segregated but do not provide any  form of student transportation; (4) a school district cannot desegregate half-way; faculty and student integration must go hand-in-hand; (5) resegregation is an alarming fact in the urban Southern school systems, aided by local state and federal action; (6) a large number of black students are congregated in the lower academic groups in southern urban schools because of &quot;ability&quot; grouping; (7) widespread student unrest is symptomatic of racism, insensitivity, and injustice; (8) suspensions and expulsions of students are so widespread as to raise serious questions as to the effectiveness of these methods to enforce discipline; and, (9) increased use of police and security guards does not seem to have eliminated or significantly decreased disciplinary problems.

NACEDC notes that 1.5 million fewer disadvantaged children are now being served due to the concentration guideline directing spending on fewer for maximum impact; at the same time it is known that the number of children living in school attendance areas with high concentrations of children from low income families is about 20 million--suggesting that about two-thirds needing Title I services are not receiving them. Recommendations in the report relate to State funds for compensatory education, Title I audits and  enforcement, delivery of services, legislative proposals for State Advisory Council for Title I, parent involvement, desegregation, nonpublic school children, follow through programs proposed by the Division of Compensatory Education, migrant programs, neglected and delinquent children in State institutions, the Right to Read Program, and teacher training. In light of appeals by private school administrators and practitioners, a special section of the report is devoted to the special needs of private schools serving disadvantaged children. (RJ)",

The program evaluated provides grants to help local public bodies finance development of neighborhood centers to serve low- and moderate-income communities--to provide a wide range of services and activities including health, educational, social, and recreational programs; the grants may be used to help finance up to two-thirds the cost of a new building or to rehabilitate an existing structure. The evaluation comprised three phases: survey of operating facilities, site visits, and seminars. As a result of the survey, 22  findings suggesting policy clarifications, procedural modifications, guidance, and management actions emerged. Fourteen recommendations in these areas were made in addition to other immediate recommendations related to the study which were implemented. Action taken as a result of the evaluation is discussed.

The specific correlation between changing attitudes, the gradual achievement of civil rights for blacks, and changing stereotypes is noted.

From July 1970 through July 1971, 36 interns (black liberal arts graduates), assigned to three school systems in the County, were given eight courses in early childhood education as well as six hours of internship, which will count toward a master's degree; the eight courses were converted to competency-based instruction to extents varying from 50 to 100 percent. When students were requested to evaluate the program, they reacted positively toward competency-based instruction; the  majority felt that they were under less pressure, would achieve more, and would receive higher grades. Faculty members also reacted positively and expressed a willingness to use the method in their own classes; but that the traditional grading system would need to be changed to a pass-fail system. All of the faculty members felt that the end-product of such a system better prepared teachers, was worth the effort to overcome such problems as do exist. The initial recommendation was to involve the total teacher education faculty in an effort to implement further competency-based instruction within the Jackson State College education program.

        "description":"This paper summarizes the issues underlying the Amish conflicts with public school consolidation and the enforcement of extended compulsory school-age limits. It calls attention to a long-standing strategy for community control of schools contributing to the maintenance of a culturally divergent minority group tradition. None of the traditional arguments in favor of school consolidation are acceptable. Amish society is localized, formal, and familistic. They are opposed to separating school from life. The Amish struggle to retain the school on a human rather than an organizational scale has centered around four main issues: (1) the location of the school; the Amish insist that their children attend schools located close to their homes, so that children can help with farm work and  aspire to become farmers; (2) the training and qualifications of the teacher; in order to teach their way of life, the Amish want to have teachers qualified by their commitment to Amish values; (3) the number of years of schooling; the Amish want education in the basic skills of reading, writing, and arithmetic; and, (4) the content of education; the Amish basically object to having their children trained for a way of life that is contrary to their religion. The Amish have, thus, been able through community discipline and support and protection of their children to maintain cultural continuity and integrity, to remain a discrete minority, steadfast to their own vision of the good life.

During the workshops, four instruments were used to collect  evaluative data, and a summarization of the data is provided for each research question. Specific conclusions were: (1) The simulation package is equally effective for state-level administrators, supervisors, and other state-level personnel, (2) The activities generated and maintained participants' involvement and enthusiasm throughout the experience, and (3) The package did provide a realistic learning environment in which the knowledge, skills, and techniques of vocational education program planning could be applied.

        "description":"Holland's occupational classification was used to analyze the work histories of a national representative sample of young men and women age 14-24. This study extended previous tests of the classification in three ways: (1) It was applied for the first time to a national, representative sample of women, (2) For the sample of men, 3-year longitudinal data of work histories rather than retrospective records were used, and (3) Analyses of occupational change and stability were performed by assigning scores to different occupational categories according to their psychological relatedness. The analyses supported the usefulness of the occupational classification for organizing the work histories of both young women and young men. When applied to the data, the classification reflected  the lawful and regular patterns of job changes for both sexes. Efficient predictions were possible for forecasting the category of later jobs based on knowledge of a person's earlier job. There was significant agreement between the categories of a person's current occupation and vocational aspiration. (Author/BH)",

Data were obtained describing the industry in the Carolinas and Georgia by a postcard survey for general information and a long form for technical information. Fifty-nine company representatives were interviewed for opinions and desires in terms of manpower training. It was found that: (1) 52 percent of the companies employed fewer than 10 employees, (2) The greatest shortage of qualified workers was in the pressroom, followed by layout and design, composition and imposition, and reproduction photography, (3)  The industry desired more post-high school formal trade training, and (4) School programs were desired in which students could obtain a broad range of experiences. Conclusions include: (1) Production employees should be prepared with a background in the overall reproductions processes, and (2) The disadvantages of production printing by school classes were numerous.

All horticulture employers in all nine business areas in the three counties constituted the employer population for the test, which was run during the months of September and October of 1971. Specific conclusions include: (1) The task checklists are not a viable recruitment tool for use with the total horticulture industry at this time, (2) Employers perceive the task  checklists to have potential for recruitment of horticulture workers, (3) The length of the checklist should be reduced, and (4) The checklists have potential for uses other than recruitment.

In a control group of 39 non-COE students, three instruments were used to gather data. To determine the relationship between vocational interests and student variables, to analyze the effect on the COE classes by pre- and post-testing, and to examine to what extent available vocational courses matched student interests, data were summarized or analyzed statistically and presented in 43 tables. After discussion of the results, it was recommended that the OVIS be used  to guide these service-oriented students, that career exploration be encouraged, and that student variables be studied further in relationship to vocational interests.

During the preliminary months, two significant milestones were reached. First, career education was defined in terms of a detailed matrix or framework containing a grade-by-grade, cumulative summation of goals necessary to achieve career education. Second, curriculum treatment units were identified and modified to deliver a substantial portion of the project objectives. These units  will be installed in the six pilot sites in September 1972. Also during this period steps were taken to: (1) identify occupational clusters for use with the career education model, (2) insure the external evolution of CCEM, and (3) conduct a national search for non-commercial materials.

        "description":"A random sample of 60 ninth grade students from each of four schools in suburban areas of Chicago was obtained to ascertain student interest in vocational education, more specifically in applied biological and agricultural occupations, by means of a Career Interest Inventory. Mean item scores were obtained in order to make a comparison between scales on the Inventory. Interest in applied biographical and agricultural occupations compared favorably with industrial and health-oriented occupations. Implementation of a program in applied biological and agricultural occupations was deemed feasible because more than 10 percent of the students expressed interest in animal science, agribusiness, plant science, forestry, agricultural mechanics, and agricultural resources. Courses common  to several areas should be developed, taking into account high interest in occupational areas involving forests, air, water, and recreation. Student interest in related business and office occupations was strong for most areas of specialization on the Inventory. Tables display the data. (AG)",

Specific fields of business surveyed by stratified random sample were animal care, animal health care, arboriculture, floriculture, golf course related, landscaping, nursery and lawn care, small engine sales and service, and recreation. The data were analyzed by summing the number of job opportunities in each job title and projecting the data from the sample to estimate its total job opportunities in the population. A major conclusion of the study was that ample job opportunities exist in the Chicago area to merit the implementation of  vocational programs in applied biological and agricultural occupations.

To evaluate the program, data were gathered on an experimental group and a control group of 10th graders, and also from counselors and parents of the students. Analysis of the data revealed that: (1) While students tended to concentrate on occupations during their first sitting at the ECES terminal, they used their second sitting to explore both  occupational and educational opportunities, (2) Parents of users were generally pleased with the effects of the system and stated that they were more involved in the educational and vocational planning of their children than they had been previously, and (3) Counselors had positive reactions to the system and were optimistic about its effect on students.

It was recommended that future studies  should be conducted, using larger sample sizes, more variables, better instruments, and the analysis of covariance technique.

The program is designed to help students become aware of and prepared for the world of work. The emphasis of career awareness and career exploration at the elementary school and junior high school levels is on individual development rather than career selection. Senior high school students focus on one or more career clusters and specific decision-making situations. Guidance and counseling services are provided as students develop career goals. Similar programs are being developed in Riverton; Wyoming; Cobb County, Georgia; Norwalk, Connecticut;  Mobile, Alabama and other places across the nation. Many are in their second year of operation while others are still in the developmental stage. Federal monies have been used to support these plus other programs including the school-based model effort being administered from the Ohio State University.

Specific objectives were: (1) to test the program's feasibility, (2) to identify skills and attributes required of an effective mental health worker, (3) to evaluate and revise curriculum, (4) to evaluate program graduates, and (5) to provide career opportunities for low-income urban residents. A curriculum was designed which would also provide career opportunities for previously employed aides and assistants and permit graduates to continue beyond the associate degree level. Included were general education courses, behavioral science courses, specialized  mental health courses, and a practicum in mental health work. Evaluation of the program indicates that the objectives were attained, and graduates were quite successful in further education and employment. (BH)",

This study analyzes the factors which influence mobility decisions to determine whether these choices are made on the basis of rational economic motives. To hold constant the effects of age and education in mobility, both of which are already known, the study uses a sample of noncollegiate Tennessee high school graduates between the ages of 18 and 26. The data indicate that noneconomic variables such as family ties act to reduce mobility, but once the economic variables become strong enough to overcome sociological influences, mobility results. This supports the hypothesis that a large degree  of economic rationality underlies individual mobility decisions. (BH)",

To assess the impact of Project INFOE in pilot schools within the state of Tennessee, information was obtained from students and counselors concerning the INFOE materials. This data revealed that counselors generally felt the need for more information on professional type careers. Also, a few counselors expressed a desire for INFOE cards with general information on job interviews and how to select a career. Student opinions regarding the INFOE materials were gathered by means of a pretest-posttest design. Seventy of the 164 students responding indicated  that INFOE materials helped them select a vocational education course. A major recommendation of the study is that the deck of job titles should be disseminated to any school in the state that will make effective use of them. (JS)",

It is a lifelong systematic way of acquainting students with the world of work in their elementary and junior high school years and preparing them in high school and college to enter into and advance in a career field of their own choosing. For adults it is a way to re-enter formal or informal educational programs at any time to upgrade skills or to enter a new career field. Career education consists of five educational levels, beginning in the elementary years with an emphasis on awareness, and proceeding through  exploration in the intermediate years, specialized job training and occupational preparation in the secondary and post-secondary years, and continuing personal development and enrichment in the adult years. Currently four models are being utilized by high schools, colleges, employers, and others to adapt the career education concept to their particular needs.

Federal involvement in adult education has increased without a conscious sense of direction, and will undoubtedly continue to increase, leading to greater political pressures on administrators. On the other hand, the increasing number of Federal agencies involved in the areas of education and social welfare has brought the Federal Government closer to local communities than at any time in the past. Adult education needs more career-oriented personnel in order to help achieve the goal of increasing educational opportunities for all population groups. With continued progress, only about a sixth of the employed persons by 1975 will have received less than 8  years of schooling. As the characteristics of the labor force change, career education becomes even more significant; therefore the Federal Government has placed strong emphasis on restructuring the curriculum to integrate career orientation. The coming decade promises massive growth in adult education. This report provides an assessment of adult education--its history, success, relationship to the economy, and innovative trends. (CD)",

Of the more than 300 reports available, constituting the most complete record of inservice attempts to deal with the educational problems of school desegregation, 80 were used to produce data using a computer-programming process for data analysis. A workshop was considered &quot;positive,&quot;&quot;typical,&quot; or &quot;negative&quot; depending on how it met such criteria as: realistic objectives; carefully articulated planning procedures; participant input into the planning;  clear and appropriate program design; full evaluation revealing participant reactions; consistency among objectives, design, and evaluation; planning or implementation for followup; and, planning and implementation for disseminating outcomes and materials. The 80 selected programs comprised 36 positive, 25 typical, and 19 negative programs. Findings included the following: most of the workshops were sponsored by universities; permanent workshop staff ranged between five to ten university personnel; and, the most popular areas of content were racial-cultural understanding, interpersonal-desegregation and general interpersonal relationships, and racial-cultural curriculum innovation.

Part VIII is comprised of case studies of the activities of field agents in three states that are the target areas of the Pilot State Dissemination Program. The areas are designated &quot;Southern Small Town,&quot;&quot;The Hazelton Districts,&quot; and &quot;Jordan County,&quot; which consisted of one rural and one rural and urban mixed counties, three rural regions, and one rural and one highly ubranized school districts, respectively. One field agent was assigned to each of the target areas a total of seven agents. Each state had one project director, and the number of full-time retrieval personnel varied from one to seven in number. Program evaluation findings show that the field agents were successful in  producing concrete reforms in administrative and classroom practices in both the rural and urban areas. It is believed that the key to the field agent's success is the fact that he is &quot;a generalist without authority whose presence is ligitimized by the provision of information.&quot; The 12 appendixes to the report are: Request for Proposal (RFP) for Pilot State Projects; Instruments Used in Evaluation; Guidelines for Observers and Field Agents; Indexing Scheme for Qualitative Observations; Taxonomy of Educational Topics; Model Request Form; Developing a Strategy Based on Particular Clients and Their Setting; Outstanding Training Needs; Measuring the Goals of Action Programs; Formative Evaluation--An Exploration with Case Materials; Tables; and Return Rates of Questionnaires.

A variety of research procedures were employed, including a questionnaire on community needs, a telephone survey of cable facilities, a mail survey of programming sources, and on-site visitations with both community development and cable television personnel. The most salient conclusions of the study are that (1) Local origination of public service program via cable is technically and economically feasible and does serve the interest of community development; (2) Emphasis in such local programming should be primarily on local events and activities; (3) Community Involvement is a necessary element of  cable television usage for community development; (4) Citizen's communications councils should be formed to oversee local programming; and (5) The use of low-cost, one-half inch videotape equipment is feasible for cable casting. To pursue further research and demonstration of the public usages of cable television in Appalachia, a multi-state, multi-purpose cable television development center is recommended. (Author)",

The ever-increasing demand for Extension type workers has magnified the shortage of professional personnel to man these programs. To meet these demands, the continuing and timely training of program assistants is necessary to enhance their value to the Extension team, and to the total Extension program. Suggestions for implementing curricula are: 1. The program assistant should be screened for dependability, leadership ability, and good judgment; 2. Job descriptions, designed to spell out specific duties and responsibilities, should also include several job levels so that the assistnat perceives opportunities for advancement; 3. A clear delineation of the Extension agent's role and that of the  program assistant should be established; 4. Pre-service orientation to insure a more productive working climate; 5. On-the-job training should include an in-service education program; 6. Encouragement to continue education should be given those seeking advancement; 7. Someone should be designated to have general charge of the program assistants; and 8.

The Extension aide may serve as a resource person to teach food-nutrition subject matter to low income, disadvantaged youth in 4-H and other youth groups; help identify and recruit volunteers to work with youth; assist with training volunteers; and serve as a liaison between the volunteer, extension staff and community resources. If the aide is to  function as a link in serving low income families, it is only realistic that the home economist and the 4-H staff share some joint responsibilities in the initial training of aides and their continuous in-service and consultation training.

Part I focuses on background information and an overview of the project. Part II describes the participants, the context, and the objectives, along with a detailed history of the developmental process and of the various encounters and interrelationships that occurred. Part II presents a conceptual model of  adult/continuing education. In the conceptual model, the educational process is presented as a dynamic system consisting of four basic processes--appraisal, facilitation, participation, and learning. Four basic recommendations are offered to facilitate the continuing work on the development of a terminology handbook. They are: expand the interaction between the Office of Education and professional practitioners; proceed with the project, use the Delphi process; and consider future work within the context of the development of an integrated data system for the whole education field.

In order to do this, the number of volunteer leaders will have to double also. To accomplish this, a leadership development process to be used in helping 4-H agents effectively perform their roles as managers, trainers, and supervisors is presented. The leadership development process is a systematic approach offering individuals the opportunity to increase their ability to influence the behavior of members of a social group. The process, developed by R. Dolan, consists of seven phases. They are: identification, selection, orientation, training, utilization, recognition, and evaluation. The model presented emphasizes  that leadership development must be a continuous and consciously planned effort if strong volunteer leadership is to be improved and maintained. For the 4-H agent, the model can be used to analyze the present leadership program by identifying areas of strengths and weaknesses, determine job assignments for professionals, paraprofessionals, and advanced or senior volunteers, and as a guide in leadership development of the volunteer staff.

The results indicated that the respondents differed slightly on a number of background variables (e.g., migrant's origins, years in residence), but were similar on many factors (e.g., age, family size, and marriage patterns). The Florida sample was slightly higher in financial, occupational, and educational areas. A majority of the respondents from both groups gave favorable responses on subjective evaluations of health. Results from the Life Satisfaction Scale showed that Arizona respondents had higher life satisfaction than the  Florida sample. It is suggested that researchers should analyze the effects on the community and environment upon the aged, specifically social participation and social interaction, and whether differences found in this study can be attributed to the planned community itself or to the background and financial factors. To maintain viable communities, it is felt that the developers need to correct some of the inadequacies found. (JS)",

These results indicated that 10 employers of the San Diego Area were prepared to participate in a program to provide adult basic education skills to educationally disadvantaged employees. Participating companies provided classroom facilities on-site at the place of the student's employment. The hypothesis tested was that if the deficiencies in reading and mathematical skills were eliminated, the participants in the program would be able to acquire the necessary vocational skills for a better job through normal public school channels. It was found that employers were willing to grant entry level employees released time to attend classes.  Teachers for the project underwent four pre-service training cycles in addition to continuous in-service training on a weekly basis. Teachers used a systems approach. First a diagnostic procedure was utilized to determine student needs and then a course of action was prescribed. Eventually, a Community Learning Center was established in Southeast San Diego. Project Step-Up is the first program funded by OEO that has been completely assimilated in the ongoing program of the contracting agency. Both student and community reaction to the project was positive. Both unemployed and underemployed adults have experienced educational and economic success as a result of the project. It is recommended that adult schools consider duplicating the efforts of any of the parts of Project Step-Up.  (CK)",

        "description":"Laboratory education is discussed from three viewpoints: (1) as an instrument for adult resocialization, (2) as an educational challenge which promotes personal but not social reconstruction, and (3) as a value medium which operates against the intellectual and independence modes. Criticism is focused on what the laboratory education technique does not do and for what it overlooks rather than its power. In a section on a typology of forces for adult resocialization, four forces which may serve as catalytic agents for adult crisis are discussed. These forces are: cultural transition, critical social interaction, personal crux, and/or educational challenge. Alternative adult responses to situational change include readaptation and social reintegration, alienation and social  isolation, or major adult development or change. Sensitivity training teaches task-oriented conformity, with little consideration given to the importance of educating people to stand up for their principles or beliefs. Intellect and independence are not encouraged in sensitivity training. Consequently, sensitivity training should review its own purposes and direction in a society aimed toward control, manipulation, ideological confusion, and what has been termed \"eternal verities.\" (JS)",

        "author":["Rivera, William M."],
        "description":"A. Inkeles' cross-cultural work is reviewed. Inkeles studied young factory workers in six developing countries (Argentina, Chile, India, Israel, Nigeria, and East Pakistan) to determine their &quot;modernity&quot; characteristics versus their &quot;traditional&quot; or rural orientations. The use of the &quot;modern man&quot; thesis in this study, that is, that the factory can be an educational tool for modernization, is criticized because the term is used loosely and factory work is used as a norm. This &quot;norm&quot; imposes class and psychological status on rural migrants. In addition, factories tend to manipulate rather than educate workers, that is, the individual becomes an instrument for production rather than a functioning unit in society as a whole. Inkeles' view that &quot;psychic unity&quot; is developing as a  result of urbanization processes is considered highly &quot;middle-class&quot; in its mentality and ambitions. There is no concept of man as &quot;change agent&quot; in the modern syndrome. Some of Inkeles' points about modernization trends and nonformal training and education by factories are significant. However, his thesis is stretched too far in trying to envision these trends as normative, good, and unifying. (A. Inkeles, &quot;Making Man Modern,&quot; American Journal of Sociology; v75 n2 p208-225 Sep 1969.) (Author/JS)",

        "description":"The problem of decreasing 4-H enrollment among senior 4-H youth in Blount County, Tennessee, was undertaken in this study. Data were collected from 246 ninth grade girls in five county schools. The girls were divided into two groups--current 4-H members (N=62) and 4-H club dropouts (N=184). The groups were compared on personal characteristics, parental and family characteristics, participation in various youth groups, and tasks they wished to learn to perform. Thirty-seven independent variables were identified and used as a basis for comparing the two groups. The subjects' 4-H membership status was significantly related to place of residence, age, length of membership, parents' reactions, number of school and extracurricular groups joined, number of 4-H events and activities  participated in, feelings toward competition, attitudes toward record books, and amount of time spent watching television. From the results, it is recommended that (1) there be more planning so that the county 4-H program can meet the needs of girls from urban and rural-nonfarm areas, (2) special attention should be given to first-year members, (3) parents should be better informed of the benefits their children receive at all age levels, and (5) more noncompetitive events should be devised.

        "description":"The purpose of this booklet is to show the role and importance of work-oriented literacy for development, that it is a way of training to adapt techno-vocational and socioeconomic requirements of development. Work-oriented literacy is geared to the felt needs and interests of selected vocational groups--farmers, factory workers, small traders, drivers, etc. This concept teaches literacy abilities (reading, writing, and arithmetic), technical knowledge, vocational skills, and related socioeconomic subjects and problems to be solved. Such a program should be more attractive and useful to adult learners and lead to improved working efficiency and productivity and attitude changes. This booklet also indicates how existing training activities can be enriched or new ones organized  without placing too heavy a burden on sponsors, organizers, and learners. In a broader sense, it suggests that literacy campaigns should be integrated with development programs, in most of which farmers and workers play an important role. All means and resources should be employed--functional mass literacy campaigns and selective work-oriented literacy--if illiteracy and ignorance are to be eradicated. (Author)",

This was similar to an earlier GAO report on administering graduate education programs for military officers. In this report, GAO reviewed the long-term, full-time training carried out by the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Long-term, full-time training is the formal schooling to which a civilian employee is assigned on a full-time basis for 120 days or more. This schooling includes academic programs offered by private, state, and federal institutions. The courses are usually at the graduate level in management, scientific, engineering, or technical fields. The results indicated  that management's approach does not ensure that the program objectives are being met as effectively as possible. Specifically, there are inadequacies in the (1) planning of training programs, (2) selection of participating schools and employees, (3) evaluations of training programs, and (4) administration of training funds.

From the results it is concluded that (1) there will be continued reliance on county agents to get news to the state's newspapers; (2) agents need to develop more personal contacts with more weekly editors; and (3) news and photograph  quality need to be upgraded and news needs to be more readily adaptable to local situations.

To meet these goals, program and staff development processes for servicing inner-city youth must be strengthened.

The natural field observations have been made in homes and in other settings, in which the main analytic technique was correlation. Numerous investigators have examined relationships between classes of parent behavior or even specific parent behaviors and classes of child behavior and sometimes even specific items of child behavior. The second approach of experimentation and quasi experimental studies have used laboratory and field situations to test, under somewhat standard conditions, what parents actually do when they behave as \"teachers.\" Usually the latter term is narrowly defined as giving didactic instruction. The  author concludes this report with the presentation of four answers to the question, \"What do we know about parents as teachers?\" The primary answer was that it is evident that what parents do in the early years in their various roles does influence child intellectual performance.

        "description":"During the past five years, staff of the American Institute for Research (AIR) in Palo Alto, California have been developing, field testing, and revising a guidance system especially suited to systems of individualized education. A primary aim of AIR's Comprehensive Career Guidance System (CCGS) is to help each student plan wisely for the future. This paper has attempted to provide a rationale for, as well as examples of initial results from, the application of criterion-referenced measurement within an individualized career guidance system. Goals in the area of 'life' education have been identified and important indicator skills isolated. Educational experiences have been constructed which relate to these goals. Assessment of desired outcomes is attempted in terms of skill  demonstration on items which relate directly to the goals of instruction. Results are used both to assist individual students in mastering desired skills and to improve the guidance system itself. (Author/BW)",

In general, it was expected that differentially evaluated external status characteristics such as sex, race, and social class may have sufficient effect in determining classroom power and prestige orderings to bear examination. The data came from a controlled survey in which approximately one-hundred fifty low income sixth grade students were observed in their classrooms and administered a questionnaire, once at the beginning of the school year and again at the end of the first semester. The author attempted to find a relationship between an individual's power  and prestige in the classroom, and that individual's attitudinal modernity. A positive relationship was found between student verbal initiation and student sense of occupational control, sense of modernism and expectation for success, whereas there is no relationship between student sense of political control and verbal initiation.

Another goal of this study was to replicate the negative correlation found in the previous study between communication accuracy and physiological responding. Subjects were 32 female and 32 male undergraduates at the University of Pittsburgh. These subjects were run in 32 sender-observer pairs using a special apparatus and detailed procedure. The results indicated that female senders showed more accurate communication than male senders, but female  observers were not reliably more accurate than male observers. The experimenter rated females as exhibiting more facial movement than males. This study replicated the findings of an earlier study which found a negative relationship between facial communication and skin conductance responding for males, but the correlation for females did not attain significance.

A stratified sample of 36,510 enlisted men, representive of the four Armed Services on a worldwide basis, responded to a 73-item Survey of Drug Use. Reported use of drugs in the period Sep 70-Sep 71 was highest for men in the Army. Army personnel also reported the highest daily drug usage rates. Except for the Army, daily usage rates for drugs were less than 2%. Major correlates of daily narcotic use included age, rank, race, and military service. Nontherapeutic drug use is predominantly reported by younger enlisted men, in the lower pay grades. Higher rates of drug use are reported by non-whites.  Use of drugs as a civilian is positively related to drug use in the Service. The report also contains findings on drug acquisition, availability, sources, of supply, and recognition of drug problems by admitted users of nontherapeutic drugs. (Author)",

In other words, the expectation was that the worker would become more deeply involved and respond to another in such a way as to encourage that person to go further, to explore deeper, to cooperate and to change. The program is divided into seven units. Unit I acquaints the subject with specific response modes of effective interviewer communication. Unit II provides stimulus material to  help increase sensitivity to the client. In Unit III the listener reviews his/her own interview behavior. The fourth unit teaches the enquirer role. Unit V places the listener into hypothetical feedback situations. Unit VI deals with techniques for changing the counselor-client relationship. Finally, the last unit is a summary and theory unit.

It was hypothesized that the experimental manipulation of verbal insult will: (1) not affect shock intensity or duration (2) not increase the subjects self-reported hostility, and (3) cause the subjects to report greater dislike for the insulting victim. In regards to the victim's gaze patterns, it was hypothesized that: (4) the victim's stare will decrease intensity and duration of shock delivered by the subjects and that (5) the victim's visual avoidance behavior will cause the subjects to administer shocks of greater intensity and duration. Forty-eight male undergraduate subjects were randomly assigned to the cells  in a 2x3x3 factorial design. The major measurement apparatus was a modified Bus Aggression Machine (BAM). The results showed that the insult condition was apparently not effective in arousing the subjects emotionally, and that gaze patterns did not significantly influence the intensity of the subjects' emotions.

The data was obtained by administering an opinionaire to the freshmen and seniors in the high school. The major finding of this study was that in general most groups held the same attitudes toward their counselor. Concerning personal counseling, most groups agreed that their counselor understood them, was interested in their welfare, and was not too busy to listen to them. Most groups also felt that they could communicate with their counselor and would rather not have a different counselor. Whether the counselor  was thought of as a disciplinarian or lacked empathy, or whether it was feared he might put damaging information in students' records was not measured by this stdy. It was suggested that another study would have to be done to find these answers. (Author/BW)",

The results showed that, with difficulty level controlled, conformity decreased with age between eight and eleven years and then increased to age thirteen. Discrepancies among earlier investigations in this area were discussed. Explanations for these discrepancies in terms of the subjects' initial ability or ambiguity of the task were seen as inadequate. An alternative explanation in terms of a failure to recognize a curvalinear relationship between the variables is offered. The results of this study were found to be consistent with the explanation in an earlier study that conformity is affected by age only indirectly  through its effects on certain situational variables. These variables include changes in social organization and changes in flexibility and generality of norms. (Author)",

Medical problems are seen as being closely related to poverty, lack of services and previous illness. The multitude of health and health-related problems faced by American Indian families are  further accentuated by the present health care system. Ill health of the poor is accentuated by high medical costs, inequitable distribution of health personnel and facilities and a loosely integrated system of health care delivery.

The goal of the program was to educate parents in the facilitation of their son's or daughter's transition from high school to college. Another goal was to recognize parents as a vital part of the university community. This recognition was attempted through a response to the needs of the parents. The incongruence in values between the generations shows the need for efforts at improving understanding among children, their parents, and the university. The results showed that parents who attended the Orientation Program generally approved of it, evaluating the program favorably. They continued to regard the Program highly during the school  year. From the data it appears that the program was successful, because it made the University more familiar to the parents and because it allayed fears of the parents that their son/daughter would not succeed.

Residents of a disadvantaged community were trained to serve as Family Health Workers, being provided with employment opportunities as well as academic accreditation. The program included academic courses related to community health practice and on-the-job training in public health field settings. The Model Cities Family Health Worker program was evaluated for the most part as a success. However, if the program were to be repeated, recommendations are made for a closer integration of academic and on-the-job training. In addition, another counselor would be needed to supervise and counsel the trainees. More curriculum input from supporting hospitals in  the training process would be an essential addition and hopefully neighborhood health centers would play a greater role in field training.

He argues that this living arrangement is more natural and promotes the fullest possible development of the individual through meaningful relationships with the same and opposite sex; it helps to teach the residents personal and social integration and to solidify sexual identity. The author discusses the meaning of co-ed arrangements, how single sex buildings can be adapted and to whom (and why) co-ed living should be offered. The multiple advantages for student and housing administrators of co-ed living are listed. It is mentioned that the issue posed in pursuing the subject of co-ed housing is related to the extent to which colleges can come to grips explicitly with sexual  behavior as it relates to \"residential education.\" In summary, the author states that he is advocating, based on student developmental needs, co-educational living as a vital component of residential education.

Although further economic growth is possible, it is suggested that the growth rate must of necessity slow down. Examples are cited of the ways in which this new state of affairs has begun to affect professionals and thus to penetrate their  consciousness. Also cited are a number of areas such as the welfare system and the tax structure about which general public beliefs are myths.

A new law which went into effect in July, 1970, in New York State presented women with the option of obtaining a legal abortion up to the 24th week of pregnancy. Counselors in New York State were, therefore, presented with new alternatives in dealing with women with unwanted pregnancies. The panel included a gynecologist discussing the impact of the law on the state and a college community; a Newman chaplain reflecting on alternatives to abortion; two counseling psychologists discussing personal reactions to the abortion issue and its impact on a college population; and a black counselor comparing the reaction of whites and nonwhites to unwanted pregnancies.  The problem of unwanted pregnancy presents serious dilemmas to counselors. This panel presentation was an attempt to incorporate a wide range of viewpoints on this issue. (Author/WS)",

At the end of that time an evaluation of project results was conducted. Operational objectives and scope of the project were continually revised as time went on. This process was healthy and accounted for the project's gradual improvement. It also prevented the establishment of baseline data for evaluation purposes. According to the evaluators, the project's main objective, as stated above, was partially reached. The achievement of results was hindered by the overall resistance to change by school personnel, conflicting priorities, personal allegiances, activities spread too thinly, and the expenditure of time,  money, and effort on services that contribute little to the total student body's increase in educational improvement. Those gains which did occur were difficult to identify due to insensitive statistical instruments, inadequate testing, and the lack of a control group. (Author)",

A sample of 650 women who had made appointments at a public family planning clinic were divided into four groups: Post-Partum Kept (PPK), Post-Partum Missed (PPM), Supply Kept (SK), and Supply Missed (SM). Interviews were completed on 329 (51%) of the sample. The focus of each interview was a 45-item attitude questionnaire. A multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) on the background data revealed no significant differences among any of the four groups of respondents. A principal component factor analysis with varimax rotation computed on 45 attitude items resulted in three independent content-homogeneous components which accounted for  approximately 27% of the total variance. No significant differences were found between the SK and SM groups. It was concluded that respondents who missed post-partum appointments had less favorable attitudes toward birth control and the clinic, and were more concerned with personal rights than the respondents who kept the appointments.

The interpretation of these findings was that those trainees with black counselors expected less and perceived that they got more than anticipated, while those with white counselors expected more and perceived that they  got less than expected from the counseling relationship, suggesting that trainees become pro-black.

It is hoped that the reader will gain some knowledge as to how to apply this technique in a variety of situations as well as with a number of variations. Although some problems of application have been mentioned, the authors intend that the therapist feel a degree of flexibility in modifying these techniques to fit his purposes. This paper is broken down into the following topics: (1) relaxation training, (2) problems in relaxation training, (3) anxiety hierarchy construction, (4) relaxation-imagery process, and (5) variants of group desensitization. The authors mention that in vivo (live rather than imagined) group desensitization is another variant that has been shown to have merit.  Although equally as effective as desensitization procedures, it can often become impractical when other simpler approaches are also available. It is also pointed out that relaxation as a technique is rapidly becoming a popular therapeutic device for handling everyday tension. (Author/BW)",

Firstly, he wanted to talk about what it means to be professional, and in particular, about how the claim to professionalism is established and how it is defended when under attack. Secondly he was concerned about the more elusive condition of paraprofessionalism. It is stated that although the ordinary counselor is able to counsel and present himself as a counselor, the counselor is not qualified merely by virtue of his excellence in counseling. The author follows this discussion by mentioning that there is evidence that the relationship between a degree in counseling and skill in counseling is somewhat shaky. In conclusion a few observations are presented concerning a realistic way out of the paraprofessional dilemma. The first  suggestion is that there are more routes than one to realize the goal of skilled and able counselors. The other suggestions are that ability ranking be used within the profession, and that we curb a too zealous and exclusive professionalism. (Author/BW)",

It was further postulated that there is an ordering of values by rural residents and a corresponding urban ordering of values. In view of the foregoing, it was appropriate to ask, what is growth producing in respective colleges and universities? Six significant environmental factors were identified which must receive attention if an administrator is to be effective. They are: (1) physical factors, (2) academic standards and regulations, (3) scholarship and financial aid, (4) standards of personal behavior, (5) student activities and the university calendar of events, and (6) the interpersonal  relationships of students and staff. In addition a discussion was presented of the techniques for influencing the environment. These included: (1) alliance with administration, (2) faculty coalition, (3) student involvement, (4) individual manipulation, and (5) modeling.

There is an acute need for new research priorities and a new research outlook in the area of college success.

Leaders should be warm, empathetic, responsive, understand individual and group behavior, give feedback, be trusted and accepted. Life experiences and personal development are important for the acquisition of empathy. Implications for leader selection, training, and credentialling are examined. The first implication is for professional mental health specialists and group leaders to reassess themselves and the system they sustain. The second is to seriously address what is known and what is necessary to know about the methodology of selecting group leaders in terms of their personality characteristics. The third is to consider how  we develop a functional system for the continuous efficient utilization, development and advancement of group leaders in human services. (Author/BW)",

Comparisons, in turn, can be identified operationally when a person looks at the results of his own performance and at the results of another's performance. In the research, the effects of competitive contingencies (rewards for a comparison outcome) on social comparisons, academic performance and competition were investigated. In general, the amount of competitive contingent reward accounted for changes in the three variables.

On the basis of equity theory it was assumed that being a woman in a masculine situation would be perceived as a nonvoluntary constraint, and thus it was predicted that the female would be rated as more deserving of reward than the male for an equivalent performance. It was further predicted, from both equity theory and from an attribution theory standpoint, that performance would be correspondingly inflated to balance the increased deservingness of reward, and that effort, an  unstable internal attribute, would be used in preference to ability, a stable internal attribute, in explaining the performance.

The study was designed to develop a conceptual system for describing effective coping behavior in several cultures; to develop measures of coping style and coping effectiveness which would be uniformly applicable in the various cultures; and to determine the relationship of such coping behavior to academic performance, skill in coping with major problems of living, vocational aspirations, and career-centered values, in each country. The first two objectives were successfully met during the first two years of the study. A universally acceptable definition was evolved which describes the attitudinal and behavioral componants of effective  coping behavior. A diversified battery was developed for assessing these characteristics in a variety of ways, and for assessing the aspirations, career values, and performance of the children in the various countries studied.

        "description":"A Right to Read Program was given major emphasis for the 1971-72 school year by the Union Free School District (New York). Every teacher devoted an additional 110 minutes weekly to the program which involved about 400 of the nearly 2500 pupils in grades 2 through 8. The objectives fell into two categories: to improve basic reading skills and to increase the students' reading interests. Evaluation of the program, based on pre and posttest scores on the Metropolitan Achievement Test and on a locally developed interest inventory, showed Right to Read pupils had improved in reading ability at approximately the same rate as the other students. However, since students with initially low scores usually progress at a slower rate than those with higher scores, the almost equal rate of  progression of the two groups is a measure of success for the program. The interest inventory results indicate the program did not change pupils' attitude toward reading and several hypotheses are given as possible explanations. Additional evaluative data was provided by interviews with parents, children and teachers: 92 percent of the parents and 80 percent of the children viewed the program favorably. Half the teachers were neutral or ambivalent and the rest evenly divided pro and con. Quotations and quantitative data are included. (TO)",

The major focus is on a review of the research on what types of inservice education are needed and are most effective. Investigations conducted recommend that inservice programs be based on the current needs of teachers. However, no evidence in the surveys reviewed demonstrated that they were based on the needs of teachers. It was concluded that the most effective inservice programs took place before the opening of school followed by group meetings and individual conferences during the school year. A synthesis of the research findings indicates the weaknesses in design, procedures, measurement, and data collection. Recommendations concerning further research  include: providing more complete information relating to samples, methods, materials, and instruments; utilizing a variety of evaluation techniques; and stating the limitations of the study. Recommended areas for further research include research assessing the needs of teachers and basing programs on those needs and research to include secondary school programs. (TB)",

Only one author reported higher reading achievement for the basal control group. Fifteen researchers reported no significant difference between groups. A note of caution seems warranted concerning simply quantifying the studies as revealing superiority one way or another. As most researchers know, unless a significant difference in achievement is manifested between groups, there is some reluctance on the part of researchers and editors to publish the findings. Therefore, it is  a reasonable assumption that not all studies pertaining to individualized reading have been included in the literature. (Author)",

Half the passages consisted of scrambled sequences of statements, half consisted of logically ordered sequences. Thus the effectiveness of imagery formation was compared to the effectiveness of rote learning. A test consisting of eight valid and eight invalid statements was given, and the subjects were asked to discern the valid and invalid statements. It was found (1) that the logical-sequence group performed better than the scrambled-sequence group and (2) that the  imagery group's performance was better on both the logical sequence and the scrambled sequence.

And since reading is often under the auspices of the English department, teachers are inclined to be trained primarily in literature. Paraprofessionals offer a partial answer to inappropriate reading teacher preparation; even without certification, they may possess the qualifications necessary to teach basic communication skills to students--and at a reduced cost. Various successful state and federally funded disadvantaged and compensatory programs dealing with reading have, also, lent credibility to proposed open-door policies. Many of the tests used in reading  programs are normed on general college populations and fail to diagnose problems which can be treated effectively. Instead they corroborate what most practitioners already suspect--severe learning disabilities. Available materials are often blamed for ineffective programs when, in fact, practitioners sustain materials based upon habit, whim, or pedagogical predisposition. Further observations reveal inadequate facilities which limit learning alternatives and affect the behavior of the practitioner. (A reference list is included.) (HS)",

        "description":"To test the effects of teaching inner-city black children to read in kindergarten and first grade through the initial teaching alphabet, i.t.a. and traditional orthography (TO) groups were compared on their comprehension of single words, short sentences, and related skills. At the first grade level, reading, writing, and oral language skills were compared. At the end of kindergarten the results revealed: (1) no significant difference between i.t.a. and TO groups on the Metropolitan Readiness combined scores, (2) the i.t.a. subjects performed significantly higher than TO subjects on all Early Reading subtests, (3) interactions between program and teacher (or school) were significant on all Early Reading subtests. In grade one the i.t.a. subjects continued to use the i.t.a.  program, while the TO subjects were instructed with the Scott, Foresman reading program. The first grade results indicated: (1) i.t.a. subjects achieved higher than TO subjects on all Stanford subtests, (2) i.t.a. subjects were better spellers and (3) could pronounce more words, had greater range of comprehension on oral reading, and seemed to read more library books; furthermore, (4) i.t.a. subjects wrote more fluently, and (5) their oral output was greater and more varied than oral output of TO subjects.

Two critical reading tests, a critical thinking test, and other aptitude and achievement tests were administered for a total of 17 subtests.

Critical reading apparently consists of a complex of language, reading, and thinking activities, particularly vocabulary, reading  interpretation, and inference.

        "description":"It is especially critical within reading programs during the years of middle childhood to identify and to nurture qualities of giftedness: open-mindedness, motivation, tolerance for uncertainty, preference for complexity, high regard for learning, sense of destiny, and the search for meaning. Supporting this view, the work of Frank Smith, Goodman, Hodges, Rudorf, Ruddell, and others has stressed the necessity of building new reading programs on the child's experience with language and his abilities to learn language. Further, Lamb and Henderson have noted that research in the psycholinguistic aspects of reading has indicated sufficient complexity in the development of language and thinking abilities in the young to suggest that the specific resources and materials needed for  reading should be highly individualistic. Fader and Herndon provide case studies of the uses of \"saturation\", \"individualized\", and \"experience-based\" materials in highly diverse school settings which appear consistent with recommendations noted in the research cited and which foster growth in creative and gifted students and in many others as well.

        "description":"A program of experimental research has established a relationship between associative reaction time (RT--the time between the presentation of a verbal unit and the first association produced) and performance in verbal learning. Initial studies established that the RT value of verbal units used as response terms has a significant facilitative effect on performance in paired-associate learning (PAL), i.e., within levels of equated meaningfulness (M), response-term units with short-latency (LL) RT values. It was hypothesized that RT and M play different roles in the PAL process. On the basis of the notion of different roles, Ley and Locascio proposed a modification of the two-state analysis of PAL in which the response-learning stage was viewed as consisting of two processes:  recognition and recall. Directed by this proposed model, Ley and Locascio designed a study in which a familiarization technique designed to strengthen the recognition response potential of verbal response units was introduced prior to a PAL task. Although the results of the research supported the hypothesis that recall of verbal units was related to making associations to the units during study, it was still unclear as to what the underlying mechanism is by which associations aid in the recall process. A number of questions still remain to be answered in the area of associations and RT. (CK)",

Aspects of performance investigated are: (1) relative participation of dyad members in the conversations, (2) mechanisms of the regulation and integration of verbal interaction, i.e., repetition and interruption, and (3) features of encoding style. The influence of subject characteristics, which include sex and race among the adult dyads and SES, sex and race among the child dyads, on these aspects of communication behavior were also examined. The results across the studies may be summarized as follows. The distribution of TVO  between members of the adult dyads and the patterning of the verbal gestures of repetitions and interruptions support the view that mutually accepted rules of conduct underlie participant interaction in problem-solving communication. The behavior of the child dyads reflects partial acquisition of these rules, and child dyad performance is similar across SES, race and sex subgroups. No consistent SES, race or sex differences were found in encoding style. Thus, observed SES differences in communication accuracy among the child dyads could not be directly attributed to characteristics of encoding style. (Author)",

The results for the first part of this study show that the percent of utility for the spelling patterns taken as a group in this study was 70 percent. Thus, taken as a group, the criteria established for the study of meeting a 75 percent utility were not met. In the second part, only those generalizations in which 40 or more syllables were found to which the  generalizations might apply were used. The results show that 81 percent of the words were composed in which every syllable contained spelling patterns identified for the investigation. The findings of the study showed that most of the syllables of the list were represented by a word-pattern and that many of the syllables followed a word-pattern in phonetic spelling. The results also indicated that many of the word-patterns are of limited value.

These items were developed to measure concept attainment using a completely crossed design with 30 concepts and 12 tasks. Conventional factor analyses were performed, separately for boys and girls, for concept scores and for task scores. Three-mode factor analyses were performed. The main conclusions drawn from the results of the conventional factor analyses are that all 30 of the concepts are measures of a single functional relationship existing among the concepts, and that all 12 tasks are measures of a single underlying ability or latent trait. The three-mode results indicate that there are no important concept-task interactions for the idealized persons; thus it is reasonable to  regard the concepts and the task as being two independent modes.

Secondary objectives for the product include improving verbal fluency and creative writing. Three classrooms 61 sixth graders and 34 fifth graders at two Wisconsin schools, used the program for two months. The purpose of this paper is to report the results of this initial field study. The major findings included information on the usability of the product and student attainment of product objectives. Teacher annotations, on-site visitations and rated pupil workbooks indicated that considerable reworking of the exercises was needed, although the teachers gave satisfactory ratings to the program  overall. Ratings of the exercises showed that only some pupils learned adequately the five techniques of creative thinking: Part-Changing, Checkerboard, Checklist, Find-Something-Similar, and Brainstorming Methods. Changes from pre-test to post-test on the 22-item attitude survey and the verbal fluency tests were both significant and positive. Finally, ratings of short writing samples showed improvement for girls but not for boys from pre-test to post-test. (Author)",

        "description":"This project was designed to provide current, educationally and linguistically sound information for the audiences involved in teaching a standard English to speakers of other dialects, specifically teachers, administrators, and textbook publishers. Three basic steps were followed in developing the targeted communications products: (1) the needs of the audiences were identified; representatives of each audience were involved in content selection and media development; (2) revelant research and related information were collected, analyzed, evaluated, interpreted, and synthesized; and (3) products designed to meet the information needs of each specific audience were developed, tested, and revised. Both the literature review and contact with members of the targeted audiences  revealed that misconceptions about nonstandard dialects are widespread in schools. Persons unaware of the linguistic research often consider a nonstandard speaker to be ignorant or lazy. The resulting damage to the nonstandard speaker may be profound. The disseminated information resulting from this project should help to overcome the questionable and often damaging attitudes and practices characteristic of current approaches to English usage. The critical need that teachers, administrators, and textbook publishers be aware of linguistic findings regarding dialect and dialect learning should be partially met by the dissemination of the products developed on this project.

Both have been proposed as the memory representation of sentences, but recent evidence suggests that the latter is the more likely. However, two recent studies have directly challenged this notion and suggest that rather than linguistic structure semantic vividness, as measured by imagery ratings, is the more important determinant of recall. In experiment one, nominals with different deep structures showing a recall difference were rated for imagery. No difference was found. In experiment two, nominals of equivalent deep structure showing no recall difference were rated for imagery. Significant differences  were found. In experiment three, Ss were set to perceive ambiguous nominals with different deep structures and tested for recall. No differences were found. Thus, claims of imagery's importance can be dismissed. However, the failure of experiment three raises interesting questions about the psychological status of ambiguity in general. (Author)",

Experiment 1 employed a mixed list of homonym, synonym, and unrelated noun pairs, while Experiment 2 employed homogeneous lists of homonym and synonym pairs.

Subjects aged 5 to 20 imitated synthetic speech stimuli representing English and novel categories. All except the 5-year olds imitated better than was predicted from studies of categorical perception. The 12-year olds performed optimally. Children were studied who were becoming bilingual. When languages were learned simultaneously, children showed fused systems. Children who had already acquired native languages experienced a \"silent\" period in the new language during which learning occurred. Accent is discussed in terms of motor-theory and psychological factors. Effects of reduced language input were observed in a hearing child of deaf parents. The language was  quantitatively and qualitatively different from normal children's. Absence of signing suggested that language must be directed to the child to permit acquisition. Characteristics of the language model presented to children was investigated by analyzing the speech of adults to a 2-year old child or to an adult. When speaking to the child, adults used shorter, less complex sentences, and more questions. The speech of male and female children could reliably be identified as to sex by judges. Differences in formant patterns suggested that children acquire cultural patterns for marking sex-identification in voice. (Author)",

With the aid of a clear-cut decisionmaking procedure, citizens could participate effectively in the development of specific planning policy statements. Such statements could be used to discuss planning priorities, focus on policy consequences, and evaluate alternative planning and design proposals. With the aid of simple graphic tools, citizens could themselves produce innovative planning proposals. (Sketches may reproduce poorly.) (Author)",

        "description":"The present study, part of a larger investigation, attempted to examine the separate and joint effects of succession and effectiveness on administrative processes in laboratory-created 3-level formal organizations. Specifically, the investigation concerned itself with the impact of these two elements on communication relationships between managers and subordinates. The investigators sought to assess the degree that these variables influenced the manner in and the extent to which information and affect was transmitted between executives and lower-level subordinates as well as among subordinates. Each organization consisted of seven coordinated positions -- a manager, two assistant managers, and four workers -- and was designed to resemble an actual business firm. Organizational  effectiveness was manipulated by predetermining the number and type of errors produced by the workers, who were confederates. Findings indicate that change in organizational effectiveness is both a major factor effecting the type and direction of communication flow between managers and subordinates and an important variable mediating the influence of leadership change on the type and direction of communication. The findings generally confirm the strategic importance of treating effectiveness and managerial variables in a processual, interdependent fashion. (Author/JH)",

Faced with a burgeoning school population and dissatisfied with the existing and planned facilities, the city of New York formed a School Space Study committee in 1970 to develop innovative approaches to providing quality space at reasonable costs with quick delivery. The results of that study are reported herein. Alternative educational and facilities options recommended include (1) the planning of 400-600 student primary and intermediate schools on small, scattered sites; (2) the provision of education space in new apartment buildings for the use of local school districts; (3) the use of \"found  space\" in nonschool building types that would require minimal conversion costs and that could be pressed into service for educational programs; (4) the distinction between old or obsolete schools and the renewal of the old schools physically and educationally; (5) the extended use of existing facilities through scheduling changes, night sessions, and year-round schools; the consolidation and recycling of underused elementary and intermediate schools for use as small high schools; and (6) the applications of systems building and building systems to the construction of new schools. The document provides the names and addresses of school personnel and planners associated with some currently operable innovative approaches. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"This document reports the result of a 5-day meeting held to recommend the structural building adaptations and the curriculum organization necessary to the renovation of Concourse Plaza Hotel into a high school. According to the planning committee, the hotel has many features adaptable to a school, which would permit a meaningful departure from the traditional structure. The investigation revealed that suites of rooms could be used for small group and individualized instruction in an informal setting, with television and lavatories in each suite; that stoves, refrigerators, and kitchens are conveniently distributed throughout the building for a possible decentralized eating arrangement; and that there are large clothing closets in all the apartments. The recommendations indicate  that suites of offices, a switchboard with telephone connections throughout the building, adequate basement areas, and ample space in general would permit quick and economical renovation. The plan calls for a comprehensive high school that would provide for students on all ability levels and offer both academic and career education. Recommendations include mini-schools -- 140 students and seven teachers -- to function for half the school day, with students' choices from a schoolwide selection of courses occupying the remainder of the day; and flexible schedules consisting of 20-minute time modules in various combinations within five 10-week cycles. Plans also call for liaison to be established with business, industry, labor, and the community for a variety of cooperative and  work-experience programs. (Author/MLF)",

Prior to model development, research conducted indicated that there was widespread dissatisfaction with current educational programs, since an inadequate balance between vocational and academic learning was found. Needs of EMR students and the competencies required of their teachers were determined. It was found that occupational information and preparation curriculum area were thought to need the most emphasis, followed by activities of daily living, psychosocial, and academic. Competencies rated necessary for the teacher were ability to provide for work adjustment, job seeking, job tryouts, job placement, vocational  evaluation, personal care training, and social development. A secondary EMR curriculum was reported to have been developed that included areas such as work adjustment training, vocational evaluation, interpersonal relationship experiences, and manual skill development. An undergraduate teacher training program was then developed that focused on the student needs and teacher competencies. (CB)",

It is speculated that past public school experience with the use of parent teacher conferences has been unsuccessful for reasons such as lack of teacher knowledge on handling parents, and parental misunderstanding of teacher's comments. The basic purpose of the teacher parent report conference is explained to be reporting to parents the child's progress in the special education and training program. The conference is thought to be more individualizing and meaningful for the parents than is the report card. In order to conduct conferences well, the teacher is said to need to understand the effects  of having a severely retarded child and the impact of this upon parents and families. The conference process is discussed and diagrammed, with emphasis on teacher control. Adequate teacher preparation is shown to be conducive to conducting the conference smoothly, warmly, and effectively. A suggested conference time schedule is provided. Appended is a bibliography of approximately 220 suggested readings for parents and staff in mental retardation. (CB)",

A total of 49 states returned the survey, and a total of 295 persons testified orally or in writing. Selected major findings and topics covered included need to increase stimulation of creativity and to provide for a flexible curriculum, need for early identification, need for better prepared teachers, mention of need for increased federal support of funds by 55% of all witnesses, state action, need for model programs, federal  government role, regional differences of testimony, differences of testimony by type of testifier, state legislation in 21 states providing special resources or incentive to local school districts for gifted programs, major deterrent to educational programs identified as lack of sufficient funds, and minimal state use of existing federal legislation. Included is a bibliography of approximately 90 written documents submitted to the hearings. (CB)",

Five basic steps in management are explained to be specification of problem behavior, counting the occurrence of the problem behavior, changing the problem behavior by formulating a plan, re-planning if necessary, and maintaining the appropriate behavior. Provision of appropriate consequences, reward or punishment, is then discussed. Reward and punishment are defined, and clarifying guidelines and comments are made concerning them. Common problems of implementation are then anticipated, followed by suggested solutions. A typical situation of classroom misbehavior is described in short, dramatic form to  demonstrate the behavior principles. Mention is then made of a video tape presentation that illustrates the basic steps of the management process as the teacher would use them. A copy of the video tape is said to be available through the Iowa Regional Educational Media Centers. (CB)",

Findings of a 1964 report were compared with findings in the current report. Activity programs were defined as organized rehabilitation services providing training in daily living activities to severely retarded individuals beyond school age. Development of activity programs was covered briefly. Findings reported included stated broad purposes of activity programs, referrals, admission criteria, evaluation procedures, reasons for rejection, activity center population, reasons for discharge,  waiting lists, program schedules, program activities, criteria for grouping, ratio of instructors to the retarded, planning program activities, evaluation of the retarded, counseling, transportation, cost of transportation, personnel, academic preparation of personnel, facilities, sponsoring or governing boards, volunteers, average cost to maintain an individual in an activity center, support of programs, and standards for activity programs.

The halfway house is explained to be planned on premises of community participation and program needs to provide a sheltered social environment in which new roles and behaviors could be tried and developed. Length of residence is thought to be typically limited to 6 months to a year. The halfway house's overall objective is said to be that of assisting the client's transition from institution to community life. Topics discussed in planning and establishment of a halfway house include historical perspective, preliminary thinking and  planning, funding and legal aspects, an initial working plan, three phases leading to separation from the halfway house and merger with community life, location and establishment of a halfway house, staffing, selection of residents, public relations and public education, actual prevocational training accomplished, social and personal training in community living, vocational rehabilitation program design, evaluation and research, and statistical design and conditions.

Selected topics discussed in relation to image modification and parent relations include the gripe bank as an index of morale and as organizational therapy, making furlough return a joyous occasion, program improvements  through marketing approaches, and image reinforcement by use of commemorative stamps. Then discussed are present day employee-administrative concerns such as functional advertising for institutions, programing institutional inventiveness among employees, uniforms as reinforcement, and strengthening houseparent retardate relations. Future demands are then mentioned such as relocation considerations, transportation and work, record keeping for the future, and the 4-day work week. (CB)",

It is explained that during 1971 the Office of Education has attempted to strengthen state, local, and federal partnership. Four national targets for fiscal year 1972 discussed are: 100,000 handicapped children in preschool programs, 250,000 children added to the special education roles, 250,000 children and young adults receiving vocational education in order that they can complete school with marketable skills, self-sufficiency, and increased self-regard, and 17,000 teachers and professional personnel receiving full or part time training needed in  reaching the three previous goals. It is clarified that federal money alone cannot meet the objectives, but that federal money is meant to act as a catalyst for state and local programs. It is thought that the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of government are cooperating in improving educational opportunities for handicapped children. (CB)",

All teachers utilized the Verbo-tonal Method for habilitating the children, who were assigned to one of the two amplifying systems. Speech samples were tape-recorded at 4-month intervals, judged, and analyzed statistically. Significant improvement over testing times for both groups was found, although the Suvag group demonstrated a greater rate of improvement than the Warren group. The condition of visual and auditory  clues with amplification was reported to be the best experimental condition for most children. Significant differences between the groups in terms of vocalization was found, with the Suvag group vocalizing more times per minute than the Warren group. Significant correlation was also reported between rating value and hearing level. Electrical and acoustic responses of the Suvag I unit indicated that the unit passed more low-frequency energy than the Warren unit. Reporting of related research concluded the interim report.

The second paper focuses on prevention of obstetric antecedents, with mention of responsible parenthood, study of previous reproductive events and congenital anomalies, relationship of social status to perinatal mortality and prematurity, maternal nutrition, psychosomatic factors associated  with pregnancy, maternal height and weight, maternal infections, and maternal diseases. The third paper on prevention of premature labor considers prophylaxis, early recognition of high risk patient, and inhibition of premature labor. The relative lack of medical help in encouraging the pregnant woman to enjoy both pregnancy and motherhood is the subject of the fourth paper on the low birth weight infant.

Among the results of an evaluation questionnaire are: the telecast portion of each lesson had a significant effect upon learning and retention; telecast portions of lessons stimulated pupil interest and motivated expanded activities; more than one presentation of each telecast is necessary for optimum effect on learning and retention; and telecast portions of lessons should be received by one class in a  regular classroom setting.

Representatives of CATV, broadcasting, movies, music and other industries, as well as the chairman of the FCC were all invited; but no one was invited to represent the six million subscribers. When the parlay was over, there was a CATV policy stripped of all its sinews except those which strengthen the status quo. So it's time for changes. A good start is to begin asking the right questions. For example, how should we handle pay-TV, and  what should be the proper relationship between federal, state and local bodies concerned with regulating CATV? We should think about designating a half-dozen communities as wired city experiments, as a basis for hard information useful for long-range policy making. (MG)",

        "description":"An experiment to study the use of a computer as an educational medium covered both higher education and continuing education. A general physics curriculum for physics and science education at the junior university level used multi-media computer-assisted and computer-managed instruction. In conjunction with continuing education the IMAGO method was used in two courses--one on financial management and the other on statistics. The main features of the IMAGO system included programed instruction, the Socratic method, closed circuit television, and phonotape recordings. Although the costs were high the results proved that students taking the multimedia course performed better than those receiving conventional instruction. (JY)",

        "description":"Two studies were performed to evaluate the extent to which response patterns and sustained attentiveness is a function of the demands of a secondary task, primary task difficulty, and feedback arrangements. The first study varied primary task stimulus difficulty level, feedback arrangements on the primary task, and presence of the secondary task. The main objective of the second study was to determine whether primary task feedback arrangements would interact with secondary task demands to influence attentiveness to the primary task; thus, primary task difficulty was held constant, and primary task feedback arrangements and secondary task difficulty level were varied. Results showed that subjects were able to detect changes in stimuli used in the primary task and to detect  presentations of the secondary stimuli, although apparently subjects were not consistently attending to stimulus characteristics. Further, there seemed to be some dimunition in attention to stimulus characteristics and a greater reliance on feedback whenever feedback was available on the primary task. Overall, results suggest the need for multilevel model of attention and that it is not sufficient to conceive of stimulus control in a unitary sense. (SH)",

In broadcasting, the FCC proposed new renewal rules and policies and issued a number of significant rulings on Fairness Doctrine matters. A policy statement outlining FCC cable television plans was submitted to the Congress. In the common carrier area, the FCC acted on computer communications and specialized common carriers and received applications for domestic satellites. The FCC advanced its program to provide additional land spectrum space for land mobile communications by establishing a Spectrum Management Task Force. A new fee schedule was adopted to return to the U.S. Treasury funds equal to the Commission's operating expenses. These highlights are summarized in  this booklet, which also provides facts and figures about the number of authorized stations of various kinds under the FCC's authority. (JK)",

While the complexities of modern society and the knowledge explosion do require many specialists, there are disadvantages to both the society and the individual in relying too heavily on specialists who cannot see the broader picture and who can become obsolete. The need of our society for a variety of integrative skills calls for a greater production of generalists: not jacks-of-all-trades, but people who have studied intensively, but not exhaustively, in a number of areas.

Both author-controlled and student-controlled CAI have the advantages of individualized instruction, privacy for mistakes, and flexibility, but are tremendously expensive. Student-controlled CAI further allows a student to be much more active, but also makes supervision difficult. A teacher-controlled system used as another teaching tool before a whole class of students is much cheaper than the other types of CAI, and adds to the computer program an intelligent subsystem, the teacher, to filter input and modify the stream of presentation. Teacher-controlled CAI gives up the advantages of individual  attention, privacy and flexibility, but the criterion of cost-effectiveness makes it an attractive possibility in the hands of a skillful teacher.

It has only been recently recognized, however, that the student can effectively teach his peers. By doing the teaching, students learn the material better and retain the subject matter longer than they ordinarily would. In addition, students approach the subject matter with enthusiasm and they continue to do so after the course. Fred Keller has developed an instructional technique known as the personalized system of instruction (PSI) in which the use of students as teachers has been maximized. The proctor is not only an important source for disseminating information to other students as a &quot;teacher,&quot; but is an important source of feedback on the good and bad  characteristics of the program. Proctors have been enthusiastic in their support of the system and harsh in their criticism. (Author)",

The system, called TICCIT (Time-Share Interactive Computer-Controlled Information Television), now interacts with more than 100 students, each moving at his own pace, for four semesters of community college math and English. Average response time to student inputs is less than one half second. The student terminal includes color TV screen, headphones and full alphanumeric keyboard. It costs about $900, approximately 25 percent of total system costs per terminal. Operating costs could average less than one dollar per terminal-use hour. A typical hour begins with a short movie followed by presentation of a \"menu\" showing segments of the presentation which  can be accessed any time; for example, \"mini-lesson\", \"instruction\", \"why take this lesson\", \"test\", and \"games\". The teaching strategies have been developed independent of content so that different course material can be plugged in the programs at some future date. (MG)",
