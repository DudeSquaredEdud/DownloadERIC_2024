        "description":"The development of the error prone model (EPM) for the 1984-1985 student financial aid validation criteria for Pell Grant recipient selection is discussed, based on a comparison of the 1983-1984 EPM criteria and a newly estimated EPM. Procedures/assumptions on which the new EPM was based include: a sample of 1982-1983 Pell Grant recipients originally selected for the Pell Grant Quality Control Study was used for estimation; cases assumed to have met the Pre-Established Criteria were excluded from the estimation database; and the model was based on an exploratory data analysis approach embedded in the Automatic Interaction Detector (AID) software package. To develop the new EPM, error was defined as the potential change in the Student Aid Index resulting from validation on four  application items: household size, U.S. taxes, and adjusted gross income of dependent parents or independent students, and student/spouse net income for dependent students. The 41 applications items that were considered as possible variables for predicting errors are identified. Information is also provided on the 18 final groups that emerged from the AID sequential search estimating procedure. Appended are descriptions of the 28 validation criteria for 1984-1985. (SW)",

        "description":"The development of a number of error-prone models to select Pell Grant recipients for validation is discussed. The 1983-1984 Pell Grant validation strategy consists of a two-stage approach: selection using Pre-Established Criteria (PEC) followed by selection using Error Prone Modeling (EPM). The database used for model development consists of a sample of 1980-1981 Pell Grant Recipients. The policy question is which students should be selected for various types of validation measures. Eight effectiveness measures are defined, and for each measure an error-prone model is developed that will identify those cases for which the corresponding type of validations will uncover the highest level of error. The data elements include: income, U.S. taxes paid, household size, nontaxable  income, liquid assets, spouse income, and dependency status. The eight models are then compared in order to identify the most cost-effective approach to marginal selection for validation. The measures refer only to the payment consequences of discrepancies likely to be uncovered by the corresponding type of validation being used. Detailed appendices include EPM error tables and Automatic Interaction Detector coding categories for predictor variables. (SW)",

Attention is directed to: (1) information needed by the U.S. Secretary of Education to decide about changes to the delivery system; (2) reasons that delivery system redesign is a critical issue; (3) what can be learned from previous approaches to the delivery system issues; (4) the current approach to the delivery system redesign issue; and (5) what will result from the assessment effort. One consideration for key policymakers is the effect of the current delivery system on key participants, including aid applicants and their families, colleges, lenders, and state and federal government. The focus is three systems of the U.S. Office of Student Financial  Assistance: Pell Grants, Guaranteed Student Loans, and campus-based aid. Major proposals of an alternative delivery system are reviewed that concern: use of technological advances, using a system approach to system redesign; broad alternative approaches involving operational and programmatic changes; and a general methodology for system redesign that deals with effects of change on program intent and involves the student aid community in the process. The framework and model structure of the current approach and its general strategy are also considered. (SW)",

Each set of regulations dealing with QC in the program is described according to several characteristics, including programmatic relationships among the federal, state, and local governments; QC responsibilities and procedures; standards and measures; frequency of reporting; and incentives. It is concluded that the structure of the delivery system is a critical factor in determining the regulatory approach to QC taken by federal agencies. Results of  the review include: the regulations mandate the inclusion of not only computation and reporting of error rates, but also the development and implementation of corrective action plans; standards, measures, and frequency of computing and reporting measures are fairly consistent across programs; most regulations identify both positive and negative incentives; and the character of the regulations differ across agencies.

        "description":"Fiscal year appropriations and supporting data are presented for comparative analysis of state financing of public higher education. The report is based on the fall collection of state appropriations data reported by M. M. Chambers. It presents a model of state rankings for seven independent factors plus eight derived measurements that together represent the principal state conditions and financial actions underlying and governing appropriation levels. The text explains the design of the model and its use, defines the measurements, and presents a limited macro analysis. A technical appendix provides greater detail on data definitions; analysis and interpretation of the data are the responsibility of state and individual users. The seven factors of the model include: (1) resident  student source, high school graduates; (2) college attendance ratio; (3) system support index, 1981-1982; (4) tax capacity, 1983; (5) tax effort, 1983; (6) allocation to public higher education, 1984-1985; and (7) tuition factor, 1984-1985. Tabular data are presented independently by state in rank order for fiscal year 1985; collectively by state in alphabetical order, fiscal year 1985; and historically by state 1978-1985. (SW)",

The POWERHOUSE shows cover comprehensive health and nutrition topics in an action-adventure format for intermediate students in grades 4-6. Activities cover the following program themes: making friends, coping with stress, learning the importance of discipline and practice, preventing illness and the spread of disease, respecting individual differences, making responsible consumer decisions, getting the facts about alcohol, judging abilities rather than disabilities, taking on challenges and avoiding unnecessary risks, knowing how to find help, learning about weight control,  seeing beyond sexual stereotyping, becoming physically fit, and learning about individual growth rates. For each program, a leader sheet provides a synopsis of the television program, background information, and insights into how the activities can help young children. Also included are an activity sheet describing activities for children to do in their meeting room, their community, or at home with their families; games and puzzles; a POWERHOUSE membership certificate; and a logo for stickers and T-shirts. The teacher's manual lists learning objectives, suggests questions and activities for pre- and post-viewing, and presents a brief synopsis of each of the 16 half-hour television dramas. Included, too, are four pages of student handouts. (LMM)",

Forty-five teachers enrolled in a graduate level course in instructional supervision participated in the guided design exercise, &quot;Right or Wrong Triangles,&quot; which introduces and requires application of the model. The exercise uses a transcript of a high school mathematics class as the basis for individual and group activities in identifying classroom problems, suggesting possible problem causes, and proposing solutions. Results indicate that the group exercise was an effective tool  for student exploration of the troubleshooting model. With regard to stages of concern about innovation, the group is typical of non-user groups in having high concern for information and fewer for consequences and collaboration. For about one third of the group, additional discussion about guided design should focus on the teachers' personal reservations in using it and similar alternative techniques. The guided design exercises used in the study are appended. (LMM)",

Background information covers developments in program packaging and distribution and explores design concepts that permit the adaptation of programming for multiple markets, such as modularization in which a project is initially planned with the intent of producing two or more products in varying formats. Legal, economic, and policy issues that may have an impact upon program packaging for the new  distribution environment are also outlined. Emphasis is on the use of public television materials both to serve educational and cultural needs and to extend the reach of public broadcasting. Appended materials include story outlines and treatments for a hypothetical package including television programs, microcomputer software, prerecorded videocassettes, and videodisc, all created from a single core production; a plan for station organization for modular projects; and a discussion of negotiation for multi-market television production.

Current teletext activities in the United States are reviewed, and four levels of involvement are assessed as options for a public broadcasting station: vertical blanking interval (VBI) leasing; VBI leasing plus retransmission of a teletext signal; VBI leasing and  retransmission of a national or regional teletext signal, plus local origination of a small teletext service; and VBI leasing plus operating a major teletext service. Final chapters summarize the Federal Communications Commission's rules governing teletext, and offer suggestions for station planning and making decisions about teletext services.

        "description":"This digest addresses issues that should be considered in proposing technological solutions to the problems of public education. Although the potential benefits of the widespread application of media to instruction are supported, emphasis is on the need to define technology as a technique of designing instruction, rather than the more common perception of technology as machine. This definition implies the interaction of individuals, materials, and machines, in a variety of instructional settings and employing a variety of instructional strategies. Three basic patterns of media utilization are identified--additive, integrated, and independent--that have different potential effects on the cost and effectiveness of education. Conclusions stress that the achievement of excellence  through the use of media requires capital investment in tools to allow the application of the &quot;techniques&quot; of educational technology, a reorganization of the structure of teaching and learning, and the will to do it. Five references are listed. (LMM)",

        "description":"This information digest discusses current issues in the management of software collections and outlines several possible options for the cataloging and processing of microcomputer software and courseware. A statement of the problem indicates that treatment of microcomputer software is highly dependent on the type of library, size of the collection, variety and purpose of the collection, type of access to be provided, and type of organization. The &quot;Guidelines for Using AACR2 [Anglo-American Cataloging Rules Second Edition], Chapter 9 for Cataloging Microcomputer Software,&quot; published by the American Library Association, are described briefly, including sources of bibliographic information; title and statement of responsibility area, general material designation; edition; file  description; and notes. Examples of other procedures that have been developed are noted, including those of the American Association of School Librarians, the Ohio Media Association, and the North Carolina State Department of Public Instruction. Other promising practices identified include the use of database management software for microcomputers to create online catalogs, produce master lists for circulation, and create charts. A 15-item bibliography is provided. (LMM)",

        "description":"This digest discusses teleconferencing--defined as electronic communication between two or more people at a distance--in terms of three major types: audio, video, and computer. Reasons offered for using teleconferencing include the extension of budget dollars and of educational opportunities, accommodation of a wide variety of classes, and provision of a flexible format for meetings. Audio conference options identified include dedicated conference networks; dial-up networks; &quot;meet-me&quot; conferencing, in which each participant calls the conferencing center from any convenient location; and audiographic teleconferencing, which involves transmission of print and graphic information over telephone lines to complement basic communication with visual information. Video teleconferencing  options described include freeze-frame or slow scan television; compressed video systems; and full motion video systems, which use wideband channels to send video, voice, and data. Computer conferencing is also briefly explained. Nine additional readings are listed. (LMM)",

The five parts of the handbook cover respectively: (1) information sources including &quot;encyclopedic databases&quot; and their vendors (Dialog and BRS), information utilities, and electronic mail and bulletin boards; (2) equipment needed and preparing to search; (3) training for the  encyclopedics, assistance with the utilities, and software for searching; (4) management concerns including start up budgets, promotion and service, and recordkeeping and reporting; and (5) searching with students. Numerous appendices include information on databases from BRS and Dialog; lists of sample files available on the Source, CompuServe, and Dow Jones News/Retrieval; ERIC ordering information and forms; information on database access and on journal collections; and examples of a search log and of search request and search evaluation forms.

The study begins with a discussion of Japan's efforts to coordinate STI, including government efforts to create integrated STI networks and additional efforts to monitor and acquire foreign STI. A discussion of current U.S. efforts to acquire Japanese STI, including selected efforts by federal agencies, the private sector, and university programs, is followed by an analysis of existing barriers to the acquisition and dissemination of this information.

        "description":"This manual was developed as part of a cooperative project between the State Historical Society of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Division of Corrections' Green Bay Correctional Institution. As part of a new training program involving computers at Green Bay, the Director of Education approached the State Historical Society about developing a program appropriate to the training needs of the inmates that would also produce something of permanent value of the State. Based on the Society's extensive experience with the 1905 Wisconsin Census Indexing Project and the many developments in the area of automation initiated by the archives, the Society developed a project in which students would help to create a database listing and index of the 1880 Census for Wisconsin. In developing the  program they hoped to create a model that would have wide applicability not only for other states and censuses but for historical demographic data in general. The manual comprises six sections: (1) Introduction; (2) The 1880 Census; (3) A Few Definitions; (4) Using the Computer; (5) Census Data Entry; and (6) Hints for Solving Problems and Additional Information. Appendices include population totals for Wisconsin counties, 1880; population totals for towns, villages, and wards of cities, 1880; and a copy of the 1880 Census Program written in Applesoft BASIC.

Subjects of the study were selected from 499 students who were advised, based on their test scores, to enroll in developmental sections of Basic Communications (BC1000) or Technical Mathematics (TM1200) between 1980 and 1983. The study focused on the grades, grade point averages (GPA's), and retention rates of 136 students who enrolled in BC1000 and 147 students who elected to enroll in college-level Basic Communications (BC1001); and 143 students who enrolled in TM1200 and 73 students who chose to enroll in the college-level  technical mathematics course (TM1201). Study findings indicated: (1) 17.6% of the BC1001 group withdrew, compared to 10.2% of the BC1000 group; (2) 17% of the TM1201 students and 15% of the TM1200 students withdrew; (3) while the BC1000 group had slightly higher GPA's than the BC1001 group, the TM1201 group had slightly higher GPA's than the TM1200 group; (4) those who received unsatisfactory grades in their developmental classes were more likely to withdraw from college than those who received satisfactory grades; and (5) 100% of the developmental students who eventually graduated had received satisfactory grades in Their developmental course work.

        "description":"This study focuses on the interrelationship between family influences and child care of varying quality on the toddler's capacity for compliance and self-regulation in a laboratory setting. A total of 89 families with children 18 to 36 months participated. Thirty-two families used day care centers identified as high quality, 25 families used day care centers identified as low quality, and 32 families did not use day care centers. Three quality-of-care indices were used: adult-child ratio, continuity of staff, and training of staff. The child and the primary parent participated in a 30-minute laboratory session. Observations of the child's capacity to comply with the parent's request to complete a boring and familiar task and the child's capacity for self-regulation both in the  presence and the absence of the parent were made. Measures were adapted from those used by Schaeffer and Crook (1980, 1981), Londerville and Main (1981), and Lytton (1979). Composite scores for adult and child behavior were created by adding the scores on each task segment of the laboratory session. At 18 months, children from both high and low quality care settings demonstrated abilities to resist temptation and to use self-regulating techniques that were similar to those demonstrated by 36-month-old children who did not attend day care. Parents with children in high quality child care were more invested in their child's compliance at an earlier age than were other parents. Parents' behavior was also different for their 18-month-olds than for their older children. Compliance tasks  revealed developmental trends consistent with Kagan's (1981) and Kopp's (1982) suggestion that the capacity to comply develops during the toddler period.

Statements from three senators describe the legislative history and successes of the program and detail the senators' efforts to restore funding to 1980 levels. Testimony is also given by medical experts from the Children's Health Fund, the Michigan Department of Public Health, the National Maternal and Child Health Resource Center, the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Services for Children with Handicaps Program in the Minnesota Department of Health. This testimony describes the impact of spending cuts  in various states on the numbers of children and pregnant women served and on the kinds of care they receive. Information is also given concerning the responses of state governments to the increasing demand for services (due to unemployment) in the face of federal funding cuts; the disproportionate effects of reduced federal funding on the urban poor, the rurally isolated, and handicapped children, as well as on the infant mortality rates of Blacks and Hispanics; and the cost effectiveness of prevention programs that provide prenatal care, immunization, and early diagnosis of health problems.

        "description":"One concern frequently cited regarding early childhood programs is that methods for assessing some of their more important objectives are inadequate or nonexistent. This paper addresses this concern in the areas of health, safety, nutrition, dental health, and physical development during the preschool years. An organizing framework for classifying the outcomes of early childhood programs in these areas was developed during the first phase of the Head Start Measures Project. In order to determine which characteristics of children's development are important to measure, two surveys were conducted: (1) a survey of 22 child development scholars; and (2) a survey of 375 primary school teachers, and Head Start teachers, parents and staff. The organizing framework resulting from  analysis of survey data includes four content dimensions (health and safety, dental health, nutrition, and motor development). Each content dimension contains from 3 to 10 clusters of variables, or constructs. These constructs are discussed in terms of recent literature, especially research on the pilot testing of assessment techniques. It is suggested that these techniques can be used by early childhood programs to conduct their own evaluations to provide comprehensive, in-depth assessments of the effectiveness of health-related program components.

To meet the need for inservice training, a practicum was designed and implemented to (1) increase inservice education for child care providers at a minimal cost to the program; (2) generate ideas that child care staff members would use in their centers; and (3) disseminate educational information, techniques, and materials related to the inservice sessions through networking. The practicum addressed the inservice needs of 78 Title XX early childhood caregivers in 18 centers and their administrators by providing a university-sponsored conference, a  series of workshops, and networking opportunities. Much of the labor of conference presenters and workshop consultants was donated. Assessment on specially designed questionnaires indicated that practicum goals were attained.

        "description":"Serious discussion of the status of children's culture in Sweden began 15 to 20 years ago. Today, it is increasingly realized that children need and have a right to personal artistic experiences. A report presented in the spring of 1983 by the National Council for Cultural Affairs on interaction between preschools and local cultural life prompted municipalities to invest greater effort in cultural activities at preschools. Another effect of the study was to bring about reassessment of training requirements for preschool teachers and child recreation leaders. Following the major expansion of Sweden's preschool system in the 1970's, discussion today increasingly centers on the content of preschool education. By bringing to life children's cultural heritage and traditions and  thereby rooting children in their own environment, cultural activities accomplish an important end. Specifically, the aim of such activities is to integrate culture in children's day-to-day life by providing continual contacts with libraries, municipal schools of music, museums, theatres, and practicing artists, rather than by presenting culture as something apart from life.

        "description":"The Head Start Measures Project was a 3-year study to develop a set of measures designed specifically for Head Start children. The measures are based on a path-referenced approach to assessment, in which children's performance is described in terms of their position along paths of development. A path is defined as a sequence of skills within a content area that is ordered by difficulty. A path-referenced test score not only indicates what the child has achieved but also details the skills the child is likely to master as developmental progress continues. The result of the project is the Head Start Measures Battery (HSMB), consisting of six scales: Language, Math, Nature and Science, Perception, Reading, and Social Development. There are versions for Spanish-speaking and  English-speaking children. In a brief and nontechnical fashion, this report summarizes aspects of the project described in more detail in other publications. Chapter I describes the background of the Head Start Measures Project and the path-referenced approach to assessment. Chapter II describes the HSMB, the 1982-83 field test results, and the uses of the measures. Chapter III describes the development and evaluation process, the psychometric properties of the measures, and the results of research relating program characteristics to achievement. Chapter IV describes a current pilot project, which involves the dissemination of the measures and their use by a sample of 30 Head Start programs. (CB)",

A brief report of results on the Georgia Basic Skill Tests (GBST) for tenth graders is also included. Specifically, the GCRT is designed to assess students' performance on reading (including concepts in reading, literal comprehension, and inferential comprehension) and mathematics (including concept identification, component operation, and problem solving). The 1984 mean scale scores of Atlanta first graders exceeded state performance levels on both the reading and mathematics tests of the first-grade GCRT. Although the reading and mathematics performance of fourth-grade pupils continued to rise from 1980 to 1984, statewide performance  also rose. Thus, performance of Atlanta fourth graders fell below the state level. The performance of Atlanta eighth graders was also below the state level. Numerous tables list the performance of each grade on test objectives; indicate performance of individual schools; and give comparisons among state (Georgia), district (Metro Area), and Atlanta norms. Comments on the GBST report that 91 percent of pupils in regular tenth grades passed the reading test and 85 percent passed the mathematics test.

The first panel presented an overview of paternal absence and father involvement. Testimony disputes the view that emphasizes father absence and lack of interest in child care. New levels of father interaction and skill in dealing with infants are described. The second panel concentrated on military families and paternal absence, the Army's efforts to deal with both the changing nature and circumstances of the military family, and stresses on and needs of military families. The third panel described effects of paternal  absence and involvement on children. The importance of economic security for families is substantiated by findings of studies on black fathers and fathering. The final panel listed private-sector initiatives that address paternal absence and father involvement. Discussion focuses on what voluntary organizations are doing to serve youth, new institutional developments enhancing the roles of fathers in their families, and the impact of father absence on families of incarcerated men.

In particular, conference discussions focused on the notion of systematic change; time-on-task as the most promising strategy for success; and encouragement of principal and teacher support for implementing program models. It was suggested that committed teachers are needed to make a program successful, and ways were suggested to &quot;court&quot; them. In addition, it was felt that efforts to strengthen the instructional process must address, among other subjects: (1) staff attitudes and expectations; (2) organizational structure and procedures, including student/staff assignments; (3) systems of incentives and rewards; (4) commitment of local  boards; (5) responsiveness to locally demonstrated need; (6) the delivery system; and (7) the management system. In response to a discussion of problems in program implementation and replication, an entirely new format for subsequent Follow Through projects/research was suggested. This format would involve study of exemplary programs to lead to a verifiable theory of effective early primary education and would provide for the necessary adaptations to student differences and other system variables. A discussion of what administrators need to know about a program before it is adopted or adapted is followed by guidelines for new Follow Through pilot projects. Also included are brief descriptions of the Detroit (Michigan), Napa (California), Oakland (California), and Cotopaxi (Colorado) pilot  projects. Following a summary of what is known to date about Follow Through programs is a list of 40 background papers prepared for NIE. (AS)",

        "description":"This report synthesizes the information presented at three conferences designed to develop guidelines for future funding for Follow Through programs. These conferences were part of a series of activities undertaken by the National Institute of Education (NIE) in 1981 to plan for a new set of Follow Through research and pilot project activities. After the foreword in chapter I, chapter II discusses the concept of Follow Through from 1967 to 1972. Chapter III focuses on planning for Follow Through, reporting NIE's suggestion that systematic change be brought by having pilot projects focus on implementing and managing proven procedures rather than on developing new curricula or instructional practices. Also discussed in this chapter are four crucial problems in the management of  compensatory education: (1) improving the instructional process; (2) building internal support systems; (3) utilizing external support groups; and (4) seeking selective evaluation. Chapter IV describes evaluation strategies for Follow Through and provides discussion of the value of conducting a &quot;multiple case study&quot; to measure program effectiveness, instrumentation, effectiveness of studying one system, and the value of conducting a multi-site study. Concluding observations are made in Chapter V. A list of 29 background papers prepared for NIE are included in Chapter VI. (AS)",

Summaries of the conference presentations are provided, grouped into three sections. The first section examines the basis of conducting evaluations. Several basic assumptions are challenged, among them that well-planned innovative programs have an appreciable effect, that research findings influence educational decisions, and that the use of scientific inquiry is a valid basis for social change. It is suggested that a &quot;judicial method&quot; can involve school staff in constant controversy and keep them learning as they weigh &quot;trial&quot; evidence. The second section discusses methods of knowing whether programs are being implemented.  Discussions of a method to calibrate degrees of implementation by teachers, the &quot;banking&quot; of a retrievable group of generalized outcome measures (which would serve Follow Through programs that are ill-served by standardized achievement tests), and the diverse requirements for federal administrators are also included. Uses and misuses of tests and the inadequacies of the testing system for language-minority students are discussed in the third section. The report concludes with discussion, conclusions, and recommendations by conference members; a list of participants; and a list of papers presented. (AS)",

        "description":"Preschoolers 4 and 5 years of age were found to use four strategies differing in temporal characteristics as they solved simple addition problems with sums of 10 or less. Three strategies had visible and/or audible aspects, and one was covert, involving retrieval from memory. The harder the problem, the more often the children used an overt strategy. The use of overt strategies most often on the hardest problems was adaptive and efficient. How children knew when to use overt strategies, though, remained unclear. Addressing this problem, Siegler and Shrager (1984) proposed a distribution of associations model to explain how children arrive at their addition strategies. Their model involves representation and process. In brief, children represent correct and incorrect answers that  vary in &quot;strength of association&quot; between problem and answer. Then they retrieve an answer. If the answer is sufficiently strongly associated with the problem, the child advances the retrieved answer. If not, the child elaborates through overt strategies the representation of the problem. Elaboration of representation is followed by retrieval. This alternation between elaboration of representation and retrieval may progress through three phases. The model has implications for explaining parallels between children's and adults' problem-solving behavior. In addition, it suggests that ordering children not to use overt strategies such as counting on their fingers is worse than useless. (RH)",

        "description":"Researchers have pointed out that the effects of generic stressors such as poverty may be mediated through other stressors in the microsystem of parent-child relationships or personal characteristics of family members. Specific, potential mediating stressors were sought in this study involving 191 low income Moslem families who had immigrated from North Africa and who had lived and worked for at least 2 years in Paris, France. Data were obtained from developmental assessments of 24-month-old children and parent interview records. Screening records provided information about medical conditions, family characteristics, and the demographics of family life. Records also provided evidence of any behavior problems in children and indicated whether the mother, father, or both reported  feeling overwhelmed by their life circumstances. With the available data, a comparison was made of 36 overwhelmed immigrant mothers and 155 non-overwhelmed immigrant mothers. Items in four domains of potential stressors were predicted to differentiate between the two groups: ecological stressors, medical or health stressors, parental personal and interpersonal stressors, and child problems and difficulties. Ecological and medical stressors did not markedly differentiate the two groups. Parental or family interaction and child social behavior stressors did differentiate the groups, and did so strikingly. Interventions at the microsystemic level with poor immigrant families were recommended. (RH)",

        "description":"A detailed description and sociological analysis were made of peer interaction in a public school kindergarten located in a large urban school district. Data collected over a 5-month observation period included field note transcriptions of hundreds of interaction events, records of formal and informal interviews with classroom participants, and various unobtrusively obtained data. Analysis focused on identifying the social goals of children in child-to-child interactions. Affiliation, competence, and status goals were identified. Affiliation goals enabled children to feel they are connected with others, that others perceived them as worthy social interactants, and that others cared about them and wanted to do things with them. Competence goals promoted children's feelings of  competence, conveyed the sense that they were capable of accomplishing school tasks, and suggested that they were recognized as members of the group achieving what is expected in school. Status goals enabled individuals to feel superior to or more important than others, to manipulate or control the actions of others, and to assert their own status in relationship to the status of others. Findings related to each goal area are described, and reference is made to the interactions of children in the contexts of their kindergarten. Within each goal area, sets of strategies for accomplishing social motives are identified. A taxonomy of social goals in outline form is appended. A three-page list of references is also included.

        "description":"To help parents of Italian descent take an active part in their children's education, a 2-year program was implemented in New York City and Boston. The project attempted to examine the impact of training upon (1) parents' active participation in the schools and the bilingual programs; (2) parents' home activities with their children; and (3) the reading achievement of bilingual children of elementary age. The program consisted of a series of workshops for 60 parents. Presentations introduced parents to the structure of the American school, bilingual education, and reading activities that they could perform with their children on a daily basis. The development of a formalized parent training program was motivated by experience in bilingual communities suggesting that parents do  not participate in schools. However, research has found that the home environment influences IQ and that children's attitudes toward and achievement in school are factors of their home experience. Outcomes of the first year of the program included the development of parent advisory committees, the organization of parents to make their opinions known to school officials, the voting of parents at school board elections, and the training of parents to work as aides in the bilingual program. As a result of an intensive course during the second year, parents conducted reading activities at home. Results of pretesting and posttesting indicated an increase in the children's reading levels over a 3-year period. Workshop outlines are attached; appendices include demographic information about the  parents and the results of parent attitude questionnaires. (Author/CB)",

During FY84 SRDC had an active role in seven meetings involving training about community/rural development (leadership development, minority land loss, computer utilization, etc.), training rural clergy to minister to troubled families (problems of death and dying, money management, substance abuse), training Garden Club and community members for effective leadership, and facilitating improvement of the Kellogg Rural Leadership Program through co-sponsoring a national  workshop for Kellogg Leadership Program directors. SRDC was also active in two networks, the National Network on Extension Community Leadership Programs and the Southern Region Business Management Network. SRDC cooperated with the other rural development centers in developing designs for in-service education of cooperative extension personnel. Six studies or projects were completed or are underway.

The three components (a continuum of reading and writing skills, pre-GED reading and writing skills workbook, and teacher's guide) of the PATHWAYS curriculum are described in detail in the second section. The next three  sections recommend methods for diagnosis, placement, and evaluation; outline suggested classroom management techniques; and provide a record-keeping system. Suggestions for effective teaching in an adult education setting, ranging from program management to the actual delivery of instruction and retention of students, are offered in the final section.

        "description":"Written to shed light on the unique recruitment and retention problems faced by rural and small school districts, this booklet also presents strategies to address these problems. Among problems noted in the opening overview are that recruiting and retaining good teachers in rural and small schools is complicated by inadequate pay which does not compensate educators for isolation, easily discouraged educators who haven't been prepared for rural living and teaching become easily discouraged; that there is a negative rural stereotype; and that there are too few good educators in the hiring pool overall. The chapter on research findings acknowledges that data collection efforts in rural education are recent, but that existing data do show that distinct differences between rural and  nonrural schools affect a district's ability to attract and retain teachers. Two chapters consider recruitment and urge that recruiters be well-prepared, represent the community as well as the school, and stress the positive aspects of small communities. Suggestions cover how to publicize vacancies, where to look for potential teachers, and what kinds of incentives have been successful. A final chapter on retaining staff provides suggested activities for helping staff acclimate themselves and grow professionally, cites understandings teachers need to cope with rural life, and describes the Rural Job Referral Service. A bibliography, author page, and acknowledgements conclude the booklet. (BRR)",

Ninety-six sixth graders from a middle school in Georgia were randomly assigned to one of eight groups defined by possible combinations of two teacher uncertainty conditions, two bluffing conditions, and two participation conditions (use or nonuse of a handout). Each group was given a 20-minute audiotaped mathematics lesson on Euler's formula while they observed overhead projections and blackboard demonstrations. Examples of the types of lessons are included. An analysis of variance indicated that student achievement was not significantly affected by uncertainty, bluffing, or participation. However, student  attitudes were significantly affected. (MNS)",

The subjects were 72 children aged 8 to 10 who had experienced difficulties learning subtraction with regrouping operations in their classes. Children observed a same-gender peer demonstrate either rapid (mastery model) or gradual (coping model) acquisition of subtraction skills, observed a teacher model demonstrate subtraction operations, or did not observe a model. Children then judged self-efficacy for learning to subtract, and received subtraction training. Observing a peer model led to higher self-efficacy for learning, posttest self-efficacy,  and achievement, than did observing the teacher model or not observing a model. Children who observed the teacher model scored higher than no model subjects on these measures. No significant differences were obtained on any measure due to type of peer modeled behavior (mastery/copying). (Author/MS)",

Fifty children aged 9 to 10 who lacked division skills received instruction and practice opportunities. Task strategies were assessed by recording children's verbalizations while they solved problems. Ability attributions exerted the strongest influence on changes in self-efficacy, and improvements in division skill largely depended on self-efficacy and effective strategy use during the training program. Future research should explore the relationship between strategy use and self-efficacy during various phases of skill acquisition. Implications for teaching are discussed. (Author/MS)",

Nor is there information on response behavior of potential teachers to various monetary and nonmonetary incentives for increasing the supply.

The goal of this program for economically qualified high school juniors and seniors was to expose them to aerospace technology through four program objectives. These objectives include: (1) emphasizing the value of science, mathematics, and technological education through applications in the aerospace industry; (2) providing stimulating experiences that reward high achievement, and helping students in personal growth and career direction; (3) providing a means for participants to share their experiences through planned presentations at their home schools; and (4) establishing new linkages to support  public education, parents, and others in the pursuit of excellence in mathematics, writing, and reading. Findings (which focus on students' program preferences, educational benefit of the program, and academic achievement) indicate that the program was a success. A list of nine recommendations based on the findings is included. Two of these recommendations are that Lockheed TEC should capitalize on its experiential aspect by incorporating and/or expanding on those activities that provide for learning by doing/knowledge applications and that future participants should have a 2.5 grade point average and show a proclivity for achievement in a technological area.

Results indicate that participants have limited knowledge about the environment. In addition, their degree of verbal, actual, and emotional commitment to the environment is low; the respondents either do not care, have not learned, or have not been exposed to an adequate amount of environmental knowledge or to a sense of commitment. While not scoring significantly higher, forestry majors did score enough higher to suggest that their  more science-based academic requirements increase their knowledge and therefore their environmental commitment. Findings (such as environmental knowledge being the strongest predictor of actual commitment to the environment) are consistent with those of other studies. Based on the low scores of participants, it is recommended that greater emphasis be placed on environmental education at all educational levels and that elementary education, recreation, and forestry majors have more required course work in ecology and environmental studies.

Included in the model were selected demographic and socioeconomic factors, academic abilities factors (including logical thinking), indicators of home and school support, attitudes toward science, and students' science enrollment plans. Results indicate that students (especially females and blacks) tended to avoid advanced and quantitative science courses. Student attitudes toward science were low, especially their motivation and self-confidence in learning science. Though they were higher achievers, females expressed less enjoyment in learning science than males. Males, more than females,  stereotyped science as a male domain. Attitudes and past performance appeared to influence course plans for both males and females. Among the attitudes, student motivation and usefulness of science were the most important predictors for course plans. These and other results suggest that: (1) improved achievement in junior high school years should be emphasized; (2) teachers and parents should motivate and encourage students to select more science courses; and (3) the unique value and usefulness of each science course should be explained to students as early as possible.

Responses obtained from middle and high school science and mathematics students were classified into one of nine categories. These categories ranged from &quot;no attempt to make a graph&quot; to &quot;complete graph with a statement of a relationship between the variables.&quot; The categories in between represented increasingly more successful attempts at ordering data in one and both variables to correct scaling of the data on the axes. Middle school subjects exhibited behaviors mainly in the first four categories, 9th- and 10th-grade subjects overlapped with middle school subjects and the 11th- and 12th-grade subjects in the middle categories, and the 11th- and 12th-grade subjects  exhibited behaviors mainly in the last five categories. These response categories also showed a close fit with Piagetian concrete operational structures for single and double seriation and formal operational structures for proportional reasoning and correlational reasoning. Teachers can use this information: (1) to determine what logical reasoning students will bring to a graphing situation; (2) to understand the reasons why students make certain mistakes when they make line graphs; and (3) to make interventions that will help students make their graphs correctly.

Microcomputer simulations of manipulative activities were used to determine how children differ in their use of science-process skills and concepts when using the simulations compared to using the concrete materials, or a combination of simulations and concrete materials. Subjects included 113 children distributed according to male and female, second- and fourth-grade level, and socio-cultural site. Criterion measures assessed the children's ability to: recognize and duplicate a design;  recognize and extend a pattern; and locate objects in space. Results indicate that: (1) fourth graders performed better than second graders; (2) rural, white children performed better than suburban, black children with activities involving the computer; (3) rural, white girls performed better than suburban, black girls using concrete-only activities; and (4) rural, white boys using activities involving the computer performed better than suburban, black girls using concrete-only activities. These findings suggest that concrete and computer activities have different effects on children depending upon their socio-cultural background and upon their sex. (Author/JN)",

Students' responses to items inserted into five course examinations were treated as measures of their abilities to use the charactertistics of formal thought in problem-solving. These items focused on six physics concepts dealing with torque,  electricity, optics, and heat (since understanding these concepts requires use of one or more characteristics of formal thought). Results suggest that a non-significant relationship exists between formal thought characteristics required to solve a problem and demonstrating the possession of those characteristics. When success on each of the interview tasks was correlated with success on each of the other tasks, all correlation coefficients obtained were significant and moderately high, suggesting that success on a problem which requires formal thought depends on an overall formal thought structure.

        "description":"This 10-chapter report provides detailed information on a study which examined what combinations of teacher, student, and curricular variables were associated with more effective life science instruction at the intermediate level. The conception of effectiveness was guided by the normative framework of scientific literacy and by student growth on science outcomes. The definition of scientific literacy used consists of five components: explaining science content; relating to science as a social historical process; relating to science as a reasoning process; relating science and society/technology; and positive attitudes toward science. Among the findings (from students and teachers in 11 classes) are indications that: (1) teachers generally used a typical pattern of academic  instruction, relying heavily on recitation, seatwork, and laboratory exercises; (2) students perceived that teachers made relatively little use of the scientific literacy components other than explaining factual content; (3) worksheets were the most commonly assigned activities; and (4) student attitudes toward science generally declined over the academic year, while science knowledge, understanding, and reasoning skills increased. Recommendations based on these and other findings are offered, such as increasing teachers' use of the scientific literacy framework and upgrading the cognitive level of tasks assigned to students.

Results showed that acceptance of misconceptions and mathematical self-concept were significantly related to mathematics anxiety; the combination of misconceptions, mathematical self-concept and arithmetic skills was significantly related to statistics course performance. Older students returning to school after several years' absence were the ones most debilitated by negative attitudes toward mathematics. It was concluded that mathematics anxiety involves a mechanistic, nonconceptual approach to math, a  low level of confidence and a tendency to give up easily when answers are not immediately apparent.

Also explored were: (1) which explanatory concepts are present, that is, which steps and conditions of understanding are thematized in the explanations? and (2) do explanatory concepts differentiate according to success and failure in understanding or by sex? A two-dimensional table was constructed for coding explanations of 20 male mathematics teachers in grades 5 and 6 of schools in West Germany. Results indicated a marked predominance of explanations referring to domain-specific tasks as compared to explanations extending across  tasks. The order of frequency of steps and conditions of understanding are noted, and sex differences in a few categories were found. The discussion focuses on: (1) reference to the task and type of explanation; and (2) obtaining explanations referring to task: problems and opportunities. (MNS)",

        "description":"Recently, a number of studies have reported a high correlation between the supposedly separate traits described as integrated science process skills and formal reasoning ability. The implication has been that these two constructs are different but related. Further implications have been made that a treatment to enhance one &quot;trait&quot; might influence the other as a result of some cause-effect relationship. This study measured these two attributes using different instruments to assess their discriminant and convergent validity. The instruments used were the Classroom Test of Formal Operations (Lawson) and the Group Assessment of Logical Thinking (GALT) to measure formal reasoning, the Test of Integrated Process Skills (TIPS II) and the Process Skills of Science Test (PSS) to measure  integrated science process skills. Results indicate that the two traits share more variance than expected and that they may not comprise distinctly different traits. A factor analysis was performed on subtest intercorrelations to examine which, if any, subfactors on the two constructs overlapped. Overlap was indicated for the subfactors of controlling variables, probabilistic reasoning, and combinatorial reasoning. (Author/JN)",

        "description":"This study used data collected during 1981-82 from a random sample of 1,960 9-year-old students from 124 elementary schools involved in a national assessment of educational progress in science. The database was used in secondary analyses which probed the validity of a model of educational productivity involving a set of nine aptitudinal, instructional, and environmental variables which require optimization to increase student learning. When controlled for other factors, ability, motivation, class environment, home environment, amount of television viewing (negative direction), sex, and race were all found to be significantly related to achievement. For an attitude outcome, the factors linked with attitudinal attainment were ability, motivation, class environment, and race. These  results for 9-year-olds were compared with those emerging from secondary analyses of data provided by 1,950 17-year-olds and 2,025 13-year-olds participating in the same assessment. Overall, the findings supported the model of educational productivity and sugggested that science students' achievement and attitude are influenced jointly by a number of factors rather than one or two dominant ones. The study also attests to the potential value of science education researchers performing secondary analyses on the high-quality random databases generated as part of national assessments.

Conventional lecture-based strategies involved didactic teacher presentation of target concepts supplemented with reading assignments from the regular textbook. Findings indicate that: (1) analogy-based instructional methods appear to enhance student performance relative to conventional lecture-based instruction in  achievement related to the digestive, nervous, and circulatory system; (2) both concrete and transitional/formal operational students benefited from analogy-based instruction; (3) with both treatments, transitional/formal operational students tended to show higher achievement than concrete operational students; (4) concrete operational students receiving analogy-based instruction scored higher than transitional/formal operational students receiving conventional lecture-based instruction; (5) students who comprehended analogies showed significantly higher achievement over those who did not comprehend them; and (6) the effects related to treatment tended to be more pronounced when comprehension of analogy was high.

It is critical that students, especially U.S. students who live in a culturally pluralistic society, be made aware of how genocide was perpetrated in the past and of the fact that it is still happening today. A basic genocide awareness glossary is provided. Seven approaches to genocide awareness education are discussed: (1) an international law and world order theme; (2) socio-economic inquiries concerning the causes of genocide; (3) historical studies; (4) affective interpretations based on first-hand accounts; (5) human rights activism; (6) recognition of those who refuse to take part in genocide; and (7) the development of theoretical models of genocide prevention. Four  constraints on genocide awareness education are examined: it is uncomfortable and unpopular to teach children about death and destruction; it is politically controversial; there is an ambivalence about U.S. government policies toward minorities; and it is difficult to find a manageable way of teaching the topic. The conclusion, however, is that genocide awareness education must be integrated into the entire curriculum. (RM)",

        "description":"By looking at changes in the status and role of the fqih or traditional Islamic teacher in Morocco, it is possible to trace the transformation of the entire learning system from an independent, teacher-centered approach to a government-controlled educational system, of which religious education is only a part. In the traditional system, students memorized and recited the Quran at lower levels, and at higher levels studied exegesis, grammar, and law. The teacher's educational background consisted of local level schooling, travel for study-apprenticeships with individual scholars, and usually attendance at formal centers of Islamic study. The goal was acquisition of a quality called &quot;ilm&quot; (knowledge). Pressures for changes in this system began early in the 20th century when Morocco  was a French protectorate. In 1968, the Moroccan government merged the Islamic and government schools so that fqihs now teach five- and six-year olds. Higher religious instruction now occurs through specialized secondary schools and universities. The traditional teacher's techniques and status have changed considerably and parents now see the teacher as a countervailing force to rapid social change. (IS)",

        "description":"An analysis of surveys conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics shows that the overwhelming majority of U.S. secondary schools offered one or more courses in the arts and in the humanities during the 1981-1982 school year. The arts program most commonly available was music, offered by over 90 percent of the schools; the humanities offerings at nearly all schools included English and history. Regarding enrollment, approximately 69 percent of high school seniors had taken one or more courses in the arts between their freshman and their senior years, and 99 percent had taken at least one humanities course. An overview of the study findings is presented. Specifically discussed are offerings and enrollments in arts and humanities as related to school type; school  size, region, and urbanicity; percent of students in an academic high school program; availability of a gifted-talented program; student body characteristics; and percent of graduates expected to enter college. The characteristics of students concentrating in the arts and humanities are also examined. The appendix contains descriptions of the sample designs, data sources, and data adjustments, and a complete list of arts and humanities courses offered. (RM)",

        "description":"Findings are reported from two descriptive studies of preservice teacher education students' conceptual change in response to reading methods instruction. The first study, involving 14 preservice teachers, focused on how students applied what was taught in the reading methods course; the second study (14 participants) examined students' conceptual change during instruction. Both studies employed observations and interviews. Results of the first study indicated that the preservice teachers gradually tended to change their thinking about reading instruction and that teaching a real student during the field practicum contributed to this change by encouraging a restructuring of cognitive information presented in the methods course. Findings of the second study, focusing on whether  preservice teachers change their cognitive conceptions and the characteristics of the changes, indicated that students apply methods course information in stages and that there are wide differences in the way they organize that information. A discussion is presented on implications for future studies of the process and structure of methods courses, and on ways in which they may be made more effective. (Author/JD)",

Established law and entrenched  interests in education must be of concern in policy formation as well as the complex problems inherent in reasonable and sufficient state funding. SEA action for improvement of education must be concerned with what is crucial to real educational reform, what is amenable to change, and most clearly with what is in the area of state-level authority.

One section took frequent cooperative quizzes, while the other took quizzes individually. Results indicated quiz scores were more homogeneous within the cooperative groups, and generally higher for the CT section. There was no significant difference between sections on the two regular examinations. Attitudes toward CT and beliefs about its fairness were more positive for students from the CT section. Students in this section were more likely to believe that their study groups influenced how much they  learned and how well they did on quizzes. Using CT as one part of a student's evaluation may have positive benefits while yielding equal levels of achievement. Cooperative test-taking was interpreted by students as a learning opportunity, as well as an evaluation tool.

The Korean Educational Development Institute (KEDI) accomplished research on the development of a new educational system through four stages: system analysis, system planning, demonstrative implementation of the  system, and evaluation of the system's effectiveness. As a result of the new educational system, the students' academic achievement, independent learning attitude, and expressive ability were improved. A positive self-concept concerning academic learning was formed. The quality of school management was improved. The teachers enhanced their subject guidance and instructional skills. The influence of the study on Korean education and aspirations for the future are discussed. (DWH)",

This paper compares two versions of a mathematical model of test performance to interpret test data that includes both genuine and nonsense items. One formula is based on the usual assumption that knowledge is all or none. The alternative formula incorporates the notion of partial knowledge adapted from signal detection theory. Results of a chemistry test taken by 407 subjects with four nonsense and 20 genuine items are used to compare the two formulas. A moderate correlation between the predictions and the findings indicate both model variations have some success, but the partial knowledge formula is the more accurate.  (Author/BS)",

        "description":"This report provides historical background on the origins, development and procedures, of Educational Testing Service's (ETS's) Board of Review. Established in 1969, the Board of Review makes final decisions for all test scores of questionable validity. ETS cancels or withholds scores believed to be invalid. Reasons for invalid scores range from improper testing conditions to overt candidate misconduct. Between these extremes lie the problems of questionable validity. Cheating on tests has been a recognized problem since the College Entrance Examination Board's founding in 190l. After the 1947 establishment of ETS, first test program directors, then a security officer (1956) were responsible for test score investigations. In the 1960's the Law School Admission Council's concern  led to a review of ETS test security procedures directed by Robert Smith, and the subsequent establishment of the Board of Review. While there have been ongoing policy changes and procedural refinements (most notably increasing reliance on sophisticated statistical methods and computer technology) the key element is unchanged. ETS interest is in the validity of the scores it reports, not in providing evidence or judgments of candidate misconduct. Court cases concerning score reporting have upheld ETS policies. (BS)",

Major structural changes are taking place at this educational level, partly because of large scale youth unemployment. The two current examination systems for the final year of cumpulsory education, the Ordinary (O) level of the General Certificate of Education (GCE) and the Certificate of Education (CSE), are now being combined in a General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) with courses starting in 1986. A new 17-plus exam, the Certificate of Pre-Vocational Education (CPVE) is also being introduced. In addition two major initiatives are taking place in the schools: (1) student profiles, or records of  achievement; and (2) graded or graduated assessments. All these innovations are characterized by a commitment to development and implementation without adequate evaluation. This lack of concern for curricular and organizational consequences or major technical problems (such as criterion referencing, score equating, and reliability) reflects a widespread disillusion with the academically divisive and unreliable current examination system (BS)",

Two extreme reactions to computers are computer phobia, or anxiety, and computer addiction, or \"hacking\". A four-part questionnaire was developed to measure computer anxiety. The first part is a projective technique which requires the examinee to draw a scene with a computer in it and write a description. The second part is a computer knowledge measure. The final two sections are a description of one's behaviors involving computer use and an attitudinal assessment of computers. Issues that are particularly important to the study of computer anxiety include: (1) the need to identify what is contextualized by the word \"computer\", (2) clarification of the  relationship between various kinds of anxiety and behavior toward computers; and (3) consideration of the possibility that computer phobia may be functional.

Several biographies of talented people in several disciplines including music, mathematics, and visual arts are discussed. Examples of their crystallizing experiences are cited. The existence and structure of these crystallizing experiences are a derivative of the multiple intelligences theory of human intelligence. The nature of the experience depends on the age of the subject. The crystallizing experience seems to be more prevalent in mathematics and music than in the visual arts. It is a fragile phenomenon which occurs when circumstances combine inborn talent,  self-teaching, and proper exposure to a set of materials in a particular way. It is recommended that all children be treated as if they have the potential for crystallizing experiences. They should be exposed at an early age to materials which may motivate them to explore a domain. (DWH)",

Developed for the Florida Beginning Teacher Evaluation Program, it provides behavioral ratings for teachers in a classroom setting. Data came from ratings of videotapes of nine teachers conducting actual lessons by nine teams of trained observers. Analysis of variance produced three estimates of reliability for each scale and subscale: (1) discriminant (across teachers); (2) stability (over time); and (3) interrater (among raters). Results indicate that the instrument appears sufficiently reliable to conduct classroom observations if ratings by at least two different observers are averaged to produce scores. Effective (positive) indicators of teacher behavior  appear to be more reliably observed than ineffective (negative) indicators. Two domains--Management of Student Conduct, and Communication: Verbal and Nonverbal--appear too intercorrelated with the other domains for discrete reliable estimation of specific behaviors. Future research on this instrument should include validation, rater certification, norming and frame factors. Appendices contain: (1) background information on the knowledge base and the Florida teacher competencies; (2) indicators of the summative instrument; and (3) computation of reliability estimates.

Interrater agreement ranged from .28 to .53 among students, from .11 to .70 among staff, and from .28 to .70 between students and staff. Separate factor analyses of student and staff data showed all items except one exhibited high loadings on a single factor. The eight items forming this factor were summed with unit weighting to form a total &quot;Teaching Quality&quot; index score for each instructor. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) coefficients for this index were .92 for  student raters and .93 for staff raters. Although this evidence for reliability is compelling, the question of validity remains. Validation methods depend on how the instructional ratings are used.

A Principal Components Factor Analysis with a Varimax rotation yielded different factor solutions: (1) the average sample yielded two factors, verbal ability and perceptual organization, which are consistent with Weschler's findings; and (2) the gifted sample yielded four factors, identified as perceptual organization, verbal  ability, acquisition of knowledge, and alertness and attention to detail.

Students also judged task and effort as more important causes of failure than ability and environment. When students were divided into groups according to reported level of comfort with  the research course, significant differences were found in the importance attached to task and ability as determiners of success and failure.

The study covered some 300 Chapter l projects over a three-year period, focusing on project settings and instructional approaches used in the projects. Results of the study indicated that the pull-out setting produced the highest achievement gains and the most favorable cost-effectiveness ratio. A prescribed instructional system, supplemented by a miscellany of other materials, produced the highest achievement gains and the most favorable cost-effectiveness ratio. The cost information generated clearly provides a better basis for determining the relative worth of the various instructional settings and approaches used in  compensatory education. (Author)",

Since 1983, legislation requires teacher education centers in Florida to report attainment data based on measurable objectives. Using a classification system adapted from the &quot;Rand Change Agent Study,&quot; directors and supervisors categorized each unit of their inservice components as one of seven types of inservice. An appropriate evaluation procedure designed to provide evidence of the increased knowledge and skill of participants was identified for each inservice type. These activities culminated in the generation of an inservice classification system with a concomitant evaluation strategy with two types of instruments--achievement tests and rating scales.  The &quot;Inservice Evaluation Handbook&quot; was created to provide assistance in developing these instruments. Although implementation difficulties emerged much progress was made in inservice evaluation. (Author/BS)",

        "description":"Using data collected from kindergarten and second grade children in a study of young children's concepts about writing as reflected in their school writing behaviors, this report focuses on information gathered from second grade children. The introductory chapter restates the research questions guiding the study and briefly reviews the major conclusions drawn from the kidnergarten data presented in volume 1. The second chapter includes both a review of research relevant to the study of beginning writing in school and a review of the project's data collection techniques. This chapter also presents the case of Bonita, the least academically successful of the three second grade writers studied. By describing, first, the nature of school writing events and next, Bonita's variable  behaviors across events, the chapter demonstrates her sensitivity to the social features of these events. The third chapter introduces Ayrio, one of Bonita's peers. By comparing Ayrio's behaviors to Bonita's, the chapter illustrates both similar dynamics at work and differences in their behaviors that appeared related to differences in their social lives within and outside the classroom. Specifically, Ayrio's case highlights the potential role of peers in writing growth. The fourth chapter focuses on Duranne, whose case highlights home influences. Again, by comparing Duranne's own behaviors across events and by comparing her behaviors to Bonita's and Ayrio's, the chapter demonstrates a child's sensitivity to writing as a social activity. The final chapter is a summary of the major  conclusions of the study, including an overview of the kindergarten and the second grade data analysis. (HOD)",

The communication assessment instrument that was used contained five sections of eight communication constructs.

        "description":"Although many metaphors were developed throughout the Free Speech Movement at the Berkeley campus of the University of California, the central metaphor of the movement was the university as a factory. The analogy was used to argue that trends in higher education were moving toward the dehumanization of students and was related to the national concern over lack of freedom by many to exercise their constitutionally mandated civil rights. Students argued that university involvement with industry was mercenary and that students were used, like raw materials, to be molded into prefabricated cogs to fit easily into the machinery of government and industry. The movement, by its use of the structural analogy--university as factory--chose an extremely powerful argumentative tool and a  useful image that lent itself to quick and wide dissemination among members of the movement. The continued development of metaphors allowed the leadership to control the analogy to a fairly high degree. However, when compared to the standards of ethics proposed by Richard Weaver, the Free Speech Movement--because of certain unwarranted uses of words as &quot;free speech&quot;, its desire to eradicate hierarchical distinctions at the university, and its failure to recognize the constraints placed upon the university--must be judged as ethically suspect with regard to rhetoric.

Researchers conducted interviews in 422 homes and distributed questionnaires with Likert-type and frequency scale items. While parents recognized and observed the warnings, the multiple regression analyses revealed that the parents who were influenced by the warnings were those who came to the viewing situation already active in regulating and monitoring their children's television viewing. The results suggest that television networks should supplement the warning statement system with efforts to increase the involvement of parents in overseeing their children's television viewing. The warnings would then  influence greater numbers of active parents and increase the effect of the warnings on the audience for which they are intended. (Author/HTH)",

Color-coded questionnaire forms were distributed to parents, teachers, administrators, and trustees, with questions relating to (1) general identifying information, (2) school community relations, (3) instructional services, (4) personnel, and (5) &quot;free response.&quot; General findings are reported for each group surveyed, and tables are provided that show statistical profiles of  respondents in relation to questionnaire items. Twelve of the questions asked were similar to those on a 1979 Gallup poll, so results of that poll throughout Canada and in British Columbia are compared with these survey results. Twelve implications are derived from the study as a whole, suggesting that parental involvement in schools is favorably regarded but requires careful planning and cooperation by all groups involved.

        "description":"The professional preparation received by school administrators in developed countries is not necessarily appropriate for administrators in developing areas. There is little disagreement over the need for specialized training for these administrators, but decisions remain to be made concerning the types of training to be selected and the delivery systems to be used. Three administrative skill areas can be identified: technical and operational maintenance skills (those used in developed areas may be transferable to developing areas, with caution); human relations skills (largely untransferable); and conceptual/analytical skills (not yet adequately defined or identified). Training should take place at both the preparatory and ongoing development levels. Inservice and related  programs seem best for technical skill training, graduate coursework best for conceptual skill training, and a cooperative approach by universities and local operating agencies best to develop human relations skill training programs. Significant research must be done to determine the needs and current practices of administrators in developing areas, and to establish appropriate theoretical frameworks. (PGD)",

Teams of experts in each of the component areas of the IES circulated inventories to the panel membership, who recorded their opinions about each proposition, the confidence level of their estimates, and their basis for judgment. These data were then recirculated, so that panel members could refine their judgments and comment on the developing consensus. This methodology is described in detail, and results of the analysis are reported for the following six  contributing factors: (1) teacher characteristics and behavior; (2) administrator characteristics and behavior; (3) student body composition; (4) school learning climate; (5) pupil evaluation procedures; and (6) curriculum materials. Policy implications are then summarized for each of these factor areas. The study concludes that substantial improvements have occurred across the board in the teaching of needy children. (TE)",

This theory presupposes that curriculum expectations be made clear to students, and that students be given sufficient time and resources to achieve those expectations. The role of administrators is therefore to make these expectations clear to teachers, to provide teachers with the means to carry them out, and to assure that teachers do carry the goals out. Teachers and administrators must share a common belief that certain outcomes are expected for students at a given grade level in a given school. Evaluation devices  must also be geared precisely to these specific curricular goals. Three important related concepts are defined and discussed: allocated time, engaged time, and success rate. These concepts are then brought together into a single concept of academic learning time, defined as engaged time with materials or activities that produce a high success rate and are related to outcome measures. This concept of academic learning time is shown to be a good predictor of classroom effectiveness. The paper concludes with general observations on the utility of research in assessing teacher effectiveness. (TE)",

These studies, along with others, provide a basis for describing important dimensions of teacher behavior that account for well-managed classrooms. Classroom management is viewed as the result of three phases of activity. During the pre-active phase (before students arrive), teachers form expectations for student behavior, plan rules and procedures, prepare the classroom setting, and identify activities for students. In the second phase, at the beginning of the year, teachers communicate expectations, students are socialized into the classroom  setting, and procedures and routines for classroom activities are established. During the third phase, the remainder of the year, the classroom system is maintained by careful teacher monitoring, prompt handling of problems, and carefully designed and conducted activities.

These general precepts are clarified through a series of basic principles of staff development, illustrated by concrete examples. First is the notion that schools should be organized in a way that permits professional development to compete with other obligations. The second principle is that successful professional development requires reciprocity and respect, or trust, among colleagues. Finally, the central challenge of leadership involves shaping meaning, value, and belief  by establishing a visible order of priorities. (TE)",

        "description":"This paper rests on two propositions: that inservice training must radically change to result in the transfer of training to classroom practice, and that inservice training must be embedded in coherent school improvement programs in order for change to be sustained. Accordingly, the first section reviews three recent research studies designed to build understanding of the problems of transfer, increase rates of transer of training, and determine the extent of attrition over time when training was boosted by the coaching of teaching and peer coaching. The second section discusses the critical importance of staff development in school improvement, arguing that, on the basis of the research, the provision of coaching following initial training--even very strong training--will be  necessary if new behaviors are to be integrated into classroom practice. The design and implementation of powerful training systems will require the full support of leadership at both the district and building levels. Administrators will have to examine priorities for staff development and the allocation of funds. Further, the organization of peer coaching systems will need to be cooperatively arranged between district administrators and school sites. Principals will be in a position to assist with more than just the logistics of peer coaching--they will be able to facilitate the implementation of such systems through establishing new norms that reward collegial planning, public teaching, constructive feedback and experimentation and through collaborative problem solving with their  teachers.

Allocation of 1 or 2 percent of a district's annual budget could bring computers within the reach of every student in a few years, and this will result in significant, far-reaching changes in education. Commercial applications of computer technology that are already causing fundamental changes in our society include robots, calculators, information storage and retrieval, \"intelligent\" wristwatches, cameras, and copy machines, and a proliferation of other applications. To make the best educational use of computers, teacher education is essential. Free evening courses and computer books and magazines in teachers' lounges are  cheap ways to upgrade teachers' awareness of computers. A 3-level inservice model for teacher education in computers is proposed. Level 1 consists of workshops to provide teachers with basic hands-on experience; level 2 provides teachers with enough knowledge to bring students to the level of computer literacy aimed for in level 1; and level 3 consists of providing teachers with the broad knowledge of computer capabilities that they will need to fully integrate computers into the curriculum in a creative and useful manner.

The fundamental problem is a shortange of educational software that can be used as a major part of the teaching of academic subjects in elementary and secondary schools--a shortage that is both the effect and cause of insufficient market demand for more diversified educational software. Related problems include (1) the time and cost of designing and coding programs, (2) machine incompatibility, (3) software piracy, (4) locating and reviewing software, (5) competition by manufacturers for the more lucrative home market rather than for schools, and (6) problems in integrating software into a classroom's other activities. Because the software  problem is primarily economic, the principal solution is to provide economic incentives for educational software development. These include government and private funding of software projects, collaborative contracts between software firms and educators, and wise purchasing decisions to help shape the course of production and innovation. Curriculum design should incorporate highly adaptable generalized programs, and teachers can develop their own educational software. The problem will be mitigated only as more organizations invest more in developing good educational software. (TE)",

In the evaluation of these four areas serious problems were identified: job descriptions were incomplete; inappropriate factors were used to determine job worth; the grade-to-compensation conversion was not reasonable; and the administrative and maintenance activities did not keep the system current and equitable. The reasons for these problems are outlined and the report concludes that the system  was flawed at its inception, had high inflation rates, was understaffed, and did not follow important procedureal requirements.

(2) What are the perceived causes of student behavioral and discipline problems? (3) How are the schools planning and administering discipline? and (4) How do schools enforce discipline and how effective are the approaches? The staff of 27 randomly selected schools and a limited number of parents were surveyed. The findings show that discipline is not seen as a significant problem and that where a discipline problem exists, it is limited in scope and severity. The three major causes of misbehavior identified in the survey are (1) inability of students to perform satisfactorily, (2)  disrespect for authority, and (3) inability of teachers to effectively communicate with some students. The survey also found that schools follow existing discipline policy closely and feel it to be effective. Administrators agreed in their ratings of the effectiveness of seven common disciplinary actions used by the schools. They gave the highest ratings to &quot;formally reporting a student to the principal&quot; and &quot;calling a student's parent or guardian.&quot; The responses of the parent sample were similar to those of school staff. The survey found that the district need not overly concern itself with discipline issues. Included are three extensive appendixes of the data collected in the survey. (MD)",

        "description":"A preliminary analysis of the impact of the seven-period school day found that a seven-period schedule allows small high schools in Montgomery County, Maryland to offer almost as many courses as larger six-period schools and allows their students to enroll in more courses, particularly in academic areas. It further concluded that students took advantage of expanded offerings, with the number of sections of academic courses increasing by 7 percent. This later analysis confirms but qualifies the former findings. In both six- and seven-period day schools, total course offerings decreased slightly from 1981-82 to 1982-83, but seven-period schools added academic courses. Despite school enrollment declines, course enrollment increased in both types of schools, growing 11.7 percent in  seven-period schools. Both &quot;academic&quot; and &quot;non-academic&quot; departments in seven-period schools gained enrollment, with increases of over 2,500 students in business, home economics, and industrial arts, and over 1,000 in physical education, art, foreign languages, social studies, mathematics, and science. In six-period schools, however, only mathematics gained over 1,000. Students used seventh periods to acquire vocational and life skills as well as to add academic courses. The seven-period day affected 10th and 11th graders' course selections, but not those of 12th graders. The seven-period day affected students of all achievement levels equally; the shift toward taking a slightly greater proportion of nonacademic courses was similar for both high and low achievers.

        "description":"Enduring political support from business may benefit schools much more than the material contributions they often seek. A study of school-business interaction in 23 U.S. cities reveals wide variation in the availability of corporate aid, the sophistication and organization of schools' initiatives toward business, and the results of the interaction. Because large corporate donors are concentrated in the Northeast and because different industries are differently inclined toward educational support, many school systems have difficulty obtaining contributions. Gaining access to untapped corporate resources may be expensive and time-consuming. Although schools more often than businesses initiate cooperation, their efforts are generally disorganized and poorly monitored. Fewer than  half the districts surveyed have policies on school-business interaction; groups such as teachers' unions, school business administrators, and school boards, which might lend valuable support to policymaking, are rarely involved. Though recent activites have modestly enhanced school resources and created some prospects for stable political alliances, most public-private ventures have been narrow, episodic, and superficial. To meet current challenges, schools must take coherent action toward long-term partnership with business. (MCG)",

Professional development activities designed to improve the knowledge and skill of teachers can help students improve academically. In investigating the motivation for professional development, the findings of several researchers support the conclusion that teachers are motivated to participate in continuing professional development activities primarily by intrinsic factors. Evaluation results of an Australian inservice program for educational administrators indicate that well-designed continuing professional development programs can change the behavior of participants. In addition, research on effective schools has shown the important role of the school principal in  encouraging and supporting the continuing professional development of teachers.

        "description":"The current rate of technological change demands changes in the ways educational administrators are trained. On one hand, administrators need more systematic inservice programs to update their skills and they themselves must provide their staffs improved inservice training. On the other hand, increasing specialization precludes administrators from mastering all the activities they manage; preservice education must therefore ground them in the fundamentals of learning theory, pedagogy, communication, and leadership, but most importantly, teach them how to learn. Accompanying these changes, the accelerating pace of life and increasing transience will affect schools' counseling services, organizational dynamics, and employment practices; telecommunications will alter the physical  and social structures of both work and learning; and job obsolescence, particularly affecting unskilled workers, will increase pressures for more effective schooling. Obviously there is no simple answer to this challenge, but two concepts combine to provide a general model for administrator education. The first of these identifies fundamentals of management: systems theory, decision theory, understanding of group and individual behavior, and distilled managing experience. The second describes foundations of curriculum development. These concepts can guide a cohesive and articulated program to prepare administrators for the 21st century. (MCG)",

Results of a review of the research on the assistant principal from a sociological perspective indicate that the research has contributed little to increasing understanding of the social character of the school work setting, the careers of administrators, or problems associated with training and developing educational administrators. Researchers in educational administration are encouraged to draw more upon sociology theory and research, to focus their research on work contexts and  day-to-day social behavior, and to employ research strategies appropriate for investigating social phenomena. Developing an applied/action research partnership is suggested as a strategy with potential for both scientifically useful research and for school improvement based upon problem-centered inquiry. Propositions are listed to provide understanding of the administrative career and to increase the potency of the socialization and on-the-job performance of principals and assistant principals, with the conclusion that fundamental changes in professional preservice training programs and career socialization processes must occur.

It is the most important of the three types of learning, but least used. Research indicates students will learn more, like school better, like each other better, and learn more effective social skills when cooperative learning is used. It is not simply a matter of putting students into groups to learn, but involves positive interdependence, face-to-face interaction, individual accountability, and appropriate use of interpersonal and small group skills. Among strategies necessary to implement cooperative learning are: clearly specifying lesson objectives; making plans about the cooperative learning group; explaining the academic task and cooperative  goal structure to the students; monitoring effectiveness and providing assistance with interpersonal and group skills; and evaluating student achievement and helping them assess how well they collaborated with each other. The principal's role includes structuring and managing a support system for teachers, with teachers providing the basic support for each other. The report describes procedures that sample school districts followed in implementing cooperative learning, and gives the address of the Cooperative Learning Center, a resource for information.

        "description":"The education voucher idea is reviewed and comparisons are made among three existing plans. The basic idea is that the government issues a voucher of monetary value directly to families to pay for education. Existing proposals include the California Coons/Sugarman plan from the 1970's, the Friedman plan, and the Jencks proposal. These plans vary from providing basic subsidies with little regulatory control to providing subsidies that include extra compensations for the poor and slightly more regulatory control over school standards. Sponsors of voucher plans believe that choice is a requirement for school improvement and that competition improves school delivery systems. They feel the plan's simplicity eliminates complex administrative processes, is inherently fair, and will add  innovation and diversity to schools. Critics argue that the plan has uncertainties, that the schools could loose their common core curriculum, that costs could vary, and that it may require added bureaucratic procedures. They express concerns that a competitive environment brings potential for abuse, increases social stratification, and gives public support to religious schools. In the 1970's the Office of Economic Opportunity and the National Institute of Education conducted research on voucher systems, but it was unsuccessful and provided little information on whether such systems can work. Major questions about voucher proposals remain. (MD)",

        "description":"This booklet reviews decision-making, an important part of administrative processes, from the perspective of school teachers and other educators. The two most commonly used processes are the rational decision-making process (identify the problem, evaluate the problem, collect information, identify alternative solutions, select and implement solutions, evaluate the decision), and the modified rational decision-making process (minimal problem definition, then solution decision). Good leaders should differentiate between routine and nonroutine processes. Nonroutine decisions are complex and require time and careful deliberation. Leaders have the power to make unilateral decisions, but doing so does not mean they will make good decisions. Experience shows better decisions are made  when others are involved; whom to involve and when to involve them are important components for successful leaders. Herbert Simon's &quot;Zone of Acceptance&quot; model, posits a zone in which subordinates are willing to accept leaders' decisions without their involvement, as against situations where not being involved would fall outside their zone of acceptance. Speed and accuracy in decision-making are not always compatible. Other decision-making techniques outlined are force field analysis, brainstroming, minimal group technique, forced choices, compromise, and consensus. The booklet includes an exercise in which the reader makes decisions and compares them with correct ones, as well as a brief bibliography. (MD)",

Policymakers' response to reductions depends on an array of factors: general economic conditions, access to data about future trends, community expectations and &quot;myths,&quot; past records of school effectiveness, local education leadership, and previous levels of local funding. Since so many options are available, retrenchment decision-making is likely to be highly politicized. How decisions are made can be as crucial as the decisions themselves. A scheme for decision-making is described that includes six areas: (1) how decisions will be made; (2) general reactions to retrenchment; (3) retrenchment goals, policies, and decision rules; (4) general strategies for reducing  expenditures; (5) specific strategies for effecting program and personnel cuts; and (6) ways to stage retrenchment.

The presentation of school budgets for voter approval must be done as effectively as possible. When presenting budgets, administrators should take into account that the public has a low tolerance for detail, budgets are boring, a well informed public is more positive, presentation materials should be attractive and brief, support groups are needed, and the media should be used wisely. The most important component of the process is the presentation of the budget support material. Fifteen suggestions for presenting budget proposals to the public are provided. The printed budget should be attractive, be self-explanatory, answer the public's questions, use graphics and  easily understood tables, and use clear uncluttered prose. The author provides an example of a &quot;bird's eye&quot; budget that is easy to read, understandable, and inexpensively produced. A checklist for assessing a school's budget presentation is provided.

There were three objectives set to meet this general purpose: (1) to increase awareness of the School Climate program as one means of accentuating the positive; (2) to provide various approaches and information to enhance external communication for school improvement; and (3) to provide information and strategies to facilitate internal lines of communication for total school improvement. These conference proceedings synthesize the content of the following presentations: &quot;School Climate&quot; (Barbara Case); &quot;Getting Your Message to  the Public&quot; and &quot;Surveying Your Community&quot; (Larry Ascough); &quot;Working with the Media&quot; (Rodney Davis); &quot;Involving Total Staff for Good P.R.&quot; (Bonnie Ellison); &quot;I Have Met the Enemy and They Is Us&quot; (Barbara Dudlacek); and &quot;Internal Communications&quot; (Mary O'Neill).

The focus of this paper is on the Teacher Certification Test (TCT) in Administration and Supervision developed to conform to stringent legal and job-relatedness requirements. The test is required of educators seeking initial certification in this area who finished their coursework after September 1980. This study details the steps followed from goal selection through field tryout and item selection for the test. Analyses of the performance of 841 persons who took the test between September 1978 through June 1983 revealed that the pass rate on the initial testing was about 68 percent, while subsequent retakes raised the final pass rate to about 81  percent (females 84 percent, males 77 percent, blacks 46 percent, and whites 88 percent). Analyses of data from 205 persons who took the test revealed that students who completed a planned degree program and coursework in the areas of administration and supervision passed the test somewhat more readily.

First, current selection and training procedures for bus drivers generally ignore issues of pupil management. Second, focusing on pupil management issues in the selection, training, and supervision of drivers can have a number of beneficial effects for a company. These include an increase in pupil satisfaction and a decrease in vandalism, accidents, driver turnover, injury, liability, and insurance costs. Proper attention to driver training can give a company a significant competitive advantage in competing for contracts. Keeping good employees around longer permits more selectivity in hiring school bus drivers. When selecting bus drivers, companies should focus  on the driver's ability to manage students and should verify hard data such as the driver's fingerprints, license, credit, and references. (MLF)",

The models are a traditional model, institutes, competency-based programs, the academy, and networking. A review of the research, however, finds that none of the five identified models has ever been researched, and most inservice research either focuses on classroom teachers or examines the experiences of practitioners without being research based. There seems to be a collection of a good deal of information of limited benefit to the improvement of schools, the role of administrators, or the condition of inservice education. Assuming that the ultimate  goal of inservice is educational improvement, there is a need to develop a conceptual description of administrative inservice, more completely describe and test the five generic models described, and continuously review and modify the theoretical conceptualization of administrative inservice, all through theory-based research, so that school administrators may fulfill the leadership function ascribed to them in the school effectiveness literature.

The first part of the book describes a \"futuring process\" developed as a tool for examining alternative future probabilities. It consists of a series of diverging and converging techniques that alternately expand and focus the participants thoughts. The steps are as follows: brainstorming, a Delphi survey of perceived possibilities, a resulting \"futures wheel\" showing a divergent pattern of multiple causality, \"cross impact matrices\" evaluating reciprocal causality, and finally, written scenarios. Six scenarios, each with its particular \"futures wheel\" chart, are described; they are: (1) the information revolution and its backlash; (2) the  aging market (increase in the median age of the U.S. population); (3) the decline in sexist attitudes and structures; (4) more flexible career choices; (5) redefinition of basic education to include technological literacy, problem-solving, and decision-making; and (6) increased awareness of global economic interdependence. The next chapter describes various complementary forecasting techniques, providing references for additional information on each.

        "description":"This publication from Australia reports on an investigation directed at possible explanations of why students in the state of Victoria remain to complete secondary school, and why schools themselves vary in their capacity to retain students to year 12. Chapter 1 provides perspectives on this topic from past research and identifies three domains of school influence on student retention as the focus of the study: student attitudes, curriculum, and organization. Chapter 2 describes the methodology, which consisted of complementary broad- and narrow-based approaches: identification of differences between schools as a whole, selection of 16 schools for further study, qualitative methods, and questionnaires. Chapter 3 presents findings on differences between schools, including trends  in average school retention rates, factors associated with differences, and patterns of change between 1982 and 1983. Chapter 4 focuses on characteristics of the 16 schools selected for further study, and the results of this intensive study are reported in chapters 5 and 6. Chapter 7 reports findings from interviews and followup studies with former students, parents, and teachers at these schools. Chapter 8 summarizes findings of the study as a whole, including differences between schools, the 16 schools, students' perspectives, factors influencing the intention to stay in school, the role of individual characteristics in this intention, and implications for future research and policymaking.

A brief discussion ensues concerning respondents' perceptions of their initial contact with schools. This is followed by a  description of the kinds of assistance external facilitators gave to the schools, categorized according to the five stages of the adoption/implementation process: (1) intiating relationships, (2) assisting clients in deciding on new practices, (3) assisting clients in preparing for adoption, (4) assisting clients in implementing practices, and (5) followup activities.

The focus is on the contributions of potential assisters to various implementation outcomes, from which implications for policy and practice are derived. The major emphasis is on the crucial (and unanticipated) role of district-level personnel in catalyzing and coordinating successful efforts. The primary conclusion derived from the research is that, in any school improvement effort, the key actors tend to contribute in different ways: principals contribute to both practice-related mastery and plans for continuation; local facilitators contribute to both teacher commitment and perceived  efficacy; and external facilitators contribute to practice-specific mastery. Practical implications of these findings are provided for principals, central administrators, and facilitators. The paper concludes with three general recommendations related to coordinating assistance in school improvement efforts: (1) both local and external facilitators should perceive implementation in terms of the 10 outcomes listed in table 1; (2) local and external facilitators should work out a division of labor; and (3) facilitators should locate and involve a central administrator committed to successful implementation.

The innovations are those associated with federally funded projects attempting to improve educational practice. The best known are those of the National Diffusion Network. An explanation of innovation adoptions is that responses to the federal projects led to the forming of a community of local practitioners who suddenly had new channels of communication open to them. To share this information, professional conferences were held with participants, who shared the following characteristics: (1) other teachers  served as their role models, (2) their attendance at the conferences was approved by their principals, and (3) they have figured out how to survive in a very grueling job. For schools, innovation is largely a process of imitation or emulation under conditions of noncompetition. Given the opportunity to try out new practices perceived as attractive and constituting an improvement, teachers change. (MLF)",

Specifically, the study examined the extent to which individual family members and significant others wove stories around the handicap and their roles in coping with it. In depth, repeated, in-home, unstructured interviews and observations of families were carried out. Interviews were taped and transcriptions of the tapes and notes were content analyzed. Three products resulted: a series of case studies illustratng interventions for families at  various stress points in the family cycle; a model for family structure, functions, and life cycles to point out changing family structure and the evolution of new roles for family members; and a series of methodological analyses relating to research problems on independence. Examples are cited of the reactions of families to questions of etiology and reality and denial. The idiosyncratic nature of each family's response to the handicap is emphasized, and researchers searching for root causes of family response to handicaps are urged to take a more phenomenologically oriented and naturalistic approach to their studies.

        "description":"The focus of this paper will be to argue for an effective and concise evaluation of special education programs serving bilingual or limited English proficient (LEP) students. Although Public Law 94-142 specifies that all children be provided with free appropriate education according to their individual needs, ensuring compliance with these requirements has been problematic, particularly in the provision and evaluation of appropriate programs and services to bilingual children. The future success of special education programs serving LEP students will largely depend on the ability to evaluate and communicate the ultimate successes and failures of such programs. In addition, while defining the overall worth of these programs, exemplary services and programs can be identified for  dissemination. Advocates of special education for LEP students must engage in evaluation activity for the future of this population. Special educators must realize that evaluation is a requisite in the process of planning and delivering special education services to all populations. (Author)",

Cognitive ability and achievement information (Woodcock-Johnson Psychoeducational Battery) were also collected during the first and last month of the school year. Posttest cognitive and achievement measures were regressed on pre-subtest performance and teacher ratings of student temperament. Results were interpreted to suggest that temperament indices (i.e., Task Orientation, Adaptability, and Reactivity) influenced performance on cognitive and achievement subtests controlling for IQ and variations in teacher rating styles. Task Orientation appeared particularly potent, influencing performance on those  subtests requiring students to do more of something that they already knew how to do (e.g., simple arithmetic operations, match-to-sample discriminations).

Experimental Ss received individualized instruction based on counting games while control Ss received instruction on objectives not related to counting. Analysis is presented of pre- and posttests on oral counting, counting transfer, counting by 10, enumeration and production of objects, enumeration transfer, production transfer, cardinality rule, subitizing, finger presentation of 1 to 10, order-irrelevance principle, and equivalence. Pretesting data suggested that basic counting skills cannot be taken for granted in retarded populations. The training was reasonably successful in extending  Ss' oral counting sequence, suggesting that short-term intensive individual tutoring that focuses on count patterns is useful, perhaps especially with TMR pupils. Training was not generally successful in producing transfer. Findings suggested that if the S's cooperation can be obtained, oral counting training can be effective with mentally retarded children with relatively low mental ages. (CL)",

The majority of parents with DD children living at home reported satisfaction with support services received and 95% had no immediate plans to place their child outside the home. Essential support services cited by parents included infant screening and diagnosis, early intervention (for  children below age 3), day programming, and a parent support system. Sixty percent of parents who placed their DD children outside the home indicated that no additional support services would have prevented or delayed such placement. The three major reasons for placement (in order of frequency) were physical size of child, behavior problems, and adverse effect on family or other siblings. The need for support services directed toward family members and toward older DD children was cited. (JW)",

The following contributing factors to  a high incidence of emotional problems were reported: (1) absence of normative expectations by parents; (2) lack of a peer support network; and (3) adolescent emotional over-responsiveness, linked to a deficit in the socialization of emotionality.

Stability rates varied considerably among states, types of facilities and sizes of facilities. A low rate of stability among semi-independent living programs was seen to be in large measure a reflection of the lifestyle these programs seek to emulate. Similarly, the high stability of the largest facilities reflected the amount of capital invested in their physical plants and equipment.

Contributing problems to the situation, such as an array of definitions, are reviewed. Performance differences between retarded and LD students are described and the overlapping nature of sensory impairments is discussed. Illinois regulations are cited to distinguish LD from behavior disorders.

Team reward systems are incorporated into the small group instruction format. The effects of the TAI approach on the achievement, attitudes, and behaviors of students in general and the behavior and peer acceptance of mainstreamed academically handicapped (MAH) students were measured over 8 weeks for 504 students in grades 3-5 in experiment 1; experiment 2 assessed the mathematics achievement effects of TAI on MAH and non-handicapped students in grades 3-5 (n=1,371) over a 24-week period. Results of experiment 2 confirmed the hypothesis that achievement effects were not  seen for the MAH subsample in experiment 1 because of the brief duration of the study. Over the full 24-week experiment, MAH Ss in TAI classes gained much more on the mathematics scales than did their control group counterparts. In both studies, nonhandicappped Ss also gained markedly in mathematics achievement in the TAI classes as compared to control Ss. Results were also positive for the behavior and social acceptance of MAH Ss. Sociometric results indicated that when MAH Ss work in small groups with nonhandicapped classmates, they are better accepted than Ss not working in such groups. Implications of the TAI approach for mainstreaming were discussed. (CL)",

The approach differs from the learning center approach in several ways, including time factors and the extent of instruction in basic skills and regular curriculum content areas. A series of five evaluation questions were posed, and the results cited. Among those findings are an increase in number of participants, enhanced exposure to most instructional/activity components of their home-school program, and improved communication between regular and gifted programs and between schools and parents. Mixed responses emerged in the assessment of the gifted instruction  provided by the program: students indicated that they wanted to spend more time in gifted instruction; after a year of the program, fewer regular classroom teachers felt that every school should have a gifted program; parents were favorable impressed with the program but felt that the adequacy of instructional facilities and their children's enjoyment of the program had diminished. It was concluded that the approach helped reduce disruption found in the gifted center approach and increased participation of the eligible students. Questions, however, were raised about the duration and continuity of instruction in the home-school approach. (CL)",

Data were collected at three middle schools by using noted observations, tape recordings of meetings, tape recorded interviews of individuals involved in the process, and collected documents. Observations revealed that procedural steps were indeed followed, but decisions were influenced by factors unaddressed or assumed in the written procedures. The underlying assumptions of the procedures did not fit the reality of the school organization. Data  analysis suggested four major factors which influenced decisions in the special education identification through placement process: (1) individuals continued to be decision makers despite the requirement that groups (teams) be used for decision making; (2) school personnel had limited time available for team meetings and procedural steps were lengthy: (3) information systems did not facilitate the flow of available information; and (4) limited interventions at the regular classroom level encouraged referral and placement decisions. The study found that procedural requirements operate within organizational constraints, suggesting that human and bureaucratic influences be considered when developing or changing procedures for making decisions about prospective special education students.

ALEM includes components of prescriptive instruction with informal approaches to foster inquiry, independence, and social cooperation. Effects of implementing ALEM in 26 mainstreaming classrooms were evaluated via measurements of degree of program implementation, classroom process outcomes, student academic and attitudinal outcomes, and teacher and parent attitudes and assessments. Results are detailed for four major topics: degree of program implementation, relationship between implementation and selected  student outcomes, relationship between degree of program implementation and classroom processes, and teacher and parent attitudes and assessment of program impact. Overall, results supported the feasibility and efficacy of a full time mainstreaming approach for moderately handicapped students in the ALEM classrooms. Among policy implications noted is that more restrictive placement should be considered only after a full time mainstreaming approach has been tried and found ineffective. (CL)",

Two studies are described; the first (the Comparison Study) examined problem solving, social skills, and linguistic performance of eight dysphasic and eight normal 8- to 10-year-olds on diagnostic and computer-based tasks. Ss worked on computer games in cooperative and didactic sessions. The performance of dysphasic Ss was lower on almost all measures. In the second study (the Training Study), the dysphasic Ss were given training in problem solving on computers. With small amounts of  training, the performance of dysphasic Ss resembled that of the control group. The results of both studies suggest that students' educational history can result in the development of secondary deficits. Lower performance is not always a property of individual deficits, but occurs within a system of interrelated activities. Among educational implications discussed are ways to draw the children into educational experiences, in part by redirecting their metacognitive skills from task avoidance to task analysis; considerations in grouping children with language problems; and the role of computers in education.

Thirty-six hearing and hearing-impaired college students were asked to read a series of 20 paragraphs. After each one, they were to re-tell the story in their own words to the examiner. The hearing-impaired students were instructed to use either speech or simultaneous communication, whichever was their more comfortable means of communication. After all the stories were finished, the Ss were given an instrument recall test. A coding of &quot;1&quot; indicated that the speaker explicitly mentioned the instrument along with the action. On the main dependent variable, the number of &quot;1's,&quot; the performance of the hearing and  hearing-impaired students were quite similar. For both groups the main effect of frequency was highly significant. The effect of importance approached, but did not reach, significance. There was a significantly greater tendency to explicitly mention the less likely or infrequent instrument than the frequent one. Thus both groups of speakers conformed to the Gricean Maxim of &quot;quantity&quot; by only being explicit when to do otherwise would have been misleading. The success of the speakers in drawing inferences was measured by the recall task. There were some differences here between the hearing and hearing-impaired speakers. The hearing speakers made very few errors in recall. However, the hearing-impaired speakers erred on 10-15% of the items, and almost all of these recall errors involved  infrequent instruments. The study revealed that both hearing and hearing-impaired speakers structure their messages in accordance with the inferential needs of their listeners. It also suggested that both groups automatically infer the most likely instrument during input, but that the hearing-impaired speakers may be less sensitive to the resulting discrepancies.

Impulsivity was assessed via the Matching Familiar Figures Tests, planning ability was assessed using the Porteus Maze Test Quotient, and field dependence was evaluated on the Children's Embedded Figures Test or the Embedded Figures Test (depending on S's age). Findings supported previous research suggesting that deaf Ss are more impulsive than hearing Ss. The best predictors of impulsivity were planning ability, age, and hearing status. Field dependence was also of value as a predictor when planning ability was removed from the analysis. Statistically significant differences in field dependence were found between deaf and hearing Ss as well  as between impulsivity and field dependence within each group.

In an introductory section, previous theoretical frameworks for language minority programs are reviewed and their deficiencies noted. In five subsequent sections, these principles and their applications for this group are discussed. The principles are that: (1) bilinguals' first and second language development is positively associated with academic achievement; (2) language proficiency is the  ability to use language for both academic purposes and basic communication; (3) for language minority students the development of the primary language skills necessary to complete academic tasks forms the basis for similar proficiency in English; (4) acquisition of basic communicative competency in a second language is a function of comprehensible second language input and a supportive affective environment; and (5) the perceived status of students affects the interactions between teachers and students and among students, in turn affecting student outcomes. These principles provide the empirical support for the Contextual Interaction Theory of bilingual education, and the implications of this theory for the teaching of language minority students are examined in the remainder of the  report.

They were examined using two tests, one requiring the subjects to produce a new name for something given a verbal description of its function, and one calling for a new name for an invented item whose picture is provided. The tasks not only test the applicability of several proposed principles of the acquisition of word formation (semantic transparency, formal simplicity, productivity, and conventionality), but also reinforce the importance of using several tasks  for revealing a variety of processes. Results indicate that specific tasks call for specific word formation processes to be used, and they are acquired following the principles of formal simplicity and semantic transparency. The results also suggest that tasks involving verbal description of stimuli call for word-based morphological devices while nonverbal pictural presentation of stimuli calls for word formation devices that are not word-based, at least for a visual language.

        "description":"A case study was undertaken to examine the influence of one aspect of signed grammar, transparency of reference of some signs, on the acquisition of possessive pronouns in American Sign Language (ASL). The subject was a hearing child of deaf parents who was learning ASL and English. Data were collected in home visits betwen the ages of 1.1 and 3.2 in videotapes and anecdotal records. The Curtiss-Yamada Comprehensive Language Evaluation measure was used to assess receptive language, with stimuli translated into ASL to assess comprehension of the relevant structures in sign language. Four stages were found in the subject's mastery of possessive forms: (1) use of names to indicate possessor in both languages; (2) appearance of some possessive pronouns in both languages (first and  second person, and some third person in ASL), with some names still used for reference; (3) correct production of possessives in English for first and second person forms, with continuation of stage 2 errors in ASL and with a new signing error of indicating the object rather than possessor; and (4) correct use of first and second person forms in English and ASL, with the few remaining errors in number and gender of the third person forms. Results suggest there was not an apparent advantage in learning signed grammar as opposed to spoken grammar, since the acquisition of possessives occurred simultaneously in the two languages, and signed possessives may have been more difficult. It is concluded that children probably do not take advantage of special cues to grammatical competence  available to them. (MSE)",

Data from 11 monolingual Italian speaking children aged 1.9 to 2.4 years were analyzed for five productive processes in early language: subject-verb agreement, agreement with noun phrase, absence of lexical subjects, post-verbal subjects, and clitic/noun phrase distribution. In each instance, the empirical predictions deriving from a semantically-based system are not supported by the acquisition data. It is concluded that  all the data point to an early grammar making reference to various grammatical categories, rules, and relations, a grammar that, unlike the semantically based model, is not qualitatively different from adult grammar and in which syntax and semantics develop in parallel.

The initial script and episodic questions were followed by nondirective probe questions. The narratives were analyzed for the number, type (act, elaboration, conditional, or description), and verb tense of propositions and the qualifiers used. A number of differences between the narrative types appeared in the data. Children predominantly used the timeless  present tense in script and past tense in episodic narratives, reported more acts and fewer conditionals in script than episodic narratives, and used conditionals primarily to refer to specific moments in time. The two narrative types were distinguished also by the proportion of general and specific information produced, as a function of subject familiarity with the event in question. Children at all ages could produce coherent narratives of each type but both types became more complex with subject age. Five categories of episodic narratives were identified: single act, act list, act sequence, incident, and thematic. Script narratives were found to be more similar than episodic across age groups.

Classification does not develop from a fixed set of features in the object, but is discourse-sensitive and invoked when it would add information for the listener. Children and adults develop classifiers in the same order, and four stages of classifier development are seen: (1) no classifiers at all; (2) division of animates and inanimates; (3) shape classification by one, two, and then three dimensions; and (4) conventionalization of functional classifiers. Shape is the most common feature chosen for classification. Classification by shape rather than function is  reinforced by informativeness, natural forms, perceptual development, and cross-sensory reinforcement, and it develops out of universal, biologically structured experience rather than purely linguistic functions. Although adults have more sophisticated functional and stylistic categories than children, when either is under communicative stress, both revert to the same simplified pragmatic mode of using common, perceptually-based classifiers that they can count on their listeners to understand.

It supports findings from previous language acquisition studies that have indicated that children tend initially to encode comment relations and assume topic relations. Such usage is evidenced by children's initial use of focused constructions almost to the exclusion of unfocused constructions, even when communication breakdowns occur. Except for the case of simple identity questions, children near two years use alternative strategies of repetition of the same utterances, increased prosody, no-verbal cues, and the addition or deletion of  information in attempt to effect listener comprehension. Passive and cleft construction, while both used independently by two and a half years, are not used jointly to indicate shifts of focus until three years or more. At two and a half years, right dislocated constructions are very prominent, becoming a preferred discourse form in intransitive constructions when subjects are known. However, topicalization does not become productive until well after three years. (MSE)",

        "description":"Research on the role of educational radio in the classroom sponsored by the Agency for International Development over a ten-year period in Nicaragua, Kenya, and the Dominican Republic is reviewed. An introductory section outlines the reasons for using radio for instructional purposes: (1) it is widespread and democratic; (2) serious radio use is still a novelty in most classrooms; (3) it can entertain and teach simultaneously; (4) it can establish a uniform standard of excellence; (5) it can use the best educational methods; (6) it is cost-effective; and (7) it is familiar technology. Four landmark programs are described, including a primary level radio mathematics project in Nicaragua, a five-year language arts project in Kenya, a Dominican Republic basic education program for  out-of-school children aged 7 to 14, and a yet-to-be implemented science project. Lessons learned from past experience with instructional radio are examined, and include the potential for its use, how children learn with it, techniques and advantages of intensive use, the need to stimulate pupil participation and immediate feedback, the advantage of using distributed learning principles and devoting each lesson to a variety of topics, enhancing the role of teachers and parents, the availability of low cost instructional aids, and the reliability of equipment.

The theory synthesizes generative semantics and notions from cognitive psychology, and posits a close link between form and meaning and denies the existence of autonomous syntactic and semantic components in linguistic structure. The intent of the analysis is to: (1) create a framework for making sense of apparent inconsistencies between the forms of English modals and their meanings and uses, especially the relationship between the historical present (e.g., &quot;may&quot;) and past (e.g., &quot;might&quot;) tenses of the auxiliaries; and (2) to illustrate how semantically based theories of language structure can be of value to teachers of English as a second language (ESL) and language teachers in  general in ways that purely syntactic theories can not. Four major points emerging from the analysis that might be useful to ESL teachers are summarized, and some possible classroom presentations of the information are suggested. (MSE)",

        "author":["End, Laurel J."],
        "description":"Theoreticians have been asking for a long time what processes are involved in comprehension of figurative language, but psycholinguists have only recently addressed this question. One specific type of figurative expression, the metaphor, has been the focus of much recent research, in part because it promises to contribute much to the understanding of language processing in general and figurative language comprehension specifically. Most theories of semantic processing have focused on literal expressions, and several of these theories explained language processing successfully until they were extended to figurative expressions. Unlike literal expressions which are either true or false, metaphors interpreted literally are either false or nonsensical, and meaningful only if a  figurative interpretation has been constructed. Metaphors are unique because they can be both literally meaningless or false and figuratively meaningful at the same time. The amount of psycholinguistic and cognitive research compiled on the metaphor does not reflect its historical importance in the development of language and concepts. For centuries metaphors have provided playwrights, authors, poets, and educators with a vehicle for creating new concepts and images, providing language users with a flexibility not available in literal expressions.

In the first, communications in a sampling of U.S. graduate science courses were examined, resulting in information about the language of classroom conversation management. This information was then incorporated into oral communication classes in China. The second part of the study, undertaken in China, looked at interaction in graduate science courses to (1) examine apparent cultural differences in more detail, (2) determine whether the strategies being taught from the study's first part were those most needed by students going abroad, (3) orient Chinese scientists going abroad at a more general level to  classroom interaction, and (4) orient foreign teachers and scholars working in China. The results of both sets of data were analyzed for similarities, differences, and salient characteristics of classroom communication in the two countries, and the results are presented. The analysis focuses on these communication features: total class time for teachers and students, student and teacher initiation of interactional frames, techniques used by students in initiating interaction, and nonverbal feedback from students. The implications of these results for the U.S. scientist going to China are discussed briefly. (MSE)",

        "description":"Three technical reports and abstracts of colloquium papers are presented as part of a research project concerning the specification and testing of alternative models of intraorganizational career mobility among nonteaching professionals in universities. This project phase involved: the development of a model of evolving jobs as an alternative to the assumption that career mobility is a process of movement through a ladder of predefined jobs; definition of the policy implications of an evolving jobs process; and the development of a database allowing description and analysis of the nonteaching professional workforce at a public university. This database will allow comparison of patterns with somewhat comparable data already compiled for a private research university. A joint  colloquium involving scholars from the University of Washington and Stanford University entitled &quot;Organizations and Careers: A Joint Colloquium on Issues and Methods in the Study of Career Mobility in Organizations&quot; was conducted to present work in progress related to this study and related issues. Eight abstracts and the following technical reports are presented: &quot;Towards a Model of Evolving Jobs: Professional Staff Mobility in the University&quot; (Suzanne Estler, Anne S. Miner); &quot;Evolving Jobs as a Form of Career Mobility: Some Policy Implications&quot; (Suzanne Estler); and &quot;The Viability of Payroll Files in Exploring Evolving Jobs: A Progress Report&quot; (Suzanne Estler). The evolving jobs model suggests that career development may involve the evolution of a set of responsibilities around an  individual so that the job changes over time. (SW)",

In 1981, work experiences of new education professors, were surveyed with attention to the amount of time they spent working and the kinds of work they did. Six kinds of work were identified: teaching, administrative and service tasks, research and scholarly tasks, personal professional development, work with students, and curriculum development. A 2-year followup survey of the professors revealed two patterns of blueprints, based on the specifications of time and work tasks. One pattern consisted of involvement on a fairly equal basis in each of the six clusters of work, while the second pattern showed an uneven distribution  among the work tasks. A characteristic of the preferred balanced design was that no particular cluster was given much greater time allocation than the others. A characteristic of the preferred unbalanced design was that research and scholarship or teaching clusters took priority over administration and service, work with individual students, personal professional development, and curriculum development.

Graduates of highly selective women's colleges were more career salient than were women at either very selective or selective coeducational colleges. The most important predictor of career involvement 1 year after college graduation was whether or not the woman had actively chosen an occupation she wished to pursue. Secondary factors were: importance attached to having a career, grade point average at  graduation, and maternal attitudes. Among coeducational colleges, graduates of selective schools were significantly less role innovative than were graduates of very or highly selective schools. It was found that the career salient woman generally had a mother who was employed and did not perceive that her mother criticized her unfairly. The career salient woman also considered a career important to her personal satisfaction and she supported sexual equality. The study questionnaire is appended. (Author/SW)",

Specific projections include: operations of unions and student activities staff will be computerized; there will be a need to provide additional personalization to staff and  students; the closely related trends of self-help and high touch (human response) will probably have the greatest challenges for the profession; student involvement in policy decisions will become more meaningful; and the competition for student enrollment will increase for the Northeast United States, while the three growth megastates (California, Florida, and Texas) will be oversubscribed.

The tabular information is grouped under six headings: population and economy, enrollment and institutions, degrees, institutional finances, student finances, and faculty. Among the findings are the following: 3 of every 10 persons in the United States live in the South and by the year 2000, the region's population will increase by one-third; the economic growth of the South is demonstrated in the rise of per capita personal income; on the average, the southern region appropriates a larger share of state tax  funds to higher education than do state governments nationally; both nationally and in the South, faculty salaries on the average increased about 4 percent from 1982-1983 to 1983-1984 in public colleges and universities; tuition accounts for an average of 11.5 percent of the current funds revenues of public institutions in the SREB states; more than 3.3 million students were enrolled in southern colleges in fall 1982; and about 84 percent of college students in the South attend public institutions.

Educationally or economically disadvantaged students who enrolled in the program during their freshman year, 1979-1980, were studied. Questionnaires investigated respondents' educational experiences since their freshman year (periods of enrollment, institutions attended, amounts and types of special services received, and financial assistance received). The kinds of jobs that respondents hoped to have in 5 years were also identified. Student transcripts were examined for information on the number of school terms completed by students, the number of course units attempted and completed, and the students' grade point  average. Relationships among freshman-year services, post-freshman services, and student outcomes were also determined: (1) The freshman's moderate use of services (i.e., a single type of service or two types of services) was associated with better outcomes, such as more extended enrollment, and with a greater number of course units attempted and completed; (2) Intensive academic services in the freshman year were not associated with better outcomes; (3) Non-academic services, on the other hand, are associated with better outcomes, including higher grades; and (4) Academic services received after the freshman year are associated with poorer long-term academic outcomes. Information is included on the background and goals of the SSDS program and the design and major findings of a previous  base-line study. The study questionnaire is appended. (SW)",

The conference, &quot;Southern Scholars on Women,&quot; was held at the Georgia State University, March 4-7, 1981, as part of a project funded by the Women's Educational Equity Act Program. &quot;Gender-balancing&quot; is another term for &quot;mainstreaming women's studies,&quot; or integrating the new scholarship on women into the curriculum. Courses focusing on women are being introduced to colleges and accepted as part of the curriculum, and faculty are integrating the new scholarship on women into courses that do not focus on women. Implementers of gender-balancing attended the conference, and developments at their campuses were assessed. In the  southern region of the country, there appears to be an increasing number of courses that focus on women or include material on women in the various disciplines. The gender-balancing conference appears to have provided knowledge and inspiration for accelerated gender-balancing activities by campus implementers. The types of organizational models of policy implementation involved and the implications of these models for the achievement of sex equity in the curriculum are discussed, along with the prospects for further advances in gender-balancing in colleges and universities.

The analysis is based on the 1981 Population and Housing Census and population projections of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). It is projected that Western Australia's population might grow from 1,299,094 in 1981 to 1,859,031 in 2001; the population of Perth might grow to 1,360,811, about 73.2 percent of the state's population by 2001. Within the Perth Statistical Division, the population residing in the North Metropolitan and Southeast Metropolitan areas is likely to grow at faster rates than the population of other areas. Outside the Perth Statistical  Division, population projections are unreliable; however, increases would be expected in coastal towns and their adjacent regions as well as in resource development areas. The influence of the Corridor Plan for Perth on future population distribution is addressed. Appendices include: a summary of ABS assumptions concerning population projections for 1981 to 2021; population projections of Western Australia by age groups (17-24, 25-29, and 30-64) for 1981 to 2001; and a map of the Corridor Plan for Perth.

Basic statistics on women's representation in the profession are examined, including two common explanations of the data. Attention is focused on the role changes that accompany the transition from student to faculty member. It is argued that the professional role becomes increasingly incompatible with feminine sex-role expectations. A structural explanation for problems faced by women incorporates ideas about stereotypic sex-roles. The personal explanations center on reasons women themselves are not able to successfully climb the academic ladder. Major  difficulties potentially faced by women include role conflicts, lack of support, and discrimination. Potential solutions involve adapting a personal strategy, changing the existing setting, and/or seeking out alternative settings (structural strategies). Barriers that may exist in graduate school include a paucity of female mentors and a lack of support for career development. After acquiring an academic job, problems may arise with affirmative action, networking, and sexual harassment. (SW)",

To orient the student to the department, pamphlets can be prepared to answer some of the student's basic questions. Considering academic schedules are an important function of the undergraduate adviser, who reviews course options and directions with the student. The student should be provided an opportunity to indicate changes in interests that have occurred since the previous meeting. The student's file should contain at least general ideas about postgraduation plans and a flexible time outline of preparation. Another advising function is career counseling. The departmental adviser should become familiar with special career counseling services available on the campus to which students should be referred for  information on dates of required entrance examinations and application procedures. Communication with colleagues should be maintained to keep informed about those who have special knowledge on specific fields. Finally, the adviser may function in the role of a surrogate parent with some advisees, although the extent of responsibility should be clear to the adviser. Appended is a list of sample support course groups giving general suggestions on courses that should be taken by pre-law and pre-health sciences students. (SW)",

        "description":"This paper provides a detailed empirical account of the performances of 8- to 9-year-olds and 11- to 12-year-olds on a chore-scheduling task developed to assess the dynamics of planning processes. In developing the planning task for revealing different levels of planning proficiency, five critical aspects of planning were taken into account: the need for planning is often not recognized; background knowledge of the situation is necessary for planning; planning is more likely when the situation is complex and novel; planning is a revisionary process; and planning decisions are made at different levels of abstractions. Thirty-two students in a private school in Manhattan were given multiple opportunities to construct the shortest path for accomplishing a series of classroom chores.  Careful examination of the processes and products of planning activities across different trials--specifically, think-aloud protocols, strategies for problem solution, and route efficiency--revealed considerable developmental progress within sessions for both younger and older children, and significant age differences; e.g., older children engaged in significantly more higher-level decision making during planning processes. A reference list, the scoring system for featural analysis, and coding categories and definitions for process analysis are included. (Author/THC)",

        "description":"This symposium includes the following papers: &quot;Software for the Classroom: Issues in the Design of Effective Software Tools&quot; (D. Midian Kurland); &quot;Computers for Composing&quot; (Janet H. Kane); &quot;LOGO Programming and Problem Solving&quot; (Roy D. Pea); &quot;The Computer as Sandcastle&quot; (Jeanne Bamberger); &quot;Learning LOGO Together: The Social Context&quot; (Jan Hawkins); and &quot;Research and Design Issues Concerning the Development of Educational Software for Children&quot; (Cynthia A. Char). The first four papers, preceded by an introduction by Karen Sheingold, are concerned with uses of the computer in the classroom. Kurland argues that tool software may be uniquely important for educators to consider for equipping students to function in this age of information. Kane describes case studies of children using  word processors for writing, and comments on the similarities and differences between writing with and without computer technology. Pea discusses several different studies of children learning LOGO programming in classrooms and suggests that it may be important for educators to specify the goals they want to attain by using computers in their classrooms. Bamberger explores the use of programming with students in various musical contexts: rhythm, melody, and composition. The two remaining papers discuss the relationship between the computer and the social context of which it is part. Hawkins discusses peer collaboration as an important context for learning and describes LOGO programming as a facilitator of such collaboration. Char's paper suggests some of the variables that contribute to  how software is used, as well as ways of designing software and materials to take account of classroom differences. Two discussants--James A. Levin, of the University of California at San Diego, and Joseph Glick, of the City University of New York--view this collection of papers through their own unique perspectives: Levin looks at the potential of new technology for affecting learning experiences for students and Glick brings a Piagetian developmental perspective to the research.

It is argued that, in addition to the inequity of access to computer hardware, girls and young women are often not given appropriate support and contexts for learning about this technology. Three lines of converging arguments are examined that relate to (1) the common identification of computers with mathematics and science; (2) concern about sex-related differences in science and mathematics, which also emerge in the area of computers; and (3) studies of children's  learning processes and computer use in education, which provide material about patterns of sex differences in learning with computers. It is suggested that the type of use and the organization of the use setting are major determinants of boys' and girls' involvement with computers. A 33-item reference list is included. (LMM)",

        "description":"Educators are asking about the appropriate role of computers in the classroom, whether computers have a legitimate place in a classroom for young children or will supplant more important activities, and whether children under the age of 8 should use microcomputers. These general questions must be examined in order to discover the real, underlying issues and how they can be addressed. One concern is that this new technology is not &quot;real,&quot; but that the microcomputer is a symbolic machine that is used to represent and manipulate symbol systems. The symbolic nature of the microcomputer per se, however, does not make it incompatible with or inappropriate for use by young children. A critical issue is how the child engages with a particular system via the microcomputer. Microcomputers  can be used to provide cognitive support; as a means for reflecting on other activities and better understanding activities in other media; and to help children take a broader view of the computer as an important piece of technology. The concern that the technology will take over, and that teacher behavior or beliefs will not matter, is contradicted by existing research. Answering questions about microcomputer use by young children calls for a complex and cooperative enterprise among teachers, researchers, and developers. Twenty-four references are listed. (LMM)",

Asking about the effects of technology and the social life of classrooms is problematic, however. For example, traditional two-group, experimental studies are flawed because computers per se do not constitute a treatment, the treatment would not be uniform, and the effects may not be observable except over time. An alternate view would consider the classroom as the social context. Questions would then concern the places and processes of change that may accompany the use of the technology. The critical elements of the incorporation process include teachers' interpretation of the purposes of software, whether computer-based  work is a legitimate part of the learning agenda, the interactional changes in the classroom that the technology can support, and whether these changes are viewed as legitimate. Computers offer the option of rethinking the selection of learning agendas, the design of curricula, and the ways in which learning tasks are done in classrooms. Thirteen references are listed.

        "description":"In order to understand how the database software or online database functioned in the overall curricula, the use of database management (DBMs) systems was studied at eight elementary and middle schools through classroom observation and interviews with teachers and administrators, librarians, and students. Three overall areas were addressed: teachers' backgrounds in teaching and computers, the information-seeking activities that teachers required of their students and the curriculum context in which they occurred, and the use of the specific database system and its relationship to students' information-management skills. Results indicated that the DBMs were implemented in varied ways depending on software selection, schools' philosophies about computers, teacher selection and  training, type of database activities, and problems in classroom use. Problems noted relate to the rigid information format required by software, inability of the software to allow for definition changes, limited hardware access, math and programming as exclusive domains for computer use, insufficient teacher training, limited classroom information-based activities, and students' math and reading skills. This report includes in-depth case study reports of two of the schools, a summary, conclusions, and the teacher interview guide. (LMM)",

        "description":"With increasing attention being given to the importance of microcomputers in the schools, there is concern about how new teachers can best be prepared to use the new technology effectively. This paper presents a perspective on teacher training based on three categories in which computers may be used in the classroom: to provide unique learning experiences that take advantage of special features of the technology; to provide information about, and practice with, the technology itself; and to influence social aspects of classroom life. The paper briefly describes three different types of software which have been developed to address the issues above: a word processor to influence children's writing skills; three pieces of software for teaching science and math concepts to fourth  through sixth graders; and a LOGO software program to teach children to collaborate while learning programming skills. It is concluded that during teacher preservice education, students should be made aware of the options available for using the computer as a tool in their curricula, and how to make critical choices for integrating it with their teaching goals.

        "description":"An overview of the research and design process that led to the creation of the Bank Street word processing program for children is reported. The decision to create a word processor for the classroom was based on the findings that commercially available programs took too long to learn, required the memorization of too many commands or rules, had difficult-to-read screen displays, and made editing so clumsy that the whole point of using the word processor to revise text was lost. The design team established a set of design principles: no control commands would be used; there would be comprehensive screen prompts; the display would allow upper and lower case letters; and no hardware modifications or additions would be needed in order for the program to run on a typical school  computer system. Functions that the program would and would not need to carry out were identified. The design of the program serves as a starting point for a general discussion of desirable features and design characteristics for good educational software. Specific points covered include how to design educational tools and the features these tools and their manuals should have. (Author/THC)",

        "description":"A study is reported in which 7 children (2 girls and 5 boys, 11 to 12 years of age) with a year of LOGO Programming experience were asked to think aloud about how a LOGO procedure would work, and then to predict by hand-simulation of the programs, what the graphics turtle &quot;pen&quot; would draw when the program was executed. While all children made accurate predictions for programs at the first two complexity levels (procedures using only direct command to move the turtle and procedures using the iterative REPEAT command), no child made accurate predictions for either level of complexity involving tail recursive procedures or embedded recursive procedures. The children's problems with explaining embedded recursion are traced to two related sources: general bugs in their mental model  for how lines of programming code dictate the computer's operations when the program is executed, and the particular control structure of embedded recursive procedures. The report concludes with a brief description of the need to teach program control structures, such as recursion, rather than expecting children to discover them on their own. (Author/THC)",

In the first year, experimental groups comprised students in each of two classrooms in a private school in Manhattan. One classroom included 25 8- and 9-year-old children; the other consisted of 25 11- and 12-year-old children. The control groups were made up of students in the same grade level classrooms in the same school. Both experimental groups were administered a classroom chore-scheduling planning task. Process and product measures of planning skill revealed no benefits for students doing LOGO  programming. The second experiment took place one year later in the same school in the same two teachers' classrooms. The second study comprised 32 students in each of the age groups of the first study. This time a microcomputer version of the task was implemented in which students gave commands to a robot to carry out the chores, and similar assessments of planning performances were collected online. Again, learning to program did not differentiate experimental from control group performances. Further tests of the programming transfer hypothesis are proposed. Data tables and references are included. (Author/THC)",

An introduction discusses microcomputer use in schools, and problems with questions of the &quot;cognitive demand of programming.&quot; Background issues addressed include the definition of computer programming, levels of programming skill development, the demands of learning to program, and programming as a cognitive activity. Theories of cognitive subtasks involved in programming are summarized, and the following subtasks are specifically discussed: understanding  the problem, designing/planning the program, coding a program, and comprehending and debugging a program. Studies are reviewed that relate to programming skills development, the definition of a core of programming knowledge, and programmer aptitudes and abilities. Conclusions point out the narrow forces of existing research, the impossibility of separating &quot;demand&quot; questions from goals, the necessity of focusing on goals of computer education, individual versus social aspects of programming skills, and the limits of instructability of programming concepts/actions.

Children in each of two classrooms at the Bank Street School for Children were interviewed individually on their conceptions of computers at the beginning and end of their first year with computers in the classroom (fall 1981-summer 1982), which included work with the LOGO programming language. Their experience with computers inside and outside of school were also examined to provide a context for the following overall issues: (1) children's understanding of programming computers in LOGO; (2) their broader conceptions of computers beyond their  function of programmable devices, such as cultural objects which have general properties and various functions; and (3) their interpretations of person/computer systems. By the end of the year, most of the children had some rudimentary skill with the computer; however, the progress of even the most advanced students could be hindered by their inadequate mental models of LOGO. The biggest problem seemed to be the lack of two concepts: a program as an algorithm applied to data, and the central processing unit as the functional core of the computer.

Five criteria that are central to these decisions are met by &quot;tool&quot; software, or software that helps users access, organize, and reorganize information of a particular type, as do word processors, database management systems, music editing systems, and graphic editors. Tools do not specify what users must do but define the activities in which they can engage. Tool software meet these important criteria because they (1) help students acquire and use strategies for managing  information; (2) help students learn about important aspects of technology; (3) can be assimilated into existing classroom curricula while providing the possibilities of new classroom activities and learning; (3) are cost-effective for both developers and purchasers; and (5) can be developed for the personal computers currently in use in schools.

The reality behind accusations of rampant piracy and the effect of piracy on the quality of educational software is examined in the third chapter, which focuses on the copyright law and how it is currently being interpreted by copyright specialists. Chapter 4 presents legal principles useful in determining the potential legality of such practices as networking; concerns pertaining to software in school libraries; the differences between owning and leasing software; and the consequences of infringing the copyright law. Chapter 5 focuses on the means available to  educators, software producers, and society to contain or control illegal copying and the use of illegally copied software in the schools. The final chapter discusses software quality, piracy, and home market factors in terms of the potential severity of the threat they pose to the health of the school market. A 30-item reference list; a glossary; guidelines and statements of policy for fair use of instructional software classroom copying, and off-air recording of broadcast programming; and a sample licensing agreement are included.

A checklist of the resulting criterion elements was formulated and mailed to a sample of 14 end-users (contract agencies), vendors (courseware developers), and academic-based educators or faculty, who were asked to rate the criteria on their importance in  software evaluation. The respondents--five vendors, four users, and three academics--generally rated the information provided on both hardware and software, including documentation, as very important for doing an adequate courseware evaluation. No global category dominated, and no major differences were noted among vendors, users, and academics. In general, it was found that users were less rigorous than vendors or academics.

This partnership between communication and nutrition was made necessary by the confrontation between an expanded demand for services and limited resources for meeting the demand. Senior officials have a substantial role to play in seeing that their programs gain the full benefit of what an effective communication program can offer by accepting the responsibilities to: (1) examine, at the planning stage of any program, the implications in it for communication; (2) insist that communication or education people work within the framework of a communication strategy; and (3) provide communication resources. In planning, steps should include policy formation and development of a  comprehensive strategy to meet program goals. With an understanding of the policy and comprehensive strategies that govern a project's overall efforts, communications specialists should start a process that includes analysis, strategy, implementation, evaluation, and next-step planning. Program officials should insist that the top communication managers deal explicitly with the elements of principal objectives, best tentative solutions, audiences, media channels, themes/messages, and schedules.

All of the studies reviewed indicated a substantial interest in educational computing. For psychology faculty, the primary interest is in using computers for statistics and laboratory methods courses. As a group, psychology faculty have strong impressions about how computers should be used in courses, but due to variations in survey methodology, trends cannot be discerned. Use of instructional computing in college level psychology teaching is modest but increasing. Use in statistics courses and data  analysis is most common, with some additional use for data collection, demonstrations, and simulations. The difference between use and interest or perceived need is substantial and it has been hypothesized that this is due to faculty problems, adequacy of hardware, support staff, and software. Many of the barriers to implementing computer-based education are disappearing, and the time is ripening for bringing computers into courses as instructional aids.

This paper reviews 15 studies that have examined the impact of the &quot;Trade-off&quot; series, and seeks to determine how the series affects student and teacher knowledge of and attitudes toward economics and whether they enjoy the &quot;Trade-offs&quot; programs. The studies reviewed examined diverse variables and used a variety of designs and instruments. They include three studies on cognitive, attitudinal, and inservice training effects; one report on the development and validation of the Basic Economics Test; five local evaluations; and two studies of teacher and administrator ratings of the series. Findings  led to the following conclusions: (1) the series significantly improves students' knowledge of and attitudes toward economics; (2) the series significantly improves teachers' attitudes toward economics; (3) student cognitive and attitudinal gains were further increased with teacher inservice training; (4) teacher attitudinal gains were further increased with inservice education; and (5) the series is appealing to students, teachers, and administrators. Notes, references, and a comprehensive chart of studies reviewed are included. (THC)",

Use of cluster analysis of library characteristics to find institutions that were quantitatively similar to one another identified four clusters of libraries. For one of these clusters, a basic group of 127 libraries that share library characteristics, factor analysis was used to derive component score coefficients for 12 statistical variables: volumes held, volumes added, total microforms, expenditures for library materials, expenditures for binding, total salaries and wages, other operating expenditures, full time equivalent (FTE) professional staff, FTE  nonprofessional staff, interlibrary loans borrowed, circulation, and total reference, directional, and group transactions. These coefficients were weighted for the 12 variables, multiplied by the data for that variable for the individual library, and summed up to provide a component score for that library. Component scores were computed for each of the 2,943 libraries for which data were available. In the appendix, component scores are given for each of the libraries, making it possible to measure each institution against the statistical research library model derived by this study. (THC)",

Three public libraries in Virginia were selected as test sites because their users encompassed a heterogeneous population that cut across demographic and socioeconomic indicators. Data collected on exception cases (times when users asked librarians for assistance in finding information) revealed that of the 412 questions analyzed, almost 60% produced no match between the language of  the information seekers and the information organizers. The online system which was developed allows directed browsing and puts descriptors into context. It contains eight fields: Subject, the primary access point containing the users' vocabulary; Enter, which serves a cross-referencing function; LC, a selection of relevant Library of Congress subject headings; Broader, Narrower, and Related, three fields which supply hierarchically oriented connections; Scope Notes, which define the meaning of records in the Subject field; and Bibliography, which lists other pertinent holdings.

The committee first studied the history of collection development in the libraries and the environment in which collection development activities occur. The interim report included here presents the committee's findings in the following areas: environmental analysis (including university goals, research and instructional programs, fiscal factors, and publishing industry trends); history and description of  the library collections (including developers of the collection, cooperation, and perceptions of collection strengths); and current collection development operating practices (including funding, staff positions and responsibilities, and objectives and goals). In the next phase, 14 staff members were assigned to 4 task forces charged with examining the allocation of materials funds, assessments of the library's collections, the development of collection policies, and organization and staffing for collection development activities. The reports of the task forces are included here. The study committee assessed and synthesized the recommendations of the task forces into 19 final recommendations which are presented in this final report. (THC)",

The sixth in the series, this report describes the use of public access OCLC terminals in the participating libraries. During the project OCLC terminals were placed for 6-month periods in public areas of most of the libraries. This report covers public and staff use of these terminals, their attitudes and reactions, and the effect that public  access had on interlibrary loan and on the decision to continue or not continue using OCLC after the project. Appendices, which make up more than half the report, include statistical information on project libraries and a map of the IVLS; public access terminal schedule; project brochure; instructional signs for public access terminals; figures for interlibrary loan activity for each library having a public access terminal; patron questionnaire; and staff interviews concerning public access terminals.

The 2-year, 4-phase project, which took place from October 1, 1982 to September 30, 1984, was conducted by the San Mateo Educational Resources Center (SMERC) with two subcontractors--the Social Science Education Consortium, contractor for the ERIC Clearinghouse on Social Studies/Social Science Education; and the ERIC Processing and Reference Facility. Phase I was concerned with the development of clear and concise specifications of the types of  materials needed by practitioners to support improvement efforts at the classroom and building level. The principal activity of Phase II was the creation of a separate computerized test file of all materials already in ERIC that met these specifications. These items were tagged &quot;Practitioners,&quot; using a new Target Audience data element developed for NEPF. The development of new sources of practitioner-oriented materials and the addition of such documents to ERIC were the primary activities in Phase III. Evaluation of the file was conducted at nine official test sites in Phase IV. Recommendations based on experiences with and evaluation of the project were made in three major categories: the educational practitioner as audience for ERIC; building a database for practitioners; and outreach.  The project resulted in the identification and tagging of 46,344 ERIC documents (RIE) and articles (CIJE) with the new &quot;practitioners&quot; Target Audience tag. Twenty-three appendixes to the final report are presented: (1) Report of Working Group Meeting; (2) Search Strategy; (3) ERIC Processing Manual (Guidelines for Applying Target Audience); (4) Revision in Timelines; (5) Acquisitions and Selection Plan, plus Addendum; (6) Document Acquisition and Selection Chart; (7) Agenda--Field Test Site Training; (8) Recordkeeping Forms, Explanatory Materials; (9) Full Text Documents (Guidelines for Processing); (10) Sensing Network Survey and Highlights of Results; (11) New Acquisitions Sources; (12) Journal Articles Compiled (Guidelines for Compiling); (13) Journal Articles Compiled (Guidelines for  Processing); (14) Flyers, Letters, Explanatory Materials Used by Clearinghouses; (15) 25 Step Processing Plan; (16) Copyright Laws: Implications for ERIC; (17) Acquisitions Sources--List; (18) Sample Search Packet; (19) Client Telephone Interview Form; (20) Boulder Valley Information Packet; (21) Interview Form--ERIC Clearinghouse Directors; (22) Interview Form--Practice File Searchers; and (23) Statistics on NEPF Documents (Target Audience, Level of Availability, Number of Microfiche, Length, Type).

The next section focuses on the organizational relationships between the CCC and ACCJC, examining the quasi-hierarchical levels of institutional accountability, evaluation, and planning in the CCC, the role of the FIPSE project in community college accountability, influences in the community college environmental network that reduce and promote conflict, and cyclical stages in institutional planning. Next, a discussion is provided of the relationships between accreditation standards and goals of the Board of Governors of the CCC, and of the gaps in the state goals and ACCJC standards.

        "description":"One of a series of papers developed as part of a project to improve planning and evaluation in community colleges, this working paper discusses the outcomes approach to evaluation in higher education and describes current projects utilizing outcomes measures in community colleges. Section I defines the outcomes approach as an analysis of the end products of organizational activities, cites prior attempts to create models and concepts for outcomes research in higher education, and presents an outcomes typology that categorizes research and writing. Section II discusses the relationship of outcomes evaluation to community and junior colleges and describes different types of learner outcomes (i.e., concrete learner outcomes such as transfer, degree attainment, and employment and  income; abstract learner outcomes such as cognitive and affective development; and social learner outcomes such as benefits to the local community and to society at large). Section III reviews the ways in which the outcomes evaluation approach is currently being used in the evaluation and operation of postsecondary institutions, focusing on the standardized testing and measurement of outcomes, attempts to refine the concept of outcomes in postsecondary education, and the use of the approach in institutional management and the creation of funding formulas. Finally, the last section summarizes the current issues in outcomes evaluation. (HB)",

Focusing on dissemination to a variety of program sites and efforts to help selected sites function as Regional Training and Dissemination Centers (RTDCs) for the model, the report is divided into two volumes. Volume I primarily deals with dissemination at the program level, while volume II examines the development of the centers and discusses the role of facilitators in this process. Volume I consists of two parts. The first part describes the PTP model, its implementation, and services delivered in current programs at seven case study sites. Additionally, the model evaluation is discussed, outcomes across programs are  described, and cost analysis in relation to evaluation and program implementation and operation is reported. Discussion concludes with a summary of the PTP model. The second part provides a view of the model's effectiveness, describing 18 family case studies and offering a detailed analysis deriving general lessons about the model's effectiveness in working with families. Volume II reports an effort to maximize the number of communities reached by training successful first-generation sites to disseminate the model. Specifically, this volume describes the PTP model and the dissemination and evaluation program, details both the New England and the Miami Valley RTDCs, outlines the training and technical assistance process, and offers a final summary. Conclusions report success for the  project: (1) in supporting the development of parenting skills; and (2) in developing criteria and processes for guiding agencies in the utilization of this model.

        "description":"This study assesses 7- to 12-year-old children's abilities to understand the figural and metrical aspects of rhythm. Tasks were developed to assess children's ability to (1) make figural and metrical descriptions, (2) interpret figural and metrical descriptions, (3) produce the metrical hierarchy through drumming, (4) describe the metrical hierarchy, and (5) relate the metrical hierarchy to the surface durations of a melody. Tasks were presented individually through a standardized clinical interview to 72 children in second through seventh grades. Nonparametric statistics were used to test for significant differences across age groups and between musically trained and untrained subjects; protocol analyses were related to quantitative findings. Results indicated that the  differences between musically trained and untrained children in terms of metrical understanding are not as strong as would have been expected from prior research. Additionally, it was found that all children were able to understand both figural and metrical forms to differing degrees; musically trained children did not lose their figural understanding in the process of developing their metrical abilities. Findings are discussed in terms of music education practices. Suggestions for highlighting the figural aspects of rhythm are given, and ways of moving to metrical descriptions are discussed. It is argued that teachers and students should learn to integrate the figural and metrical forms at all levels of musical training and performance. (Author/RH)",

Convincing parents of diet components that insure adequate nutrition is of prime importance; if the home does not support the content of the school's nutritional curriculum, the child may feel caught in the middle between conflicting values. Several studies have shown that parents can accept a nutritional curriculum if an effort is made to educate them at the same time as their children. Many activities can be undertaken to involve parents in teaching about nutrition. For example, parents may share family food customs with their children's classes. One of the advantages of involving parents directly is that the nutritionist can  model for the parents ways in which they can teach their children about food. Parents can also be educated about nutrition by providing them with printed material or through scheduled group meetings where information is shared through films, demonstrations, lectures, and activities. Finally, actively involving parents in projects designed to incorporate new ideas about nutrition is a more effective way to change established beliefs than merely telling children and parents what to do.

The discussion begins with an overview of the incidence of child support awards among demographically eligible women and then focuses on research on factors determining fathers' payment performance. Chambers' (1979) study of payment patterns of divorced males in Genessee County, Michigan is emphasized. Subsequently, attention is given to factors influencing post-divorce visitation arrangements, father involvement in parenting, and the relationship between child support payment and visitation. Major limitations of the studies are pointed out, and the need for research on the dynamic interface  between child support payments and post-divorce spousal and father/child relationships is indicated.

Fathers and mothers were interviewed jointly as well as separately and they independently filled out a questionnaire. Children were individually interviewed at school. The following categories of data related to dimensions of fathers' participation were reported: (1) intensity of interaction with children; (2) absolute amount of time spent in child care or home chores versus the proportional amount of time spent (i.e., the number of hours spent by the father divided by the number of hours spent by both parents);  (3) solo participation versus participation with the mother; (4) performance of household chores versus child care; and (5) responsiblity for tasks versus simply performing them. Children's sex-role sterotyping and attitudes were assessed in three domains: current interests and activities, adult occupational roles, and adult family roles. In addition, children's occupational aspirations were also ascertained. Fathers' participation patterns were associated with maternal employment status and parents' sex-role attitudes (specifically, their attitudes about the male role). (AS)",

The fact that infants do not intentionally manipulate their parents; are not identical; are not simply hedonistic seekers of bodily pleasures; and are not passive, disorganized beings needing training into regularity is pointed out. In fact, infants are well-organized, individual in their responses, curious, active, and capable of learning. After establishing these premises, the question of the precise nature of infants' thinking abilities is explored in discussions of perception, physical activities with objects, the development of intention, the development of causality, construction of the permanent object, person permanence, motor memory  and symbols, cognitive representation, development of self-awareness, and self-recognition. It is pointed out that (1) a baby's developing perceptual competence is remarkable; (2) processes of intentionality and causality have to be learned and are at first comprehended through infants' own bodies and their handling of objects; (3) symbolic representation at first appears to be of a motor nature; and (4) infants learn about themselves as reciprocating persons in interaction with caretakers.

The depiction of adolescence emphasizes adolescents' ability to think abstractly and their knowledge of the mind's ability to process, direct, and manipulate experience. In contrast with the &quot;radical empiricist&quot; younger child, the adolescent is seen as a &quot;psychological clinician.&quot; This &quot;clinician&quot; includes social personality characteristics in his or her conceptualization of self, learns to integrate diverse elements of the self, and knows the self in relation to others and to social conventions. It is acknowledged that, while adolescents are introspective and self-analytical, they may sometimes experience painful self-consciousness and  engage in histrionics. The discussion very briefly considers factors influencing and influenced by the development of social competency and self-esteem. Changes in self-esteem are explored, with emphasis being given to the principles that (1) motivation for maintaining and improving self-esteem is ever-present, and (2) the self-concept develops in a social context. Implications of these principles for improving self-esteem and countering effects of unemployment are pointed out. Also discussed are the way adolescents think about problems of adolescents, such as early pregnancy and drug abuse, and the relationship of low self-esteem and school absenteeism. Concluding remarks explore the topic of subcultures and adolescent identity.

Topics briefly addressed in part I, on the thought processes/capabilities of babies, concern sensorimotor thought without abstraction, the importance of physical exploration, the development of intentionality, learning about cause and effect and properties of objects, and the development of symbolic thought. Table 1 describes motor development in the first 3 years, and Table 2 delineates six stages in the development of object permanence. Discussion of the development of preschool children in part II focuses on combining and transferring information; reversing observations; egocentricity; animism and artificialism; intuition and  sequential associations; cause and effect; classification; and applications (specifically concerning preschoolers' drawings, dreams, and concepts of death, as well as professional practice, preoperational thought in adults, and the transitional years).

The development of the primary school student is described in part III in terms of the extension of conservation, seriation, classification, concepts of number and time, concrete thinking, verbal problems, hypothetical problems, proportions, combinatorial logic, and applications to primary school children's social concepts. Educational implications are also discussed. In part IV, adolescents are discussed with reference to the egocentric idealistic crisis;  combinatorial logic; hypothetical deductive thinking; impression formation; use of symbols for symbols; and, very briefly, thought beyond formal thought.

        "description":"This book presents five papers that address a variety of issues confronting those who work directly with young children and their teachers. The first three articles present ways of thinking about what constitutes professionalism in working with children and parents. Specifically, &quot;Contemporary Perspectives on the Roles of Mothers and Teachers&quot; examines the distinctions between the orientations of mothers and teachers toward children and points out ways in which both orientations play an essential role in children's growth and development; &quot;The Professional Preschool Teacher&quot; aims to distinguish professional behavior from both nonprofessional and unprofessional behavior by illustrating types of responses to a dispute between two preschoolers over a tricycle; and &quot;Ethical Issues in  Working with Young Children&quot; examines ethical problems specific to the field and analyzes the teacher's relationship with parents and colleagues. The fourth paper, &quot;Assessing the Development of Preschoolers,&quot; proposes 11 dimensions useful in determining an individual child's development at a particular time on the basis of everyday behaviors that indicate natural fluctuations in growth. The last paper, &quot;Helping Others with Their Teaching,&quot; proposes ideas to help supervisors of teachers and teacher educators decide how they can best encourage the mastery of professional skills in the teachers and student teachers with whom they work.

Bright spots in New York's rural housing situation include availability of land at affordable prices, good existing housing stock, high percentage of owner-occupancy, presence of banks  capable of lending, and a sense of community and shared commitment to its well being. Realizing the goal of a comprehensive data base for rural communities that will enhance ability to compete for federal, state, and private support of community facilities and housing, and finding solutions to public policy issues such as how to prevent urban solutions from being misapplied to rural problems may lead to equitable assistance to rural New York communities.

Despite increases in New York's overall physician supply during the 1970's, major changes have not occurred in the rural primary care specialties: general and family practice; general internal medicine, surgery and anesthesiology; and general pediatrics. The number of small, rural hospitals of less than 50 beds is dwindling. Increased emphasis on specialty training, rapid growth of medical technology, licensing regulations and practice constraints for health care providers have limited the number and  type of personnel that rural hospitals can recruit and retain. The larger proportion of the elderly in rural areas also contributes to the rural health care crisis. State policymakers should develop and implement a flexible planning and regulatory framework that satisfies the health care needs of individual rural communities and improves the supply of health professionals. Public policy should consider how local involvement in the planning, design, implementation, and maintenance of rural health care can be enhanced.

Trends indicated declines in agricultural production, farm income, and number and size of farms and increases in direct marketing by farmers, debt-to-asset ratios, and property taxes. Among the strengths noted were low land prices, abundant resources and effective conservation practices, access to capital, human, and information resources, legislative support, and a strong  agriculture-related economy. Goals centered around production, processing, and marketing improvements; preservation and expansion of the agricultural land base; and financial and regulatory policies conducive to agricultural development. Appended lists, maps, and charts reflect supporting data relative to population growth, land use and agricultural acreage, farm income and farm product sales, patterns of food consumption and expenditures, and agricultural employment.

Among the trends cited were a population shift from urban to rural areas and a corresponding need for more services, increasing state mandates and decreasing state financial assistance, and increased resistance to centralized governments with greater reliance on local problem solutions. Strengths included effective local governments; availability of private and voluntary resources as well as such governmental resources as special commissions, city and state agencies, and federal programs; and potential assistance from rural educational institutions. Cited as weaknesses were isolation,  legal constraints on local governments and services, lack of financial and technical assistance, ineffective government structures and management, and effects of land use disputes. Goals to improve government and management encompassed efforts in financial, legal, structural, educational and technical assistance areas. Appended are lists, maps, and charts reflecting population distributions, governmental structures, expenditures for various services, and sources of revenue, and other supporting statistical data.

For grades K-12, rural schools were characterized by increased enrollment due to migration from urban areas, increasing popularity with parents, and continued consolidation/centralization of school districts. Their strengths included close school-community interactions and good student participation. Problems relating to limited program offerings, poorly prepared staff, and a limited financial base indicated the need to establish additional specific programs. For higher education, concerns centered around the sophisticated technologies of business and industry and means  of attracting students to available training programs. Thirty-six of the State University of New York's 64 campuses are located in rural counties, and vocational and community colleges are also available to most rural residents, but workshop participants identified a need for financial aid to students, better program planning and management, and more interaction between education and business/industry. Education's 2-fold role was viewed as preparing rural students for a changing world, and developing its generally unrealized potential for improving the quality of rural life.

Consisting of six parts, the reference book: reviews how a writing system was selected for the Hualapai language; explains the alphabet used and how each letter is pronounced; discusses the basic structure of Hualapai sentences with attention to noun and verb usage; explains how different types of sentences are formed and what  they mean; and presents a discussion on nouns and pronouns. Other information provided includes an analysis of verbs in detail, a discussion of verbal expressions, and an explanation of sound symbolism; types and formation of useful expressions (modal, habit and repetition, and degree) are discussed and ways in which sentences can be expanded into longer and more complex ones are explained. Two appendices provide the vocabulary words and grammatical morphemes (Hualapai-English and English-Hualapai) that appear in the book. (ERB)",

        "description":"Because Native American societies are held by United States courts to possess rights of self-government where these rights have not been explicitly withdrawn, the constitutions of 280 Native American governments in the United States (exclusive of 219 in Alaska) were examined as they existed in September 1981 to determine the extent and character of provisions dealing with civil liberties. Findings showed that, in addition to including general provisions for civil liberties and incorporating the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968, many tribal constitutions also listed specific rights (First Amendment rights, guarantees of equality, protection for property rights, due process of law, discrimination by gender, rights of the accused) which members and/or other persons have against  tribal governments. However, the number of such specific rights was less for almost all tribal constitutions than for the United States Constitution. It is recommended that Native Americans seriously study how to strengthen constitutional protection for individual liberties without undermining tribal self-government, survey the state of civil liberties on reservations today, develop remedies beyond the writ of habeas corpus for civil liberties violations, and consider the use of the Bureau of Indian Affairs as trustee for tribes to protect the civil liberties of individuals.

Additional Regional Education Centers (RECs) were established to serve 120 primary schools enrolling approximately 160,000 students (1/3 of the total school population), two teacher training schools were planned, and 480,000 textbooks were provided to 4th, 5th, and 6th grade students. Curriculum revision at the primary level was accompanied by additional teacher training to facilitate a multisensory approach through  individualized and practical learning activities. The new secondary curricula emphasized relevance, group learning, library usage, and development of critical thinking ability. Program impacts have included increased student access and retention and improved achievement. Lack of support from the government of Paraguay and dependence on donor funding continue to characterize the educational system. Six appendices present AID program features, list U.S. and Paraguayan personnel and facilities, and provide supporting tabular data. (MM)",

        "description":"In recent years, rural sociology has been the subject of sociological inquiries. Many of these have been highly critical, raising questions about the ontological nature of the discipline. This paper extends the tradition, providing a brief historical analysis of rural sociology's roots as both theoretical and applied and critiquing current rural sociology in a critical theory perspective. Questions about rural sociology's very being and how it could become more policy-oriented are raised. Illustrating a direction in which research and practice are more interwoven rather than merely discussed and suggesting a direction in which rural sociology could go, the paper gives examples from economics. Finally, the paper cautions rural sociologists that not to address these questions is to  run the risk of creating a scientifically pure but substantively vacuous discipline. (Author/NEC)",

Based on the North American compensatory education model, the Bourke Project, in 1969, chose an experimental methodology and then devised an appropriate teaching program to fit the methodology. Also begun in 1969, the New South Wales van Leer Project established 12 centers, now operated by Aboriginal people, where parents provide learning experiences for themselves and their children. Functioning between 1969 and  1972, the Victorian van Leer Project developed experimental Aboriginal preschools in contrasting rural and urban settings. The South Australian van Leer Project established two preschools in 1969 to prepare children for more effective entry into the formal school setting. The Katherine Project, operating from 1970 to 1973, emphasized development of language and communicative skills by Aboriginal children in the first four primary grades. The Queensland van Leer Project, initiated in 1968 and since implemented in all Aboriginal schools throughout the state, developed a sequenced language teaching program for the first three primary grades.

        "description":"This study attempted to determine which combinations of student, teacher, curricular, and task factors characterize effective life science instruction, where effectiveness is defined as the acquisition of scientific literacy. The framework of scientific literacy used includes five teacher behavior components: (1) explaining science content; (2) relating content to science as a social historical process; (3) relating to science as a reasoning process; (4) relating to science and society/technology; and (5) positive attitudes toward science. Data were obtained from 11 seventh grade teachers and their students using student pre- and post-surveys (respresenting the scientific literacy components), classroom observation records, and curriculum content analyses. Results indicate that  teachers carried out academic instruction largely through means of recitation, seatwork, and laboratory exercises (in that order), followed by a fairly consistent use of audiovisual materials. In addition, when presenting academic information to the entire class, the teachers rarely made explicit reference to the historical, reasoning, social, or attitudinal implications of the subject matter. Possible explanations for this latter finding are offered and discussed. (JN)",

The field draws upon theoretical constructs from a wide variety of disciplines, including mathematics, psychology, linguistics, neurophysiology, computer science, and electronic engineering. Some of the most promising developments to come out of recent AI research are &quot;expert&quot; systems or computer programs that simulate the problem-solving techniques of human experts in a particular domain. This paper reviews contemporary work in expert systems. It includes: (1) a brief history of AI research; (2) an overview of major lines of inquiry in the field, considering pattern recognition, robotics, and problem-solving; (3) a detailed discussion  of the structure, design, and limitations of expert systems; and (4) a discussion of the role that expert systems might play in education. Two appendices are included. The first presents an example of interaction with an expert system; the second lists major systems that are currently in use or under development in the categories of bioengineering, chemistry, computer hardware, computer software, education, engineering, general purpose systems and artificial intelligence utilities, law, manufacturing and industry, mathematics, medicine, the military, and resource exploration.

The analysis is organized to show the shape of the learning opportunity that most students are likely to get in school by about the time they reach the end of grades 1-8. The focus is on the mathematical tasks that students do, and in particular what they do today so that improvements in learning opportunities can be designed. Students mainly get opportunities to learn how to do things in mathematics, rather than to understand mathematical meaning. Similarities in content across textbooks for the same grade level are far more striking than the differences, but there are real  differences in the way many topics are presented, and in the sequencing of topics during the year. There seems to be much consensus regarding what schools can, or at least do, accomplish. The report then briefly highlights the follwoing topics: whole numbers, computation with whole numbers, common fractions, decimals, percent, ratio and proportion, probability and statistics, integers, algebra, geometry, measurement, and special topics, each with subtopics.

In this study, student misconceptions were identified and used as a basis for analyzing the classroom behavior of teachers and students and for developing modifications that increased the effectiveness of commercial science programs. Results, obtained from case studies of teachers using either the light unit from Laidlaw Brothers &quot;Exploring Science&quot; textbook or the Producers part of the Science Curriculum Improvement Study (SCIS-II) &quot;Communities&quot; unit, indicated that: most students had misconceptions; the teachers exhibited a variety of teaching styles that did not take student  misconceptions into account; and fewer than one quarter of the students learned the scientific conceptions they studied. When teachers used modified materials (which informed them about likely student misconceptions and suggested strategies for helping students to change), important changes in the teachers' behavior were noted and at least three times as many students understood the scientific conceptions of light than in the previous year. Learning for the Producers part did not improve, but other problems with the part were identified. When these problems were addressed in a subsequent study, learning improved substantially.

Two major questions were addressed: (1) Do stages of concern exist? (2) If so, are they developmental? The sample consisted of teachers attending summer workshops in 1974 (N=15) and 1975 (N=38). Concerns were assessed five times (including before and after the training workshops) using the Stages of Concern Questionnaire (SoCQ), a Likert-type instrument developed to measure seven hypothesized stages of concern. The SoCQ consists of 35 statements (five items for each stage) which allow respondents to describe a concern they feel at a given point in time. The seven hypothesized stages are  awareness; informational; personal; management; consequence; collaboration; and refocusing. Results indicate that individuals in this sample followed a general developmental trend from being more intense at the lower stages of concern to becoming more intense at the higher stages of concern and that management concerns never predominated any group. Other findings (such as comparisons between teachers attending the two different workshops) are reported and discussed. (JN)",

Traditional methods for collecting and analyzing such information have significant disadvantages in zoo settings and should be supplemented (not replaced) by nonreactive measures. To test this concept, teams of graduate students conducted six different research projects using nonreactive methods to investigate selected behavior of recreational visitors at the Los Angeles Zoo. Brief synopses of each study are provided. These studies focused on: (1) visitor &quot;turning preference&quot; in a zoo; (2) determinants of the holding power of zoo exhibits; (3) sign reading at two zoo exhibits; (4) children's reactions to selected animals in a petting zoo; (5) animal  stereotypes; and (6) intergenerational communication. The studies contributed to knowledge of the educational impact of zoos and to development of nonreactive research methods and improved student research abilities while requiring students to work under conditions faced by contract researchers. In addition, the studies provided future students with a more advanced starting point for further research and contributed to zoo-university cooperation.

Following an executive summary, four separate papers are presented. These papers address issues related to and discuss plans for: (1) strengthening and expanding doctoral study and research programs in HBCUs; (2) strengthening and expanding undergraduate programs in HBCUs; (3) significantly increasing the number of high school students selecting careers in science and technology; and (4) expanding and establishing collaborative  research programs between universities, industry, and national laboratories. Each includes a summary, introduction, programmatic thrust (goals), mechanisms for implementation, recommendations, and other information unique to the specific component addressed. Efforts in these areas are designed to increase the pool of minority scientists; improve the quality of faculty at all levels; improve facilities; and provide strategies to secure, as well as sustain, funding for these programs.

        "description":"Four hundred forty six female university students who had completed at least five courses were tested for self-schemas in math/science ability. One hundred eighty-four of the women had taken or were taking more than the required one basic math or science course. It was found that 35.0% of the women in the sample could be classified as having a positive self-schema for math/science ability, while only 14.1% could be classified as having a negative self-schema for this ability. Women were more likely to be positive schematic for math/science ability if they had taken or were taking math or science courses. Both the finding of such a small proportion of women classified as negative schematic and the subjects' responses to open-ended questions about the reasons for their course  choices suggest that many university women avoid math and science courses not because of a sense of inferiority with respect to their abilities in these areas, but simply because of a lack of interest. The problem of women's avoidance of math and science courses may well lie less with the women themselves than with the presentation of math and science to them. (Author)",

Following a background paper by Romberg, the status of mathematics instruction was discussed by Senese, Willoughby, Pollak, and Romberg. The mathematics curriculum was then explored, with the focus on new goals by Pollak, computers by Braun, statistics by Hunter, and needed changes by Usiskin. In the third section, focusing on learning and teaching, research on learning was described by Siegler and on  teaching by Peterson. In the same section, Case discussed implications of cognitive science, Carpenter explored learning as a critical variable in curriculum reform, and Lappan discussed implications of research to mathematics teachers. Work group reports were then summarized, followed by papers on policy implications and impediments. Williams discussed the preparation of teachers, and then various perspectives were presented: Makhmaltchi, on publishers; Jones, on test developers; Barclay, on materials and producers; Hala, on mathematics supervisors; and Gawronski, on school administrators.

Student and teacher ratings were collected for 206 students in ten junior high school math classrooms. Consistent support for the hypotheses was found.

Studies of the earth's mantle which may provide additional information about the earth's core are also discussed. They include  laboratory experiments with mantle materials and modeling of mantle structure at the Carnegie Institution's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism. It is pointed out that although many questions about the earth's core are still unanswered, the promise of new research tools is vast.

In the attempt to enforce order, the analogy between the family and the state (i.e., the family provides a model for all social and political relations) became prevalent. Discussed within this context are the patriarchal political theory, how the family was described by early modern English household manuals, and how the restoration changed the way the judicial systems maintained social order. After the Restoration, population growth stabilized, real wages began to rise, and the poor,  while still present, seemed less threatening. In such a situation, strict enforcement of gender and familial relations became less necessary; their symbolic role in affirming social and political order was no longer crucial. It was in this context that John Locke and others came to see and define the family as a private and natural institution instead of a public, social institution. (RM)",

        "description":"The level and character of school investment affected the national economic output in agriculture and industry in Mexico during two periods, 1880-1910 and 1920-1925. Prior to the 1910 revolution, the Mexican government encouraged urban-centered industrial development, and schools were mostly locally- controlled, urban institutions. In post-revolution Mexico (1920-1925) a rural-focused strategy of agricultural development that discouraged industrial investment was adopted, and the federal government took control of schools, giving top priority to rural areas. Federal statistics on schools and economic activity in these two eras were analyzed, using production-function and panel analysis models. The level of school investment prior to the revolution was found to be negatively  associated with agricultural growth, perhaps because of the urban focus of schools during this time. After 1920, school investment--now focusing on rural development--had a positive influence on agricultural output. Conflicting positive and negative effects of literacy on industry were observed prior to 1910. After 1917, however, school investment and quality raised aggregate manufacturing output. (RM)",

Prior to 1953, Israeli political parties operated and had total control over their own schools. Before statehood in 1948, a growing desire for national unity led some major parties to give up their separate schools and merge them into a school system or stream. Three school systems--the General, Religious, and Labor streams--existed in parallel until statehood in 1948, when they were joined by a fourth stream, the Ultra Orthodox (Agudat Israel). The State Education Law, passed in 1953, was a compromise. The various political parties agreed to transfer control of their separate schools to a central Ministry of Education and Culture. The compromise was to retain some religious  differentiation in curriculum and school atmosphere within one national school system. Five types of schools were established: state secular, state religious, ultra orthodox, communal settlement schools, and Arab schools. The new law has resulted in less parent involvement in schools, but more equal educational attainment between Ashkenazic and Sephardic Jews. (RM)",

The study was conducted over three consecutive semesters in which 41 women and 6 men completed the Attitude Toward Women (ATW) Scale and the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) during the first and last weeks of classes. In addition, individual interviews were conducted with male students during the first and last weeks of courses. Results of the BSRI showed changes in masculinity and feminity scores. Masculinity scores significantly decreased for men and increased for women who participated in women's studies classes, a change  that represents decreasing sex-typing in both males and females. On the ATW Scale, attitudes toward women were liberal in both sexes (though more liberal in women) at pretesting and remained so. Structured interviews with male subjects were more sensitive than objective measures in revealing perceived changes in males. Results contribute to an understanding of attitude change as a function of exposure to information in an academic setting. (LH)",

Arranged by grade level and presented in chart format, the curriculum is organized around three major components: topics, social issues and competing values, and objectives. Objectives are further subdivided into values objectives, knowledge objectives, and skill objectives. While topics might pertain to a time  period, a geographic region, a culture, or a system of human organization in general, 60 percent of the total prescribed content is devoted to Canadian studies. Unit topics include the following: families (grade 1); planning neighborhoods and local communities (grade 2); lifestyles in other times and places (grade 3); Alberta's natural and human resources and links with the world (grade 4); the exploration, settlement, and development of Canada and relations with the United States (grade 5); meeting human needs (grade 6); people and their culture (grade 7); people and their institutions (grade 8); technology (grade 9); participatory citizenship (grade 10); and global issues (grades 11 and 12).

The first chapter, an introduction, provides an overview of the status of student voter education programs and recommends possible roles for election officials in the development and implementation of such programs. The second chapter contains information and recommendations for short- and long-term and modular projects for middle schools and high schools. Three types of mock elections are outlined and sections and sample lessons from one long-term project, Project PAVE (People and Action in Voter Education), are provided. A chapter on elementary level voter education describes how  mock elections can be used at each of the lower grades and briefly describes some other materials available for this level. The fourth chapter focuses on using election officials as resources. The final chapter discusses voter registration related activities, including actual registration of high school students, the appointment of student deputy registrars, and registration drives. Three appendices contain the following materials: thirty classroom activities; a list of community, state, and national resources; and a list giving names and titles of election and education officials interviewed during state visits. A bibliography concludes the publication. (LP)",

The first sections deal with the political history of the region, emphasizing the period of U.S. administration from the 1940's to the 1970's. The history of instititonalized education is also outlined, describing political, economic, and demographic factors that affect the future course of Micronesia. The document then examines ethnographic research on the various cultures of Micronesia. Emphasis is placed on aspects of traditional culture which particularly have an impact on education: traditional learning structures; factors in communication and self-presentation; and attitudes toward authority, work, and  cultural contact. Traditional leadership structures and status relationships, now competing with the cash economy and status through wealth and education, are also discussed. Separate subsections deal with each of the Federated States of Micronesia (Yap, Truk, Ponape, and Kosrae) as well as the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Belau, the Territory of Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The final sections address education in Micronesia, including educational needs and areas for future research and development. A population chart and tables showing trends in urbanization, age distribution, the relationship among languages, and language spoken in the home are provided. A bibliography listing over 180 resources concludes the document. (LH)",

The alternatives to violence course is structured into twenty 45-minute units (a total of 15 hours). Sessions 1-3 examine kinds of violence, the nature of violence, and institutional violence. Session 4 deals with basic responses to conflict and historical cases of nonviolent action. Sessions 5-7 focus on the development of nonviolent alternatives, including active listening, group facilitation and consensus, and negotiation and leadership. Session 8 explores differences between violence and nonviolence and session 9 examines elementary skills necessary for active  nonviolent self-defense. Sessions 10-12 deal with confronting violence, alternatives to violence on the community level, and problem solving. In session 13, students apply concepts and skills for interpersonal and community conflict resolution to global problems. A session on nonviolent national defense (session 14) is followed by a session promoting nonviolence as a philosophy or lifestyle. Sessions 16 and 17 relate personal lifestyles to global conflict resolution through problem-solving exercises involving current events. In sessions 18 and 19, students learn to influence the U.S. political system through effective letter-writing and steps toward global nonviolence are discussed. A course evaluation sheet is presented in the final session. The manual concludes with a bibliography,  glossary, description of games, and a list of conflict scenarios. (LH)",

        "description":"A major transformation in teacher education must occur if social studies education is to become soundly-based civic education that meets the needs of special interests, such as global education, without becoming dominated by those needs, and if teachers are to transcend the textbook so that goal statements are actually reflected in classroom practice. One step in this transformation would be to change the student teaching experience. Research shows that, rather than fulfilling its goal of having preservice teachers apply the model teaching practices they have learned in the classroom, the student teaching experience now serves to socialize prospective teachers into conservative school patterns. If, as Dewey (1916; 1933) noted, people think and learn when faced with problems real  to themselves, then it would seem that prospective teachers could learn more if exposed to professional teacher education courses after they have had teaching experiences. This procedure would allow courses to capitalize on the needs teachers perceive as growing out of their own teaching experiences. The coursework that would follow this teaching experience would include a major emphasis on educational philosophy. The gap left in undergraduate education by the transfer of professional education courses to the graduate or inservice level could well be filled by a return to traditional liberal arts education.

However, it is possible to do a great deal to meet these goals from within the confines of the traditional social studies textbook and social studies course. In the past, several projects have attempted to do this. The Harvard Project of the 1950's and 1960's was designed on the premise that curriculum development had to take place in the school setting and with the involvement of practicing teachers if the results were to be responsive to school needs. The Utah State University Program, undertaken in the 1960's, culminated in the development of the Analysis of Public Issues Program, a set of supplementary materials for integrating  critical thinking skills and analytic concepts into the social studies course. The challenge facing social studies educators today should not be whether to abandon totally the traditional curriculum but how to encourage more of an emphasis on citizenship education within the realistic demands of public school teaching.

A composite list of skills was categorized into six groups: planning; management of student conduct; instructional organization and development; presentation of subject matter; evaluation; and personal and professional qualifications. Participants in the study included 200 preservice teachers, 200 supervising teachers, 34 college faculty, and 28 university supervisors. Analysis of the resulting data indicated that there was a high degree of congruence  across all groups on concerns about teaching competencies that must be developed before leaving the program. There was strong agreement that management of student behavior was the most important skill category, with planning a close second. Data on the ranking of specific skills are presented in tables. The appendices include steps taken in the evaluation study, a complete list of identified teaching skills and categories, questions used in discussion groups, and transcriptions of preservice teachers' discussions on the specific content of program courses.

The teacher career cycle is viewed as a progression affected by personal and environmental factors. The stages a teacher's career proceeds through (e.g., preservice, entry, growing, stable, exit) are described as not necessarily linear, but frequently cyclical. Scenarios are given of the cyclical development of four teachers, each of whom is required by circumstances to change or reverse directions to develop professionally. Implications for inservice education include: (1) Traditional inservice activities that emphasize improved teaching skills are appropriate at certain points in a teachers' career, particularly during  skill-building periods; (2) The concept of staff development and professional growth should be broadened to include concern for personal needs and problems of teachers; (3) Organizational policies should provide support for teachers at various stages of the teacher career cycle; and (4) Approaches to staff development and professional growth should emphasize personalized, individualized support systems.

In &quot;Research in Teacher Effectiveness,&quot; Georgea M. Sparks traces the research findings on effective teaching practices and educational outcomes during the last 15 years, and briefly summarizes the research on cooperative group learning strategies. In chapter 2, &quot;Curriculum and Effective Teaching,&quot; John I. Goodlad presents information from his study on schools and discusses the prerequisites of effective teaching and the cooperative classroom. In &quot;The Art and Craft of Teaching,&quot; Elliot W. Eisner addresses the aspects of the cooperative classroom that develop teacher flexibility and creativity. In &quot;These Days--These  Debates,&quot; Philip L. Hosford discusses teacher evaluation and argues for the use of both a quantitative and qualitative approach to gaining knowledge about teacher effectiveness. In &quot;Aldo: A Metaphor,&quot; Robert Garmston and Arthur Costa present a narrative about an experienced and devoted classroom teacher facing an aggressive staff development program requiring the learning of new teaching skills. In &quot;Using Research to Improve Teaching Effectiveness,&quot; Ralph W. Tyler challenges educators to use what is available from &quot;action research,&quot; but reminds them that research findings are generalizations that serve to guide practitioners as they study and try to understand all of the elements in their own classrooms. In the final chapter, an &quot;Overview of Cooperative Learning,&quot; Chick Moorman, Dee  Dishon, and Pat Wilson O'Leary give their rationale for teaching cooperation, and describe the differences between typical classroom groups and cooperative groups.

        "description":"Semiotics is the science of signs and the structures of signs within which meanings emerge. The process through which these sign structures are built up is called semiosis. Courses commonly taught as foundational to teacher trainers should be imbued with a specific semiotic emphasis. At a general level, teachers may be introduced to the notion of signs and the process of semiosis, and be sensitized to the structures and codes of experience which both they and their students are building as they operate in the world. Thus, the interconnectedness of the concepts taught in foundational courses may be recognized and clarified. This view directs the attention of teachers away from teaching specific bits of knowledge and focuses upon the cultivation of higher intellectual skills. While  semiotics is not the only view which leads to this conclusion, it, unlike some others, provides some conceptual tools for analyzing these skills and provides insights into ways in which these skills may be nurtured.

        "description":"A study examined the effects of one aspect of trainer behavior on teachers' classroom behavioral change. The trainer behavior studied was elicitation of trainee public commitment. Seventeen teachers participated in a series of workshops from the Stallings' Effective Use of Time program. These workshops were team led by teacher, principal, and university trainers, who were in the process of becoming certified workshop trainers for the program. Relationships of specific teacher commitments to actual behavioral changes were measured by pre- and post-classroom observations, using the Stallings' Observation System (involving snapshots and 5-minute interactions). The focus of observation was on three major elements: (1) trainer commitment-generating activity; (2) trainee discussion of  commitment; and (3) trainee response to commitment. Comparisons were made of the behavior and results obtained in the workshops conducted by teachers, by principals, and by university personnel. Based on research on public commitment, the study sought to determine if a relationship exists between teachers' commitment to behavior change and the effectiveness of a teacher training program.

An analysis is presented of the reactions to the simulation of three experienced special education teachers and two teachers in a masters' degree program in  elementary education. Findings indicated that: (1) Experienced teachers were not able to perceive the microcomputer simulation as an adequate representation of school reality; (2) The teachers interpreted the simulation situations in terms of their own ideologies and teaching perspectives; and (3) The simulation did not seem to facilitate experiential learning.

The cyclical rhythms and patterns of the school year are considered, as are the formal and informal guidelines used by teachers in their interactions with students and school personnel. The social realities of teaching in the elementary school are delineated in the second chapter. Case studies of two schools are presented to illuminate differences which may exist in school climates. Chapter 3 points out the sharp difference between teaching at the elementary and secondary school school. Major themes in discussing secondary level teaching include  living in a bureaucracy, working with adolescents, and the faculty culture. The problems inherent in relationships between teachers and principals and the responsibilities of leadership are discussed in the fourth chapter. In the fifth chapter, descriptions of school improvement efforts are analyzed. The final chapter explores fundamental realities and needs to be considered in improving inservice teacher education, and the roles of teachers and administrators in these endeavors. (JD)",

Teacher performance common to instruction in all subjects (generic performances) have been identified as positively correlated with student outcomes. Researchers have identified, described, and tested the effectiveness of a large number of generic elements in teaching. Concepts of effective teaching have been assembled and classified into six instructional domains: planning, management of student conduct, instructional organization and  development, presentation of subject matter, communication, and testing. Another area of research has dealt with content-specific teaching performances and techniques used for instruction in different subject matters. A third component of pedagogical education is theoretical pedagogy, which consists of concepts and principles about human development, conditions of learning, and the relations among social variables. Each of these components is described with summaries of relevant research findings. (JD)",

The emergence of an unmotivated urban student population from families who undervalue education will pose increasing problems for teachers. While teachers' knowledge of subject matter is essential, insights into the ecology of the classroom, the nature of the learner and learning, and a command of various teaching methodologies will be necessary. At present, several conditions constrain the quality of teacher preparation: (1) limited integration of a strong foundation in the arts and sciences; (2) limited integration of a strong clinical component throughout teacher education programs; (3) limited commitment of the best teachers and K-12 schools to teacher preparation; (4) lack of  institutional characteristics and organizational features which provide coherence to programs and a sense of programmatic collegiality among faculty and students; and (5) limited numbers of courses and credits which define the scope of teacher education programs. The relationships between a markedly changing social demography and these five constraints is discussed. Studies on school effectiveness are cited as providing guidelines for improving teacher effectiveness in the future. Priorities for programmatic research and development are suggested. (JD)",

Preservice education is expected to provide schools with a continuous supply of highly qualified candidates. However, preservice teacher education exerts little proactive control over teacher supply, which is governed by large marketplace factors such as perceptions of the occupation, expectations of job opportunities, and relative salary advantages. Preservice education is also expected to provide fully prepared and competent teachers, able to handle the daily work of schools without further support or assistance. New teachers are expected to be a source of research-based innovations in teaching. Pressures on schools of  education are such that much time is spent defining and rearranging credit hours rather than focusing on such basic questions as what a teacher must reasonably know to function effectively in the classroom. The expectations of new teachers are often unrealistically high, and when they are faced with the realities of the classroom, students, school administration, and extrinsic rewards, disillusionment is frequent. Specific recommendations are offered for building toward much needed reform in preservice teacher education programs to prepare prospective teachers for the realities of their profession. (JD)",

Section I discusses concepts of funding adequacy and equity in public elementary, secondary, and post-secondary education. Data are included on differential weighing of academic programs. Section II presents and analyzes data concerning the principal resource and productivity variables in teacher education in 43 state universities and land-grant colleges for 1982-83. Tables show the comparative relationships of different variables among several institutions. In section III, a comparative analysis is presented of resources and productivity between the colleges of education, engineering, and business administration in a  major public university, in the belief that this situation is probably representative of most public universities. Within this section, a statement is developed about the nature of teacher education programs and those two other disciplines. Section IV presents a series of conclusions and recommendations, with an emphasis on the policies needed to improve the preparation of the nation's teachers. (JD)",

Teachers must be thoroughly prepared in general academic work and in pedagogy, and they should be exposed to the actualities of the classroom. An excellent teacher education program needs high quality faculty and staff, and needs them in sufficient numbers. The faculty must be highly competent intellectually and well educated in appropriate academic disciplines and in specific areas of pedagogy directly related to their instructional responsibilities. They must also have been experienced and successful teachers of children themselves. Serious consideration should be given to lengthening the teacher preparation program. There is  a need to strengthen both academic and performance criteria for prospective teachers. To meet the needs of an excellent teacher education program, more funding is necessary, and better physical and instructional resources are essential. (JD)",

The question of the effect of certification tests on the quality of hired teachers is briefly discussed. Statistics are presented on types of tests used by various states, with particular attention to differences in the cut-off scores for passage of a teacher certification test, whether on a test developed by one state or a nationally-normed test set by individual states. Correlations between the scores on admission tests and subsequent teacher certification test scores in several southern states are analyzed. The structure and validity of some state-developed tests and nationally-normed tests are considered. Also examined are the relatively low test scores of minority groups and the  effects of this phenomenon on schools with predominantly minority students. A brief discussion is presented on issues raised by testing for recertification which has been mandated in Arkansas and Texas. (JD)",

Many positive qualitative and quantitative changes in the teacher training programs have been rendered as a result of the state program approval process. The National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) offers an additional accreditation source. This accreditation differs from the state approval process in that it uses one set of standards for all secondary teacher preparation programs, and these programs are either approved or disapproved in aggregate. NCATE teams are quite small and do not contain a specialist  for each program being evaluated. Recently NCATE has been reexamining its program approval process, and a proposal has been made to concentrate review on general and professional education rather than on specific teaching fields. Some state officials question the need for NCATE's assessment of program aspects that have already been evaluated by state teams. (DG)",

The first paper discusses the current state of teaching, namely: (1) that students are not interested, challenged, or knowledgeable--they are not learning, and (2) that teachers are using outdated methods and are not able to compete for their students' attention--they are not effective. An in-service training model designed to improve classroom instruction and student learning is described and recommendations are made regarding incorporation of the model's components in pre-service training programs. The  second paper presents some ideas about how states and teacher educators can work together: (1) State Departments of Education need to work closely with schools, colleges, departments of education (SCDE); (2) States must help SCDEs attract better students to teacher education programs; and (3) States need to reconceptualize what teaching and teacher education are all about.

It is emphasized that the computer cannot  teach anything but the basic materials programmed into it; a computer cannot substitute for creative thought or individual decision making.

        "description":"The recent spate of national studies about schools is largely based on analyses of what schools do, how they do it, what the results are, and what they ought to be doing in light of present and future demands. Recommendations from these studies appear to fall into four categories of structure changes, content changes, value changes, and people changes. While the recommendations often differ, some common elements can be found in them, including visions of what schools need to do, dissatisfaction with the current state of schools, the belief that the teacher is vital for improvement in the schools, and concerns that teachers are not up to this challenge. Eight characteristics that bear on teacher education can be derived from the national studies. Teachers should: (1) be  well-educated; (2) be intellectually curious and interested in others; (3) be knowledgeable in the subject matter taught; (4) support the essential character of American society; (5) understand how students learn; (6) be the pedagogical manager or &quot;coach&quot; in the learning process; (7) be a continuous learner; and (8) look forward to a teaching career. Each of these characteristics is discussed in terms of its implications for teacher preparation. (CB)",

Four images of the teacher's role are: (1) the teacher as an artist, prepared by practitioners and master performers in the fashion of an apprentice; (2) the teacher as a moral craftsman, which implies the selection, training, and support of teachers who have the propensity or capacity for making moral decisions; (3) the teacher as an applied scientist, with teacher preparation that is keyed to the research base on teaching  effectiveness and carried out in clinical sites; and (4) the teacher as a decision maker, focusing on decision making functions and responsibilities. Three areas of these roles are explored: the knowledge a decision-maker image would require teachers to acquire; preparation models for teacher education; and selection criteria for future teachers.

The following problems and questions are examined: (1) Raising standards for entry into teaching and teacher preparation may exclude minorities, older adults, naturalized citizens and others whose skills and talents are useful. However, not raising standards will make it difficult for teaching and teacher education to achieve professional status in the professional and academic communities. (2) Reformers are calling for career ladders, and differentiated  rewards as a teacher displays special skills, knowledge, and initiative. However, teachers tend to cling to the egalitarian tradition that one teacher's opinions and contributions are equal to any others. (3) Can students be trained to do what good teachers do and be what good teachers are, or must some basic aptitudes and talents for teaching be present before training? (4) Will standardization of the teacher education curriculum negate the tradition of academic freedom? (5) Should the focus of instruction be on a standard curriculum or on the individual student? Some concrete recommendations are presented about initiatives which uinversities, teachers, and public agencies can pursue to attract competent students to teacher education and the field of teaching.

A joint university committee could provide common intellectual experiences as well as concentration in particular subjects together with professional teacher education. Other suggestions for improvement are: (1) integration of professional teacher education with undergraduate preparation; (2)  collaboration between professional teacher education faculty and arts and sciences faculty for the evaluation of students for admission to teacher education programs; (3) incentives, social and fiscal, to attract and reward those faculty members who exert efforts to integrate these programs; and (4) a broader concept of the role of the school of education's dean or director.

However, there now exists a body of knowledge and a fresh set of conceptions about teaching upon which to base teacher education. Recent and numerous advances in pedagogical knowledge can now be used to provide teacher education with a scientific foundation. Over the last decade or two, the scientific approach to the study of education has been unusually fruitful, though not all of that research has yet been incorporated into teacher education programs. Schools of education at the major state universities should be leading the way in developing new programs of teacher preparation based on research on teaching. Research having implications for teacher preparation is  cited in the areas of: time factors in learning; success and positive reinforcement; structuring behavior; pedagogical decision making; classroom management and achievement; and effects of expectations on student performance.

Program features include emphasis on research and study in fields supplementary to education-related study. Reasons for changing to a five-year program include changes in the teaching profession and in teacher preparation, new demands placed on teachers, the need to prepare for increasingly complex teaching fields, changes in public perception of teachers' degrees, the need to work on and master effective classroom practices, and the need for more comprehensive and demanding requirements.

Out of 418 organizations contacted, 40 percent responded to the letter, 21 percent returned some form of document, and 8 percent provided documents that  contained guidelines for appropriate test use. A checklist was implemented to review each document, with the following results: (1) Almost all organizations provided quidelines in the category of test score interpretation; (2) The purpose of testing examples of misuse, and procedures for monitoring compliance received less emphasis than interpreting test scores; and (3) Test selection, test administration, scoring tests, communicating results, handling test data, and qualifications of test users received the least attention.

Discussion follows, however, on whether it is possible to improve the quality of cognitive assessment by extending the range of cognitive abilities to be assessed. Two types of extension are considered: modifying and expanding testing procedures for psychological functions that are components of conventional tests, and the extension of testing to psychological functions not generally assessed by conventional intelligence or aptitude tests. Computerized presentations will make relatively little difference in the current ways of testing verbal comprehension. Computer controlled testing could well extend the ways in which spatial-visual reasoning and memory  are evaluated. The impact of testing on the evaluation of reasoning is unclear. Computer-controlled item presentation makes it possible to conceive of tests of learning and attention. The psychological nature of the abilities being assessed raises problems in assessment that are not addressed by the fact of computer-control. Some research questions are identified that ought to be explored before testing is extended into these fields. Computer-controlled evaluation could be extended to the assessment of criterion performance, either in the normal working situation or in a simulation of the workplace. While evaluation of this sort does raise social questions, it clearly presents an opportunity to obtain validation data for psychological assessment studies. (Author/BW)",

Implementation success is a function of use/nonuse, appropriate/inappropriate practice, and user concerns about the innovation. These dimensions: Levels of Use (LoU) of the Innovation, Innovation Configurations (IC) and Stages of Concern (SoC) about the Innovation can measure and rank progress for individuals or groups, be combined for a composite ranking, and be used for exploring the relationship between implementation success and change process variables. These procedures were applied to the Principal-Teacher Interaction Study to assess implementation success across nine elementary schools in Colorado, Florida,  and California. Study sites varied by principal's approach to facilitation, year of implementation, and innovation being implemented. Throughout the 1980-81 school year, data were collected from bi-weekly phone calls to principals and four on-site visits. Teacher data were collected using the CBAM diagnostic dimensions. Rankings were done during three 3-day meetings by research staff and school district representatives. Results suggest close monitoring feed back and more interventions will improve implementation success. Principal change facilitator style significantly influenced teacher classroom practice.

Students typically experience a transition from a self-contained classroom to departmentalized instruction in junior high school; they often also experience a transition from heterogeneous to homogeneous, ability-grouped classrooms in junior high school. Effects of these environmental changes on students' social comparison of abilities and achievement-related beliefs and values in mathematics are examined for a sample of 291 students in 14 upper-elementary and junior high school classrooms. Certain social comparison behaviors increase when the school transition occurs and are higher in heterogeneous compared to homogeneous, ability-grouped junior  high school classrooms. Other social comparison behaviors are affected in quite different ways at the school transition. Self-concept of math ability and math value decline at the school transition. Implications of these trends for long-term persistence in mathematics and suggestions for future research are discussed. (Author)",

Four interrelated psychological aspects seem to attract women to ethnographic research: its emphasis on a holistic perspective; the fact that an ethnographer must establish rapport with participants in the culture; the use of the self as a measuring device; and the dual goals of involvement and detachment. Despite these attractions, choosing to do ethnographic research can create problems for women, such as the stigma of doing \"soft\" research (non-quantitative, less rigorous) or the potential future  perceptions of ethnography as a woman's (devalued) area. A final problem is the time demands involved in ethnography. Despite these problems, there are reasons why women should consider doing ethnographic research. It provides opportunities for developing new theoretical models and new research paradigms. (BW)",

Following an integrative summary delivered by the chairperson (DeVito), the first paper (Conetta and Tryon) reviewed the two basic types of self-report TA instruments--those measuring global TA and those measuring specific aspects of TA separately--and reported their use in TA literature. The second paper (DeVito, Tryon, and Kane) provided additional validity data for the TAI. The TAI emotionality and worry scales were correlated with the Mooney Problem Check Lists (PCL) items using data from 525 college freshmen. PCL items significantly related to the TAI  were considered with regard to the validity of the TAI and implications for the theory and understanding of TA. The third paper (Kane, DeVito, and Tryon) discussed the relationship of the TAI to the Survey of Study Habits and Attitudes and selected Strong-Campbell Interest Inventory scales. The final paper (Carlson and DeVito) reported a study of 273 freshmen on the equivalence of actual and recalled measures of test anxiety using the A-state scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.

The goal of this evaluation were: (1) to determine the factors which affected the implementation of Native Indian Language programs for dialects of two language families (Wakashan, including Kwak'wala and Nuu-chah-nulth; and Salishan, including Songhees, Sencoten, and Halkomelem); (2) to ascertain the support for such programs among Native Indian parents and teachers; and (3) to consider whether the public school is the appropriate agency for Native Indian language programs in the Greater Victoria region. After an introduction to the evaluation and its methods in Chapters 1 and 2, Chapter 3 provides a history and description of Native Indian  language education in the region. Chapter 4 presents the major issues and concerns which emerged, including: (1) the development of standards; (2) preparation of Indian language teachers; (3) responses of school staff toward Indian education; and (4) community communication characteristics. A curriculum review, presented as Chapter 5, proposes a set of criteria for evaluating language curriculum materials. Chapter 6 highlights &quot;multiple perspectives&quot; on the school/community relationship extracted from a recorded Saanich community meeting and taped interviews. In Chapter 7, detailed questionnaire information on Native Indian language usage and education and its context are provided. The entire study's findings and recommendations are summarized in Chapter 8, including praise for the  instructors and proposals for: curriculum criteria and development; community participation; full certification for teachers; and methods for determining standards for teacher and pupil performance. The appendices include a list of participants, a sample questionnaire, and school district policy statements. (BW)",

Locally designed objectives-based tests, carefully matched to the mathematics curriculum and administered to students in the Des Moines Independent Community School District, were used to identify students in need of remedial assistance in mathematics as well as assessing students' overall mathematics achievement. Twenty-one Chapter 1 teachers participated in the study, 11 at the 4th and 5th grade levels  and 10 at the 6th grade level. Teacher judgments of item difficulty were recorded. The study found that results of item calibration analyses confirmed stability of the item difficulty estimates for the tests and the groups of students studied. It further found that the lack of continuing remediation when the results so indicate, can potentially compound their deficiences at the succeeding grade level. Adhering to a predetermined &quot;fixed&quot; standard as opposed to a &quot;floating&quot; standard can affect a student's future learning experiences. (Author/EGS)",

This experiment examined the process of cognitive integration and the similarities and differences between how imagined and perceived information is processed in solving problems. The information integrated consisted of straight lines and semi-circles. All subjects learned to identify lines or curves corresponding to one of eight numbers through a paired-associate procedure. In the integration phase, subjects had to mentally construct one or more letters from 26 subsets of three different lines previously learned. Lines were presented to different subject  groups by two methods, display or imagery. Unlike similar research, subjects could use different strategies: work forward from lines to letters, or backward from letters to lines. Results showed that different stimulus information sources can produce different situational and cognitive demands. These factors can affect the subject's choice of problem solving strategies and produce different response patterns. This research illustrated that methods are needed for perception and imagination research which do not restrict subjects' processing strategies. (BS)",

From the literature and an elementary school teacher survey, seven purposes of homework were identified: practice, participation, personal development, parent-child relations, policy, public relations, and punishment. Using data from elementary school teachers, principals, parents and students from a survey in 16 Maryland school districts (Becker and Epstein, 1982), this paper explores the correlates of homework activities and student behaviors in school. Six homework variables are correlated with reading and math achievements, homework performance, and classroom behavior: homework time, homework quality, student attitudes, teacher practices, parent abilities and resources, and  other student and family factors. Results indicate that simple association of homework time and student achievement is not enough to understand when homework is important for effective teaching and learning. It is not clear that increasing homework time improves or maintains the achievement, homework behaviors, or school attitudes of low achievers. (BS)",

        "description":"A dominant theme in cognitive psychology is that prior knowledge in long-term memory has a strong influence on an individual's cognitive processing. Citing numerous memory studies with children, knowledge base effects are presented as part of a broader picture of memory development. Using the sort/recall procedure (asking subjects to group sets of items prior to recall), instructions provided have dramatic effects on the sorting style and recall performance of younger children. With highly salient stimulus materials (categorically related items) and remembering based instructions, third graders form meaningful groups and transfer the organizational strategy to unstructured materials. Rehearsal strategies of third graders also vary as a function of stimulus properties. The data  suggest that with developmental advances in component cognitive skills, applying mnemonic strategies requires less effort and becomes increasingly routinized. Complete understanding of memory development requires a longitudinal analysis of children at all stages of mnemonic competence, rather than traditional cross-sectional research designs focusing on particular mnemonic skills.

Correlation analyses indicate teacher reports of their classroom behavior appear to be related to the perceptions teachers have of the needs and expectations of others in their role set. Teacher teaching experience, grade level, faculty size, and frequency of supervisor contact  influence these perceptions. Whether teacher beliefs are accurate is not known.

Sensory interaction indices were derived for these subjects who had taken the Surface Development Test of spatial ability. Product-moment correlations were computed between sensory interaction indices for eight cerebral sites and spatial ability test scores. Sensory interaction for left and right hemispheric regions was significantly related to spatial ability. As sensory suppression decreased, spatial ability increased. The results substantiated the theory that the  visual-imaginal-analog and the auditory-verbal-propositional representational systems are implicated in spatial ability. The extent to which the cortex can inhibit or attenuate the interaction or integration between these dual symbol systems is associated with complicated spatial task performance. (Author)",

This proposition is concretely illustrated for bar graph-using performance of 4th and 6th graders who under most conditions manifest quite accurate performance. Mean response time (T) is made a linear function of the measure of task/display effective complexity. A model is presented wherein this measure of complexity represents the sum of the weights of the parameters pertinent to three physical operations, one or more of which is pertinent to performing either of two information processing tasks with respect to either of two bar-graphic display  forms. It is contended that effective complexity could be evaluated for any sufficiently analytic information display form using the approach sketched. It is noted that in any such analysis the measure of complexity remains a postulation until empirically verified using suitable new data. (Author/BW)",

Procedures to design, develop, and empirically verify attainment and placement tests are presented. The methodology is designed to ensure that the test instruments and results serve carefully defined functions and accurately describe and reflect instructional program effects. The specific concepts and skills addressed and the emphasis they receive in the instructional materials and procedures provide the basis for defining the test and reporting structure. The attainment test development process involves: (l) identifying and analyzing instructional segments; (2) specifying, and representing  accurately and proportionately, the skills, concepts and outcome for each segment; and (3) verifying generated prototypical items by analyzing proficiency patterns of prototype test results. After attainment test preparation, placement tests can be developed. Items selected should yield information to differentiate student assignment to the most appropriate initial instructional segment. Preliminary results indicate that the methodology is extendable to a broad range of instructional programs and product systems. (Author/BS)",

Instructional accomplishment inventories are descriptive, and are designed to reflect the scope, sequence, and skills and emphasis in a particular instructional program. Standardized achievement tests are designed to discriminate between students and do not represent actual instruction. These tests can be equated using a qualitative method which requires a matching of instrument structures at three levels: general instrument, subcatagories, and items. The analysis is performed in sequence at each level to show the correspondence between skills reflected in the instrument. An example of qualitative equating  for the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills and the Los Angeles City Schools' Survey of Essential Skills in reading and mathematics for grades 3 and 6 is given. Qualitative analysis may reveal that there is no meaningful basis for statistical equating. If the testing instruments do have a qualitative relationship, the statistical relationship between the instruments takes on a better informed meaning. (BS)",

Three common definitions of item difficulty were considered: the proportion of correct responses for a group of individuals; the probability of a correct response to an item for a specific person; and the location of the item along a difficulty continuum. This paper defines the difficulty of an item that measures more than one dimension as the direction from the origin of the multidimensional space to the point of greatest discriminating power and the distance from the origin to that point. The direction can be given in terms of angles with the coordinate axes or the corresponding direction cosines. The distance is a signed number using  the same units as the coordinate axes. For the unidimensional case, the definition simplifies to the b-parameter from unidimensional item response theory. (BW)",

This report presents the results of the 1984 survey at Northwestern High School and compares them with two prior surveys (1982 and 1983). The number of student respondents from all grades from randomly selected classes closely approximated the percentage distribution of enrollment by grade. The Student Opinion Inventory, published by the National Study of School Evaluation, was used, consisting of 34 questions sorted by 6 school descriptor categories: student activities, instruction, curriculum, guidance and counseling, school morale, and school administration. Guidance and counseling and curriculum were most favorably assessed. Near uniformity was found  in the category rankings for both the mean of the percent responding favorably and for the magnitude of the mean scores in all three surveys. School administration ranked sixth, and student activities ranked fifth in all three surveys. School morale ranked fourth in the last two surveys, but in 1982, it ranked second. The appendices, tables which comprise more than half the document, deal with such topics as: (1) survey questions with 1984 response results by grade level; (2) survey questions with frequency responses, mean scores and chi-square test results for each survey; and (3) mean scores per grade per year with analysis of variance and linearity significance levels.

        "description":"Drawing from a conceptual framework which hypothesizes a temporal sequence for persons who are in psychological distress, this paper focuses on two problems faced by chronically mentally ill (CMI) Hispanics in need of clinical services: (1) barriers in seeking follow-up clinical services upon discharge from a psychiatric hospital; and (2) barriers to effective psychiatric treatment. The research upon which the report is based compared data collected in a survey of residents of the Fordham Tremont area of the Bronx, New York City (the community sample), with data from all persons receiving services in November 1982 at Continuing Care, a mental health clinic for CMI patients from the same neighborhood. It was found that most Hispanics who underutilize mental health services do so  because they do not recognize or acknowledge symptoms, while a smaller number acknowledge emotional problems but cannot get the services they need. Some evidence also was found for the existence of cultural and institutional barriers to the use of mental health services among Hispanics. Comparison of the community survey and clinic patient data also indicated that different Hispanic subgroups (recent immigrants, less acculturated) are less likely to seek treatment than are younger, better educated Hispanics, but more likely to persist in treatment and to have successful outcomes. Finally, instability in living arrangements was found to have a greater effect on clinical experiences than on utilization of mental health services. Based on these findings, this report presents extensive  recommendations for increasing the number of CMI Hispanics utilizing mental health services and for improving treatment for CMI Hispanics.

The functional goal of Project MAS, which was conducted at three elementary and one intermediate schools in the Bronx (New York), was to expedite students' acquisition of English language skills through specialized instruction in mathematics and science. Although the administrators of the four schools involved differed in their views of and approach to bilingual education, the program's director described its philosophy as developmental, one that promotes growth in both  languages. Title VII funds supported all administrative and support staff, in addition to five paraprofessionals. Instructional services were provided by tax levy and Title I personnel. Curriculum development efforts were geared to the sciences and instructional materials were developed for physics, biology, geology, and chemistry. In addition, the program provided staff development and parent involvement activities. Quantitative analysis of student achievement indicated that (1) students at most grade levels performed well and made significant gains in English and Spanish reading; and (2) in mathematics, a mixed pattern of gains and losses was evident. Recommendations for future program effectiveness focus on meetings among site principals regarding the goals of bilingual education and  the program philosophy, filling the position of science resource teacher, concentrating staff development activities on techniques for teaching language through mathematics and science, and providing more paraprofessional training activities that address the intermediate grade level.

The project's overall goal was to enable LEP students to progress in both academic subjects and in English proficiency through specialized academic training and special attention to the affective domain. Based on this goal, students studied their native language while learning English; they were mainstreamed gradually by increasing their exposure to English and decreasing the use of Spanish.

In addition, the program aimed to provide students with employment and job training awareness and opportunities. Based on these goals, each learning center offered a range of educational and support (career and college counseling) services. Another important program goal was to encourage staff participation in training and development activities, including curriculum development.

Analyses of the number of skills mastered showed that nearly all participants mastered at least one skill and 76 percent mastered three or more. There was a strong relationship between program attendance and student mastery. The program continued to implement recommendations from previous  cycles for early pre-planning and, in response to a recommendation from the 1982 evaluation, hired paraprofessional educational assistants to help with individualization of instruction. Finally, in a continuation of modifications made during the 1982-83 full-year program, assessment of student progress was linked to ongoing instructional planning, which was expanded to include activities of daily living skills and career education. For continued effectiveness of this program, it is recommended that paraprofessionals be hired for all sites where staff feel that the addition of paraprofessional support would improve program service.

Three items are needed to set up for telecommunications: the personal computer, the modem, and a communications (software) package. Potential uses of personal computers by adult educators include bibliographic and information searches; bulletin boards to share information and networks; a more sophisticated use of the bulletin board notion; and data transfer and communication. Adult educators can use bulletin board systems to communicate at the local, regional, or national levels. Adult education organizations can apply computer technology as an information delivery tool, a linkage between agencies, and an enhancement to  referral activities. Computers can also make easier a variety of administrative activities--budget planning, word processing, and data management. Implications related to telecommunication technology for adult educators are a need for information dissemination, a need to develop a linkage to commercial vendors of hardware and software, and a need for a national commitment to provide for computer literacy.

        "description":"General principles of planning tailor-made change strategies arise directly from the CLER (configurations, linkages, environments, resources) model, a model of planned change, as well as from the value assumptions in which the model is embedded. These principles include the following: change requires commitment, planning and management of change requires knowledge, and an invitation to change should be an invitation to total system renewal. Other principles are: that a change planner must think in terms of systems and dialectics; and that a change planner should consider the whole ensemble of the changer, the change, and the changed. Furthermore, change is often defined in the process of implementation. In planned change, description must precede prescription. Descriptions of  change-relevant systems should be tested in the real world. Strategic prescriptions should arise from tested descriptions, and power is the essence of all strategy. CLER, a systematic and dialectical model of innovation diffusion and planned change, suggests that innovation diffusion or planned change is a function of four variables: configurations, linkages, environments, and resources. The CLER model suggests that the probability of occurrence of a change event can be increased through a synergetic optimization of these four variables. (YLB)",

Distribution data for the study were obtained from responses to questionnaires from 22 of the 32 states with products accepted by the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) during calendar year 1982. Next, telephone interviews were administered to 55 recipients of the Dissemination and Utilization (D&amp;U) Program of the National Center for Research in Vocational Education (NCRVE). Finally, impact data were obtained from six sites in West Virginia where two NCRVE-developed entrepreneurship training products were being used. These three data collection efforts, which resulted in a rather positive  picture of R&amp;D product impact, confirmed that R&amp;D effectiveness can indeed be documented; however, such documentation turned out to be expensive. To keep documentation costs to a minimum, researchers were urged to plan utilization and impact studies carefully, to ensure that questions in such surveys be relevant to the purposes at hand, and to make certain that study respondents are key audiences who are in a position to resolve the problems under investigation. (Appended to this report is a conceptual framework for assessing impact.) (MN)",

During the formative evaluation, researchers administered exit interviews to 49 students completing the 10-week pilot test of CPS and asked the 7 teachers at the 5 pilot test sites to complete instructor logs. Summative data were gathered through two evaluation instruments: data regarding the impact of the CPS materials were obtained via the administration of pre- and posttests to students in  experimental and control groups, and data concerning the teachers' assessments of the programs' overall quality were elicited through a five-point rating scale that was included on the instructor log. Students and teachers alike found the microcomputer version of CPS interesting, enjoyable, and usable. The pre- and posttest scores of the experiment group further attested to the effectiveness of CPS. (Copies of the evaluation instruments used are appended.) (MN)",

        "description":"An 18-month project was conducted to adapt the resource room version of the National Center for Research in Vocational Education's Career Planning System (CPS) for delivery through microcomputers. Specific goals of the project were as follows: to adapt a print-based product previously found successful with middle school students who displayed mild forms of one of several disabilities, to evaluate the use of that adapted version with a representative sample of such students at sites across the country, to revise the materials on the basis of the evaluation results, and to initiate a plan for the national dissemination of the final revised version of the materials. After selecting the Atari 800 microcomputer system with 64K of random access memory as the delivery system for the  revised version of CPS, project staff converted the instructional elements of the earlier version, along with management and record-keeping functions, into a 30-disk package. Various other printed materials, including instructor's and student's guides, were developed for use with the revised system. Based on the results of a field test of the revised CPS that was conducted at five sites throughout the country, it was concluded that middle school students from a variety of special populations found the system interesting, enjoyable, and usable. Students in the aggregated experimental group gained more knowledge concerning career planning than did students in the aggregated control group. Recommendations called for wide dissemination of the revised CPS among different populations at a wide  range of grade levels. (MN)",

The first part of the paper discusses the need for a pretechnical curriculum in terms of a model for self-empowerment. Addressed in the next two chapters are employer and employee needs in the labor market of the future and criteria for curricular decisions. Next, the concepts of personal and occupational transitions are examined, and a model for handling transitions is provided. Covered in the next chapter, the largest section in the report, are the need for developing problem-solving skills, a model for solving problems, strategies for developing higher  order problem-solving skills, skills for use in developing logical and critical thinking skills, and the role of interpersonal skills in the group problem-solving processes. The final chapter is an implementation guide that presents strategies for fusing generalizable, transition, and problem-solving skills in pretechnical and technical education courses to prepare students for entry-level jobs, training programs, or retraining programs.

A questionnaire dealing with six factors currently stressed in vocational educational programs and five factors that should possibly be stressed was mailed to the following groups, which the study population comprised: 31 members of the State Advisory Council for Vocational Education in Illinois; 21 directors of regional career guidance; 60 state-level staff in adult, vocational, and technical education; 45 teacher educators; 451 representatives (administrators, teachers, and students) from comprehensive high schools; 242 representatives from area vocational schools; 466 representatives from  junior colleges; and 115 business and industry representatives. In all, 1,019 individuals (71.2 percent) completed the questionnaire. The respondents felt that affective job, technical, and occupational survival skills currently receive the most emphasis in vocational education, followed by job search, basic, and entrepreneurial skills. With respect to those factors that should be emphasized, affective job and occupational survival skills were mentioned most frequently, followed by job search, basic, and technical skills.

Fifty-eight staff members of the Department fo Adult, Vocational, and Technical Education (DAVTE) of the Illinois State Board of Education were asked to write a profile for a student who had just graduated from high school. Half (29) of the staff were asked to discuss the skills, knowledge, and attitudes that students should have in order to get a job. The other half of the staff were asked to discuss the skills, knowledge, and attitudes that students should have in order to go on for further training. Using a content analysis approach, the researchers identified 11 major skill areas that were  mentioned in the profiles. These included basic, computer, communication, entry-level job, interpersonal, job search, and occupational survival skills as well as knowledge of the world of work, positive attitudes toward learning and work, and possession of a tentative career plan. Because the majority of outcomes identified by the DAVTE staff were the same for both groups of students, differing primarily in the priority of the individual outcomes, it was concluded that the same high school program would be appropriate for both types of students providing it were designed so that students would obtain all the outcomes identified.

Vocational education outcomes are those that occur specifically as a result of a vocational education program. The processes and criteria used to identify outcomes of vocational education programs vary with the purpose of the study. Criteria used in followup studies appear to be legislative requirements and information needs of a particular audience. Studies that focus on the identification of vocational education outcomes provide somewhat more information on actual processes used to identify the outcomes. Surveys and working conferences have been used to gain input from representatives of education and business and  industry on appropriate outcomes. The literature that identifies vocational education outcomes can be divided into two categories: outcomes that have been identified and assessed in followup studies of vocational and/or nonvocational graduates and outcomes that have been identified as major vocational education outcomes in studies that focus on the process of identifying and assessing outcomes. Outcomes that have been assessed vary by study but generally include knowledge, skills, and attitudes. (YLB)",

The initiative, which is based on the premise that the private sector has a keen interest in the promotion of literacy, encourages cooperative efforts by the public and private sectors as well as the recruitment of literacy volunteers. Through the National Institute of Education, the Department of Education will establish the National Adult Literacy Project--a program that will identify model literacy programs and develop and test new literacy materials. To utilize untapped student resources, the Department of Education  plans to launch a pilot program in which college work-study students will be employed to teach adults how to read. College students and federal employees alike will be encouraged to serve as literacy volunteers. In addition, the Adult Literacy Initiative will encourage literacy efforts from the following segments of society: state and local officials, minority communities, special education groups, and groups serving disabled persons.

The issues and concerns that surrounded the early development and expansion of vocational education are first discussed. The preferred practices--the principles--are then developed in three categories. &quot;Principles and People&quot; includes the topics of guidance, lifelong learning, needs, open to all, placement, sex bias/stereotyping, special needs, student organizations, teachers, and work ethic. &quot;Principles and Programs&quot; presents these principles: career education, comprehensive education, curriculum, families of occupations, innovation, job entry, safety, and supervised occupational experience. &quot;Principles and Processes&quot; includes the topics of advice seeking, articulation and coordination, evaluation,  followup, legislation, planning, and research. Basic philosophic concepts in education are reviewed and summarized--the essentialist, the pragmatist, and the existentialist viewpoints. Each philosophy provides a generalized response to four fundamental questions regarding the nature of the learner, teacher's role, curriculum, and role of schooling. The same questions are used to derive a philosophic position for vocational education. The principles of vocational education are used to provide a response to these issues, and the responses are compared. A philosophic position derived through inductive processes results. (YLB)",

It begins by differentiating between keyboarding and typewriting and establishing the criteria for making decisions regarding appropriate content and methodology. A discussion of content in teaching focuses on determination of activities performed by employed and personal-use typists and suggests an outline for typewriting courses. Two sections then present a number of suggestions for introducing the keyboard and for improving the skill of production typists. A recommendation contrasting what should be happening in the classroom with what has traditionally taken place is followed by a brief  explanation. Individualization of learning and the possible advantages and disadvantages of individualized programs are then considered. The discussion of grading examines reliability and validity of measurement instruments, the three most commonly used methods of the grading of keyboarding, evolving grades from separate speed and accuracy scores, the grading of production typewriting, and combining grades to determine a terminal performance grade. Criteria are also offered for selecting textbooks and microcomputer software. An appendix lists sources of instructional materials. (YLB)",

        "description":"To determine why some persons leave the university while others remain in the student role, a study compared a group of 44 university students aged 60 and over with a group of 50 ex-students of the same age. The two groups were comparable in age, education, sex, and income. The ex-students stayed at the university a significantly shorter time (2.5 years) than the students (4 years). Both groups felt accepted at the university and felt supported in the student role by faculty, students, and relatives and friends. The ex-students left primarily after reaching their objectives; a large proportion became employed. The continuing students planned on remaining at university indefinitely, even after obtaining their degrees. Findings indicated that the groups of older students and  ex-students appeared to differ only in the length of time spent at the university and in their employment status. However, for one group the student role acted as a means to meeting other objectives, while for the other it was an end in itself. Moreover, leaving the student role was not difficult for the one group while it appeared inconceivable for the other. (Four tables are attached.) (Author/YLB)",

Speakers from both the public and private sectors shared their expertise in various areas affecting vocational education. Focus of the papers and panel discussions presented during the conference was on the following topics: the possible impact of the international and domestic business environment on vocational education, the future role of the federal government in vocational education, the future role of state and local governments in vocational education, the impact of technological advancement on vocational education, and the advantages of a closer alliance between vocational education and business. Conference participants provided explanations of past and  current trends in vocational education policy, practical speculation on the direction of those trends in the future, and possible responses to those trends.

        "description":"A model was proposed whereby students enrolled in a four-year program in vocational home economics would be given instruction in computer literacy using an integrated rather than a course or unit approach. The model called for identification of the competencies and skills necessary for computer literacy, determination of how students can obtain the competencies, identification of existing courses into which instruction in the competencies can be integrated, development of units of instruction for the courses, selection of software, and field testing and revision of the materials. The model addressed the following student competencies: demonstrate a basic understanding of how computers work; experience the use of computers in a variety of subject matter applications; analyze the  sociological and psychological impacts of computers on various segments of the school and community sectors; and apply computer technology in generating new ideas, creating new products, and solving problems. (This paper comprises a brief narrative description of the model, a flow chart outlining the model, a list of computer literacy skills organized according to courses into which they can be integrated, a practicum, a software evaluation form, a microcomputer experience, an opinion form dealing with computers in education, assignment sheets, and a list of uses of computers in home economics education programs.)

Felt needs are self-defined wants or desires which, when expressed, suggest an unmet need and a means of gratification or imply ultimate goals. A normative need refers to a deficiency between the present state of affairs and some criterion. Comparative needs arise when an individual or group is not receiving a service others in a similar situation are receiving. Different types of needs have been identified, including motivational and prescriptive, felt and expressed, and subjective and objective. Scissons proposes a typology of educational need based on three need components (reliance, competence, and motivation) and two categories  (wants and complex needs). Methods of assessing educational needs include Tuomisto's social demand method, investment in educational method, and manpower method and McKinley's individual self-fulfillment models and system discrepancy models. Adult educators generally use the terms \"need\" and \"demand\" synonymously, but the existence of an educational \"need\" may not necessarily imply the existence of \"demand\" for education. Neoclassical theory of consumer behavior can be used to show that demand for continuing education arises when the student participates in the continuing education program. (YLB)",

        "author":["Gasser, Judith G."],
        "description":"Since the time of E. B. Huey (1908), there have been clear indicators that oral language as a reflection of a child's linguistic ability has been clearly related to his or her reading achievement or comprehension. P. McKee (1937) and W. S. Gray (1937) both speculated that reading difficulties might parallel language deficiencies. G. Hildreth (1949) saw &quot;linguability&quot; as critical to the reading process. R. W. Shuy (1969) called for a new system of language arts instruction based on the child's language facility. Following E. L. Thorndike's study (1917), which found that reading comprehension was influenced by the relation of elements within a sentence, other researchers have found much the same evidence. Even with direct relationships established, researchers throughout the  decades have found distinct differences between speech and reading modes. Nevertheless reading specialists have continued to stress the critical importance of oral language to reading acquisition. A number of researchers have all stressed the absolute necessity of basing reading instruction on strong oral language development. Nonetheless, coming decades will have to resolve many unanswered questions, such as: What skills are essential to oral language growth? Are quantity and quality synonymous with general language ability? and, Is there a hierarchy of language skills? Until these questions are addressed, reading theorists have a good way to go before a language-based reading model may be developed. (HOD)",

          "Tierney, Robert J."],
        "description":"Addressing the question of how schools and teachers can foster an advanced level of reading awareness among secondary students, this paper focuses on the similarity in language used to describe recent research on both the composing process and comprehension as acts of constructing meaning. It presents a perspective on the reading/writing relationship, and argues that the thoughtful reader is one who reads as if composing a text for yet another reader who lives within. The paper states that every speech act is an action, and that every speaker and every listener is trying to get the other one in the discourse to behave in a certain way. It is noted that this perspective implies that knowing why a speaker said something is just as important as knowing what was said, and that  this--in conjunction with readers monitoring their own comprehension--indicates that reading should be viewed as an act of composing. In this composing model of reading, the paper argues, there are key authorial roles a thoughtful reader must play: planner, composer, editor, and monitor. It also describes strategies teachers can use in the classroom to promote thoughtfulness to self (a role that encourages students to become better at drawing essential inferences from texts), thoughtfulness to an author, the suspending of judgment, and critical reading.

        "description":"A transactional investigation of reading considers comprehension to be more than the duplication of the author's message. Rather, it entails the readers' interpretation of the textual representation that he or she has constructed. Thus, researchers must ask how the reader duplicated the author's creative role. The goal, in other words, is to investigate the processes that give rise to the reader's interpretation. This can be done through an ethnographic mode of inquiry. Ethnographies permit the researcher to study all that the reader brings to reading such as attitudes, interests, and instructional history, as well as the definition the reader ascribes to the event as a whole. Ethnographies also allow for open-ended attitudes--hypotheses that are not formulated a priori, but  instead are generated and revised in the course of field work. Furthermore, ethnography, like reading, is itself a transactional process. Not unlike reading, beliefs and actions are pulled from the stream of experience so that they may be evaluated and developed. Thus, ethnographies permit a mode of inquiry that is commensurate with a transactional definition of reading comprehension. (HOD)",

The first section, intended to provide a clear example of personal memory, examines a hypothetical episode in the life of an undergraduate student, and shows how one episode can give rise to three different forms of memory: personal, semantic, and rote linguistic. The second section develops a &quot;botany&quot; of important naturally occurring forms of memory and contrasts descriptions of six types of memory (personal, semantic, generic perceptual, motor, cognitive, and rote linguistic) with the traditional distinction between episodic and semantic memory. The third section decomposes the important naturally occurring types of memory and attempts to construct a table of the logically possible types of  human memory. It organizes human memory in terms of the types of inputs and types of acquisition conditions and proposes an account of the possible forms of memory representation in terms of the intersections of these two factors. The final section relates the initial botany of memory to a more analytic classification scheme and discusses the mental processes involved in transferring information from procedural memory to semantic memory and the problem of the veridicality of mental images.

Following a brief introduction to the project, the paper presents an example of writing produced by a sixth grade student in a classroom that used QUILL. It then provides a linguistic analysis of the example, highlighting several anomalies that could lead readers to dismiss the writing as &quot;bad.&quot; The paper next examines the social context in which the writing was produced and explains how this perspective can provide an explanation for the apparent anomalies. It further shows  how the writing process is reflected in the writing product, but not revealed by an analysis of that product alone. In conclusion, the paper points out that while programs such as QUILL can enhance the learning of reading and writing by providing new techniques for teaching and learning, they can also produce profound changes in a classroom's social structure.

Specifically, the study examined whether providing college students with materials containing textually important information underlined would improve test performance for those materials. Approximately 100 students were arranged into three separate experimental groups. Those in the first group were told to concentrate on knowing the underlined portions of a text and were told that by focusing their study time on those portions they might do better on a  test to follow. Students in the second and third groups were instructed to read and study the text as they normally would when preparing for an examination. No mention was made of underlining. Following the reading, each student completed a reading comprehension test and a test of language skills. Results indicated that students given relevant information underlined in the text did not obtain higher scores on the comprehension test than students who had unmarked texts. However, students provided with underlined text spent less time preparing for the subsequent test, and this effect was found to be independent of comprehension skills. (FL)",

Their stated instructional base and theoretical orientations were measured using the Theoretical Orientation to Reading Profile (TORP). Data were collected from video tapes and their transcriptions and from teacher journals. The results were analyzed using these questions as guides: On what unit of our language and linguistic system did the teacher focus the children's attention? What aspects of reading were emphasized? Was the reading material contingent on the student, teacher, or material? and,  What attitude toward reading specific text did the teacher encourage? Findings showed that in every category of observable data the teachers adhered closely to their theoretical model, and that, in diametric opposition to the instructional position of the skills teacher, the whole-language teacher focused children's attention on the largest unit of language suitable for the situation, encouraged the children to construct meaning sensible to them and their lives, permitted deviations from text in allowing miscues, involved children in planning, utilized library books and other texts, and encouraged children to &quot;think about and feel&quot; what they read.

The features illustrated are that (1) human plans are social, (2) human plans operate on interpretations, and (3) human plans are used, not just executed. Twelve students each from grades one, three-four, and six, and 12 college students were shown a videotaped skit in which one character deceives another. Many of the younger subjects considered the interaction to be cooperative, while older subjects understood that the deceiver was manipulating the victim's cooperative interpretation. A model of interacting human plans was incorporated in  a notation system that was used for displaying the structure of the alternative interpretations and their mutual embeddings. This notation system contained a key concept, mutual knowledge (or belief), that incorporates the essentially social features of human plans. Implications of the model of human plans for the development of social action and cognition are discussed. (Author/FL)",

Data consisted of archival and survey data obtained from 85 university affiliated medical schools for 1979. Media visibility scores for each medical school were developed by analyzing the content of two major classes of mass media--national news magazines and major metropolitan newspapers. Scores reflecting public relations efforts were developed using survey data obtained from medical school public information offices. Findings revealed that both school prestige and research productivity  had significant independent associations with media visibility. Contrary to expectations, public information efforts were found to have no significant independent relationships with or effect on media visibility. What these data suggest is that public relations efforts, defined as number of public information initiatives, may not be having an effect on national media coverage independent of the news value of the organization conducting the efforts.

Voice is expressed by such things as word choice, rhythm, sound, and juxtaposition of words and sentences. Moreover, the writer's attitude toward the subject is one aspect of the implicit set of assumptions and values that guide inquiry. Unfortunately, it is often this unheard voice--the unacknowledged feelings and attitudes--that inhibits the students' ability to become self-critical, analytic, dialectic, empathic, and synthetic. By considering voice as an important aspect of their writing, students can learn to distinguish among attitudes that convey negative or positive functions.  Through an analysis of their own writing, students can discuss and discover what feelings are being expressed. By being fluent in the dialogues of feelings, wherein attitudes and voices challenge and modify each other, the students' writing can become an orchestration of many voices offering more complex interpretations and fuller explanations.

One strength of the Fahnestock and Secor book is their opening discussion on thesis and support. They point to kinds of support and what can go wrong, specifically covering the needs to address feasibility and to anticipate refutations. In a subsequent chapter they cover the issues of ethos, voice, moderation, and disclaimers. The most important aspect of Flower's text is her emphasis on Rogerian argument. This stresses the  actual world necessity of compromise to achieve mutually satisfactory goals. Thus, both texts can be combined effectively in making assignments for proposals that are tailored to the students' interests: one classifies and functionally analyzes the types of argument, the other emphasizes achieving consensus and shared goals.

        "description":"A study examined the marketing differences between large chain newspapers and small chain and independent newspapers by analyzing differences in characteristics of the newspapers, patterns of circulation, economic and social conditions of the market, and competition from other print media. The 200 newspapers studied--113 large chain and 87 small chain and independent papers--came from 41 states. Statistical analysis revealed that some 21 of the 54 independent variables examined were significantly correlated with large chain newspaper ownership--five concerned newspaper characteristics, three circulation, five print media competition, three economic variables, and five social characteristics. The findings showed that large chain papers had a number of advantages over their  competition. They published in larger, more urban and more affluent markets with stronger magazine circulation and weaker circulation of outside Sunday papers. In addition, they managed to charge 14% more for subscriptions while publishing only 3% more issues per month. The results suggest that the real threat to newspapers does not come from the existing concentration of ownership, but from the continued absorption of independents by chains, from the subsequent absorption of small chains by large ones, and by the final absorption of large chains by corporate conglomerates. (A list of counties, cities, and states providing the studied newspapers is appended.) (FL)",

        "description":"To describe the largest division in the University of California (Los Angeles) writing program, this report focuses on placement and testing procedures, curricular principles, course descriptions and goals, and staffing concerns. The first part of the report discusses the components of the Freshman Writing Program--including the English Composition Requirements of the university and the Subject A Requirement (a university-wide minimal writing-ability standard) and the methods of completing these, the Freshman Summer and Preparatory Progrms, and the Honors Collegium. The curricular principles next described include teaching students to write the kind of discourse that is central to academic inquiry, building writing assignments on the kinds of materials students encounter at the  university, relating writing assignments sequentially, and presenting the students with challenging writing curricula. The paper then goes on to discuss the courses for English 1, 3, and A, giving detailed sample curricula for each, and describing the Freshman Preparator Program Curriculum, the Project Workshop, and the Cross-Disciplinary Theme-Centered Course. Finally, the staffing of the programs, staff development, and program development are described. The 5 appendixes of this document include explanations of the Subject A Requirement, detailed syllabi and sample lessons for courses, and a syllabus for English 495A and B--Supervised Teacher Preparation.

        "description":"A testing procedure used by J. W. Getzels and M. Csikszentmihalyi (1964) to gauge the relationship between problem finding and creativity in art students was employed in a study designed to determine if the same relationship existed in writers. Subjects were middle school students identified as either creative or noncreative by two separate measures and by their teachers. Eight creative and eight noncreative students identified in this manner were matched according to sex, grade, and IQ. Each student was asked to produce a piece of writing based on 15 objects placed on a table. They were told to use any or all of the objects and to arrange them as they wished. Two sets of evaluators judged the resulting writing on a variety of criteria, including the number of objects touched,  the nature of the arrangement, the exploratory behavior exhibited by the subject, the amount of time spent writing, the total amount of time spent on the task, writing fluency, how the subject had changed the reality of the objects, and how their perspectives had changed. Results indicated that the creative students touched and manipulated more objects, chose more unusual objects, spent more time prewriting, and seemed to see more relationships between objects as measured by changes in the object reality variable than did noncreative students. These findings suggest that the attempt to understand a deeper structure in the relationship among objects and in how they occur has an effect on the originality of writing. (FL)",

        "description":"A coding scheme developed by M. A. K. Halliday and R. Hasan was used in a study that investigated how students in grades 4, 6, and 8 developed meaning within narrative texts. Students, after being presented with a visual stimulus, were asked to describe what was happening and say what happened before and after the picture. Next, an oral assignment closely paralleled the written, with a picture as a stimulus and information concerning role, audience, and setting. Each communication unit in the texts was coded to determine instances of the number of ties per communication unit, cohesive items within the text, type of cohesive tie, distance between cohesive items and the direction of the tie, and presupposed items. Among the findings were the following: (1) at all grade levels,  lexical cohesion occurred more frequently in the written narratives than in the oral; (2) for narratives written in grades 4 and 6, lexical cohesion accounted for over 50% of the total number of ties produced; (3) students in grades 4 and 6 used a higher percentage of reference ties in their oral than in their written narratives while students in grade 8 reversed this trend; (4) the percentage of conjunctive ties remained relatively stable throughout the three grades except for a sharp decline in their use in the grade 8 written samples; (5) both substitution and ellipsis occurred infrequently; and (6) the narratives with the highest number of ties per communication unit were produced by eighth graders, while those with the lowest number of ties per communication unit were produced by  fourth graders.

        "description":"To develop a theory of invention that would include both generation and selection of material for written composition, the four major current theories of invention were considered. Since only one--prewriting--included a selection component and was limited in several ways, a psychotherapeutic theory--focusing--was adapted to the composing process in accordance with the principles that underlie adequate rhetorical theories. The resulting theory, which focuses on the composition process, was field tested to extend and refine it and to develop methods for its use in a wide variety of writing situations. The theory and methods enabled writers to generate and select material through a single coherent and widely adaptable procedure. Five patterns for different kinds of writing--i.e.,  personal narratives, literature, assigned subjects, comparison/contrast and other essay development types, and persuasion--were developed.

        "description":"Good and poor explanatory essays of 40 college freshmen were analyzed for 18 cohesive ties and chains to determine the appropriateness of the cohesion system for teaching and evaluating writing. The questions that were specifically addressed were, (1) How do writers use the cohesive resources of the language? and (2) How is cohesion related to teachers' perceptions of writing quality? The analysis revealed that the density of ties and length of chains increased disproportionately to the length of essays. A review of individual specimen essays suggested that greater variety and maturity of lexical choice characterized the good essays. Poor essays had frequent pseudochains--long strings of common high-frequency words bearing very little semantic import. Most good and poor essays  had a dominant chain connecting several paragraphs. The findings suggest that the cohesion system lacks content and domain selection validity to be appropriate as an evaluation scheme. The system could be used in instruction by a teacher at the point of responding and suggesting revisions, but not as the central emphasis of instruction. (HOD)",

The models were three different formulations of gratifications sought/obtained discrepancies--two emphasizing gratifications obtained and one expectancy-value model. Two of the models also contained evaluation components in an effort to determine whether inclusion on these components increased the predictive powers of gratification models. Subjects, 178 college students, completed a gratifications sought scale concerning television in general, and a gratifications obtained scale concerning each respondent's most frequently watched evening news program. After a two-day period, the  subjects completed evaluations of gratifications obtained from television news in general. In addition, the subjects completed a satisfaction scale dealing with television news. Taken as a whole, the findings provided support for a combined expectancy-value/gratifications obtained approach to explaining and predicting media satisfaction. Direct comparison of several theoretical models was found to be particularly useful in exploring the strengths and weaknesses of the different formulations. (FL)",

        "description":"&quot;Breadth of perspective&quot; is a significant concept for definition of public goals, especially in line with the two-way symmetric model of public relations practice. The concept involves four components: (1) awareness that more than one definition, stand, or conclusion is possible and is probably accepted as valid by significant persons or groups; (2) awareness that there are, in all probability, differences between one's own position or definition and that of other people; (3) an inclination to take others' views into account when making and carrying out communication decisions; and (4) knowledge of arguments and their ramifications that support viewpoints opposed to one's own. So defined, &quot;breadth of perspective&quot; has roots in a number of disciplines and research traditions,  including symbolic-interactionist sociology, personality theory within social psychology, political science, and communication. Three studies have shown partial determinants and implications of breadth of perspective. These include a survey of working journalists, a study of the public relations posture of osteopathic medicine, and a general-population survey relating to three political issues in Ohio. Breadth of perspective is important in public relations because it is in line with the libertarian heritage; it can lead, under many circumstances, to productive, flexible, innovative behavior and output; and it can help articulate and add substance to the two-way model of public relations practice.

        "description":"In focusing on the epistemology of journalism, this paper seeks to determine how reporters, particularly investigative reporters, know what they know. It begins by distinguishing between the validity of knowledge claims and their everyday justification, assuming the latter to be the proper focus for a phenomenological study of what passes as knowledge among journalists. The paper then examines the investigative process as practiced by a distinguished reporter, and concludes that although the process may verify knowledge claims it does, by increments, justify the telling of a story that embodies those claims. It recounts the phases of justification: (1) a tip is selected if it may lead to a potentially productive investigation; (2) evidence is collected, not to prove the story but  to justify the assembly of a story that can be further scrutinized; and (3) the story is tested by assembly to determine if the components validate each other and the story. The paper suggests that if a story, once assembled, cannot be disconfirmed, it emerges from the process as fully justified. The paper concludes that it does not seek to promote the process of justification as the best model for investigative reporting, but rather presents the process as a practical human achievement and a workable procedure for accomplishing practical tasks.

From the significant amount of convergence in the findings of the studies, the paper concludes that what researchers are learning is not only an interesting picture of children's  early writing development, but a valid one.

        "description":"Letters to the editor, one of the major ways citizens can respond to, and possibly even influence, public policy decisions, are good examples of public discourse. Those who take the time to write guest editorials or letters to the editor hope to go beyond self-expression to communication. They hope to influence the beliefs and attitudes, and even the actions, of others--to change minds. And yet, relatively few letters achieve this aim. Whatever their intent, the effect of many letters is to build not bridges but walls. Too often letter writers present a one-sided point of view and fail to empathize with those with whom they disagree. Or, writers are unwilling or unable to see beyond their own value and belief systems, making open debate of crucial issues both difficult and  time-consuming. Another problem is writers' failure to adequately consider the assumptions and values of their audience. There are no simple solutions to problems as complex as these, especially since each letter is and ought to be unique. Nevertheless, there are three principles that, if followed, can lead to more effective communication: (1) consider audience and purpose carefully; (2) ground the argument, when possible, in assumptions or values shared by the audience; and (3) be specific, concrete, and--when relevant and appropriate--personal.

An overview of the needs and instructional preferences of such students grew out of a larger project being conducted on the subject at Seattle University, which showed that adults seem to prefer (1) a problem solving focus, (2) practical learning experiences, (3) learning that is incorporated into existing experience, (4) an individual approach to instruction, (5) teaching approaches other than lecture, (6) grades that are based on more than tests, (7) a variety of ways to meet course requirements, and (8) instructors who are interested in their progress, who are relaxed and informal in class, and who have a realistic view of their students' outside duties. Other  studies show that successful literature programs for adult learners feature innovative scheduling and packaging, variety in methods of instruction, and a high degree of individualization. This may involve materials modified for particular students, selection of materials relevant to the students' own lives, or adoptation of existing materials. Many of the general principles used with literature classes seem equally effective for writing courses. Nontraditional students seek practical writing competencies. They are more interested in technical writing, including resume writing, writing compositions, writing reserch papers, and research design and proposals, and are more likely to enroll in shorter courses that stress essential writing skills. Some problems these students have in writing  are lack of advance planning, organization, and sense of purpose in organization. (CRH)",

        "description":"A response to a piece of student writing will be most effective if it helps students consciously identify and solve their composing problems, stimulates them to use the response, and helps them to transfer these practiced skills. Furthermore, the response should (1) take place during the process of writing rather than after a piece is completed, (2) be substantive and text-specific rather than purely evaluative and generalized, and (3) be positive and encouraging in tone. By definition, response involves interaction in the same way that conversation involves interaction. If the recipient of the response, in this case the writer, does not hear or read and understand the response to his or her writing, the response cannot be effective. Further, if the writer rejects the response,  if it does not serve any function for the writer, then the response is likewise not an effective part of the teaching-learning dialogue. Thus, in evaluating response, it is important to look at whether the writer listens to and understands the response and then at whether the response functions constructively in the learning process.

After defining a focus unit as an instructional sequence in which literature is used both as a rich natural resource for developing language and thinking skills and as the starting point for diverse reading and writing experiences, the first chapter of the book describes the basic components of a focus unit model. The second chapter identifies the theoretical foundations of this model, and the third chapter presents seven categories of questions used in the focus units to guide comprehension and composition or narrative. The remaining 14 chapters provide examples of the  model as translated into classroom practice, each including a lesson plan for development, a description of its implementation, and a bibliography of texts. The units cover the following subjects: (1) animals in literature, (2) the works of authors Roger Duvoisin and Jay Williams, (3) the world around us, (4) literature around the world, (5) themes in literature, and (6) fantasy.

        "description":"Generally, there are three kinds of software that could be used in college writing courses: word processing programs, interactive questionnaires, and text parsers. Although the benefits of these programs are well known, they still pose some problems. Word processors, for example, have been designed to &quot;process&quot; existing text; few have been designed to meet the needs of online composing. The problem with interactive questionnaires is that the text is fixed, while the problem with text parsers is their inability to analyze content. A software package that hopes to solve these problems and provide the teacher with the means to create computer based aids, prompts, and exercises is A Computer Composing Educational Software System (ACCESS). Among its features are a number of exercises  already designed and written by and for composition teachers. Teachers might borrow an exercise and adapt it to a particular class and students. Or, they might create exercises such as entering sample texts that students could react to in writing. When teachers sit down to create such exercises, they can choose from nested menus. The first menu, for instance, offers exercises for prewriting, drafting, or revision aids, or drill and practice. Although ACCESS is in large part already programed, it still awaits debugging and testing. (HOD)",

Black students in 20 undergraduate speech classes completed questionnaires eliciting information about their media use, attitudes toward Jesse Jackson, and the campaign in general. Results indicated that students preferred television over newspapers as information sources, with 52% identifying themselves as light readers and only 20% describing themselves as light television viewers. Data also showed that student interest in the Jackson campaign was high, and that attitudes toward him  were not rigidly predetermined on the basis of identification with an articulate, attractive black politician. There was, however, considerable student uncertainty about Jackson's position on four campaign issues, which is the possible explanation for the failure to find any relationship between media use and the acceptance or rejection of propositions regarding his position on the issues.

        "description":"To illustrate decision making as negotiation, this report utilizes P. H. Gulliver's theories concerning negotiation and two case studies of decision making by cooperative labor-management Quality of Work Life (QWL) committees. Negotiation as joint decision-making is discussed and two models that are central to Gulliver's theories of processual negotiation are presented: a cyclical model of information exchange between the negotiation parties, and a developmental model that maps the progress of the negotiations, guiding them with eight conceptually distinct phases that may more or less parallel actual phases in time. The report describes two labor-management committees that are part of a QWL program established to improve both the quality of working conditions for municipal  employees and the services provided by city government. It then recounts the operating principles of the QWL program, its expansion, its committee based structure, and the consensus decision-making process it employed. A record of each committee meeting follows, with an abstract of the occurrences at each one. The first analysis section on negotiation as decision making concludes that Gulliver's theory presents little help in explaining why one committee acted successfully and a second inconclusively. The second analysis section concludes that the decision making of the successful committee may be viewed as negotiation because the committee built incrementally on a series of decisions made by the committee, consulted outside parties, and incorporated the diverse interests of different  organizational stakeholders in its operation.

The typology delineates four types of organizations: Type 1, \"traditional\" organizations, typically small-scale structures with low complexity; Type 2, \"mechanical\" organizations that are large scale, low complexity structures employing many people; Type 3, \"organic\" organizations that are small scale but characterized by high complexity and small numbers of employees; and Type 4, mixed mechanical/organic groups that are large scale, high complexity operations employing many people. Using existing data collected from 216 organizations employing public relations practitioners, a study investigated how public relations is related to the Hage-Hall typology of  organizational systems. Data analysis revealed that (1) Type 1 organizations were characterized by public relations practitioners who only rarely counseled management about public opinion toward their organization, and by public relations activities that were more centralized than in other organizations; (2) Type 2 organizations had less centralization of public relations functions than Type 1 groups; (3) Type 3 organizations were the only ones to place significantly less emphasis on holding press conferences and making formal contact with journalists; and (4) public relations practitioners in Type 4 organizations produced the least number of press releases, instead spending their time writing speeches, counseling management, and working with the news media.

The Conversation Self-Report Inventory (CSRI) was used to identify the satisfaction-oriented and commitment-oriented patterns of interviewers. In one encounter, the interviewer was instructed to gain the subjects' reactions to a proposed physical education course. In another encounter, the interviewer was instructed to gain a commitment from the subjects to sign up for the proposed course. Communication satisfaction was measured by a linear rating scale while commitment was measured using a  Thurstone-type instrument. Results showed that communication satisfaction was a function of communication responsiveness, regardless of the purpose of the encounter. Generally speaking, informative encounters produced more satisfaction than persuasive encounters. Behavioral commitment was also found to be a function of communication responsiveness. Both communication responsiveness and individual differences played a role in securing commitment from others. However, there was no support for the role of communicative purpose. It was concluded that the CSRI could be used to identify interviewers' communication patterns. (HOD)",

The study, in confirming operationalization validity, found that self-report measures correlated only slightly with observations of students' actual behaviors, while holistic impressions of competence were wholly consistent with the CCAI ratings. In addition, students' persuasive speech grades and instructors' impressions were found to correlate with the CCAI measure, adding to reification, or convergent validity. Elaboration validity analysis discovered that argumentativeness was unrelated to CCAI scores. However, a relationship existed between apprehension,  knowledge, and skill, lending credence to the idea that, along with judgments of behavioral appropriateness, impressions of communication competence are also based on perceptions of motivation and knowledge that manifest themselves in actual communication behavior.

Eight types of messages were composed concerning four social issues in order to assess the generalizability of any effects. The four issues were capital punishment, handgun control, nuclear weapons freeze, and establishing a universal national service program. To elicit salient attributes of the issues, 22 college students were asked to list both the positive and negative consequences of both having and not having each policy. The five most frequently mentioned positive and  negative attributes were arranged into 32 different message combinations. Next, 174 college students received the information in booklets that were presented as edited essays by other students. The subjects were guided through the four sections of the booklet, each containing a page-long summary of the topic and followed by one of the eight essays. Participants were asked to respond to two questions on their attitudes towards the issue, and the seven category scale ratings were combined into a single index. Results indicated that although essay ratings tended to vary as a function of message type, the pattern of effects was not consistent across issues. Furthermore, the relative \"goodness\" of messages did not correspond with relative effectiveness. (CRH)",

In approximately the 27th week of class, students were administered the Stanford Achievement Test (SAT) to assess their level of academic achievement in reading and mathematics. Students in the two classes did not differ in their levels of achievement. Four weeks later, students were orally administered the Measure of Elementary School Apprehension (MECA), which is composed of 20 Likert-type statements that assess students' levels of fear or anxiety associated with communication with others. Students' MECA  scores were correlated with their national percentile-rank achievement scores in reading and mathematics from the SAT.

Many kinds of information that the government has in its possession must be kept confidential to protect important public interests. For example, agencies often must withhold information to protect the privacy of innocent third parties, to maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets, to avoid the disclosure of information affecting national security, or to prevent interference with pending civil, criminal, or administrative investigations, and protect the identities of confidential sources involved in any of these types of investigations. Also, since many  agencies, in the course of operations, collect and maintain personal information about individuals, it is important to protect an individual's right to privacy. Senate Bill S.774 would amend the FOIA to correct the above problems and would allow agencies to charge a fair value fee for records containing commercially valuable technological information collected at public expense; establish more realistic time limits in processing requests; and establish guidelines for proper requests that would include limiting felons' requests, expediting journalists' requests, and limiting the scope of foreigners' requests.

        "description":"The rhetorical appropriateness of two of Shirley Chisholm's persuasive speeches on women's liberation were assessed using Afrocentric criteria for speech criticism developed by Molefi K. Asante (1979). The speeches addressed the controversy of whether the women's liberation movement was appropriate for women of minority cultures in the United States. The first speech, delivered to a predominantly white audience focused on women's rights from the standpoint of white American culture, while the second speech, delivered to a predominantly black audience, treated the issue from a black American cultural perspective. The application of Asante's criteria revealed that Chisholm's treatment of theme, audience, composition, speaker presence, and the speech components of style and emotion,  as well as appeal to folklore and memory of the past were quite positive. Chisholm's use of logic and indirection were questionable because she used early deductive reasoning and directness when inductive logic and indirection probably would have been more appropriate for any receivers who were uncommitted to women's rights. Chisholm's assets in both messages clearly outweighed her liabilities. Thus, Asante's criteria for evaluating black speakers have proved workable tools for measuring the rhetorical effort of Chisolm's persuasive communication in the two selected speeches. (HTH)",

        "description":"Mass communication researchers have largely ignored the role of audio media and popular music in the lives of children, yet the available evidence shows that children do listen. Extant studies yield a consistent developmental portrait of childrens' listening frequency, but there is a notable lack of programatic research over the past decade, one in which stereophonic and tape playback systems proliferated widely, FM music formats generated greater market stratification, and cultural markets for preteen-oriented entertainers became established. Children can usually name performers and musical genres they prefer. In addition, the social aspect of listening seems to cover several of the same functions as television viewing, including entertainment and passing the time, and has some  unique functions; for example, friendships may be established on shared musical taste. From song lyrics, young listeners may learn new vocabulary, ideas, and other life styles or world views. Usage and ownership patterns of audio equipment, children's accounts of their audio media use and perceptions, and sensitive analyses of textual significance of characters, actions, and atmospheres are logical areas to be explored in future investigations.

Subjects, 118 college students, completed an inventory that categorized each student as Mastery Responsive (opts to influence others), Flexible Responsive (adapts with conversation), or Neutral Responsive (detaches from the conversation). Each then made predictions about other students enrolled in the same course. The predictions were made either after an encounter with the subject of prediction, or without such an encounter. Data analysis showed significant, but not large,  gains in predictive accuracy following a communication encounter. Neutral Responsives gained the most from the encounters. Females did a better job of predicting in same-sex dyads, and males gained most in mixed-sex ones. The results can be interpreted in terms of a task/maintenance/likeness-bias theory of interpersonal sensitivity, which would account for the low-to-moderate and somewhat bizarre relationships reported in the sensitivity/communication literature.

(Journals were chosen as offering the most accessible research in this area). Although there is much anecdotal information on how to lecture, how to utilize small groups, and how to lead class discussions, there is very little information on what kinds of training teacher educators need to give teachers in these instructional strategies or what kind of training in these strategies is most effective. Researchers in the future, therefore, should give greater attention to individual difference variables to determine what students learn most effectively via each  instructional method. In addition, dependent variables will require comparable definitions and operationalization across studies. Researchers will also need to develop more sophisticated experimental designs and statistical techniques and recognize the need for situation specificity. Finally, several more variables should be examined, including teacher and student variables, teaching/learning process variables, and product variables. By following these suggestions, researchers will gain a better understanding of which teaching methods are most useful with various students under varying conditions.

        "description":"To suggest future research directions in the assessment area, a review was conducted of literature concerning teachers' classroom communication. Focusing first on the large body of research identifying behaviors or skills that lead to perceptions of teaching effectiveness and increased learning, the review then examined a smaller group of studies that describe measurement devices of communication skills of teachers and potential teachers. Results indicated that methods of identifying skills include job analysis, expert consensus, and correlation studies. In addition, the review showed that research examining teachers' daily activities consistently produces lists of behaviors, that the ideal but least practical method of assessment is naturalistic observation over long periods,  and that research could address accounting for interpersonal skills and affective style, among other concerns. Assessment instruments identified in the review were self-evaluation forms, written exams in various subject areas, evaluations of teaching performance by students and superiors, and assessment of communication performance by means independent of methods classes or student teaching situations. The findings suggest that assessment instruments are in the developmental stage, and that some of the areas future research could focus on include standardizing assessment criteria of student teachers, the validity of student assessment of teachers, and the availability of valid and reliable performance assessment techniques.

Approximately 1,200 children, aged 5 to 10 years, indicated their food preferences on a questionnaire consisting of binary choices between a sugared and less sugared food. Three days later, subjects viewed a videotape of a cartoon, interrupted by four advertisements--pairs of sugared food advertisements (with or without disclaimers added), pairs of filler advertisements, or pairs of counter advertisements. The filler advertisements were for nonfood items, the disclaimers applied specifically  to the sugared item advertised, and the counter advertisements were informational and motivational, suggesting that other foods are more nutritious. The subjects then repeated the questionnaire. The results indicated that children's food choices were significantly influenced by the advertisements they viewed. In the posttest, children who viewed only sugared food advertisements made less healthful food choices, while children who viewed counter advertisements made the most healthful food choices. Those who saw the sugared food ads with disclaimers made intermediate choices. (HTH)",

The teacher records his perceptions of the approach, noting successful strategies (such as differential approach in programing for students' behavioral and academic objectives) as well as unsuccessful strategies. In reassessing the method and theory of invitational education, the teacher educator suggests refinements in the  theory. (CL)",

Six mothers were trained to use the following techniques: first, the Model Procedure, which provides the response for the child to imitate; second, the Mand-Model Procedure, which elicits information the child already knows; third, the Time Delay Procedure, which allows the child time to initiate communication; and finally the Incidental Teaching Procedure, which uses the three previously trained techniques in a new situation. Training of each technique consisted of a lecture, a videotape, a handout, and homebased sessions featuring trainer feedback and audiotaped play sessions. Results indicated mothers successfully acquired the skills  but that maintenance and generalization of the skills may need to be specifically programmed. (Detailed data on one mother are provided).

A variety of standardized tests were administered and information was gathered about coping strategies and barriers to learning through an individually administered interview, informal assessment of work products, and data about students' use of time. Results of the psychoeducational assessments identified key variables distinguishing LD from non-LD Ss; sequencing and timed tasks; language abilities; and spelling, math, and reading achievement. LD Ss also exhibited a wider range of  subtest scatters but verbal conceptual abilities on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale were equal to control Ss'. LD Ss with the highest academic performance performed significantly higher than lowest performance LD Ss on 36 to 39 psychoeducational variables. LD Ss with highest academic performance had the best scores (compared with low performance LD and control Ss) on six variables measuring verbal conceptual ability. Among other findings were that LD Ss used university resources more than controls; that LD Ss reported greatest difficulty in performing in-class exams and papers, with the most difficulties in grammar, spelling, and neatness rather than in ideas and concepts; and that a wide range of problem areas and coping strategies were identified.

        "description":"Of the 15 substantive papers in this report, 12 focus on the use of the Kent Infant Development (KID) Scale with severely handicapped children. The KID Scale measures 252 behaviors usually developed during the first year of life in five domains (cognitive, motor, language, self-help, and social). It was successfully adapted to elicit reliable developmental information from mothers, teachers, nurses, therapists, and child care workers of 125 severely handicapped children. One paper describes studies (interjudge and test-retest) that examined the reliability of the scale, and focused on items that elicited agreement between two caregivers and those that failed to elicit such agreement in each domain. A further report describes studies that examined the scale's concurrent validity  with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and indicated (1) that high intercorrelations existed between the two measures and (2) that KID Scale developmental age estimates varied somewhat depending on the informant's relationship with the child. Additional analysis of the two measures supported findings noting similarity between developmental sequences of normal infants and severely handicapped children. A report on followup studies on KID scale results is followed by a summary of consultant and caregiver evaluations on the use of the KID scale with severely handicapped young children. The application of a sorting system based on KID Scale data to the formation of individualized program plans is addressed. The Kent Scoring Adaptation of the Bayley scales of Infant Development for  assessing severely handicapped children is proposed. Three concluding studies address the following topics: the reliability and validity of the Minnesota Child Development Inventory for assessing moderately handicapped primary students; the use of the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities to assess mentally retarded children; and consultant and caregiver evaluations of the Minnesota Child Development Inventory. An outline of dissemination activities by project contributors concludes the report. (CL)",

Questions focused on (1) whether or not group care was perceived as an alternative to sibling care or institutional placement; and (2) whether or not formal applications had been made or plans discussed with siblings. It was found that only five families (all urban) had made any formal plans for living arrangements. Almost 40% of urban parents wanted group home placement but had not made application. No rural parents had discussed plans with a potential caretaker; 58.8% were hoping that a sibling would provide care. Larger family size in rural areas suggested less  reliance on community resources. Elderly urban parents with small families tended to be undecided about future arrangements. In both rural and urban communities, younger, more educated parents were more willing to consider group home placement.

The sample consisted of a predominantly white, middle-class, suburban, midwestern school district. The developmentally handicapped students were mainstreamed into each of six normal classrooms for at least one period of each day. A sociometric nomination measure was used to obtain behavioral attribute profiles of the students which were then used to predict a psychometric measure of social distance. Mainstreamed handicapped students were not found to be more socially distant than their normal peers (p>.05). Factors analysis of the 20 behavioral attributes obtained four significant factors, three of which were  found to be significant predictors of classroom social distance, accounting for better than half the variance in social distance (R2=.54, P<.01). The three factors were described as (1) incompetent and unassertive, (2) positive active and assertive, and (3) passive and unassertive. The study concludes that social rejection in mainstreamed classrooms is more a function of perceived behavioral attribute factors rather than the developmentally handicapped label as such. (Author)",

Analysis of videotapes recorded in the child's home during informal play was performed in terms of communicative gestures. Results revealed that Ss used a very limited number of hand configurations, locations for signs, and hand and arm movements. Analysis of the gestures showed that there was a great deal of similarity in the components used by the three Ss. Ss presented consistent patterns in their gestures. Although the single gesture utterance was the most common communicative form, all Ss did combine gestures to form two-gesture utterances. Speech was infrequently used, and all Ss had larger gestural than spoken lexicons at 30 months. It was possible for elements in two gesture utterances and  word/gesture combinations to be produced simultaneously. The content of the utterances indicated that they were able to express the same semantic relationships as hearing children at a similar stage of language development. (CL)",

These cognitive structures are hierarchically organized in terms of highly inclusive conceptual clusters, under which are subsumed less inclusive sub-concepts. Implications center on issues of philosophy, curriculum (including that the most general ideas should be presented first, followed by progressively differentiated material), and classroom teaching (including that advance organizers, such as  illustrations, anologies, and concepts and terms already familiar to the learner should be used to strengthen cognitive structure and enhance retention of new information).

Empirical data are presented to verify that the language or system acting as a \"first language\" for hearing-impaired students in cognitive/academic stituations can be determined. Educational implications are discussed, including that hearing impaired students should be given the opportunity to demonstrate which of the potential languages are beneficial to them in learning academically-related skills. Four variables should be evaluated: (1) language and/or system of the caretaker; (2) onset date of exposure to sign language and/or systems; (3) degree of usable aided hearing ability; and (4) language and/or system demonstrated most effective for  learning cognitively demanding/context-reduced tasks.

        "description":"The availability and application of particular memory strategies by deaf children and adults was examined. In the first study, 20 younger (mean age, 6 years, 3 months) and 20 older (8 years, 8 months) children's use of rehearsal strategies was examined with a serial probe task. All four types of stimuli (animals, nonsense shapes, hands, print) elicited strong primacy effects in the serial learning curve, and overt labeling and gesturing during stimulus presentation. Findings suggest that the children tested were using appropriate rehearsal strategies. A subsequent free recall study with 60 third-, fifth-, and seventh-grade deaf children was designed to determine if children would spontaneously group items by semantic category during study and/or recall phases of the task. Results  showed that deaf children used semantic clustering and were able to enhance recall from instruction in categorization. A third study concerned deaf adults' use of categorization. Two bases for categorization were available: categories based on semantic meaning (e.g., foods, occupations) and categories based on formational similarity of signs (e.g., with signs for \"Train,\"\"Egg,\"\"Chair,\"\"Name,\" forming one group). While Ss were able to group items according to formational similarity when asked to do so, their spontaneous preference was to cluster by semantic meaning. This finding is parallel to studies with hearing people who virtually always favor semantic meaning to surface item features (e.g., rhyming words) as the basis or organization. Findings suggest that, while it may not be  neccessary to provide instruction in memory strategies per se, it may be useful to provide instruction that increases the extent to which deaf individuals (1) have conscious knowledge of the availability of strategies, (2) recognize under what circumstances the available strategies may be applied, and (3) organize material to allow the optimal application of these strategies.

One research area of special interest is research on environmental conservation and pollution abatement. Technical R&amp;D has been assigned a high priority. Government funds are channeled to collective research (i.e., research programs that are jointly financed by private enterprise and the government). The universities are used as much as possible for research commissioned by the official sectoral bodies, and to  some extent for research under contract to the business community. In addition, a number of independent, state-run research institutes exist.

The Department has criteria and procedures to determine which national, regional, and specialized accrediting agencies should be included on its list of recognized agencies. Accreditation is largely a means of conducting nongovernmental, peer evaluation of educational institutions or programs. Cases are cited in which accrediting agencies have used their status to advance certain ends of special  interest groups. It is noted that some accredited colleges have a loan default rate of 85 percent.

The question of whether there is access to graduate education is addressed. Attention is directed to the following concerns: the appropriate balance between undergraduate and graduate assistance; whether existing aid programs should be expanded to include graduate students or expanded to include more graduate students; what reasonable loan balances should be established for graduate and professional school students; and the impact of the federal government's efforts to expand access of minorities and women to graduate and professional education. Based on an Educational Testing Service study, it is suggested that some  graduate and professional students who borrow heavily for school may encounter substantial repayment burdens and that, as tuitions climb, it is likely that student borrowing will also increase. Additional areas of consideration include the management of loan repayments, graduate fellowships that are targeted for minorities, the effect of heavy debt burdens on career choices, and whether students are pursuing professional degrees that take a shorter time to complete and that promise a higher payoff.

Influences, such as college costs and personal attitudes, are briefly addressed. Data from the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey were used. Findings include the following: participation rates for the lowest income groups were down most sharply among black dependent students; participation rates of independent students have increased since 1969 for all groups except males (who show a decline); participation rates of women have been increasing during this  period; and participation rates for low income blacks were down, while rates for independent black students were up sharply. It is suggested that financial aid for the most needy students should be increased, particularly to correct for the effect of inflation. Competing requests for funds for middle income and academically talented students should be weighed against the national commitment to reduce financial barriers for the most needy. (SW)",

The 3-year project assessed the present educational approaches and developed recommendations to improve instructional programs and learning. Broad discussions were also stimulated among the medical school and college faculties and their disciplinary societies about medical and college education. Three working groups considered three major facets of the problem: (1) essential knowledge, (2) fundamental skills, and (3) personal qualities, values, and attitudes. To guide deliberations, charges were written for each working group and a series of assumptions and questions  arising from the assumptions were posed for each facet. Assumptions guiding the working group on essential knowledge covered such concerns as: information management technology, college science, broad baccalaureate education, biomedical science, and clinical disciplines. Assumptions dealt with by the fundamental skills group covered areas such as: skill development during college, skills during clerkshops and skills in the prevention of diseases. Concerns of the third working group had to do with personal growth and development, curiosity, competition, concern for patient welfare, and coping with emotional stress. A roster of the AAMC project panel and staff is included. (SW)",

        "description":"A theoretical framework for the process of faculty renewal in the 1980s was proposed, based on examination of the role of department heads as in-house agents of change for staff development. Support for the theory was sought using three empirical statements to test the relationship of department heads' manipulative orientation and social insight to the role and personal power attributed them by faculty. It was proposed that the greater the department head's social insight and persuasive tactics (Machiavellianism), the greater the power attributed them by faculty. A sample of 37 department heads and 276 faculty members were administered the Mach V for Machiavellianism, the Chapin Social Insight Test, and the Attributed Power Scales. The following variables were assessed: personal  leadership, teaching and curriculum logistics, faculty career status, control of extracurricular resources, research resources, extra compensation, and committee shared concerns. Based on the findings, it was concluded that the manipulative skill of department heads does affect the power attributed to them by faculty, but only in those areas of immediate concern to the career of the faculty member. Social insight alone appeared to have limited value in increasing the power of department heads except in teaching and curriculum logistics. (SW)",

Objectives that an institution should address are as follows: (1) to provide advisers with accurate and timely information about the policies, procedures, and processes that affect the advising relationship; (2) to provide advisers with additional skills often required in their advising responsibilities; (3) to increase student satisfaction with advising; (4) to increase adviser satisfaction with advising; and (5) to develop a comprehensive approach to academic planning as a part of the total advising process. The importance of assessing the commitment of the institution to the advising process is noted. In order to achieve the objectives, attention must be directed to selection and training  of faculty advisers, evaluation of advisers, and compensation or reward. Advising and student development can be conceptualized by levels and stages. The primary level involves information-giving about registration, graduation, and courses, while the professional level concerns more advanced areas, such as selection of majors or graduate schools. The next level involves the adviser's personal skills in recognizing student problems and making referrals. Stages of the advising process begin with the student's first contact. (SW)",

Eight accreditation criteria for a school's educational program and services are outlined: philosophy and objectives, organization, student personnel services, curricular program, cocurricular program, staff, school plant and physical facilities, and finance. Guidelines for self-study of the curriculum are also outlined. (SW)",

The following student outcomes were studied: achievement in general education, achievement in the major field, and opinion measurement concerning the quality of academic programs and services. Task forces recommended that student outcome information be included in the evaluative data gathered for the university's comprehensive  program review process. Changes in instruments, data collection/analysis, and interpretation of results were recommended before utilizing outcome information. The initiative has strengthened the academic program review process and stimulated increased use of outcome information in departmental decision-making as well as campuswide strategic planning and resource allocation.

Factors that differentiate persisters from those who withdraw were examined, based on findings of previous research on college dropouts and undergraduate career socialization. Comparisons were made of dropouts and program graduates on background and individual characteristics, pretraining experiences, commitments, social and academic integration, and outside integration (e.g., effect on children). The findings suggest that the models derived from research on traditional students can be appropriate for the  study of this nontraditional group. Program completion is linked to students' goal commitments and their integration into both the academic and nonacademic sectors of postsecondary educational institutions. The importance of being alert to the possibility that educational institutions are not encapsulated environments is also suggested by the findings that intrapersonal and extra-institutional integration are related to program completion.

Questionnaire data were collected to assess stability and change in students' images of qualities of \"most\" physicians and of \"effective\" physicians. Male and female students' images of practitioners were also compared. The analysis focused on three successive student cohorts of a small, combined bachelor's degree and medical school program. A response rate ranging from 90 to 98 percent was obtained for the three time periods: at the end of the first 2 years of study, after year 4, and after year 6. The data were assessed using profile analyses. The findings suggest that students' images of qualities of \"most\" and \"effective\"  physicians are transformed over time. At all time periods, most students see physicians as caring, but this conception declines slightly over time. While students initially see doctors as quite status conscious, at the second data collection this perception of physicians' status consciousness declines, and then increases as students approach graduation. This same pattern is found for another perception: physicians' concern with social issues. However, at all time periods, most students do not see physicians as strongly concerned with social issues.

Eighty-four sophomore medical students completed a critical incident report form at the end of an interviewing practicum session during which they were co-supervised, in groups of four, by a family physician and behavioral scientists. Working independently, 11 judges sorted the reports of effective and ineffective supervision behavior by physicians and behavioral scientists into 11 categories. Using joint proportion matrices and principal component analysis, source variables underlying the observed behaviors were identified. The  requirements for effective supervision by physicians were to model the physician's role, teach clinical problem solving, provide balanced feedback, suggest how to improve interviews, structure the task, prod critical thinking, and confront defensiveness. The supervision requirements for behavioral scientists were to teach interviewing and interpersonal skills, provide constructive criticism, discuss patient behavior, convey personal support, promote change, and facilitate group interaction.

A sample of the initial freshman classes of 1970 and 1971 were tracked over a period of 11 years. A total of 4,705 open admissions students were compared to 8,084 regularly-admitted students. Since CUNY's policy was designed to expand educational opportunity for disadvantaged minority groups, data were also assessed for four major ethnic constituencies that comprise the majority of CUNY's entering classes. Graduation data were compared for White ethnic groups (Jewish and White Catholic) and minority groups (Black and Hispanic). Data are presented separately for CUNY's four- and two-year colleges. It was found that in the senior  colleges, 34 percent of regularly-admitted students graduated after 4 years, and 62 percent needed 5 years or longer. Among open admissions students, only 16 percent earned diplomas after 4 years, but after 11 years 43 percent graduated. In the two-year community colleges, 45 percent of regular students and 28 percent of open admissions students completed their community college studies after 11 years. Additional time to graduate appeared especially important for CUNY's minority students. (SW)",

The average college tuition rate in Michigan is the highest in the nation, and a critical maintenance and equipment problem exists. The Commission is composed of knowledgeable persons without vested interests in higher education; more than half are graduates of Michigan colleges and universities. The Commission will seek input from every segment of the educational community in the following key areas: students, faculty, trustees, legislators, administrators, labor specialists, and corporate and philanthropic leaders. In beginning its study, the Commission reviewed previous reports that had been completed in the state during 1958-1980.  Five basic concerns framed the current report: improving the quality of higher education, increasing the accessibility and affordability of higher education, maintaining diversity and reducing unnecessary duplication, defining the role of colleges in promoting the state's economic revitalization, and defining and supporting the roles of different types of institutions. Areas of assessment include: instruction, research, access, school-business cooperation and economic development, and financial support for higher education. (SW)",

Approaches to selecting priorities for capital renewal and replacement are also covered, based on a systematic approach for policy decisions. The concept of grouping projects for cost effectiveness in the form of decision packages is introduced, along with a method for ranking priority levels of projects (i.e., necessary, suitable for reduction in scope and cost, or deferrable). In  reviewing methods for establishing annual levels of funding, attention is briefly directed to existing formula methods, life cycle concepts, and replacement methods. Also outlined are techniques for institutional fiscal analysis of resources allocated to capital renewal and replacement requirements. Sources of funding for renewal/replacement (annual budgets, external sources, and innovative techniques) are discussed, and ways to build constituencies and formulate policy are suggested. (SW)",

        "description":"Teaching and learning of the humanities at the baccalaureate level were assessed by a blue-ribbon study group of 31 nationally prominent authorities on higher education convened by the National Endowment for the Humanities. Some attention was also given in the context of the humanities to how secondary and graduate education have affected under-graduate education and been affected by it. Answers were sought to three basic questions: (1) What is the condition of learning in the humanities? (2) Why is it as it is? (3) What, if anything, should be done about it? The five sections of the report cover the following topics: (1) Why study the humanities? (2) How should the humanities be taught and learned? (3) How well are the humanities being taught and learned? (4) The role of  academic officials in strengthening the place of the humanities; (5) How colleges and universities might do a better job in transmitting the accumulated wisdom of our civilization. Four kinds of information aided discussion: (1) Descriptions of graduation requirements at 15 representative colleges and universities; (2) Reports by study group members on the humanities in secondary education, two year colleges, and graduate schools; (3) Papers by study group members recommending ways to improve teaching and learning in the humanities; (4) Data from several national studies and surveys pertaining to undergraduate education and to the humanities in general. It is noted that over the past 20 years, the place of the humanities in the U.S. undergraduate curriculum has eroded and the overall  coherence of the humanities curriculum has declined. To reverse the decline, the report recommends the following: (1) The undergraduate curriculum should be reshaped based on a clear vision of what constitutes an educated person, regardless of major; (2) Academic officials must make plain what their institutions stand for and what knowledge is regarded as essential to a good education; (3) Faculties must put aside narrow departmentalism and work to shape a challenging common curriculum with a core of studies in history, philosophy, languages, and literature; (4) Excellent teaching should be rewarded through decisions in hiring, promotion, and tenure; (5) The humanities and the study of Western civilization should be placed at the core of the college curriculum, intended for all students  and not just for humanities majors. The report closes by identifying a set of specific questions that should be addressed by college presidents, humanities faculty, humanities departments, and the acacemic community in general.

An introduction discusses the automatic data processing (ADP) acquisition process and the need to plan for uncertainty through contractual flexibility. Current constraints in evaluating computer systems are identified. Decision factors which affect the choice of evaluation techniques are examined, including both agency-dependent factors and general factors such as conformance with federal procurement regulations, accuracy, cost, perceived fairness/acceptibility to vendors, and ease of understanding. The following evaluation techniques are then appraised with regard  to those parameters: proposal data analysis, applying experience of the evaluator(s), instruction timing analysis, rating charts analysis, analytic modeling and simulation, benchmarking (timed benchmark tests and functional demonstrations), and prototyping. Additional information on the use of evaluation techniques is included as well as appendices containing a three-page reference list, a list of organizational information sources, and additional guidelines on benchmarking.

An example database is described and a discussion of the structures for modeling this database focuses on data types, actual structures, integrity constraints, and schema definition. An examination of data manipulation covers access from external languages and provides examples designed to show the power of the network and relational models in manipulating their data structures. Some characteristic features of the  two models are then analyzed, including their specific benefits and limitations. A final chapter addresses additional issues in the selection of a database management system (DBMS), including access control, backup, recovery, bulk loading, and concurrency control. Most of the topics pertain to the daily operation of the DBMS itself rather than to the logical structures and operations of the data model. (LMM)",

With regard to needs assessment, consideration is given to district goals, personnel, budget, facilities, Board of Education support, Central Office support, and school mandates. Planning concerns discussed include the purpose of computer implementation, the location of computers in the schools, student/teacher assignments with computers, time schedule for computer usage, computer hardware/software synchronization, inservice for staff, and evaluation techniques. Critical  implementation factors described include appointment of a district-level coordinator, selection of school-level coordinators, and parental involvement. The discussion of evaluation delineates how to solicit the most appropriate feedback regarding the district's computer curriculum, and notes that evaluation should be keyed to goals and include evaluation of the personnel directing and implementing the program. Conclusions indicate the need for reading educators to develop functional literacy with currently accepted media. Twelve references are listed. (Author/LMM)",

Without such information, planning, coordination, resources allocation, and other decision-making activities are severely handicapped. Furthermore, evaluation of the curriculum to determine a program's congruence with institutional goals and objectives is difficult and rarely undertaken. While curriculum guides and course syllabi provide readily available overviews of desirable curriculum, they are often vague, lack specificity, and do not represent the real curriculum. Curriculum mapping was developed by Fenwick W. English (1978) to identify the status quo and reveal the actual school curriculum. A  feasibility study for the New York State Bureau to School Libraries applied the process, and addressed data manipulation problems by using a computer-based system called CMAP, developed on an IBM 4341 mainframe system in the APL programming language. A microcomputer-based CMAP system was developed by adapting existing microcomputer file management software. By applying microcomputer capabilities to curriculum mapping, educators have a powerful tool for analyzing and managing curriculum. This paper includes a seven-item reference list and a curriculum map worksheet. (LMM)",

The findings presented are based on 101 usable responses to a 55-item questionnaire mailed to five major college and university campuses in each of the 50 states (40% return on 250 questionnaires). Following an introduction, statement of the problem, and description of the research methods, a literature review addresses computer and microcomputer use in instruction and lists 140 references. Findings are reported separately for each of the survey questions, which concern such issues as enrollment, curriculum, access to microcomputers, programming languages taught,  and inservice training. Conclusions and recommendations for the campuses and for further study are included. A composite program plan is given which summarizes specific key steps and procedures used to implement programs and includes steps in initial planning and in planning for providing inservice training for the education faculty, teacher education curriculum changes, and equipment purchases and placement. The lack of systematic and comprehensive long-term planning before microcomputer acquisition is identified as a major teacher education weakness. (LMM)",

Daniel Brooks and Michael Remington discussed the current and changing status of copyright regulation and legislation. Policy implications of copyright law for federal funders of educational software, including television, were addressed by Richard Huber of the National Endowment for the Humanities, George Tressel of the National Science Foundation, and Frank Withrow of the Center for Libraries and Education Improvement (Department of Education). New technology and software rights were discussed by Eugene Aleinakoff, an attorney, John  Carey of New York University, Larry Benincasa of Reston Publishing, and John Cecil of the Public Broadcasting Service. The need for proper teacher preparation and training for a changing technology was considered by Charles Tidball of George Washington University, Mont Mondale of the Educational Computer Service (National Education Association), Allan Hershfield of the Instructional University Consortium for Telecommunications and Learning, and David Wormser, an attorney for the Association of Data Processing Service Organizations.

        "description":"Along with cost, and hence availability of hardware and quality educational courseware, the major barrier to full implementation of microcomputers is the lack of knowledge possessed by researchers and educational practitioners alike regarding the nature of the knowledge, skills, and attitudes a teacher must have to successfully use microcomputers in classroom instruction. In evaluating the success of classroom computer use, the inclination is to pit technology against \"regular instruction\" and to compare the effects of these alternatives on student achievement. The premature conclusion may be that computer technology offers little incremental benefit. A process analysis would focus on how teachers integrate computer activities into classroom instruction, including the  consequences of degrees of integration for outcomes of instruction such as student achievement and motivation. Successful classroom computer use is inherent in teachers' planning, decision making, and evaluation of instruction. The teacher decision-making perspective suggests several dimensions that should be included in the evaluation--goals, curricula, computer-based learning activities, integration, and feedback. Because the proposed definition of successful computer use focuses on preactive, interactive, and evaluative processes rather than products like standardized test scores, a naturalistic and field-based research approach is suggested. Nine references are listed. (LMM)",

Networking is the interconnecting concept. In the first half of the thesis, emphasis is on the current relationships between the key themes and educational and general public administrative structures and strategies. In the second half a variation of the &quot;brainstorming&quot; technique (involving purely the author rather than a group of individuals) has been used to produce a scenario of possible educational and general public administrative structures and strategies in the 1980s and 90s; this  scenario emphasizes the possible interrelationships between these structures and strategies, the key themes, and communications networks. A case study then follows which links the key themes and the scenario by including discussion of one senior educational administrator's perceptions of probable futures for a particular education system. It is concluded that there is great potential for new technologies such as computer conferencing and data processing to assist with the restructuring of educational and general public administration. Recommendations on how this could be achieved are given. A list of descriptors and identifiers used in a computer search of ERIC for this thesis is attached. (Author/DMC)",

First, the paper examines the objectives and benefits of conducting formative and summative program evaluations. The paper then identifies the single group pre-test/post-test comparison as the most commonly used method of evaluating remedial programs, and identifies the biases to which the method is vulnerable (e.g., test administration, student attitude, instrument, and external learning biases). Next, methods of reducing the influence of some of these biases are suggested. The paper then focuses on the marginally remedial/marginally exempted comparison, the remediated/exempted comparison,  norm-group comparison, cross-program comparison, and historical comparison methods. The paper then recommends that program evaluators be objective, informed, comprehensive, pragmatic, political, selective, and prepared to compromise. The last sections describe the methods of data collection and analysis, and the findings of the developmental math program evaluation. The project (1) investigated the number of students who completed the math courses, the number who took a more advanced math course after completing the developmental course, and marks in advanced math courses; and (2) compared results from classes in which math anxiety was recognized and treated with those in which it was not.

First, questions raised by the committee regarding family income levels are addressed, indicating that the community colleges serve, proportionately, 96% more students from low-income families than does the University of California, and 55% more than the California State University system serves; and that two-thirds of the families of dependent children attending community colleges fell below the median family income. Next, information is provided on financial aid in the community colleges. The following  section discusses unmet financial need among community college students, estimating that there is between $88 million and $183 million in explicit unmet need (i.e., the dollars needed over and above the aid received) and between $117 million and $204 million in implicit unmet need (i.e., the dollars needed by students who do not receive aid). Finally, possible consequences of unmet need are discussed; e.g., students taking fewer units, spending more time working, adopting shorter-range goals, getting lower grades, taking longer to complete programs, and having more interruptions in college attendance. Tables provide statistics on student income levels, financial aid, and need estimates. (HB)",

        "description":"Arguing that college mathematics education must be made more effective, especially for technology, engineering, mathematical sciences, and physical sciences students, this paper presents nine general principles to enhance math instruction for all students. Introductory material argues that changes in perception, attitudes, and role models are needed to realize the goals of integrating knowledge acquisition and knowledge utilization and exploring metacognitive instructional considerations. Next, a historical and futuristic overview is provided of important mathematical issues of the 20th century. Then, the general principles for mathematics instruction are presented, discussed, and illustrated with examples: (1) \"what\" one communicates in mathematics instruction includes the  intrinsic nature and value of the discipline; (2) \"how\" one communicates goes beyond the exchange of ideas and information to long-lasting psychosocial values; (3) math teachers must appreciate individual differences and their impact on learning styles; (4) multimodal representation of concepts has the potential for synergistic learning; (5) math principles should be presented as the basis for solving classes of problems; (6) students need to learn to reformulate and restructure problem representations; (7) teachers must anticipate and preempt students' misinterpretations; (8) control knowledge must be appreciated as part of knowledge acquisition and accumulation; and (9) students must be responsible partners in an interactive and collaborative learning environment.

Druitt Early Childhood Project, which was developed to provide quality educational programs for disadvantaged children living in the western suburbs of Sydney, Australia. In order to set the subsequent discussion in broader perspective, chapter 1 addresses several key issues influencing project development. Chapter 2 reviews the project's developmental phase; outlines project goals; and specifies what the goals meant for children, teachers, and parents. Chapter 3 describes the Mt. Druitt area, a new low-cost public housing estate. Summarized in chapter 4 are objectives and general methods followed in each of five different early childhood programs (cognitive, competency, contemporary, behaviorist, and home-based). Additionally, general issues in  preschool programming are considered, and childhood practices in Australia that influenced program selection are reviewed. Chapter 5 describes the program evaluation model and presents demographic, medical, nutritional, cognitive, language, and achievement data about children in the preschool and comparison groups at the beginning of 1977. Chapter 6 describes and quantifies many of the processes that occurred within classrooms and evaluates these processes against the goals of the project. Chapter 7 describes initiatives taken to achieve the goal of parental and community involvement with schools. Overall results of the study are presented extensively in chapter 8, and other results are discussed in chapter 9. Implications of the main results are considered in chapter 10. (RH)",

The CRMC is designed to advance knowledge about fetal development, pregnancy, and birth; to identify the prerequisites of optimal growth and development through infancy, childhood, and adolescence; and to contribute to the prevention and treatment of mental retardation, developmental disabilities, and other problems of childhood and adolescence. The extramural activities of the Center are administered through three branches: the Clinical Nutrition and Early Development Branch (CNED), the Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Branch (MRDD); and the Human Learning and Behavioral Branch (HLB). The largest branch in the CRMC, the CNED has  three sections: a Genetics and Teratology Section, a Pregnancy and Perinatology Section, and a Nutrition and Endocrinology Section. In June of 1983 the CRMC provided more than $119 million in support of over 1,000 research and research training projects concerned with the special health problems of children, mothers, and families. Information concerning each branch and section includes an overview, descriptions of the unit(s) involved, a summary of program activities, a table disclosing National Institute of Child Health and Human Development grants and contracts active during June 1983, descriptions of research activities, and a brief report of staff activities.

        "description":"In two studies, preschool children's social interactions while working on problem-solving tasks were investigated. In the first study, 27 preschool children were observed over a period of 9 weeks while working on learning games at a computer. Sharing, verbal and nonverbal instruction, and initiation of interaction were recorded. A total of 63 percent of the time at the computer was spent with a peer, and peers often spontaneously shared and instructed each other. Age-related increases in time spent at the computer, as well as in self-initiation of interaction and sharing, were evident. No differences were found in boys' and girls' activities at the computer. In the second study, 18 children were observed over a period of 5 weeks while working with jigsaw puzzles. In this context,  children worked with peers just 7 percent of the time and exhibited far fewer instances of cooperative interaction. Generally, results indicated that preschool children can engage in cooperative problem solving and instruction and that various activities differentially stimulate such behavior. Further, in contrast to stereotypes about computers, this research suggested that even children younger than school age can work effectively at computers and that computer technology may actually stimulate social interaction in problem solving.

        "description":"By asking three first-grade teachers to respond to actions taking place in their classrooms, researchers made an attempt to identify the beliefs or constructs that underlie teacher decisions. The following research questions were addressed: Is there a system of professional constructs that can be identified in early childhood teachers? and, To what role dimensions of teaching are these constructs related? To answer these questions, teachers were observed in their classrooms, and observed teacher decisions became the basis for interviews. Statements of beliefs abstracted from interview transcripts were edited and presented for teachers' confirmation, disconfirmation, or modification. Resulting statements were organized into 10 content areas, and statements of belief about values  were separated from beliefs about fact. Categories were (1) goals for children's behavior, (2) children's needs, (3) classroom management, (4) planning and organization, (5) materials, (6) learning, (7) instructional processes, (8) academics, (9) evaluation and assessment, and (10) home and parents. Results indicated that, while teachers differed in the number of statements generated, a consistent ratio (60:40) existed between beliefs about facts and beliefs about values underlying their decisions. Sixty-seven (19 percent) of the beliefs were held in common by all three teachers, while an additional 91 (26 percent) were held in common by two of the three. Beliefs not held in common reflected individual values concerning children, teachers, or management and instruction.  (Author/RH)",

Participants included a total of 16 female and 16 male 10-month-old infants, together with their mothers and fathers. From the pool of 64 parents, one parent in each family was randomly chosen to serve as subject. The selection of subjects was made so that equal numbers of parents with first- and later-born infants and equal numbers of mothers and fathers participated. The selected parents were unaware that they had been chosen as subjects. After parents and children were separated, subjects heard cries attributable to their children and were told they could return at any time to the playroom to investigate. Time from the onset of recorded cries until the subject opened the  playroom door was recorded as a primary measure of parental responsiveness or wariness. When the parent returned to the child, or after 10 minutes had elapsed, the experiment ended. The credibility of the procedure was then checked, and a questionnaire was administered. It was found that first-borns received quicker and more frequent attention from their parents than did later-born infants and that more mothers than fathers retrieved their infants. Sensitivity to infant distress was related to parents' experiences in caregiving. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"This report discusses three studies of 2- to 5-year-old children's interpretations of facial expressions in terms of (1) the structure of the emotional domain and (2) prototypic example, overlap, and range of emotion categories. In the first study, 78 children were asked to make similarity judgments about 10 photographed facial expressions by sorting the photographs into two, three, and five piles. Results suggested that children as young as 2 years structure the emotional domain in roughly the same way as older children and adults and that they may perceive emotion in terms of pleasure and arousal. In the second study, 60 pre-schoolers at each of four age levels and a comparison group of 60 adults were asked to tell which of two facial expressions corresponded to an emotion  label. In general, children's choices indicated that their categories of emotion are broader than adults', although children and adults usually shared the same prototype. In the last study, 48 children and 20 adults were asked to tell whether or not each of the 10 facial expressions corresponded to an emotion label. Results indicated that, for each emotion word, several faces apply; in addition, each face was seen as an example of several emotions. In both cases, the range narrowed with age. It was concluded that it is more useful to describe carefully children's behavior in interpreting facial expressions than to assess children's responses against an adult norm. (Author/CB)",

        "description":"The influence of negative affect on the retrieval of information from memory during infancy was investigated in two studies through the use of an operant conditioning paradigm. The procedure used, known as &quot;mobile conjugate reinforcement,&quot; involves a free operant task in which an infant is reinforced for footkicking by the movement of an overhead crib mobile. This procedure produces rapid learning in 2- to 4-month-old infants: the infant learns the footkick response in a distinctive setting in which details of the crib, stands, mobile, and even ribbon serve as possible contextual cues for the production of the conditioned response when the infant is returned to that specific context at a later time. Results of the first experiment indicated that infants' crying in reaction to a  change in the number of mobile objects displayed (i.e., reward shift) had a deleterious effect on their memory for a learning task, thus providing some of the first direct evidence that negative affect influences infants' memorial capabilities. The second experiment was conducted to investigate two possible explanations for the findings: state-dependent retention and memory loss. Results refuted the state-dependent hypothesis. Generally, results provided evidence that negative affect associated with an event produces rapid forgetting of that event, but that this forgetting is not a permanent loss of information. Such forgetting may best be viewed as the result of retrieval failure. (RH)",

        "description":"This paper envisions child care problems in the year 2000 and explores their relationship to policies of today. The population entering parenting age in the year 2000 will bear the scars of the inadequate child care policies of the 1980's. New poor and black parents--many of them born to adolescent mothers in the early 1980's--will have been affected by the lack of supportive child care policies, and particularly by results of the 1981 budget cuts. Many of these poor parents, as children, will have had extremely different preschool experiences as compared to the 53 percent of children from middle- and upper-income families who were enrolled in preschool in 1984. Many new parents will have grown up in single parent families headed by their mothers. Their mothers were among those  least likely to be beneficiaries of private sector child provisions. By 2000 there will be a 15.6 percent increase in the number of children under 6 years of age, increasing numbers of whom will live in poverty. Certainly, by the year 2000 the use of informal child care arrangements should decline. The decrease in family size will result in families which can better afford formal care in homes or centers. But, increasing numbers of dependent elderly adults will be competing with young children for resources. Issues involving the future of child care services are difficult and will require complex negotiating and painful trade-offs. But the picture is not entirely bleak. Now is a time of tremendous potential for building a child care system that will ensure a positive early education  experience for all children. (RH)",

        "description":"Because fantasy has a special role in the lives of children, the meaning and consequences of fantasy experiences in children's lives are central psychological questions. Although the scientific study of fantasy is in its infancy, it does seem to be the case that children with rich fantasy lives have better self-control and are less likely to be impulsive and overly active than children with impoverished fantasy lives. Cathartic effects of viewing violent dramatic themes in television and films are not likely to occur; in fact, aggressive behavior may be stimulated by exposure to vicarious violence. In this area of psychological research, the challenge to the scientist is to determine combinations of factors that lead to an increase in aggression, conditions that mitigate or  eliminate the impact of television violence, and conditions that facilitate a cathartic effect. In this regard, a critical factor is the extent to which a television drama is perceived either as a real event or as a form of make-believe or fantasy. Data indicate that violence on television perceived as fantasy strongly reduces aggression-stimulating effects and may even result in catharsis. Research results also indicate that children who watch a great deal of television are children whose internal fantasies are disturbing. In contrast, children whose fantasies are pleasant and who enjoy engaging in fantasy are children who read. (RH)",

        "description":"A study was made to assess whether middle-class men who were primary caregivers for their preschool-age children continued as such when their children were of school age. The attempt was made to predict level of paternal involvement 4 years later; also explored were the stability and predictors of father involvement over a 4-year period when the men initially had no major childrearing role. The sample consisted of 59 middle class, primarily white, intact families with preschoolers of age 3 to 5 in 1977. Results indicated that a number of factors influenced the father's role in the socialization process, but that these factors differed in importance in the context of different family structures. Specifically, influential factors included the father's efforts to compensate for or  model his own father's role in child care, the nature of father interactions with the child, the sex of the child, and the father's education and occupation. Also influential, but to a lesser extent, were the mother's education and sex-role orientation, and the father's age. It appeared that high father involvement was a stable and enduring pattern: upon assessment when their children were 7 to 9 years of age, men who took a major role in child care early on were not found to have retreated into a traditional, uninvolved paternal role.

A qualitative approach based on two semistructured interviews with each family was used to explore the effects of workplace policies and social support networks on the ability of single divorced mothers to become involved in the education of their elementary-age children. The families were recruited through their workplaces: the local phone company and several large banks. All the women worked in traditionally female, clerical, white-collar jobs that did not require more than a high school education. Findings concerned the following: mothers' involvement in the education of their children;  divorced mothers' social support networks; mother-child relationships in single-parent families; and post-divorce family relationships. Additional goals of the Working Parents Project included networking and dissemination activities, which culminated in a regional mini-conference called &quot;Strengthening Supports for Dual-earner and Single-parent Families.&quot; This conference gathered researchers, service providers, and advocates from a six-state region. The report includes a description of the conference proceedings and a summary of evaluation data collected from conference participants. Appended are interview schedules, coding categories, and other related matherials. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"One important source of biological determinants to intellectual behavior is the immediate family of origin. When family history is taken into consideration, it is necessary to examine the environmental aspects of intellectual development in conjunction with the biological. Herein lies the usefulness of a transactional model of development over main-effect and interactional models. A transactional view sees the two processes as a compound -- each substance entering a relationship with the other such that both are transformed into a new entity. In the family, transactions arise that are centered around the interface of the biological and environmental spheres and give rise to a dynamic interplay of interpersonal relationships which foster the propagation of a vicious cycle,  maintaining the original biological and environmental variables intergenerationally. Some factors that affect human intelligence can presently be listed: sex, socioeconomic status, region of residence, the urban-rural dichotomy, malnourishment, infection, disease, and certain handicaps; it is held that all such variables ultimately will be determined to be environmental. Listing environmental influences does not, however, lead to an understanding of how intelligence develops. A transactional model of intellectual development can be formed by combining Piagetian, learning, and information-processing theories. The transactional model would include developmental stage concepts, mechanisms of information acquisition, processes by which stages are accomplished, and meta-learning processes, the  last of these being particularly important for understanding intelligence.

At least one state was selected in every standard federal region, and, in total, the 13 states accounted for approximately 45 percent of all block grant funds and an equivalent portion of the nation's population. In addition, these states accounted for about 40 percent of MCH block grant funds. At the federal level, information concerning MCH fund allocations for fiscal years 1981, 1982, and 1983 and certain program information was obtained. At state and local levels, a wide variety of data collection instruments and approaches was used to obtain information from individuals or organizations responsible for or having  an interest in a single block grant or multiple block grants. Fieldwork was carried out primarily between January and August of 1983. Chapters of the report focus on the following: funding patterns emerging under the MCH block grant and the ways they differed from patterns existing in prior categorical programs; changes made at the state and service-provider levels in the types of MCH services offered and the methods of delivery; state organization and management changes; and the involvement of citizens, state elected officials, and interest groups in processes leading to decisions on the use of block grant funds. Appendices describe data collection methodology, indicate expenditures for various health conditions, and disclose interest group responses to questions about block grant  implementation for MCH programs.

        "description":"From October 1982 through May 1984, the Council for Community Services--a private, not-for-profit community planning council--carried out an Institutional Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention Project, in close cooperation with the state of Rhode Island's Office of the Child Advocate. The project approach relied heavily on monitoring teams of volunteer professionals from the community to review residential facilities for children. Project staff also reviewed foster homes. Both the residential and foster home review components of the project operated under the mandate of the Child Advocate's Office. This manual describes the project and provides guidelines for replicating the project elsewhere. The description includes sections on each stage of project development and descriptions of  project outcomes, including some achievements not originally anticipated in the project design. The manual cites evidence of significant project success; namely, the implementation by residential facility directors and by the State Department for Children and Their Families of many of the project's recommendations. Replication guidelines are interwoven with the project description, and sample materials, such as training outlines and interview guides, are included in appendices. The manual emphasizes that the project can be replicated by either a publicly funded component of State or County government or a private not-for-profit agency such as a planning council or volunteer service bureau.

Participants' characteristics that should be considered by the group leader are also discussed. The first half of the course focused on learning to listen and respond to one's child, whereas the second half concerned speaking for oneself and acceptance of the child. The format for each training session involved (1) presenting a communication skill by using a brief lecture, videotapes, and live examples; (2) practicing the skill in role-playing exercises; and (3) transferring the skill to interaction with one's child through homework assignments. Evaluation of the program showed that the course improved fathers' communication skills and  changed their views of the ideal family. In addition, their children perceived changes in their relationships with their fathers. In directing the group, course leaders should consider such factors as fathers' motivation for enrolling in the course, previous experience in classrooms and role-playing situations, knowledge of child development theory, and home and family situations. Additional factors include the amount of support fathers receive from significant adults and the low energy level many may experience from coming to the class directly from work. (CB)",

Progress of these students and their contemporaries was measured by the Portland Public Schools' Achievement Levels Tests, which were administered in the fall and spring at the third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade levels. Analysis of achievement results was presented by grade level for three categorical groupings: total survey group, student status (transfer or resident), and sex of student. Findings and conclusions were suggested, based on a comparison of standardized deviations and gains of the surveyed group and those of the total  Portland Public School District. Generally, it was found that the gain made by ECEC students was close to the district average in reading and mathematics and slightly above the district average in language usage. (Author/RH)",

The model itself, basically a framework within which teachers can interact with students about information, has 10 categories of thinking skills: recognition of concepts, relationships, and patterns; information reconstruction, evaluation, and extrapolation; problem solving; and knowledge of basic input-output processes, content-specific tasks, and self as learner. In addition to briefly describing other commonly used models of thinking skills and noting criteria for thinking-skills model development, the first section of the discussion characterizes each skill, identifies the theoretical base from  which it was devised, and reports research supporting its instructional utility. The second section outlines general instructional implications of the thinking skills model. It is concluded that, in its present form, the model can be implemented at any grade level within any instructional framework because its focal point is the teacher and his or her interaction with students.

Children demonstrating low empathy and high APT were expected to be highly machiavellian and to cite self-oriented reasons for helping more frequently than would their age-mates. Highly empathic children were predicted to be more helpful and to cite other-oriented reasons for their own helping behavior more frequently than would less empathic children. Finally, highly empathic children who demonstrated high APT were expected to be more helpful than peers when the need of the other was subtle and required inference. The 61 fourth graders and 56 fifth graders participating in the study were  categorized into high and low empathy and APT groups based on their scores on the Bryant empathy scale and a modified version of APT measures developed by Rothenberg and by Silvern et al. Findings indicated that children in the low empathy/high APT group had significantly higher machiavellian scores than did children in the other empathy/APT groups. Highly empathic children were rated by their teachers as more helpful under certain circumstances; these children cited other-oriented reasons for their own helping behavior more frequently than did less empathic children.

Based on their responses and other statewide data, four types of educational control were formulated: localized, regionalized, unified, and mixed. Using a 10% sample of rural schools, 28 schools were selected for more intensified field analysis during the 1981-1982 school year. Significant differences were found among the three relatively pure types of control with respect to the social and political conditions, school governance processes, and their associated outcomes. Although localization is the goal of  the decentralization movement, only one-fourth of the schools fell in that category. Localization depended on several conditions: a stable local administrator who shared influence with the school board, had a positive orientation toward the local community, and respected its values; local boards or committees that represented major community interests, including faction, stability (low turnover) of the local board; a district superintendent supportive of local control; district policy which specified substantive, functional areas of school government in which local boards and administrators had deciding influence; and open district-level communication.

        "description":"The Shared Responsibility Model (SRM), a language process model that has been used effectively in classrooms that serve limited and proficient English speakers interacting within the same environment, can be utilized with Navajo children. SRM's philosophy recognizes that students learn and retain vocabulary most effectively when they: (1) learn vocabulary actively, as that language meets their needs; (2) share that language in real situations; (3) work with words that are important to them; (4) practice words in low-risk situations; and (5) approach language literacy holistically. Since students must have the opportunity to use the vocabulary purposefully, daily classes must be shifted from teacher-dominated environments to student-oriented settings; SRM utilizes students'  strengths as the center of instruction. In writing, SRM encourages students to maintain ownership of the piece, provides purposeful writing experiences which have real audiences, and emphasizes quality and not just quantity. The majority of in-class time is used for drafting, revising, and editing. To foster an interest in reading and to develop comprehension, SRM emphasizes the relevance of materials by utilizing traditional English curriculum objectives and non-traditional classroom materials. For example, texts for junior high Navajo students might include stories from the Long Walk period, coyote stories, or student-produced materials. (ERB)",

        "description":"A 1983 four-community survey of 220 rural Utah households had as its central analysis issue the extent to which conflict plays a modulating role in linking network positions. Not only do most network analysis approaches reflect an implicit assumption that network ties involving conflict are mutually exclusive from and incompatible with support ties, but there is a tendency to assume that networks channel only positive relations (the &quot;amiability tilt&quot;). Sites were selected to represent four major types of economic change currently being experienced in nonmetropolitan areas. A method was devised which measured conflict, support, and simple contact in such a way that none presupposed or eliminated another. Conflict definitely represented a common feature of important relationships  and was a regular feature of network life. Conflict did not affect all community members in equal degree or form; indeed, male and female conflict patterns were so different that they actually appeared to inhabit socially different communities. Two common stereotypes depict American villages as tranquil and supportive, or riddled with hostility. Not only may both versions be right about the same relations, but the amiability tilt of network analysis needs correction. (BRR)",

        "description":"Data focused on illegal alcohol and marijuana use were collected in 1981 from 4,859 high school students living in two rural counties in southern Georgia. The sample consisted of over 85% of all students in grades 8 through 12 within the two counties. The data were used to test a facilitative-constraint model developed from selected components of differential association, differential indentification, and social control theories. Discriminant analysis was used to compare &quot;users,&quot;&quot;experimenters,&quot; and &quot;non-users&quot; on the basis of factors chosen to represent each dimension of the theory. The findings demonstrated that the theoretical model was useful in correctly classifying students into appropriate categories for both drugs assessed, but was particularly useful for predicting  marijuana use. The most important empirical finding was identification of two variables which were demonstrated to be good discriminators of drug use: &quot;access to drugs&quot; and &quot;identification with pot-head groups.&quot; Facilitative indicators were the best in predictive variables, while constraint factors were shown to be much less important in differentiating among the various drug user groups. Programs designed to increase identification with conventional groups while simultaneously reducing identification with drug-oriented groups will probably be effective in reducing illegal drug use.

        "author":["Resnick, Lauren B."],
        "description":"Research recurrently indicates that children who have difficulty with arithmetic often use systematic routines that yield wrong answers. Recent research has focused less on identifying the most common errors among groups of children and more on analyzing individual children's errors. This paper considers the source of systematic errors in subtraction with multidigit numbers and appropriate instructional responses. The author argues that conceptual misunderstandings lie at the heart of many errorful procedures, and that these misunderstandings are what should be addressed in instruction, as well as the problem of linking conceptual understanding to procedural skill. Following an analysis of the nature of &quot;buggy algorithms&quot; in subtraction, teaching the semantics of procedures is  considered. Principles of subtraction and place value are presented, and children's knowledge of the principles is reviewed. Instructional experiments on how the principles apply to written arithmetic are described. Finally, conclusions and some questions are presented. The importance of error analysis research is confirmed. Systematic errors probably arise from a basic failure to mentally represent arithmetic procedures in terms of operations on quantities within a principled number system, rather than as operations on symbols that obey largely syntactic rules.

Five views that shape the problem definition are first given: (1) individual teachers do make a difference; (2) to be effective, teachers must be masters of what they teach, and must find their subjects intensely intriguing; (3) solving the teacher shortage should be focused at all levels; (4) the problem is one of both quantity and quality; and (5) this is not a new problem. Then two reasons for the teacher shortages are discussed: the severe reduction in the number of newly trained persons entering teaching, and the large exodus of those in teaching. The decline in  quality and the decreasing ability of the profession to attract academically able individuals are then explored in terms of social, demographic, and economic factors. What we know of the typical teacher is reviewed in terms of lower teacher-pupil ratios, better education, lowered regard for teaching, and experience. Finally, reasons for the concern about mathematics and science education are discussed. (MNS)",

Then the Midcareer Mathematics and Science Program is described. It is designed to provide mid- to late-career professionals who already possess quantitative backgrounds with the training they need to become secondary school mathematics and science teachers. With six students in 1983 and 20 in 1984, it reaches those for whom the economic constraints of teaching are of less concern, status has already been attained in another field, and the change of pace and environment are welcomed. Conducted during the academic year with optional summer workshops, the eight courses in the  program are divided among educational theory, methods of teaching mathematics and science, classroom practice, and electives. Consideration of developmental psychology and of schools as organizations are included, and participants work directly with practicing classroom teachers in a variety of high school settings.

Data were collected for 489 junior high schools (82% of the total) and 719 high schools (99% of the total). Discussed in the report are demographic characteristics, including enrollment statistics; the typical mathematics program in junior high schools and in senior high schools, including course offerings; and sex-related information on student enrollment in mathematics, including analyses by course. The summary indicated that a larger proportion of students was enrolled in mathematics courses in 1982 than in 1977. The mathematics curriculum at the high school  level continues to follow a traditional pattern, with elementary algebra and plane and solid geometry the most commonly offered courses. Remedial mathematics courses are more likely to be found in large high schools than in small ones. Mathematics enrollment was greater for females than for males between 1977 and 1982. A notable increase was found in Computer Mathematics offerings and enrollment. (MNS)",

        "description":"This study investigated the influence of student and classroom characteristics on a sample of 17-year-old students' (N=1955) inquiry ability. The sample was obtained from a 1981/1982 national assessment in science carried out by the Minnesota Science Assessment and Research Project. Specific areas addressed included: (1) the effectiveness of the Model of Educational Productivity (MEP) for predicting students' inquiry skills; (2) whether predictors of science inquiry skills differed for males and females; and (3) whether predictors of science inquiry skills differed for white and nonwhite students. Results indicated that the model was capable of accounting for between 24 and 32 percent of the variance in inquiry skill for the general population of 17-year-olds; more specifically,  ability alone accounted for between 17 and 22 percent of the variance in inquiry skill for the general population. Little difference in the prediction of inquiry skill for males and females using the model was found. In addition, for nonwhite students, the MEP accounted for only 18 percent of the variance in science inquiry skill; specifically, ability accounted for only 6 percent of the variance, suggesting that little is known about the factors contributing to the science inquiry skill of nonwhite students.

The ICP, authorized by the National Energy Conservation Policy Act of 1978 and administered by the Department of Energy, provides energy audits and 50 percent matching grants for detailed energy analyses and for the installation of energy-saving capital improvement to schools and hospitals. The evaluation studied the experiences of a sample of Cycle I and Cycle II ICP grantees to determine the impacts of the program and the factors that contribute to achieving and sustaining energy savings. Among these factors, strong and effective leadership by institution managers was clearly linked to the success of energy conservation programs. Thus, the key  elements of the manager's role in effective energy conservation are highlighted. Major areas considered include: energy and the organization; energy and management decisions; and management and the energy conservation process (focusing on evaluating in-house resources, performing energy analyses, developing and implementing energy management strategies, and maintaining the energy management program). An introduction (providing a description of a typical conservation program and other information) and sources of additional information are included. (JN)",

Another primary ICP goal is to conserve oil, thereby reducing the nation's dependence on imported fuels. Secondary ICP goals include fostering energy conservation awareness, advancing energy conservation science by expanding its technical base of knowledge and the expertise of its specialists, and improving the technical capacity for managing energy use in institutional buildings. An evaluation was conducted to determine: (1) how well the ICP has been administered; (2) if the ICP has achieved its primary goals; and (3) what secondary  goals have been attained. This report on the ICP evaluation includes an executive summary, introductory/background information, a description of the methodology and procedures used in the evaluation, and evaluation conclusions and findings obtained by means of site visit observations and data analyses. Appendices contain details on ICP history, additional information about the evaluation methodology and the survey instruments used, and an explanation of the assumptions underlying the analysis. In general, ICP was found to be a valuable and well run program that has been achieving its primary goals of helping institutions save energy, money, and oil. (JN)",

The mathematics curriculum in middle and secondary schools was investigated and compared in order to encourage discussion and possible refinement. A long-range goal for mathematics education, especially for computer-based learning, is presented. Literature on international comparisons was first reviewed. Then a questionnaire was constructed in English, validated, and revised; it was next translated into Chinese and validated. In 1982-83, it was sent to 250 schools in the United States and to 250 in-service mathematics teachers in Taiwan. A response rate of 68 percent was achieved in the United States, and 95 percent in Taiwan. Results focus  on comparisons regarding curricula, graduation requirements, learning centers, computer centers, instructional methods, teaching load, classroom management, teaching aids evaluation and achievement, faculty evaluation, remediation, teacher training, in-service training, and the future of the teaching profession. The discussion compares school systems in the two countries, curricula, teaching methods, and teacher training. Conclusions and recommendations are then given. Appendices contain recommendations from two professional associations, guidelines for teacher preparation, and the survey instrument. (MNS)",

To improve their abilities to think creatively about how to change the world, students must learn about nonviolence and the strategies used by pacifists in the pursuit of their causes. For example, in U.S. history and American literature classes students can be exposed to the writings of William Penn, George Fox, and John Woolman and can learn about the Quakers' commitment to nonviolent principles. By reading works of and about the abolitionists of the 18th and 19th centuries, students can learn about the tactics used by Elihu Burritt, Sojourner Truth, and others as they worked to end slavery. In addition to the  examples from previous centuries, recent U.S. history also teaches the discerning student how nonviolence may be successfully used in resistance to violence and oppression, e.g., the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930's, the Peace Corps of the 1960's, and the American civil rights movement.

        "description":"The purpose of this research project was to identify ethnographers who had used computers in the field to record and analyze qualitative data. To locate such individuals a literature search was conducted, an announcement was placed in the &quot;Anthropology Newsletter,&quot; anthropology computer specialists were contacted, a special symposium was conducted, and questionnaires were sent to anthropology department heads. The results were all negative. Excerpts provided from the letters from the anthropology department heads show that computers are used either in conjunction with textbooks or sometimes in field work, but not both. In the field, usage involves statistical analysis, rather than recording of qualitative field notes. The research project also surveyed recent Ph.D.'s in  anthropology to determine the methods they use in the field to record and process their field notes. Vignettes from that survey and a paper describing the results are provided in the appendices. Additional items in the appendices are a bibliography of anthropological uses of computers and the field notes survey instrument. (RM)",

        "description":"The conference considered a broad range of issues regarding nuclear nonproliferation and U.S. policy objectives for the nonproliferation regime both in the near term and long term. Major areas receiving particular attention were developments affecting the context of the nonproliferation debate; the present status of the nonproliferation regime; threats to the future of nonproliferation; the 1985 Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference; and U.S. objectives regarding the implementation of full-scope safeguards, enhancing the International Atomic Energy Agency, strengthening the NPT, and broadening the nonproliferation regime. Overriding these issues was agreement that to insure the future stability of nonproliferation, measures must be taken to halt and reverse the  vertical proliferation of the superpowers' nuclear arms race. The participants shared the goal of supporting and strengthening the nonproliferation regime and urged the United States to work toward this end. (Author)",

For example, in dress, physical appearance, and the utilization of modern appliances and machines, General Conference Mennonites and Mennonite Brethren basically cannot be distinguished from other citizens in American society, whereas Old Order Amish, Holdeman Mennonites, and the Hutterites are clearly distinguishable. More specific comparisons are made in subsections devoted to each sect with regard to  dress and physical appearance, attitudes toward formal schooling, acceptance of modern appliances and machines, acceptable occupations and living arrangements, attitudes toward military and community service, and differences in the teachings of the church. As a result of studying various Mennonite sects as well as other subcultures in the United States, learners may contrast their own values, beliefs, and goals with those of other subcultures. (LH)",

        "description":"The organization of social studies classroom communication and the format for presenting such communication were investigated. High school students (n=282) were assigned to groups determined by the possible combinations of lesson organization, also referred to as lesson commonality (high versus medium versus low), method of reading (oral versus silent), and student ability level (above average versus average versus below average). After the students were presented an economics lesson, a test was administered to determine their comprehension of the lesson. The students who read the lesson silently scored significantly higher than students who received an oral presentation of the lesson. A significant interaction between lesson organization and student ability level indicated that  highly organized lessons increased student learning under certain ability level conditions. These results are discussed in relation to previous pertinent research. (Author/LP)",

Demographic information revealed slightly more male than female graduates. Most graduates were Caucasian. The major area studied at the bachelor's level was not education, and, at the master's level, approximately a third did not major in education. A substantial number taught K-l2 prior to the  doctorate, and there was a substantial increase in college level teaching after receipt of the doctorate. Overall, the graduates indicated that their doctoral program significantly contributed to their current job satisfaction. The respondents recommended some changes in the program: (l) increased contact with advisor; (2) more research and statistics courses, and (3) more computer training.

A needs assessment was conducted to determine the social health problems and behavior patterns of the older adults in the community. After analysis of factors that may impinge upon the decision-making processes of those who might engage in a health program, it was decided that a program of regular exercise would be most conducive to achieving a healthier lifestyle. The characteristics of such an innovation were examined, including compatibility with past experiences and values, difficulty with understanding the benefits of exercise, the extent to which it may be tried on a limited basis, advantages, impact on social life, and risk or uncertainty. In an  educational diagnosis of factors related to older adults, the factors of attitudes and beliefs, resources and necessary skills to perform, and attitudes and behaviors of peers were explored. A description is presented of the educational strategies selected for the program, and a brief evaluation of the program's progress is given. (JD)",

The problems and challenges presented by each of these dilemmas are discussed within the framework of how they have been met at the University, and how they have affected policy making decisions within the college of education. Reactions of administration and faculty to  legislative recommendations for changes are discussed. It is noted that the greatest challenges appear to be finding ways to use the visibility afforded teacher education as leverage to secure resources needed to implement desired changes, and maintaining the legitimacy of colleges of education as the principal component of the institutions responsible for teacher education.

The program was designed to maximize teacher dialogue in a supportive climate to increase participants' understanding of the complexity of the professional relationships involved in successful behavior management. A model was created which required ongoing input, dialogue, peer coaching, and observation related to the implementation of behavior management strategies. Instructional materials were selected to stimulate critical analysis of strategies. This approach resulted in the identification of techniques matching the teachers' styles. Lecture and activity sessions  provided: a conceptual understanding of behavior management systems; techniques for describing, defining, and monitoring behavior; responses to specific problems and strategies for dealing with them; and, teacher self-assessment and observational strategies for evaluating implemented techniques. Teachers learned to observe and coach each other, providing one another with information relative to the specific behavior management strategy being employed.

An attempt is made to identify national policy and the process by which that policy was developed. A description is given of how policies are implemented, with special emphasis on transmission downward to subnational levels of government. Primary attention is given to the national program, &quot;Life. Be In It.&quot; Federal funding and the financial network supporting health activities are discussed. Also examined are the policies and roles of the state governments in Victoria and New South Wales. A summary of observations includes some comparisons between the national and state programs of Australia and those of Canada and  the United States. (JD)",

        "description":"A final report is given of an assessment and comparison series which evaluated the national fitness and sport promotion systems in the United States, Australia, and Canada. The framework of the three country-specific assessments treated national level policies and programs first, followed by state or provincial activities. At each stage, physical fitness and sports were dealt with separately. This report synthesizes the previous assessments, and identifies salient points and recommendations for the United States system. Comparisons are made among the three countries in the areas of administrative structure, resources, types of programs, and transmission of policy. It is noted that, in Canada and Australia, physical fitness aims are pursued within the context of a broad  recreational orientation, while in the United States, much fitness promotion is done in a preventive health context. The primary observation about sports policy and promotion is that both Canada and Australia allocate substantial amounts of money to promotion of both professional and amateur sports, in contrast to the United States, where virtually no direct financial support is given to these sports. Nine specific recommendations are made for strengthening the United States system. (JD)",

Three groups of physical education experts worked on the task of identifying and agreeing upon appropriate measures. The first panel determined that the most valid measures for measuring physical fitness status tested five elements: (1) cardiorespiratory endurance; (2) muscular strength; (3) muscular endurance; (4) body composition; and (5) flexibility. The second panel considered the most feasible, valid, and reliable ways to measure these elements through school-based, mass-testing programs. The third panel sought to determine items to be included in a questionnaire that could be used to monitor  trends and patterns of participation in school physical education programs, public recreation programs, and participation in other physical activities. A discussion is presented of the results of each meeting, the protocols identified for administration of the measures, the rationale behind selection of the measures, and descriptions of concerns about or disagreements with the measures.

New recruits to teaching are less academically qualified than those who are leaving, and shortages of qualified teachers in subjects such as mathematics and science are expected to grow into a more generalized teacher shortage. Teachers' salaries fall far below those of other professions. Lack of input into professional decision making, overly restrictive bureaucratic controls, and inadequate administrative supports for teaching contribute to teacher dissatisfaction and attrition, particularly among the most highly qualified members of the teaching force. Professionalizing teaching  will require a new career structure in which improved preparation and professionally enforced standards of practice are combined with increased responsibility for technical decision making by competent teachers. Upgrading teacher compensation and creating more professional working conditions are part of a structural solution, one that addresses the interrelated causes of the teacher supply and quality problems, rather than merely their symptoms.

Cholesterol intake of males increased with age and was higher than the intake of females. The mean intakes of sodium among junior and senior high females were within the recommended range, but the average intake in other groups exceeded the recommendation. Candy was a major contributor of sugar in the diets of teenage girls, whereas soft drinks accounted for a substantial portion of the sugar consumed by teenage boys. The energy value of between-meal snacks increased dramatically with  age. Senior high students consumed nearly 40 percent of their total energy intake as snacks. Ethnic differences in food intake were also noted. Additional data were collected from teachers, parents, community agencies, school administrators, nurses, food service managers, and food service workers. That part of the needs assessment yielded additional &quot;unhealthy&quot; findings. These results provide a firm basis for development of nutrition education curricula oriented toward the specific needs of the target population. (BW)",

The program purposes were to: (1) identify the most useful computer-based adaptive testing strategies; (2) identify testing conditions that maximize the positive rather than negative psychological effects of computerized testing; (3) investigate intra-individual multidimensionality problems in ability testing; (4) examine probabilistic responding and free-response methods for computerized adaptive testing in order to extract maximum information from each test item response; and (5) develop, refine and evaluate new computer  administered ability tests for spacial, perceptive, memory, and other abilities not now measurable using paper and pencil testing. Monte Carlo and Bayesian adaptive testing methods were used in these studies. Fifteen major findings, primarily on adaptive testing and test administration conditions, and implications for further research are given.

This view, the Cultural-Distance Approach, briefly stated is that a sub-culture's distance from the major culture, on which test questions of a test are based and validated, will determine that sub-culture's group sub-score pattern in relation to the sub-score pattern of the norming population. Eighty post-secondary school adults (48 White males and females, 32 Black males and females) were recruited and administered a series of tests. Analysis of variance (ANOVA's) were calculated for each of the IQ measures. The results suggest that although Blacks and Whites perform equally on learning tasks at  either the Level I or Level II dichotomy of intellectual abilities, performance on standardized tests of IQ do not adequately reflect this equality of performance, possibly because of the loading of cultural bias in the latter measures. A 93-item bibliography, supplementary forms, and statistical tables are appended. (Author/EGS)",

        "description":"The present study was an attempt to alleviate some of the difficulties inherent in multiple-choice items by having examinees respond to multiple-choice items in a probabilistic manner. Using this format, examinees are able to respond to each alternative and to provide indications of any partial knowledge they may possess concerning the item. The items used in this study were 30 multiple-choice analogy items. Examinees were asked to distribute 100 points among the four alternatives for each item according to how confident they were that each alternative was the correct answer. Each item was scored using five different scoring formulas. Three of these scoring formulas were reproducing scoring systems. Results from this study showed a small effect of certainty on the probabilistic  scores in terms of the validity of the scores but no effect at all on the factor structure or internal consistency of the scores. Once the effect of certainty on the probabilistic scores had been ruled out, the five scoring formulas were compared in terms of validity, reliability, and factor structure. There were no differences in the validity of the scores from the different methods. (Author/BW)",

        "description":"Using five metamemory question types and the Counting Span Test (CST), this research investigated the effects of metamemory task demands, and the relationship of the amount of information one can hold in working memory to metamemory question performance. One hundred twenty kindergarten, first, third, and fifth grade children served as subjects. The amount of information in each metamemory question was systematically varied by the number of options and the number of metamemory variables nested within each option. In the analysis of metamemory data, the main effects of grade level and question type were significant, as was the interaction. The measure of information storage capacity (CST results) increased with age, and was significantly related to metamemory performance. Effects  of gender and gender-grade interaction were not significant. It was concluded that an explanation which incorporates the complex relationships between knowledge, tasks, and information processing constructs is most appropriate. The results support Brown's (1978) contention that systematic investigation of task demands is a critical aspect of future theoretical work in metamemory. (Author/BS)",

Careful evaluations of programs involving computer instruction and education are needed for progress in computer literacy and computer integration into the core curriculum. Data were collected from the 370 participating students, 13 instructors, eight lab assistants, and four program coordinators using pretests, interim feedback forms, posttests, and 40 hours of evaluator  observation data. National Assessment of Educational Progress items were part of the test battery. Results showed gains in computer programming skills, mathematical problem-solving, and attitude toward computers. Sex differences were found in cognitive gain, use of computer labs, and discipline. Teacher training was part of the program. The appendix contains the &quot;Formative Evaluation Feedback-SCOPE Session I,&quot; designed to assist personnel continuing to conduct the program. Findings and recommendations concerning student behavior, physical facilities, field trips, parent day/parent communication, the curriculum, and instructional strategies are presented.

This paper attempts to identify overlaps and gaps in the accreditation/evaluation processes, and presents recommendations for the redesign of the CTC. All the agencies use team visits. In addition, all but the CTC use self-studies. Standards appear to be the major difference between the agencies' approaches. OPPE and WASC concentrate on  facilities, institutional support, faculty, and in a general manner, program content. NCATE's standards overlap CTC's guidelines in several areas of curriculum. The results of the comparison indicate that some combination of a self-study and candidate-centered evaluation, with more rigor in the initial approval process, is necessary to achieve more efficiency and effectiveness in the CTC evaluation process.

It examines the application of Federal policy to institutions which provide employment and training opportunities, as well as implementation of affirmative action policy by the current administration. Statistical information and opinions of employers and others directly involved in the workings of the policy are included. In general, affirmative action is found to be &quot;a policy marked by pragmatism and compassion,&quot; but criticisms are made against the Reagan Administration: the President is called upon to reexamine his position of opposition to affirmative action policies developed and  implemented by his predecessors. His stance, it is argued, has had little influence on the courts, Congress, and most Federal agencies, but it has encouraged opposition and decreased the protections of law available to persons discriminated against. Chapters include: (1) History of Affirmative Action; (2) Goals, Ratios, and Quotas; (3) The Reagan Administration Record; (4) The Impact of Affirmative Action; and (5) The Debate over Affirmative Action.

The report is divided into three parts. The first emphasizes the long history of contact between Asians and Pacific Islanders in the Pacific. This history, it is argued, has partly shaped the way Pacific Americans view Asian Americans in the United States today. Part I also briefly describes the migration process as experienced by the majority of Pacific migrants, who were mainly Polynesians and Micronesians. Part II outlines some of the contemporary issues in more detail, and describes the way in which Pacific Americans have attempted to overcome barriers to greater participation in the health, education  and employment fields. Part III focuses on the origin of the term &quot;Asian Pacific American,&quot; the degree of ambiguity in using such a term, and the resulting disadvantages for the Pacific American community. This section is based partly on the results of several community meetings held to discuss Asian Pacific American relations. Finally, the report recommends (1) a change of the existing classification to two separate ones--&quot;Asian American&quot; and &quot;Pacific American&quot;; (2) that a standard Federal definition of &quot;Pacific American&quot; be adopted, and that it be limited to people of Micronesian, Melanesian, or Polynesian racial and cultural origins; and (3) broader-based support for the upward mobility of all Asian and Pacific Americans, perhaps through a national conference and the creation of  professional associations and integrated leadership training programs.

A basic thesis is that by identifying these two groups with one label, significant cultural and socioeconomic differences are overlooked. This has led to problems in targeting specific populations who may require different types of social services, public involvement, and government aid. Adverse consequences, it is asserted, have been felt most keenly by the Pacific Islanders, who form a \"minority within the minority.\" The inadequacies and malfunctions of the present Asian/Pacific relationship are discussed, and the origins and development of the label behind  it are assessed. The role of Federal assistance is probed, as both a factor contributing to the \"dilemma,\" and also as a functional measurement of the inter-ethnic partnership itself. The paper ends with a presentation of the project's list of recommendations, including abolishment of the label and a call for the formation of a national coalition of both groups. (KH)",

The contractors and their five demonstration sites were: (1) the University of Tennessee, and the Reidsville (North Carolina) City School System; (2) the NETWORK, Inc., and Quincy (Massachusetts) Public Schools; (3) Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory, and the Lincoln County (Oregon) School System; (4) American Institutes for Research, and the Tucson (Arizona) Unified School District; and (5) the University of Miami, and the Broward County (Florida) School District. This report summarizes the accomplishments of all five demonstration projects in the 3 years of  implementation. An introduction (section I) describes the projects' common purpose as (1) the use of materials that contribute to an educational environment free of sex and ethnic bias; (2) helping educators to integrate equity concepts into their instructional practices; (3) providing a setting where people can observe equitable practices; (4) offering training to individuals interested in establishing equity programs in their own schools; and (5) collecting data for program evacuations. Project activities are then described in the remaining seven sections, which focus respectively on installing the demonstrations; faculty utilization of equity resources; developing faculty and administrator capabilities and improvement of Title IX compliance; establishing intern programs at the five  sites; conducting parent and community outreach; evaluating the projects in terms of elementary student, secondary student, and faculty outcomes; and the equity program's legacy for the future.

It is part of a combined effort to assess voluntary integration programs and is designed to inform the district's policy-makers on the progress the district has made in relieving the harms of racial isolation. A Prologue considers the general context affecting the analysis and interpretation of findings, in three aspects: (1) the nature of the greater Los Angeles area served by the district, (2) changes in the district's leadership, financial picture, and racial distribution; and (3) the effect of State and Federal policy changes on the district. Chapter I describes the YRS program as an effort to relieve overcrowding, and details the size,  schedule, and goals of the program. Chapter II presents the methodology used to conduct the study. Evaluation questions, sampling procedures, instrumentation, and data collection and analysis are discussed. Chapter III, which provides results, is organized by these evaluation questions: (1) How successful have participating Year-Round Schools been in relieving overcrowding? (2) What are the opinions of the teachers and administrators about the advantages and disadvantages of Year-Round Schools? (3) What instructional practices are used in Year-Round Schools? (4) What are the attitudes of parents of participating students toward Year-Round Schools? and (5) What progress has been made in reducing the harms set forth in the Crawford decision? (The last section discusses the achievement  levels, attitudes, behavior, and postsecondary opportunities of YRS students.) Finally, findings showing a positive picture of the progress of the YRS program are discussed and recommendations are given to the school district for dealing with continuing problems. (KH)",

Information on implementation methods is presented for the use of district policymakers and for gauging progress in reducing the harms of racial isolation. A prologue considers the social, economic, and governmental context affecting the analysis and interpretation of findings. Chapter I provides a general introduction and a short history of the PWT and CVP programs. The purpose of PWT is stated to be the provision of opportunities for students to share multicultural and educational experiences in an integrated setting; nearly all of 21,000  participating students represent non-Anglo minority groups. CVP programs, it is said, exist to allow students who attended a paired or clustered school in 1980-81 under a mandatory plan to continue to participate in an integrated experience on a voluntary basis. Chapter II describes study methodology. A review of the purposes and issues underlying the investigation is followed by a description of the sampling, instrumentation, and data collection strategies. Chapter III contains findings and recommendations. It is organized according to questions related to (1) changes and effects of program mechanisms; (2) effects of school policies and practices on student interactions as well as efforts to incorporate participants into the regular school program; and (3) progress made in reducing the  harms of racial isolation. A final section summarizes major findings, which were generally positive, and makes recommendations which mainly focus on improving the information distributed to parents and students, and on training teachers and involving them in the program's implementation.

Acknowledged is a need for scholars and researchers to look at the lives of black women, not from the dominant, white, male-centered scholarship model but from the social and cultural perspective of black women's lives and environments. Part I reviews selected socialization literature on blacks and raises questions about the validity of using one single body of scholarship to explain the diversity of black socialization patterns. Part II explores the direct relationships between socialization patterns for blacks and choice of non-traditional gender roles. Part III discusses the ambiguity that many black  women face as they assume these non-traditional gender roles and gives results of a pilot study that the author is presently conducting.

        "description":"The Brown v. Board of Education decision upheld a civil rights ideal that was based on the personal interests of the students; it made no requirement for a perfect racial balance in all classrooms throughout the offending school district. Yet the ensuing, forced desegregation plans that involved long-distance busing, and other measures based on percentages, actually produced racial isolation on a broader scale. The consequent flight of economically able parents from urban public schools contributed to the erosion of the municipal tax bases, which in turn directly affected the ability of many school systems to provide quality public education to their students--whether white or black. Fortunately, the experiment with forced busing is largely over. The present administration has  premised its remedial approach on consensus, not conflict. Centering on magnet schools and other curriculum enhancement programs, its approach provides all children with educational incentives and leaves the choice of school up to each of them--with a full range of transfer options. Thus the use of racial percentages and classroom proportionality are no longer used as measurements of equal opportunity. Nonetheless, two court-related issues bear watching. First, the Supreme Court is about to rule on the scope of relief that can be awarded in a desegregation suit. The Justice Department is arguing that Federal courts lack the power to make States responsible for all transfer costs resulting from interdistrict student transfers. Second, courts should not be slow to declare unitariness when a  school district has clearly exhibited good faith in attempting to comply with court desegregation decrees. (KH)",

The primary purpose of this review is to identify children that may be in need of special help during the transition to the desegregated environment and to determine the type of help needed to enhance their achievement. The use of test scores as an argument for or against desegregation is rejected; it is held that legal and historical imperatives alone require an end to past wrongs. Existing desegregation studies are noted to be often flawed, with methodological weaknesses and insufficient emphasis on classrooms. It is further noted that all too frequently, an integrated school has racially segregated classrooms. Given these caveats, however, the report concludes that  desegregation does have a positive effect on achievement. This is especially true where integration occurs at the classroom level, rigid tracking is avoided, children gain access to integrated schooling at a very young age, and the program endures over time. These findings support the legal and historical arguments for continuation of efforts to racially integrate schools. (Author/GC)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the potential of individual States for encouraging voluntary desegregation at the local level. Desegregation history and State strategies in five States--California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Kentucky, and Washington--are closely examined. In all of the States studied, State laws provide the State agency with considerable power. Generally, these laws make racial imbalance actionable, even in the absence of an intentional violation. The examination reveals successes and failures within every State. Individuals within the State agencies responsible for school desegregation appear to be committed and vigorous, but reduced resources and competition with other State priorities threaten their capacity to pursue traditional strategies. As a result, these State  agencies are searching for new strategies, particularly ones that directly combine a concern for racial balance with improving student achievement. While specific ways of accomplishing the twin goals of desegregation and quality education are far from clear, those involved believe that both can be met. (Author/GC)",

Review of the current situation shows that some States (New York, Illinois, Michigan, Massachusetts, Maryland, and Minnesota, for example) have been able to integrate their schools by fostering the development of low and moderate income housing in particular urban areas. The shift in Federal policy away from urban school desegregation (and from urban problems in general) presents an opportunity for States to take up the slack. The rational use of housing subsidy programs can be of great assistance to desegregation goals. In States experiencing rapid development, regulations controlling growth and development may also be used to assist in these goals. Control over rules for use of State and local  public employee pension funds--a new source of capital for home financing--provides another potential tool. (Author/GC)",

Non-Black racial minorities have a right to a meaningful education with special attention to language needs. This special attention, however, cannot be used to permanently segregate Hispanic and other language minority children. It is argued that only older students--those well skilled in their native tongue--benefit from English as a Second Language programs, while younger children do better in an integrated setting.

It is argued that computer literacy is increasingly becoming a key element in a child's education and future success. A growing body of evidence is cited which shows that access to microcomputers in the schools will be more limited for poor and minority students than for wealthier, majority students. It is also hypothesized that female students may not participate in advanced programs for mathematics, science, and related activities to the degree that male students will participate. Further data cited indicate that more computers are being purchased and made available by wealthier districts, and that more sophisticated student-computer interaction takes place within these districts. The paper concludes with a  review of the potential assistance that Federal and State governments can provide to help achieve equity in this new field. (Author/GC)",

Results of a comprehensive survey of constitutions and statutes reveal a substantial State commitment to the goal of education equity. Constitutional provisions in an overwhelming number of States mirror the requirements of the Federal equal protection clause. Even where the State constitutional provisions are markedly different in terminology, State courts have construed them to be equivalent to or to exceed the Federal standard. In addition, most States have expressly prohibited race discrimination or race segregation in education. Virtually every State has some kind of statute on race discrimination or segregation in schools. Some of these prohibit such inequity in &quot;places of public  accommodations,&quot; expressly or implicitly including schools in the definition. Others have provisions in the State education code. Some States adopted policies before the Federal government, and some have requirements that are stricter than those of the Federal government's. Some States, for example, make unintentional racial imbalance a condition that must be corrected. The overall picture for the States is one of great variety. (Author/GC)",

An overview of other papers in this series is also presented. The conclusion is drawn that although considerable progress has been made in achieving greater racial equity in education, much remains to be done. Blacks have faced the greatest inequality historically, and efforts to correct this imbalance have met with the greatest opposition. Blacks today, however, are less likely to attend segregated schools than are Hispanics, the largest of the new immigrant groups. Hispanics historically have faced discrimination in education in the United States, and new immigrants face isolation due to poverty and lack of English language skills. The need for  addressing their language needs, however, cannot justify any permanent segregation. While the Federal role has been important in the past, a new era of State leadership seems imminent. Thus, virtually all the States have adopted policies to address inequities in the schools. Some have exceeded the Federal government's, although some are weaker. States, however, may be in a better position to bring about lasting and sensible solutions to educational inequities. (Author/GC)",

Literature on the ethnic background of Greeks in Australia is briefly reviewed, and previous findings are presented to articulate some of the issues important in this study: how is a Greek identity maintained from generation to generation after migration, what changes occur, and what are the identity conflicts, if any, of Greek students who are raised in Australia? Next, the study's framework and a rationale for the study of ethnic background factors on second generation adolescents are outlined. The methodology of the survey, which involved administering questionnaires to 1,029  Greek-Australian students, is detailed. Survey responses are given, under the headings of Ethnic Background, Internalization, Values, and Problems, and patterns in background and identity are observed. Much of this information is conveyed by statistical tables. Many variants are reported, but it is concluded that attachment of ethnic culture is quite strong and that the family group is important to the second generation. Finally, a general model is proposed for the study of the responses of second generation ethnic groups. Appendices contain the survey questionnaire and an explanation of the statistical methods used to interpret data in this study. (KH)",

The first of six sections describes the program's activities in preparing minority students to take the New Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT). The original proposal and actual developments during the program's first three years are detailed. Evaluation criteria and the evolution of the program are briefly outlined. Underrepresentation of minority groups in medical colleges, due in large part to low MCAT scores, is documented in the second section, which expands on the program's purpose. The third section describes the background of the project, which originally ran for two years in the Washington,  District of Columbia area, and focused on black students. Its later expansion to include New York City, where most of the students were Hispanic, is also outlined. The fourth section contains a description of changes in the project's structure, content, and conduct over its first three years. Student needs, curriculum, and means used to disseminate the program's major components to other institutions are explained. The fifth section discusses outcomes and impacts. Data are presented showing that program participants have scores almost the same as those of minority students who were accepted into medical school for the year 1983-84. The sixth and final section summarizes this report and asserts that the program's basic elements are effective and flexible enough to be readily replicable in  other institutions. Appendix A consists of the formative evaluation of the project's third year, Appendix B of publicity and recruitment materials utilized, and Appendix C of instruments used to collect data from participating students and their tutors.

Three introductory sections discuss general desegregation effects, the role of and advantages for teachers in desegregation efforts, and recent court cases. Guidelines are then given under these headings: general principles; assignment of educational personnel; the instructional program; student rights; school governance; the local association; the State association; and desegregation of multiple school districts. Next, factors contributing to  resegregation are discussed; these include \"white flight,\" standardized and competency-based tests, displacement of ethnic minority students and educators, and the elimination of special programs geared to the needs of specific groups. In a conclusion, local associations are advised to monitor every step of the desegregation process. Three appendices provide NEA resolutions on desegregation and integration and on student testing, a selected bibliography, and a list of resources available to local leaders involved in desegregation.

        "description":"A study examined the extent to which college students differentially evaluated women in traditional, nontraditional, and unspecified occupations. It also investigated whether sex-role identification was a variable moderating the attitudes of students toward the kinds of occupations women selected. The Situational Attitude Scale for Women in Occupations and the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) were administered to 124 freshman university students. Students were classified as masculine sex-typed males, feminine sex-typed females, androgynous, or undifferentiated, using the BSRI. Data analyzed using two-way analysis of variance of occupational designation (form) and sex-role identification (role) yielded 18 items significantly different on role, 12 significantly different on form, and  4 significantly different on interaction of role and form. Results indicated women identified with nontraditional occupations were viewed less favorably than women identified with traditional occupations. Students with an androgynous self-concept were more likely to view women in any occupation more favorably. Masculine sex-typed males were most likely to hold negative attitudes toward women in any occupation and particularly toward women in nontraditional occupations. Results suggested that sex-role orientation had an impact on women's occupational choice and attitudes of male peers influenced women's career choice. (YLB)",

        "description":"This study extends previous research on labor market effects of vocational education by estimating the relationship between vocational education in high school and the intervening factors in its relationship to labor market outcomes. The strategy is to use data from a stratified national longitudinal survey to estimate a simplified, reduced-form model of outcomes for individuals that can contribute to understanding why positive earnings effects have been hard to find for men and why the effects vary between men and women. The estimated model shows that (1) vocational education may have both direct and indirect effects on earnings, income, and unemployment; (2) the indirect effects operate through such intervening factors as unionization, industry, occupation, labor market  experience, and postsecondary education; and (3) the indirect effects differ between men and women and between whites and nonwhites. The relatively small total effects on males' earnings are more likely attributable to imprecise specification of curricula and neglect of the importance of finding training-related work than to tendencies for conflicting indirect effects to offset each other. Training-related placement is a significant distinction in estimating earnings differentials. Benefits are attributable to occupationally specific skills rather than general work habits or attitudes. Four policy implications are suggested. (YLB)",

Five PA technologies are examined in this report: computer-aided design, robots, numerically controlled machine tools, flexible manufacturing systems, and computer-integrated manufacturing. Each technology is in a relatively early stage of development and even earlier stages of application. PA is not likely to generate significant net national unemployment, but its use may exacerbate regional unemployment problems. Due to PA, the white-collar work force will constitute a larger proportion of manufacturing employment. The introduction of PA will create situations that have negative psychological effects on the work force but will tend to have a favorable  impact on the physical surroundings of work. PA will reshape instructional services and create new demands for high quality education, training, and retraining programs; career guidance; job counseling; and placement services. PA industries concentrate on software and customer services and are characterized by high levels of interchange between firms. Both industry and government fund a broad range of PA research and development. Successful Federal policy regarding PA must mesh actions in several areas through a multifaceted strategy. (YLB)",

        "description":"A random sample of 111 industry representatives from 4 standard metropolitan areas in Pennsylvania offered opinions on how to improve critical aspects of vocational education in the state. Employers gathered at one of four sites and dealt with questions regarding students' basic skills, technical job skills, and job attitudes. Group discussions and questionnaires were used to identify and rank priority recommendations. Among all participants was a highly significant level of agreement on the priority recommendations and their rankings. Responses to the basic skills issue highlighted the need for reinforcement of basic skills in vocational education, emphasis on basic skills in earlier grades, and greater emphasis on vocational awareness by guidance counselors. The priority  recommendations for technical skills emphasized the need for technological updating of teachers and curriculum upgrading. The job attitudes issue evoked responses emphasizing the need for students to understand the free enterprise system, for teacher updating, and for work site simulations. Three recommendations were constructed: (1) vocational educators should review successful programs for possible implementation; (2) vocational educators should assess the roles of all groups that could have an impact on vocational programs; and (3) more deliberate collaboration must be developed between educators and business and industry representatives.

Study participants were 197 administrators from 63 postsecondary vocational-technical institutions identified from &quot;The College Blue Book&quot; (1981). A questionnaire collected information on basic background and these career and professional variables: career decisions, career preparation, professional competencies, professional values, professional commitment, and professional satisfaction. It was hypothesized that: (1) there would be no difference among administrators based on background variables; (2) there would be no difference among  administrators for the career and professional variables; (3) there would be little difference among administrators for the relationship between professional commitment and the career and professional variables; and (4) there would be no difference between administrators with and without teaching load in the career and professional variables. Results indicated that: most administrators had education-related majors; had much teaching and administration experience; were involved in upgrading or inservice education three to four days a year; stood neutral concerning professional values; on the average, were confident about professional competencies; were highly committed to their profession and on the average were satisfied with their profession. Administrators showed differences in career  decisions and professional preparation. Highly committed administrators had significantly higher professional confidence and satisfaction.

The first section clarifies the purpose of the union as an institution by examining its roles, functions, characteristics, and legal frameworks. Domestic and international competition affecting unions and their relationship to business and industry are discussed. Labor education and training sponsored by trade unions are the main topics of the second section. The role of unions in providing apprenticeship training is described, emphasizing the importance of training trust funds for apprentices. Labor education is the training of union officers and members to fulfill their functions within the union and the larger society. In the third section, the role of  educational institutions in providing labor education is outlined, delineating three stages of development of university labor education programs. The emerging role of community colleges is acknowledged. Four types of tuition aid programs are the subject of the fourth section: tuition advancement or reimbursement, educational leave, training funds, and scholarships and educational loans. This section includes information about barriers to worker participation and ways to overcome them. Case studies describing educational programs sponsored by unions conclude the monograph, illustrating the diversity of educational and training opportunities available to union members. (SK)",

        "description":"A study examined the academic skills, study habits, and attitudes of returning adult students and compared them to those of younger, traditional-aged students at the University of Wisconsin-Superior. To gather data for the study, researchers asked 432 students aged 25 and older and 500 traditional-aged students to complete the following four commercially published, standardized tests: the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, Form F; the Metropolitan Mathematics Test, Advanced Level II; the STEP English Expression Test, Form 1A; and the Survey of Study Habits and Attitudes. Of those asked to participate in the study, only 45 of the 432 originally contacted older students completed the battery of tests and only 18 of the 500 younger students did so. Based on the results of these tests, it  appeared that although the measured English skills of the older students were comparable to those of the younger students, their math skills seemed to be less adequately developed than those of the younger students. The adult students scored significantly higher on vocabulary and reading-rate subtests; however, they achieved approximately the same comprehension levels as did the younger students. Both groups appeared to have similar attitudes toward educational practices and requirements. (MN)",

Study methodology was guided by 23 evaluation questions representing five major study components: problems and needs, priorities, programs and activities, outcomes, and policies. Data sources were background information and existing documentation and files, interviews with Pennsylvania Department of Education officials, interviews with local education agencies, and a mail survey of projects. Pennsylvania's approach to funding vocational education programs for the handicapped was principally fiscal; state funding was distributed through an allocation  method. The overwhelming majority of the programs were at the secondary level and represented continuation programs. The most frequent program activities were specific job skill training, individualized programming, general motivational skills training, and pre-employment services. Only about half of the activities represented &quot;best practice.&quot; Little state-level interagency cooperation existed. Generally, the needs of program participants were met. Recommendations were made in these areas: definition of target population, method of funding allocation, exemplary project identification and dissemination, use of &quot;best practice&quot; techniques, enhancement of local program evaluations, interagency cooperation, and a stronger state education department leadership role.

        "description":"As mandated by the Vocational Education Act of 1976, an evaluation was made of Pennsylvania's vocational guidance program for the 1979-80 through 1981-82 fiscal years. The study objectives were to describe the funded projects, evaluate their impact, and explore local capacity development. The study was guided by evaluation questions in five areas: Federal priorities, Pennsylvania's approach, program activities, program outcomes, and policy recommendations. The methodology relied primarily on analyzing existing data and interviewing state and local project staff. Federal priorities were found to accommodate Pennsylvania's program needs fairly well, but funding allocation procedures to states may give Pennsylvania less than its fair share. Likewise, the Pennsylvania Department of  Education's administration of the program was handled well, but the process of setting project priorities for funding greatly restricted the number of districts that could compete for guidance projects. In the three years studied, more than $4 million was used to fund more than 250 guidance projects affecting a quarter of a million participants in elementary, postsecondary, and corrections environments. Emphases included vocational information, career awareness, employability skills, and assessment/career decision making. Few projects assessed impact empirically, but services were extended to underserved populations and there was some evidence of impact in job and educational placement, career planning, awareness of occupations, self-awareness, and awareness of sex role stereotypes.  Recommendations were made regarding funding allocation, project information systems, and state-level guidance program development. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"Small businesses can participate in a variety of partnerships with the educational community that can result in benefits to all partners. Examples of successful school-business partnerships in Arizona include the Aquafria Foundation in Evandale; the partnership among the University of Arizona, Pueblo High School, and the Puma County-State Bar Association; and the Tucson Unified School District Adopt-a-School Program. The benefits to be derived by a small business from participation in such a partnership with the local educational community are many--increased visibility and an improved image, increased teamwork among employees, and a better educated pool of potential employees. Partnerships between a small business and a local school can take any one of a number of forms,  including administering a volunteer program to furnish teacher aides, sponsoring a reading or math contest and furnishing a company service or product as the prize, and conducting an educational enrichment activity such as a plant tour. To ensure a successful educational partnership, members of the partnership should set realistic goals that are agreeable to all involved, should be specific as to program methodologies and durations, and should work to keep the lines of communication among parties open at all times.

        "description":"During the last decade there has been a heightened interest in teenage work experience as a partial solution to the problem of an increasingly visible delinquent youth culture. To examine the effect of teenage employment on drug use and other more serious delinquent behavior, students in grades 6-12, from a randomly selected national population, completed surveys in both 1981 and 1982 assessing their work experiences and the extent of their involvement during the last year in delinquent activities. An analysis of the results showed that of the students in the longitudinal sample, 34.3 percent reported regular employment in either 1981, 1982, or both years. The workers were distributed unevenly by race, gender, and grade level, with males, whites, and senior high school students  being disproportionately represented in jobs. Female workers also came from more advantaged families than did female nonworkers. Workers and nonworkers differed on a number of dimensions before they commenced work, with female workers reporting more behavior involving interpersonal aggression and more than twice as much drug use as their nonworking female counterparts. Male workers reported lower levels of parental attachment than did male nonworkers, and workers of both genders reported significantly greater involvement in extracurricular activities than did nonworkers. In contrast to earlier reports, evidence from this study implies that teenage working does not increase delinquency and does not have a detrimental effect on commitment to education, involvement in extracurricular  activities, time spent on homework, attachment to school, or attachment to parents.

In response to this concern, the Austin Independent School District interviewed 95 dropouts in their homes, asking them why they left school and what could have been done that would have enabled them to remain in school. Responses indicated that no one issue could fully explain school withdrawal. Social, personal, and academic issues were interwoven; however, school related issues were the most commonly mentioned, with inadequate academic preparation, especially in reading and writing, mentioned as a primary reason for withdrawal. The ability to work was the most commonly cited advantage to dropping out, although employment concerns were  also listed as the primary disadvantage. The findings suggest that providing all students with the opportunity to develop basic academic skills in the early grades could reduce the number of dropouts. (JAC)",

        "description":"The Adult Day Care Program (ADC) in the Province of Manitoba is a health and social service program providing socialization and recreation in a supportive environment to those who, without this intervention, might deteriorate in physical or mental health function. To examine the impact of adult day care on the utilization of other health care services (including long-term institutionalization, physician visits, and hospital stays) and on quality of life (including survivorship, overall well-being, activity, and social integration), 76 randomly selected Winnipeg, Manitoba older adults were interviewed. Study participants were matched with those using no home care or home care other than ADC. Interviews were conducted in 1980 and again in 1982. Interview data contained standard  demographic information, health information, and activity and social interaction information. An analysis of the results showed that the ADC, per se, was not having a unique effect on the utilization of medical claims services or inpatient hospital services. Rather, in both instances, the ADC participants tended to fall &quot;between&quot; the users of other home care services (the heaviest users) and the nonusers of home care services (the lightest users). Participation in the ADC resulted in a greater likelihood that the individual would be assessed for long-term institutional care and would be admitted to a personal care home. No significant differences emerged between the groups in terms of survival. Participation in ADC led to increased life satisfaction and increased participation in specific  activities. Participation also led to increased social integration, a change not shared either by users of other home care services or nonusers. These findings suggest that ADC appears to be successful in fulfilling the objective of socialization. (BL)",

A rationale for incorporating the student paraprofessional into the school psychology role and function is presented. Steps in the successful preliminary planning and implementation of such a program are outlined, based on collaboration with other school personnel. Recruitment of student candidates, training, group dynamics, and evaluation and accountability are discussed, and specific intervention strategies that students can implement are described. The increased effectiveness for a  school psychological services delivery system using student paraprofessionals is summarized in seven areas, and the value of extending the program into the community is emphasized.

The battery included the Defining Issues Test, the UCLA Loneliness Scale, the Adolescent Depression Scale, and the Epistemological Relativity Scale. An analysis of the results showed a significant relationship between cognitive relativism and clinical loneliness and depression. Contrary to expectations, no relationship was found between relativism and advanced  social cognitive development, as measured by moral reasoning.

Such applications compare the quantity and quality of employee movements to the cost incurred to accommodate those movements. What is needed is future research proceeding from this decision-theoretic perspective. Where utility models  are developed (primarily for inward and outward movement), applications are needed that demonstrate the models and suggest refinements to make the models more realistic and generalizable. Where utility models are just emerging (primarily in internal movement), further conceptual development, followed by empirical research to apply and improve the basic models, is needed. This research is also likely to have practical applications, enabling human resource managers to more readily integrate their decisions and analyses with those of other management functions. (BL)",

        "description":"Although researchers have been interested in identifying characteristics of students using college counseling centers, research approaches have been varied and unsystematic. To investigate student use of the counseling center using the Clark-Trow subculture model, 582 University of Maryland college freshmen were administered a single item assessing their college orientation (academic, collegiate, vocational, or nonconformist). Students were subsequently compared on counseling service usage, services provided, and number of counseling sessions attended. An analysis of the results showed that 26% of the students sought counseling center services over 3 years. Clients were more likely to be academic (42% vs. 34%) and less likely to be vocational (35% vs. 43%) than were non-clients.  Collegiate clients had significantly fewer sessions (1.86) than all other groups, while nonconformists had significantly more sessions (8.37). Clark-Trow typology was not related to types of counseling sought. These findings suggest that contrary to expectations, based on enrollment, vocational counseling is less needed, and counseling resources would do better to concentrate on nonconformity and its implications for the client and the institution.

        "description":"Identifying the variables which influence student attitudes, perceptions, and behavior patterns in regard to religion, sex, and alcohol has been a major source of investigation. To determine the dimensions underlying the relationship among religion, sex, alcohol use, and alcohol knowledge among university students, 376 University of Maryland students (52% males, 48% females) completed an anonymous questionnaire on the subject. Principal components factor analyses identified eight factors which represented the ways students organized their perceptions of the areas studied. The factors were: personal sexual code, dogmatism, dualism, religiosity, alcohol information, alcohol consumption and sex, alcoholism, parental drinking behavior, and conservatism. An analysis of the results  showed that men and women differed on three factors (personal sexual code, dogmatism, and alcohol information). While women were less likely than men to be dualistic or dogmatic in their approach to religion, sex, or alcohol, they were also more likely to support a double standard, feeling that sexual intimacy for women should be based on love, but accepting that men base sex on mutual attraction. Additionally, women did not see a link between sexual satisfaction and alcohol consumption as men did. Women also were less likely to feel that virginity is strange or that homosexuals need help. These results suggest that men may feel different pressures to adjust to their sexuality. Thus, programming which is unique to the problems and adjustment of each sex may be more beneficial.  (BL)",

        "description":"Westbrook (1983) challenged the validity of the construct &quot;career maturity&quot; because measures such as the Career Maturity Inventory Attitude Scale (Crites, 1973) correlate to measures of mental ability. Rather than interpreting this association as evincing lack of discriminant validity, the association should be interpreted as supporting the convergent validity of the Career Maturity Inventory Attitude Scale (CMI-AS) because career development theory postulates that career maturity should relate to other dimensions of general maturity, including mental maturity and intelligence (Super, 1955; Super, et. al., 1957). Some minimum level of intelligence is required for the development of career attitudes and competencies because intelligence is, presumably, directly related to the  acquisition and application of domain-relevant behaviors. More importantly, a measure of a conative variable like attitudinal career maturity may relate to intelligence as long as it also relates to other variables which, in turn, are unrelated to intelligence. A key test to determine if the CMI-AS measures something other than intelligence is whether or not the CMI-AS correlates to measures of other dimensions of general maturity that do not correlate to intelligence. (Studies showing the indirect or circumstantial validity of the CMI-AS are presented to support its construct validity as a measure of career maturity.) (Author)",

        "description":"Whether or not there are sex differences in helping behavior is a question that has attracted interest from both theoretical and applied perspectives. A meta-analysis was conducted of 172 studies of helping behavior, coded for publication date, source, sex of author, sample size, setting, type of appeal for help, availability of other helpers, sex of victim/requester, and observation by another person. To generate measures of the extent to which each helping behavior was sex-typed in the male or female direction, undergraduate students rated a brief description of each helping behavior appearing in the studies in the sample. Results showed that, in general, helping behaviors were not strongly sex-typed. Men were especially helpful when under surveillance by persons other than the  victim/requester, when a need was present, and when there was no direct request. Female victims/requesters received more aid, especially when the helper was under surveillance. The theoretical analysis of helping behavior in terms of social roles and social influence is generally consistent with the findings of the meta-analysis, suggesting that researchers should describe the variability of sex differences and attempt to account for it in terms of a detailed analysis of situations and behaviors. Although sex differences are seldom well represented by averaging them out, gender is sometimes an important variable in social interaction. (JAC)",

The paper first describes how oral and written languages differ in terms of background knowledge, shared knowledge, multiple channels, feedback, and shared time and space, and how the absence or presence of these features is a matter of degree. It then focuses on examples of children confusing the strategies in their language activities, and problems they encounter in each one. Finally, it discusses the implications for instruction that these strategies suggest,  including talking on the telephone, dictating narratives about experiences not shared by teacher or class, journal writing, and show and tell. The paper suggests that teachers need to help children acquire a repertoire of written language strategies and, at the same time, help them become aware of the pragmatic differences between various types of oral and written discourse.

        "description":"Education has often created and widened the distinctions between reading and writing rather than focusing on their relationship. More recently, however, research has advanced a view that recognizes reading and writing to be instances of communication between people. Research also suggests that five kinds of knowledge (informational, structural, transactional, aesthetic, and process) are critical to expertise in both reading and writing. For example, when readers compose messages, they need both the text and information of their own. When writers compose messages they begin with information and use text to convey it. Revision in both reading and writing focuses on information. Structural knowledge comprises knowledge of discourse structure and writing formulas. Writers produce  texts with structure; readers use the structure when they construct meaning. Transactional knowledge relates primarily to the conceptualization of texts as a medium of communication between author and reader. In reading, such knowledge leads to investigating and questioning the author's purpose and even style. Aesthetic awareness, or the artistic side of language--its sound and rhythm--also constitutes a strong link between reading and writing. Finally, since both reading and writing are complex, awareness of the process by which knowledge is combined aids proficiency in both areas. Thus, since reading and writing do facilitate one another, they should be taught as related processes, with classroom contexts taking advantage of the communicative nature of reading and writing.

This scientific paradigm has led to several misconceptions about reading: (1) that comprehension can be reduced to separately identifiable parts, (2) that meaning is contained within the text and has no connection to the reader, and (3) that reading is a tangible thing rather than a process. These misconceptions encourage a false dichotomy between reading and comprehension. There is an organic paradigm emerging in physics that takes into account the transaction between &quot;observer&quot; and &quot;observed,&quot; the so-called &quot;quantum leap.&quot; There are several ways in which this modern paradigm parallels and lends support to the  psycholinguistic schema-theoretic view of reading. First, there is no separation between observer and observed, reader and text, reading and comprehension. Second, the whole (universe, sentence, text) is not merely the sum of separately identifiable parts. Third, meaning is determined through transactions (between observer and observed, reader and text). Fourth, the basic nature of the universe and of reading is a process. (HTH)",

Style was determined using bilateral alpha (8-13Hz) scores measured from the cerebral cortex. It was suggested, on the basis of bimodal theory, that holistic processors would produce greater amounts of EEG alpha and recall more metaphor from less logically stuctured poetry than would analytic processors. Recall of metaphor by analytic and holistic males provided partial support for bimodal theory, with holistic processors consistently recalling more metaphor from less logically stuctured poetry, and analytic processors recalling more metaphor from tightly structured poetry. Analytic and holistic  females' metaphor recall patterns were generally opposite to those of males. EEG alpha supported the existence of the holistic processing dimension derived from bimodal theory. As predicted, alpha production of holistic processors was greater than that of analytic processors during poetry encoding. (Author/FL)",

Following an established research procedure, each article or study was given a credit of 1.0. When more than one author and institution appeared in a contribution, credit was assigned proportionally to each institution. After credits were assigned, a count was made to determine the number of articles or studies contributed by each institution. Then, a list of those institutions contributing more than three articles or studies was made.  Results indicated that seven institutions accounted for approximately 16% of the possible credits: (1) University of Georgia, (2) Kansas State University, (3) Northern Illinois University, (4) Texas A and M University, (5) University of Delaware, (6) West Virginia University, and (7) University of Connecticut. When the size of the reading faculty was taken into account, there was a change in the rankings, with the University of Delaware, Texas A and M, Northern Illinois University, the University of Connecticut, and the University of Georgia comprising the top five institutions.

        "description":"Defining schemas as higher order cognitive structures that serve a crucial role in providing an account of how old knowledge interacts with new in perception, language, thought, and memory, this paper offers an analytic account of the nature and functions of schemas in psychological theory and organizes some of the experimental evidence dealing with the operation of schemas in memory. The paper is organized into six sections, the first of which provides a detailed examination of the schema concept as formulated by F. C. Bartlett in 1932. The second section relates Bartlett's theory to the larger issue of the conflict in psychological theory between ideas from British Empiricism and ideas from Continental philosophy. The third section briefly outlines some of the basic theoretical  assumptions of information processing psychology to serve as a background for an analysis of schema theory, and the fourth examines modern schema theory, and contrasts it with Bartlett's theory and with the information processing approach. The fifth section discusses the nature of schemas, specifically mentioning ontological assumptions, modularity, ecological validity, and phenomenal experience, while the final section develops a framework for analyzing the functions of schemas in the memory process, and then examines a number of recent experiments in terms of this framework.

The findings provided some evidence to suggest the desirability of modifying textbook design for use with young, developing, unsophisticated readers. Among the recommendations made to textbook designers were the following: (1) use modified terminal punctuation for beginning and low ability readers, (2) use punctuation to indicate the boundaries between chunks of  text, (3) consider the possibility of syllable duration and visual rhythm display in texts, (4) eliminate printed intonation cues in texts, (5) print phrasing of text in meaningful units to facilitate children's reading comprehension, (6) do not break chunked text due to lack of space at right margin, (7) make line breaks between phrases or toward the end of the sentence, (8) do not use &quot;and&quot; or prepositions at the beginning of a line of print, (9) eliminate sentences causing confused intonation from texts, and (10) provide information for dealing with intonation of text in teachers' manuals.

        "description":"Researchers and educators involved in designing programs of vocabulary instruction must take a more realistic view of the task they face and realize that vocabulary instruction has limitations. First among these limitations is the sheer size of the task. Teaching the meanings of new words one at a time cannot possibly ensure the volume of vocabulary growth necessary for normal progress in reading, nor can it be seen as a solution to the massive vocabulary problems facing many students. A second limitation is that much vocabulary instruction has been found not to increase reading comprehension measurably, and a third is the failure to take into account the heterogeneity of English vocabulary and to adapt instructional methods to different types of words. Recognition of the  limitations of vocabulary instruction makes it necessary to reevaluate the goals of such instruction, and the criteria for what constitutes the most effective approach to it. A primary goal for any vocabulary program must be to foster independent word learning, which necessarily involves a large volume of reading. (Author/FL)",

        "description":"To explore the idea of image complexity, i.e., the more complex the television news image, the more appeal it will have to audiences, two time series measures were obtained by showing a regular half hour broadcast of a &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; program to a group of viewers. The two measures were an objective, machine-based measure of the complexity of the television image across space (static complexity), and a subjective, semantic differential measure obtained at 15-second intervals throughout the newscast from 110 subjects in a response laboratory. The incorporation of time lags revealed two particular features: (1) there was significant evidence of cumulation, reaching back as far as 150 seconds, in the effect the static complexity had on subject responses; and (2) the form  complexity variable, static complexity, when lagged back 150 seconds and tested against an authoregressive form of the subject responses, accounted for some 31% of the variance in those subject responses. Results also revealed that subjects showed significant variation in their responses to the newscast material up to 120 seconds in advance of associated changes in static complexity. The results may have implications for research in television news that confines itself only to content based variables at the expense of form variables, and that assumes only a cross-sectional relationship between newscast material and audience responses.

The paper concludes that, in general, the historians defined three divergent approaches to evaluating the press during that period: (1) the Progressive/Liberal approach, which enbodied a conflict approach to history, and which saw differences among sections of American society as the underlying causes of change in history; (2) the Consensus approach, which played down the differences among Americans and emphasized the ideas and beliefs shared by them, and which favored journalism philosophies and activities that were  nationalistic in outlook; and (3) the Developmental approach, which assumed that the proper stance of the press should be neither liberal nor conservative, but apolitical, and which viewed the history of journalism not as the story of how the press stood on issues, but of how it performed its professional role as an informer of the public, supporter of press freedom, and watchdog over government. The paper analyzes each of these three approaches and summarizes representative works from each school. (FL)",

Results showed that China's propaganda efforts consisted of official and unofficial activities and activities directed toward overseas Chinese. The official activities were carried out by the Chinese News Service and its branch offices in various American cities under the direction of the Ministry of Information's International Department in Chungking. The unofficial activities were carried out by both Chinese and Americans, including missionaries, business people, and newspaper reporters, and the activities directed toward the overseas Chinese in the United States were undertaken for the purpose of  collecting money and arousing patriotism. The propaganda program fell into four phases, the first beginning with the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937 and directed at exposing Japanese atrocities. The second phase began with the withdrawal of the Chinese central government to inner China in late 1937, continued until the beginning of the European war in 1939, and concentrated on economic and political interests. The third phase ran from late 1939 to the bombing of Pearl Harbor and was directed at the American government in an effort to promote more moral, economic, and military aid for China, while the last period began when the war became global and continued until the end. The effectiveness of the propaganda program cannot be accurately measured. (FL)",

Such short writing assignments are also suited to 10-week academic quarters. The intended audience in the class is the educated, but nonspecialist, reader. Students select a research topic and then pursue it through the quarter, completing each of the genres in relation to their topic. Each piece is critiqued by the instructor, revised, and resubmitted. Grading involves marking of inappropriate grammar, spelling, and other mechanics, as well as  noting organization, logic, clarity, and precision in language. This system provides continual writing experience and prompt feedback from the instructor. Most helpful to this class structure is the instructor's knowledge of English composition theory in the area of prewriting and of heuristics systems suggested by composition researchers. Such interdisciplinary efforts, although difficult to accomplish, are necessary if students are to integrate what they have been taught in English courses with the experience of writing in their own disciplines.

The findings suggested specific factors  or methods that tend to encourage or discourage interaction. The use of individual student presentations and student-led small group discussions may have contributed to higher levels of interaction. Teachers' questioning patterns during class discussions encouraged or discouraged interaction, depending on the ratio of teacher talk to student response and the nature of the questions.

        "description":"An investigation of the language transfer in second language (L2) lexico-semantic development looked at the relationship of the level of L2 proficiency and interlingual patterns of lexico-semantic correspondence. The linguistic categories used were verbs and adjectives. Relative degrees of difficulty for L2 learners were determined for four interlingual patterns: congruence, convergence, divergence, and semantic gap. It was hypothesized that the patterns would show an order of difficulty such that convergence would be more difficult than congruence and semantic gap would be more difficult than divergence. A short-answer test on these patterns was administered to 300 Japanese studying English in Japan, and results showed that within the verb condition, the patterns' order of  difficulty was, in ascending order, congruence-divergence-convergence-semantic gap, and for the adjective condition the order was congruence-convergence-divergence-semantic gap. Individual analyses of stimuli indicated that L2 semantic development is constrained by language transfer interacting with other factors such as specific-exemplar learning. (MSE)",

Previous estimates of high school peer influence on college aspirations have used peer similarity as an indicator of peer influence but have neglected to control for peers' initial similarity in aspirations at the beginning of their friendships. Longitudinal sociometric data on choices and aspirations were used to control for friends' initial similarity, and a correction factor for peer influence was computed. Two standard types of models were used: the \"Wisconsin\"-type recursive model of status attainment and a nonrecursive \"reciprocal influence\" model. The Wisconsin-type model used data from a 15-year followup study for 728 boys who chose new best friends between fall 1957 and spring  1958. The recursive-influence model followed 993 boys and 936 girls who had new best friends. Additional variables include: I.Q. and friend's I.Q.; grade point average; socioeconomic status; occupational aspiration, and educational aspiration of the child and the friend; parents' educational and occupational encouragement; and educational and occupational attainment. It was found that prior estimates of peer influence had been inflated by over 100 percent. High school peer influence on college aspirations had a weak effect. (SW)",

As a group, the students who attended the extended summer orientation program exceeded their predicted GPA by .38, while those who attended the large fall group sessions fell short of their predicted GPA by .06.  The school lost 5 percent of the summer orientation students after the first quarter, compared to 15 percent of the fall group. Seventy-three percent of the summer orientation group and 55 percent of the fall group returned for the second year. Finally, a greater percentage of summer than fall orientation students graduated.

        "description":"The possibility that some private colleges, when faced with relative tuition differences and/or changes, will experience a change in Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) averages of new students was investigated. Data on 710 private and 349 public four-year colleges for 1967 and 1971 covered tuition, income, enrollment, institutional characteristics, and academic ability measures. Thirteen subgroups of private colleges were also assessed. Based on 14 stepwise multiple regressions, it was found that during 1967-1971 the rate of change of tuition at private colleges relative to the rate of tuition change at public colleges adversely affected the SAT percentile change of most (but not all) groups of private colleges. However, the results also show that 1967-1971 changes in relative  private/public tuition, and the dual tuition policies of states that help determine such relative tuition changes, do not determine most of the SAT percentile changes experienced by private colleges during the period. Most of the SAT percentile change was related to institutional characteristics and may reflect the consequences of choice changes rather than the impact of a dual-tuition rate policy by states. Questions about the consequences of dual tuition systems are also identified. (SW)",

In summarizing factors contributing to a reduced emphasis on critical literacy at the community college, attention was directed to changes in institutional characteristics caused by changes in both the external environment and administrative policies. The study found that: (1) administrators emphasized course enrollments because of an enrollment-driven funding formula; (2) developing new programs to serve a more diverse student body while funds were restricted resulted in strategies to conserve funds, including the increased use of part-time faculty; and (3) because faculty were confronted with great  diversity in student preparation and student objectives, they tested students for low-level cognitive objectives with multiple choice examinations, without requiring students to acquire or practice critical literacy skills. The questions of whether other community colleges face similar problems and whether critical literacy has declined in four-year institutions are addressed. Also considered are literacy and access issues at the urban community college and public urban university. (SW)",

Data for 1,608 students were drawn from the the &quot;High School and Beyond&quot; survey of 1980 U.S. high school seniors. Blacks and lower socioeconomic status (SES) students were more likely to attend lower-selectivity institutions, and lower-SES students were more likely to attend lower-cost institutions. Academically-strong students were more likely to  attend more selective institutions, and, to a lesser extent, higher-cost institutions. While blacks were likely to attend lower-selectivity institutions, they were not especially likely to attend lower-cost institutions. In addition to test scores, important indicators of entry into a selective institution were educational expectations, high school grades, and experiences in student government and journalism. Students with less educated or lower-income parents were likely to attend lower-selectivity institutions, even if their academic ability and achievements were superior. (SW)",

The survey combined Boshier's Educational Participation Scales, Pascarella and Terenzini's Institutional Integration Scales, and 21 questions about students' background and participation in college  activities. Based on factor analysis and LISREL-VI analysis, findings included: both academic and social integration directly influenced persistence, while satisfaction had almost no effect on persistence. Two background characteristics that had the greatest effect on persistence were mother's and father's level of education.

Attention was directed to three concerns: the similarity of competing institutions; the extent to which enrollment competition is structured by characteristics such as institutional type, control, selectivity, geographic region, and program emphasis; and how well institutional perceptions of competitors match prospective students' interests in colleges. Questionnaires were also completed by 269 institutions, representing 81 percent of the larger field study sample. Overall, it was found that focal institutions perceived their competitors as being larger, more selective, more likely to be public, and offering higher  level degrees than they. Of 1,295 competing institutions identified by 252 focal organizations, 39.5 percent of the competitors were of the same institutional type as the selecting focal institutions. Competition was highest for major doctoral institutions and lowest for specialty institutions. In addition, focal institutions identified competitors of the same size about 50 percent of the time.

It is claimed that academic research is shifting from an area of patronage consumption to one of economic development investment. In addition to considering the markets for academic research and research and development funding under conditions of patronage, implications for economic development policy are considered. Markets for research in universities under conditions of patronage have special features: patronage commonly occurs under conditions of oligopsony, where research is sponsored by a relatively small number of federal agencies, the largest foundations, and top industrial supporters; patronage implies unequal bargaining  power; the patron gains indirect consumption benefits, some of which are based on exclusion; and consumption as opposed to investment is a key element of patronage. Some universities wish to decrease their dependence on federal support and are attempting to broaden their revenue base by a move toward state or regional economic development. The life sciences are used as an example of the problem of &quot;misspecialization&quot; of research that can create &quot;blockages&quot; as it flows into the economy, generating low economic growth.

Respondents rated the extent to which certain characteristics were present at their school as well as the extent to which four organizational culture types (clan, adhocracy, hierarchy, or market cultures) were dominant. In addition to rating organizational effectiveness on nine dimensions, respondents rated structural, strategic, decision-making, and environmental dimensions and made similarity ratings of scenarios. For example, if a respondent gave the most points to the scenario indicating a clan type culture,  identified the leader as a facilitator/mentor, indicated that bonding occurred on the basis of loyalty, and that strategic emphases focus on human resources, the organization was identified as having a congruent culture. No significant differences in organizational effectiveness were found between schools with congruent or incongruent cultures. Schools with strong cultures were no more effective than schools with weak cultures. However, the type of culture at the school appeared to be more important in accounting for effectiveness than congruence or strength. (SW)",

Personal characteristics that are important elements include: motivation, interests, willingness to take risks, career success and position, and knowledge and abilities. Environmental forces that affect productivity include: education and training, institutional climate,  mentorships, colleague support, and socialization processes.

Results of research on economies of scale at two- and four-year colleges and research are summarized as follows: (1) two- and four-year colleges, on average, do experience positive returns to size; (2) substantive size-related economies are most likely to occur at the low end of the enrollment range; (3) the enrollment range over which such economies are likely to be found differs by type of institution; (4) the extent of such economies differs by function, with the administrative area typically experiencing the greatest reduction in unit cost and instruction the least; (5) for educational and general  expenditures, the broadest category, a three- to four-fold difference in enrollment among small institutions is accompanied by a difference in cost per student, at the mean, of 25 percent for two-year institutions and 23 percent for four-year institutions; and (6) the extent to which scale-related economies or diseconomies are demonstrated by a given set of institutions depends on variations among them in the scope and variety of the programs and services they offer, the salaries they pay, and the general disposition of their resources.

A longitudinal design was employed that had controls for the following pre-college characteristics: aptitude, family socioeconomic status, intended occupational status, number of years employed between 1976 and 1979, sex, number of years enrolled in two-year colleges between 1972 and 1976, number of jobs held between 1976 and 1979, and occupational status of job held by respondents in 1979. Respondents also indicated their satisfaction with the challenge of the job, working conditions,  opportunities for advancement, pay, security, and fringe benefits.

It is suggested that higher education should be viewed in the context of a state's practices in other human service policy areas (e.g., social and health services). Three types of state policy postures are emphasized: laissez-faire, market competitive, and direct regulatory. Four areas of state policy that are centrally important to private colleges are also covered: access/choice, direct institutional aid, planning and program review, and information policies. Policy areas and postures are illustrated by the cases of California and Indiana, which were studied in detail. The case of New York State is used to illustrate the adaptation to changing demands for degree programs and the  competition between public and private colleges for public funds. Also considered are statistical evidence of relationships between state aid programs and indicators of access, choice, and private sector health. The objective is to compare changes in enrollment patterns and indicators of private sector fiscal health across time periods and across states representing different levels of policy commitment to the private sector and its students.

Constitutional decisions regarding academic freedom have struck down loyalty oaths for college staff, intrusive reporting requirements, and restrictions on political activity. The Supreme Court has protected the right of a student editor to publish controversial material. The  controversies today concern the future of predominantly or historically black colleges, full integration of colleges that have been closed or hostile to minorities, and the question of whether sex discrimination in educational programs can be barred.

The typical chairperson was male, from the College of Letters and Science, had served for about 4 and one-half years, was a full professor, was about 50 years old, and had served at the institution for about 18 years. Of the 55 chairpersons, 49 were not interested in being a dean for such reasons as commitment to teaching and research and the unpleasantness of administrative work. Some respondents offered reasons why other individuals might like to be dean even though they would not, including the opportunity to have influence in shaping the direction of the college.  Chairpersons did not conceive of the dean as a powerful and bureaucratic administrative figure. Over 80 percent of the interview protocols pictured the deans as responding primarily to departmental initiatives. Deans were perceived to govern in a variety of ways. While bureaucratic position enabled the dean to follow a rational decision-making model, the traditional doctrine of freedom in teaching and research supported a collegiality model of academic governance. Also relevant was the political governance model, which recognizes inevitable conflicts that arise. (SW)",

Fourteen states affiliated with the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education are used to examine issues 3 and 4. Concerns that directly affect colleges and state systems are identified: increased federal support for need-based grants and reduction of  directed assistance programs; sharp increases in student reliance on borrowing for college; the expansion of state roles in providing all types of student assistance; shifts in the distribution of total Pell Grant support from students in public institutions to students in proprietary programs, and from four- and two-year degree programs to shorter nondegree programs; and a growing disparity between total Pell Grant disbursements received by students in particular states and those states' proportions of total postsecondary enrollments and population.

Senate Bill 2151 changes the process by which most private, nonaccredited schools will be authorized to grant degrees. Formerly, an institution could grant degrees with only an accurate disclosure of its goals, programs, and resources and the showing of $50,000 in assets devoted to educational use by the institution. The new process requires that a college's entire program, faculty, academic requirements, and physical and fiscal resources meet  qualitative standards. The primary change instituted by Bill 1923 is to make the approval process an institutionwide process and ensure that the college will not achieve approved status unless and until every degree program attains the quality required under this section of the law. Prior to the bill, state approval was granted on a program-by-program basis. It is expected that the implementation of this law will assure both the quality and strength of entire institutions as well as individual programs. The texts of both bills are appended. (SW)",

The college also has programs for the handicapped, including early registration, sign language interpretation, notetaking, counseling, and equipment loans. However, funds from the state specifically designated for the handicapped are needed. Information is included on: attrition rates for Special Services students, freshmen students, and all students; income levels of counties from which the college draws students; and proposed new academic programs.

A Follow-up Survey measured outcomes that were relevant to the college's goals and objectives. Factor analysis resulted in 27 entering student variables, 41 college program and activity variables, and 17 outcome variables. The Follow-up Survey included variables for faculty-student interaction, student-student interaction, the amount of students' extracurricular activities, participation in the Freshman Seminar, student major, and living on campus. The outcomes concerned student satisfaction, perceptions of  the college's contribution to intellectual development, personal goal development, self-image, and self-confidence. The study population was all fall 1979 entering students and all 1982 seniors (84 percent of the original sample). Stepwise multiple regressions and analysis of covariance of the outcomes and significant input and intervening variables were performed. In addition to examining the findings for specific variables, methodological concerns for addressing student outcomes are identified, along with three relevant research questions. (SW)",

Data were obtained from a Cooperative Institutional Research Program survey of 4,621 freshmen entering college in 1971 and a followup of those students graduating in 1980. Based on multivariate analysis of covariance, including separate analyses for males and females, it was found that different types of institutions have a differential effect on the developmental patterns of college graduates, and males more than females were affected by the type of postsecondary institution. Analyses suggest that male graduates of major research universities exhibit less growth in terms of academic and social self-concept  and community orientation than their peers at the four other types of postsecondary institutions, while female graduates of comprehensive colleges and universities and general liberal arts colleges exhibit less growth in business orientation than those attending other types of postsecondary institutions.

Data collected on instruction and research from existing records from 22 programs, six departments, and for the college as a whole are summarized. Findings include: productivity appears unrelated to rewards;  instructional and research productivity appear highly related; and the presence of active Ph.D. candidates appears unrelated to research productivity. Using the information system to identify the most productive programs can help direct both rewards and other resources to them.

The significance of issues management as an organizational process is also considered. Stages of the issues management process are: (1) scanning the external environment to identify strategic issues; (2) analyzing these issues for likely impact and probability of occurrence; and (3) developing suitable responses for managing the issues. The usefulness of issues management stems from its potential to act as an early detector of significant external trends, and to provide the mechanisms for developing effective strategies to respond. In addition to planning by the traditional organizational structure, issues management permits cross-unit planning. An  early aspect of the strategic management process at Pennsylvania State University was the initiation of a macro-level external assessment. Six assessment committees were appointed: population trends, economic trends, federal and state policies, societal, technological and scientific trends, graduate and research markets, and changing higher education structure and competition. Later annual planning will require unit level scanning and micro-level external assessments by lower-level planning units. (SW)",

In addition to examining the usefulness of this model for higher education, the analysis promotes understanding of the political nature of information and the role of the professional in a variety of organizational contexts. Sixty percent of the sample were from public institutions, while 40 percent were from private schools. Respondents' perceptions describe existing decision-making quality levels, characteristics  of institutions, and the existence of preventive techniques that can encourage improved outcomes. Ratings of enrollment, staffing, and resource changes from 1979 to 1984 were developed to examine the level of environmental stress at each institution. Group indexes were developed for five areas: environmental stress, executive cohesion level, symptoms of Groupthink, defects in decision making, and Groupthink prevention techniques. Results validate the theoretical model of Groupthink in an educational context. (SW)",

During the past years, government actions related to retrenchment prompted the Dutch universities to change their planning process in order to increase flexibility and to account for differences in quality. Two important procedures were carried out: restructuring of educational programs and an external review of research programs. The new structure of educational programs included a four-year degree program, selective admission to graduate programs, and a limitation on the period that students can attend college. Educational restructuring resulted in greater emphasis on general studies and a postponement of specialization; a modular organization of programs; more attention to  measuring output (e.g., graduation rate) as well as qualitative issues; and changes in the resource allocation model. Results of the external review of research programs included: most of the departments were able to submit more research programs than was calculated; differences among departments were due to historical factors, such as the value attached to research activities and fluctuation in student enrollment; and research activities were grouped into broader programs.

Study variables included: students' family background; individual attributes; precollege schooling; academic aspirations; grade point average; students' perceived level of intellectual development; student-faculty contact outside of class; participation in  extracurricular activities; and student interaction with peers. Although the discriminant function analysis yielded results accounting for a smaller proportion of the variance in dropout behavior, the results were somewhat consistent with those of the earlier studies. Path analysis of the pooled data, as well as for separate gender and institutional subgroups, provided additional confirmation of the general explanatory power of Tinto's model.

        "description":"The use of Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), a type of microcomputer application software, to analyze open-ended survey questions is discussed. Using open-ended questions allows researchers to ask respondents to express themselves freely about their attitudes and beliefs. This approach also can elicit a precise answer even though the list of possible answers is too large to list in the instrument or too long for most respondents to read (such as student major or home town). The characteristics of an RDBMS that allow for analysis of open-ended questions are: flexibility to create fields after the database has been designed, ability to join databases, and ability to sort on any field in the database. RDBMS can handle unstructured data and can use the relational  operators &quot;join&quot; and &quot;project&quot; when using CONDOR, or the relational operator &quot;copy&quot; when using dBASE. The RDBMS can be used to clarify who is responding to open-ended questions in surveys, thus making the comments more useful, even in cases of underenumeration. The underenumeration problem can also be approached through effective design techniques. Another feature of RDBMS is that it allows the creation of a data entry screen. In addition to identifying technical considerations related to the use of RDBMS, an example of the automated Q-sort is provided. (SW)",

In addition to a growing number of academic librarians who have been given faculty status, the library school curriculum and the credentials needed by beginning librarians have changed in response to modern developments.

However, these measures ignore noninstructional time and they assume that the same amount of time is involved in teaching all three-credit courses, regardless of discipline and course level. Faculty reports on their activities are another information source, using interviews, diaries, or work samples. Possible research problems include a biased sample, the time of survey  administration, the time period covered, time allocation, and study reliability and validity. Factors that can affect workload data include demographic factors (discipline, country, institution); scheduling factors (class size, course level, course type, preparations); and individual factors (rank, gender, and individual differences).

        "description":"Focusing on the experience of one of seven working groups at a theater-for-development workshop in Zimbabwe, this report details the process followed by many groups, and reveals some of the major learnings, dilemmas, contradictions, strengths, and limiting factors found in a practical village-based theater-for-development process. A brief discussion of theater-for-development (TFD) presents this drama form as an experimental collaborative process designed to take theater out of urban enclaves and make it accessible to the masses, presenting such common concerns as crop production, water shortages, immunization, literacy, and family planning. A day-by-day diary account of this working group illustrates an overview of, and specific tasks involved with, the production of a &quot;theater  pungwe&quot;--people's theater. A TFD model lists educational objectives for the drama process and defines the workshop objectives, which are: (1) to train development cadres and theater artists in theater-for-development, and (2) to start a TFD program in Murewa area of Zimbabwe as a training and popular education/culture program. The report's concluding sections provide an analysis of the workshop, including constraints, relationship with villagers, organizational strategy, and team work. An extensive bibliography is included. (JB)",

        "description":"As more school districts install computers at all grade levels, order and evaluate instructional software, and send educational personnel to computer seminars, curriculum decisions concerning computers become mandatory. To clarify the conditions or factors which might affect the rationality of a school district's decision on computer literacy requirements in the curriculum, a participant observation study was conducted in a midwestern metropolitan area over the period of an academic year. This paper describes the rationale for selection of the specific school district, the methodology used in the study, and the computer literacy issues debated by each of the three committees that were formed to look at specific issues pertinent to grades K-3, 4-6, and 7-12. The three major issues  addressed by the committees were: what the term \"computer literacy\" means for students in grades K-3; whether computer assisted instruction (CAI) or programming should be the emphasis in grades 4-6; and how changes in the computer literacy level of elementary school students would affect the existing computer course for eighth graders. Each committee's deliberations and findings on these issues are reported, and the concluding section discusses limitations of the study and presents recommendations for future action. A list of references is provided. (JB)",

        "description":"To better determine the cognitive abilities needed for computer programming, a study was done using 41 junior and senior level college students majoring in social and behavioral sciences at a Los Angeles area university. The subjects were first tested to determine their cognitive abilities with regard to spatial ability, field dependence/independence, general reasoning or non-verbal intellect, analytic versus holistic processing, and math skills. These results were then compared with the results of a test of the subjects' computer programming skills after 10 weeks of computer instruction. Results of this comparison show a positive correlation between computer programming and several cognitive abilities. A comparison of the results of this study with those of a similar study done  by Shaha (1983) using graduate students indicates that this study verifies Shaha's findings with one major exception--the order of regression coefficients for overall programming ability.

It includes discussions of artificial intelligence programming and the facilities provided by the Ada language, pattern-directed computation, pattern matching, and parsing. The second paper (John Kreuter, Tulane University) describes a project which was part of an overall effort to add useful artificial intelligence tools to Ada  through use of pattern-directed string processing of the sort available in the language Post-X (Bailes and Reeker, 1980). The third paper (Kenneth Wauchope, Tulane Unversity) presents a pattern-directed list processing facility for the Ada programming language. Pattern lists for matching against source lists are constructed from a set of SNOBOL4-derived primitives which have been extended to be applicable to arbitrarily complex LISP-like data structures.

The procedures for collecting data are stated (Classroom Observation System) and illustrated by a sample coding sheet. Analysis of the data showed that, in general, medical students  favorably reviewed the quantity of information presented, the presentation style of the professor, and the technical quality of televised presentations. However, they were not so satisfied with the ease of note taking during two-way televised presentations, and they expressed less interest in topics presented via two-way television.

Twenty-four short art films were rated by 218 children in 12 fourth and fifth grade self-contained classrooms in two elementary schools in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; one was an all black Chapter 1 school and one an all white non-Chapter 1 school. After viewing each film, the child was asked to rate the film on a questionnaire  developed for the study and to rank order the four films seen each week in order of preference to determine whether or not children have a preference for a certain film form or technique. The same questionnaire form used by the children was also used by participating teachers to indicate how they thought their students would rank them. It was found that children like films with real children in stories about their daily lives; narrative/live action films were the most popular. Neither sex, race, nor socioeconomic status was closely associated with film interest. Finally, teachers proved to be relatively accurate in predicting their students' interests. Tables of supporting data, a copy of the questionnaire, and a list of references are appended. (JB)",

        "description":"This paper compares the content of two types of instruction presented to a student either by an intelligent tutoring system or by some conventional text, such as a textbook or a computer user's manual, when the educational goal is skills learning. Two distinct points of view are presented: (1) that of the &quot;expounders,&quot; who believe that instruction should be as complete and explicit as possible, and (2) that of the &quot;minimalists,&quot; who believe that instruction should above all be brief and should leave much to the learner's own exploration. Each theory is outlined, and the results of a practical application of the expounders theory are reported. In this study, 40 inexperienced computer users were given two manuals to read (one fully elaborated and the other one-third as long with  the elaborations deleted), and then asked to perform some tasks on the computer. It was found that learners who had specific tasks in mind when they read the manual performed much more efficiently with the short, unelaborated version of the manual, while unprepared learners did better with the longer version. However, contradictory findings by John Carroll (1984) are noted. He found that after working through his minimal version of a tutorial manual for the IBM Displaywriter System, people learned the same basic information more quickly than those who used the commercially developed version of the manual. This study resolves the contradiction by restating the problem from a new perspective--namely, taking the emphasis away from the length of the instruction and focusing on the inclusion  of relevant, essential information, and considering two important dimensions: (1) the kind of information the text must contain; and (2) the kind of learning situation in which it will be used.

        "description":"Presidents and top-level administrators often need to hear more than the obvious reasons to maintain a commitment to retention programs, equal access, and equal opportunity. The most potent arguments center on appeals based on the costs of not having a well-managed program of equal educational opportunity, (e.g., litigation costs, tarnished image, recruitment impacts, and enrollment/revenue losses) and not implementing a student retention program (e.g., mission failure, negative public relations, and lost revenues). An awareness of the following strategies can promote the effective negotiation of changes on campus: (1) gaining administrative support by appealing to the \"college purpose,\" illustrating the impact of student attrition, focusing on costs and student opinion, and  highlighting marketing benefits; (2) establishing cooperation between academic and student affairs areas; (3) building faculty support by personalizing the approach, building \"ownership\" into the programs, and recognizing faculty participants; (4) building campus support; (5) beginning with a pilot project; and (6) drafting program proposals. These approaches should be used sensibly, avoiding extreme zealousness, to enhance the success and visibility of the equal educational opportunity/retention program. (AYC)",

The writing portion of the book begins with a statement concerning the importance of writing, and responds to a series of questions about a cross-disciplinary approach to writing instruction and students' writing skills. A discussion of writing as a thought process that facilitates learning is followed by brief descriptions of other writing across the curriculum programs in the United States. Next, short, frequent writing strategies are suggested, guidelines for selecting and working with peer  tutors are provided, and special suggestions for math instructors are presented. Ways of making and responding to writing assignments are explored next, followed by a discussion of alternatives to letter grades and of graded writing assignments. The section concludes with a list of support services available to the instructor and a bibliography. The reading section begins with a question and answer introduction to reading across the curriculum, offers information about textbook readability, and explains textbook structure. Next, strategies for learning the important ideas from textbooks are suggested, such as graphic organizers, semantic mapping, and vocabulary learning techniques. The next section discusses the factors that distinguish scientific/technical reading from reading in other  subjects. Suggestions for giving reading assignments are followed by test-taking guidelines. Appendices include information on word roots and affixes and a bibliography. (AYC)",

Though open to all science students, the developmental science program is designed for students who are enrolled in programs for which anatomy, chemistry, or physics is a requirement, but who did not take the course in high school; took it but were not successful; or feel the need for background preparation in science. The program operates  through developmental, transitional, and spanning for success phases, which begin as well-ordered, tightly structured mastery learning experiences, proceed to more independent developmental instruction and auditing experiences in mainstream courses, and conclude with mainstream class enrollment supplemented with tutorial assistance. Evaluation studies indicate that the program has increased student success in mainstream science courses and increased student persistence in college, as well as providing other benefits for students and faculty.

Such a transition calls for postsecondary education to understand the values and expectations of the individuals and the character of the institutions and organizations that comprise the society. During the 1970's, a new approach for planning and managing educational institutions and systems began to evolve based upon: (1) a comprehensive assessment of the external environment of the institution's service area; (2) a critical audit of an institution's internal environment; (3) the development of visions and alternative scenarios based on the environmental assessments; (4) the selection of  strategic options and tactical alternatives; and (5) the specification and management of strategy. Using this approach, a coherent and comprehensive plan can be developed for the institution as a whole and all major units. Within this plan, the resource development office can become an effective broker to private and public support; and can assist in the development of the critical mass of intellectual capital necessary to help institutions become community renewal mechanisms in a technical society based on information.

After providing a brief history and background to the staffing problems facing the district, section I examines three alternative solutions: (1) maintaining the status quo, assuming that retirements and resignations will solve the overstaffing situation without any specific action being taken to correct the problem; (2) retraining the underutilized faculty to team teach with another faculty member in a discipline where a faculty shortage exists through activities such as mentoring, continuing professional education to complete a degree, or retraining in a new field; and (3) firing the full-time faculty  who are no longer needed. Finally, section I describes participants in LACCD's retraining program, who were recruited from the overstaffed Physical Education Department. Section II provides an analysis of the costs and benefits of the three alternatives, concluding that the retraining option represents a more cost-effective alternative than maintaining the status quo; and that while the firing option appears cheaper in dollars, the political and human sacrifice factors make it a costly alternative.

        "description":"The changing role of women in the family is discussed, and alternative policy options relevant to female-headed and dual-income families are identified. A model of family functions and an outline of the historical forces shaping family roles from preindustrial to present times are presented. The model indicates the typical allocation of nine family responsibilities to either husband or wife, displays current trends in allocation, and lists societal supports which supplement or supplant the responsibilities of the family. Areas of responsibility considered are health, protection, breadwinner, household, extra-family social, affective support, child nurturance, morality/standards, and child instruction. The shift in roles resulting from family crises involving handicapped and  chronically ill children, unemployment, divorce, and absent fathers, is also discussed. Further discussion explores the influence of public policy on the family and the surrogate role of society in aiding the family. Concluding that child care is perhaps the weakest link in the model, the paper evaluates six alternative child care policy options for aid to dual-worker or single-parent families (public day care centers for all children, child care programs for poor and handicapped, child care vouchers to low income parents, negative income tax, industry supported child care, and tax credit) by five criteria: cost, vertical equity, political feasibility, preference satisfaction, and effectiveness.

Discussion of acute illness in day care settings begins with an overview of studies on day care and illness and focuses on hepatitis A, appropriate sanitation, and indications of research on respiratory conditions. Policy recommendations for implementation at state, community, and center levels are offered. Subsequent discussion describes ways a woman's entry into the labor force can affect her family's nutrition and recommends that nutritional supports should be available to women working at home or in the labor force. Discussion of health insurance for mothers focuses on national and South Atlantic regional data indicating type of  health insurance coverage for and number of plans held by mothers of varying marital and employment status. Recommendations illustrate two different approaches to providing better health insurance for mothers. Further discussion, concerning occupational health and the female labor force, begins with an overview and specifies two major issues confronting North Carolina policymakers. Recommendations considered proactive and maximally protective are offered. Additional analysis and discussion focuses on the protection of the working woman against occupational assaults on her health, reproductive system, and fetus. To select a policy that effectively addresses this problem, the concluding discussion rates five policy options across nine criteria. Examples of hazardous conditions in 13  predominantly female jobs are provided. (RH)",

        "description":"Results of a review of problems associated with divorce indicate that not only are very large numbers of children involved, but divorce seems to be associated with serious effects for children and adults. A very substantial number of children of divorced parents live in poverty and nearly all experience substantial reductions in family income. One of the major causes of income reduction and poverty in female-headed families is the poor performance of fathers in providing financial support for their children. Estimates show that as little as 20 percent of the money needed by single-parent mothers to support their children is actually paid. Although recent efforts to strengthen child support enforcement provisions at the federal and state level have produced good results, the  problem of poverty and low income among these families has hardly been affected. To address the problem of assuring adequate support of children in single-parent families, four alternative policies (AFDC, guaranteed annual income, child support enforcement, and child support tax) are assessed with regard to seven criteria: equity, efficiency, stigma, preference satisfaction, family privacy, paternal responsibility, and effects on the post-separation family. Concluding remarks offer social policy recommendations for the state of North Carolina. (RH)",

In Study 1, kindergarten children with normal IQ and no formal arithmetic training were screened on prearithmetic skills, pretested 20 times over the course of 8 weeks on a set of problems to estimate their distributions of associations, given intensive arithmetic training for 8 weeks, and posttested. Transfer of learning was also assessed. Results provided little evidence of learning over the 20 repetitions of pretest problems. Pretest distributions of associations did not provide a good  indication of how the children responded on the posttest. In Study 2, 30 moderately or mildly retarded subjects between the approximate ages of 6 and 20 were screened and tested to estimate their distributions of associations with a set of 16 basic addition combinations administered 20 times in seven or eight sessions over a period of 1 month. Results were similar to those from the kindergarten children, but mentally handicapped children tended more than kindergarten children to use one or two strategies that accounted for a large proportion of their responses. It was concluded that children's earliest estimates are not drawn randomly from all known numbers and that computing experience is insufficient to account for the type of estimation errors occurring before mastery of basic number  combinations.

        "description":"Answers to questions about how children successfully use computers were found by identifying computer skills and concepts achieved by children attending the 1984 Computer Camp for Young Children at the University of Delaware. A total of 43 children from 4 through 7 years of age attended 1-1/2 hour sessions each day for 4 weeks. Computer activities were embedded in a supporting curriculum of materials and activities designed to precede or extend computer experiences. Children received instruction or coaching in specific computer skills as the need arose. During the last 3 weeks of the camp, teachers recorded children's performance on a list of computer skills thought necessary for successful computer use. This paper first succinctly identifies seven skills demonstrated by all  successful children and five concepts about the nature of computers the children understood. Then, for each concept and skill, sample activities and materials are suggested as stimuli to planning. Concluding remarks caution readers that the information presented in the article does not constitute a prescription for successful computer activities with young children, but should be regarded as a demonstration of a way of thinking about computer use in early childhood education through which curriculum materials and activities were generated.

The training population consisted of directors and caregivers from Head Start and state-subsidized day care centers in North Carolina. Three urban and one rural teleconferencing centers were established in the state. Attendance at each site ranged from 7 to 18 teachers and aides and from 3 to 14 administrators. Lasting between 3 and 4 hours per subject area, training focused on the classroom environment, families, and financial management. It was found that teleconferencing can create a learning environment as desirable as the one  created by traditional training, both in terms of amount of learning and attitudes toward training. Of the approaches examined, audioconferencing provided the most cost-effective alternative to traditional training. It was suggested that the other approaches can offer a number of benefits when used in a specialized manner. (RH)",

Responses to female and male strangers were observed in a modified Strange Situation. Mother-child interaction was assessed with a modified version of Baumrind's cuisinaire rod task, and questionnaires measured maternal life stress. Results indicated that children from single-parent families were more fearful toward strangers than were children from two-parent families. Boys from both family groups were more affiliative towards strangers than were girls. Children explored more in the presence of female strangers than in the presence of male strangers. Married mothers made more maturity  demands on their children than did single mothers, and all mothers placed more demands on daughters than on sons. Mothers appeared to be in greater control with daughters than with sons. Single mothers experienced more stress than did married mothers. Single mothers who were stressed communicated less optimally, were less nurturant, and tended to have children who were less compliant than were other mothers. For both single and married families, qualities of the mother-child interaction predicted children's behaviors toward female but not male strangers. Concluding discussion centers on influences affecting children's sociability and father's role in children's social development. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Examined are recent advances in knowledge about children with peer relationship problems. Two specific developments are described: (1) an emerging recognition of the differences that exist between socially rejected versus neglected children; and (2) a growing appreciation for children's own perspectives on their social situations. The discussion is divided into four parts. The first section focuses on sociometric methods for identifying low-status children who may be experiencing difficulties in peer relations. The second section describes findings from recent studies on the behavioral correlates of children's peer status. In both the first and second sections, evidence is presented to support the distinction between rejected and neglected children. The third section of the paper  surveys new information on the link between peer status and children's subjective sense of well-being. This information documents the importance of looking beyond observable aspects of children's social problems to consider the perceptions and feelings of the children themselves. The paper then ends with a discussion of techniques that have been found to be effective for helping children overcome problems in their peer relations. It is concluded that even though the focus of the paper is on problems, the underlying theme is quite positive. Parents and teachers should increase efforts to identify and help children who might be experiencing serious peer relationship problems. (RH)",

The story begins when the tribe first encounters gunfire in a battle with the Plains Cree, then their neighbors to the east. A Blackfeet warrior is killed and the others return home to tell the chiefs and medicine men about the powerful thunder medicine of the Crees. The Blackfeet determine to capture this weapon and are successful, but many winters pass and they cannot make it work. Finally, Chief Na-mak-an, proposes that they make peace with the Crees and, in return, learn to use their thunder medicine. The Blackfeet not only learn to load and fire their weapon but are given more guns by the Crees, who get them from white men on the  Assiniboine River, trading 50 beaver skins for each gun. With the great medicine of the loud mouthed gun the Blackfeet drive the Crow south to the Yellowstone, raid many tribes, and gain and hold a vast country even after all their enemies are equally well armed.

The overall objectives of the programs for Indian students were to increase reading and math proficiency, improve the high school graduation rate, promote cultural and ethnic awareness activities, provide individualized tutoring, increase participation in extracurricular activities, provide incentives for special achievement, and encourage closer contact between teachers and parents. Evaluation of the objectives showed mean achievement scores (reported as Normal Curve Equivalents) up 2.6 points in reading and 5.8 points in math over 1983 scores. The high school dropout rate was 1.7% compared with 13% in  1983. Cultural activities were reported by 42% of the programs, a decrease of 25% from 1983. Individual tutoring sessions totaled 27,127 or an average of 173 sessions per child. Indian students participated in various extra-curricular activities including student government, band, and athletics. The incentive program for special achievement distributed 1,333 awards. Closer contact between teachers and parents was promoted by numerous activities including a 3-day workshop for parents. The report provides a directory of the 19 Johnson O'Malley programs and includes their specific objectives and evaluations. (JHZ)",

        "description":"Some local governments in nonmetro areas--especially those in the rural West and in very rural areas--experienced high levels of fiscal stress in the mid-seventies that were associated with high and rising local taxes. These local governments may be forced to cut back their rural development activities in the eighties. Fiscal pressures on local governments were assessed by looking at locally raised revenues as a percentage of local income from 1972-1977. Areas with both high and rising revenue effort experienced the most fiscal pressure. Over 33% of the totally rural areas not adjacent to metro areas had both high and rising local government revenue effort, in contrast to only 16% of the less rural nonmetro areas. Efforts to raise revenues increased in about half of the totally  rural areas during the mid-seventies. The high cost of providing essential government services in isolated areas may explain why these areas experienced the greatest fiscal pressure. The varying fiscal condition of local governments is an important issue to Federal and State policymakers in the design and implementation of rural development policies. An appendix presents a multiple regression analysis designed to identify and separate imperfections in the measure of revenue effort. (Author/PM)",

Housing was defined as inadequate if it had one or more of the following flaws: incomplete plumbing facilities, incomplete kitchen facilities, leaking roof, holes in walls or ceilings, and exposed wiring. Fifteen percent of rural heads of household lived in inadequate housing compared with eight percent of the urban elderly. Most elderly heads of household were white, married males aged 65-75 years old with less than a ninth grade education. Of the inadequate housing units of the rural elderly, 45% had two or more structural flaws and were classified as severely inadequate. Comparing four regions (West, North Central, Northeast, and  South), the rural South had the highest percentage (10%) of severely inadequate housing, especially among renters. A major factor contributing to housing problems of the elderly was low incomes. Twenty-nine percent of the rural elderly had incomes below the poverty level compared with 10% of the rural nonelderly. Housing affordability was a problem for many rural elderly including those with inadequate housing, who spent more than 30% of their incomes for housing in one case out of every five. (JHZ)",

Sharing ventures may be for limited purposes, such as sharing a physics teacher or having a joint drama production, or for more permanent programs such as a regional vocational education or media center. Guidelines for successful service sharing programs include joint planning by participating districts, clearly written objectives, voluntary participation, and equitable cost sharing. At the regional level, financing and staff recruitment are typical problems facing service sharing agencies. Among school districts, problems are related to issues such as school  calendars, scheduling, transportation, teacher benefits, and local pride. Shared ventures can expand curriculum offerings, maintain a balanced staff, and decrease expenditures through joint purchasing and sharing of supplies, equipment, and staff salaries.

The reasons for high turnover are numerous and complex, e.g., preservice preparation is presently more suitable for large, metropolitan schools than for small, rural schools; career orientations fail to recognize that experience in small schools advances future plans and goals; and there may be a mismatch of personal value systems and rural lifestyles. Incentives for teachers to accept employment and to remain in small schools are varied and frequently innovative. Some are of no or low cost and are within existing resources; others require additional funds which may be obtainable only through legislative action, voter participation, or local largesse. Superintendents,  school boards, and communities must exercise their creativity in recruiting and retaining good teachers and must work cooperatively to secure the additional funding required to meet the need for a competent and stable teaching staff. This digest defines the small school and discusses the following: reasons for high teacher turnover, old and new recruitment strategies, the housing problem, intrinsic advantages of small schools, salary and related incentives, retention activities, payment for incentives, and mutual support among small school districts.

Introductory sections provide a brief history of the project and explain that the book uses spelling and symbols based on an orthography adopted by the Gila River Indian Community Tribal Council in 1979. The book begins with a display of the Pima alphabet, which uses English orthograpy plus diacritical marks for its 25 characters. Each subsequent page shows an upper and lower case letter of the Pima alphabet, a Pima word beginning with that letter, and a large and easily interpreted illustration of  the word. The illustrations, while reflecting Pima culture and southwest influences, show foods, animals, and other items generally familiar to young children, e.g., chair, corn, orange, saddle, sun, skunk, broom, deer, and key.

Four hypotheses related to these approaches were investigated with children of ages ranging from 5 to 16 years. The subjects were interviewed about their interpretation of propositions and logical arguments. Interviews were designed to explore understanding of the premises and conclusions of syllogisms and the child's understanding of syllogisms in total. The report explains the design of the studies, scoring techniques, and the standardization of the materials that were used. Conclusions are  presented for each of the hypotheses; the general pattern of correct responses with the Dutch students who participated in the study was found to be similar to previous results of English-speaking groups.

The central question addressed was whether the advancement of American technology needs the active participation of the federal government, be it in the currently highly visible, high technology sector or in the more traditional smokestack industries that much of the country relies on. Two of the bills propose the establishment of a new agency to be known respectively as either the National Technology Foundation or the Advanced Technology Foundation. Both bills would create or bring together programs closely related to technology development. They would also establish a number of new programs,  but basically they would give a strong push to government support for research and development aimed at fostering technology to the point where commercialization would take over. Two other bills would instead initiate major studies of the entire question of industrial competitiveness. These proposals take the view that decisions should not be made until additional consensus is reached. Other lesiglative proposals would target federal support on technology for the manufacturing sector.

The 3-year sequence is designed for students whose present plans are not directed toward entrance into a mathematics-based college program. Although this program is not as mathematically rigorous as the 4-year sequence, students who complete the coursework in the sequence will be prepared (should their plans change) to enter college-level precalculus. The 2-year sequence is designed for students whose present progress in mathematics, achievement level, and aspirations preclude  the potential for success if enrolled in either of the other sequences. This sequence provides for meeting the minimal state graduation requirements in mathematics. For each of the sequences, the guidelines indicate the suggested years in which topics should be introduced, developed, and mastered. Major topic areas for the three sequences are: critical thinking and problem-solving; measurement; geometry; number properties, theory, and computation; algebra; and functions.

Section I, an overview, discusses the purpose of the test, the background of the test administration, and the approach for program analysis; a general summmary of performance is included. Section II provides an overall analysis and an analysis of each subtest relative to task  requirement, student performance in Hawaii compared to national performance, implications, and recommendations. Grade 6 SAT item matches (SAT objective correlated with learner objective or performance expectation) and other supporting documentation are included in appendices. The statewide summary of group stanine results indicates that sixth grade students in Hawaii performed better than the national average norm population with 80 percent scoring in the average and above average ranges. This is 3 percent higher than the national norm of 77 percent. (JN)",

This two-section report presents findings of the SAT's three mathematics subtests. These subtests measured achievement relative to mathematics concepts (number, notation, operations, and geometry and measurement), computation, and applications (story-problem items involving cost sharing, selection of an appropriate solution sentence, converting units, computation of measures, reading and interpreting graphs and charts, and others). Section I, an overview, discusses the purpose of the test, the background of the test administration, and the approach for program analysis; a general summmary of performance is included.

The dependent measure was reaction time on a secondary task while listening to six tape recorded passages about chemistry and physics in a 2 x 2 x 6 mixed design. The analogy treatment group required less cognitive capacity and the visualization treatment group required more cognitive capacity to process the materials. The analogy results support the theory that analogies make mental processing more efficient by modifying existing cognitive structures prior to processing the new information. The visualization results support a theory that visualizers devote more attention to the material being processed. A  general similarity effect of organizing devices is suggested. (Author)",

        "description":"The impact of the educational programs of zoos on the recreational visitor is addressed in this report. Unobtrusive or nonreactive research methods were employed as primary evaluative techniques by graduate social science students conducting six research projects at the Los Angeles Zoo. These studies were designed and implemented to examine: (1) visitor turning preference; (2) determinants of holding power of zoo exhibits; (3) reading signs at zoo exhibits; (4) children's reactions to animals in a petting zoo; (5) the stereotypes zoo visitors may hold about selected animals; and (6) intergenerational communication. It is suggested that nonreactive measures are particularly appropriate for these types of evaluation studies because they do not impose on visitors or require their  cooperation, and because they reduce problems with sampling and response bias.

Research studies of the educational goals of different audiences associated with zoos and aquaria are reviewed in this report. These audiences include: (1) the zoo staff; (2) volunteers or docents; (3) general community members in formal programs; (4) students (elementary through graduate school); and (5) recreational visitors. The report also discusses the educational components of, and factors affecting, education in zoos, emphasizes the need for visitor research, explains approaches for conducting research on human behavior learning in the zoo/museum/aquarium environment, and reviews problems associated with the commonly employed methodologies of experimental design studies and survey research. It is pointed out that  much of the literature that exists is descriptive, appearing almost exclusively in journals and conference proceedings associated with zoos and museums rather than in those of major disciplines such as psychology or sociology. Research studies often involve small numbers, instruments of unknown reliability and validity, and data that cannot be generalized confidently. The more extensive use of naturalistic or nonreactive research measures is recommended. (ML)",

DiSessa's phenomenological primitives to mathematics (particularly to the notion of circle). Various acceptations of the word representation are examined, using the notion of a circle as an example. Primitive conceptions are presented together with two tasks aimed at probing their presence or evolution. Two computer programs (three-ring puzzle and moving-around-the arc) which bring forward the development of primitive conceptions are described as is a small-scale investigation in which the programs were used. Negative results obtained from the investigation are analyzed in view of the intrinsic difficulty of pinning down  the elusive mental constructs. The importance of the research project as computers start to be used to enlarge children's universe of experimentation (micro-world) is stressed. (Author/JN)",

        "description":"A logical analysis of word problems provides an hypothesis about the kinds of knowledge that may be necessary for solving multi-step word problems. This hypothesis is that knowledge of the overall pattern of relations in a problem may function in problem-solving apart from knowledge of the particular entities and the local relations in which they participate. This overall pattern or structure determines equivalence classes of problems, problems whose solutions differ in the specific mathematical operations utilized but which are of similar difficulty. To illustrate this analysis, a notation system for one-step word problems is introduced and a description of two-step word problems according to this notation is provided. Experimental results (using third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade  students as subjects) are then presented that verify the psychological validity of the analysis, namely, that for all grade levels the problem structure (the overall pattern of relations between the quantities in the problem) has an effect on problem-solving success. Speculation on the representation of problem-solving knowledge that could account for these results is included. (Author/JN)",

Aspects of the questionnaire dealt with: (1) attributions of success or failure; (2) students' comparative perceptions of mathematics, English, and social studies; (3) the nature of mathematics as a discipline; and (4) mathematics attitude. The results paint a disturbing picture of students' perceptions of mathematics as a whole. The data (which are tied closely to a series of empirical studies) suggest the resolution of contradictory patterns of data in other attitude surveys, where students simultaneously claim that mathematics is mostly memorizing but also that mathematics is a creative and useful  discipline in which they learn to think.

Students in experimental classes (computer immersion project) spent approximately 40 minutes of each class period engaged in computer assisted instruction while a teacher directed, group centered instructional mode was used in control classes. When decisions regarding implementation of a new program which is as expensive to replicate as the computer immersion project must be made, both statistical and practical  significance must be weighed. Although statistically significant differences were found, the practical magnitude of these differences was small, and this, coupled with other methodological problems, resulted in the conclusion that the computer immersion project did not demonstrate an impact of computers, even when time is maximized, on any of the variables studied. School district officials concurred with this conclusion and the computer immersion model was dropped and the computers put to other uses. (JN)",

The expected adequacy of supply to fill these positions is assessed after taking into account projections of college enrollments and degrees along with competing labor demand from nuclear defense, defense waste management, weapons development, non-nuclear defense activities, and other highly technical industries. The likelihood for shortages is high in certain fields.

They provide the introduction to science for many children and are a major source of continuing education for adults. This paper discusses cooperative programs between The Children's Museum (Indianapolis) and the Indiana University School of Education. These programs are built around a series of open-ended, Piagetian type interviews of visitors conducted by preservice teachers. The interviews are aimed at determining a visitor's perceptions and scientific explanations of the exhibits. Beginning with a history of the museum and the development of its hands-on, interactive Science Spectrum (an 11,000 square foot exhibit of physics and chemistry for children), the paper considers variables critical to  designing the museum environment. Several questions about adult/parent affects upon learning in museums, children's learning, and items for future research are raised. Field experiences of the preservice teachers, goals of their activities, and course requirements are described. Several examples of interview data are provided, along with a discussion of the effects of the data on the design of exhibits, the development of science objectives and curricula, and improvements in prospective teachers questioning techniques.

Following this, Howard Mehlinger, in \"World History in Secondary Education,\" addresses problems of teacher training, course purpose, and student acceptance. The third and fourth papers--\"World History since Toynbee: The Emergence of Macrohistory\" (H.

        "description":"Described is a summer institute designed to teach high school teachers about the philosophical and historical roots of the three social science disciplines of economics, sociology, and psychology. During the institute, participants read and discussed the primary works by the most important philosophers and writers of Western civilization. It was hoped that familiarity with these classic works would encourage the teachers to move away from secondary sources to primary sources in their classes. The first three weeks of the institute were divided among the disciplines of economics, psychology, and sociology and stressed their historical underpinnings; the fourth week was devoted to philosophical and curricular issues affecting all three disciplines. Background information and class  schedules are provided for each of the sessions. Evaluations of the institute showed that the institute not only broadened teachers' understanding of the disciplines and their contemporary applications, but also clarified the critical connections among the disciplines. Teachers were able to apply not only broad concepts but specific lectures and readings to their high school programs. (RM)",

Census data were collected from 489 public junior high schools and 719 high schools. The traditional social studies courses of United States and American history, world history, and American government accounted for over half of all the social studies enrollment in high schools. United States history and social studies courses accounted for the majority of enrollment in junior high schools. High schools of 1000 or more enrollment offered an average of twice as many  social studies courses as schools with less than 200 enrollment. Almost half of the social studies courses offered in high schools are full year courses. In junior high schools, over 80 percent of the courses are a full year in length. Almost three-fourths of the social studies courses offered in high schools are elective, although some may satisfy a general requirement for credit in social studies. (IS)",

        "description":"The communication of faith requires a full personal response not required to the same extent in other branches of human knowledge. Because of this, teaching methods designed for the arts and sciences must be adapted for use in religious education. Because religion focuses on God, the absolute transcendent, religious education has to do with mystery. Knowledge of the transcendent depends on symbols embedded in the Bible and the traditions of the Christian community. In the framework of this symbolic approach Christian faith may be described as a personal commitment to the joint meaning of Christian symbols. For Christian faith, the central symbol is the figure of Jesus Christ. Religious education must deal with the centrality of these symbols while it serves three major functions:  (1) to exhibit the credibility of the Christian religion; (2) to communicate the contents of Christian belief; and (3) to socialize the individual into the community of faith. Crucial to all of these are acceptance of dogma, the importance of liturgy, and the acceptance of the Church's authority. (IS)",

Curricular approaches include the addition of subjects, units, or lessons; the infusion method, which concentrates on student activities; and the  integration approach, which includes opportunities for justice and peace activities throughout the school's activities. Special opportunities include teachable moments; awareness activities such as worship, speakers, and days of awareness; service projects; and family involvement. Resources for each of these approaches are included. Chapter IV is designed to assess the school's progress as a peaceful and just institution by critiquing learning materials and examining school structures.

        "description":"The effectiveness of two alternative attitude change strategies--a traditional persuasive strategy and a combined attributional/persuasive strategy--in altering attitudes toward nuclear disarmament were compared. Seventeen male and 39 female undergraduate students at a small university participated. A nuclear disarmament attitude pretest was administered. Two lectures, one advocating nuclear disarmament and the other designed to enhance a belief in personal political efficacy, were videotaped. After viewing one or both of the videotapes, subjects completed a questionnaire. The study had predicted that change would be greater among the subjects who viewed the combined presentation than among subjects who viewed only the pro-disarmament presentation. It was also predicted that this  effect would be greater among initially pro-disarmament subjects than among initially anti-disarmament subjects. Study results failed to support these predictions. Although all subjects' disarmament attitudes tended to become more favorable toward disarmament over the course of the study, no differential attitude change resulted from the attributional manipulation.

A random sample of 35 teachers of grades kindergarten through adult completed a written survey instrument that asked them to read statements regarding sex-stereotyping and to rate themselves regarding their own classroom practices. Item frequency responses are provided for each of the following categories of teachers: K-3, 4-6, 7-12, special education teachers, adult education teachers, and all teachers. Frequency responses are also tallied by years of teaching experience and by teacher age. Results revealed a strong agreement among teachers of all grade levels that sex- stereotyping attitudes were seldom observed in their classrooms. The teachers demonstrated an  awareness of the need to exhibit behaviors that were not partial to either sex. The report also discusses implications of the study with regard to research, teacher preparation, inservice teacher education, the school, and the family. (RM)",

        "description":"A perspective on artistic creativity developed by an artist and a psychologist is presented. The artist approaches art as a semiotic system built upon relations between visual isomorphisms. The psychologist is concerned with the origins of analogical thought in children's symbolic play and its possible maturation into a component of adult creativity. The paper is divided into two parts. In the first part the artist presents his aesthetic rationale and outlines the creative process. The focus is on the role of isomorphisms in visual art, both historically and in the artist's own work. In the second part of the paper, the psychologist discusses the artistic manipulation of isomorphisms as a theoretical construct in psychology. The concept of isomorphisms is placed into a larger  theoretical perspective that studies creativity as a maturation of children's symbolic play. It is suggested that the ability to perceive and manipulate isomorphisms originates in children's symbolic play and matures into an important component of adult creativity. Preliminary findings of an instrument designed to measure creativity and aspects of symbolic play are presented. (RM)",

        "description":"Textbook presentations of Asch's classical research were used as a case example to evaluate whether an anti-group bias exists in social psychology. Ninety-nine textbooks were analyzed to evaluate whether an overemphasis on conformity was presented by textbook descriptions of Asch, and whether independence and resistance to group pressure were minimized. The results indicated that authors tended to distort Asch's study in line with the hypothesis and that this tendency has increased dramatically with time. Contrary to expectation, an increasing number of textbooks mention that Asch's social support variation &quot;reduced&quot; conformity, but failed to stress that the power of the group was very much depleted with the support of only one other. The results were discussed in relation to an  anti-group bias in social psychology and the impact this has on social psychology. The study concludes with an extensive list of references.

        "description":"Intended to examine equity in values education in public school curricula, this comprehensive report is organized into two major sections. Section 1 is empirically oriented and presents evidence describing how religion and traditional values are represented in the nation's public school textbooks. Part 1 of section 1 (by Donald Oppewal) is a review of the already published literature on this topic. Part 2 of section 1 reports on how religion and traditional values are currently portrayed in a large and representative sample of the nation's textbooks. Four appendices, making up approximately half of the report, provide tables showing the 60 social studies books in the sample listed by publisher, grade, and title, followed by general summaries of major sections and emphases for  each text. The books analyzed are: social studies, grades 1-6; American history, grades 11 or 12; and basal readers, grades 3 and 6. Section 2 addresses the question of why values should be taught, and if so, what rationale for teaching values is most defensible. Part 1 of section 2 (by Henrietta Schwartz) argues on the basis of anthropology that values are an inescapable part of any culture or subculture, such as schools. Part 2 of section 2 (by Edward A. Wynne) describes and extensively critiques the two most common rationales in the public schools for teaching values today--values clarification and Kohlberg's model of moral development. This part also presents a newly revived alternative approach to teaching values--an approach explicitly aimed at the development of character.  (Author/LH)",

        "description":"This section, from a larger report describing a project designed to systematically investigate how religious and traditional values are represented in today's public school curricula, presents a review of the literature focusing on studies that have analyzed the treatment of religion and values in elementary and secondary textbooks. This survey is supplemented by an examination of a sampling of literature anthologies used in upper elementary and secondary English classes, health/sex education textbooks, secondary biology texts, elementary social studies texts and textbooks used in civics/government and history classes. Using a table categorizing types of sex and ethnic bias (McCune, Matthews and Gall) and the \"Humanist Manifesto\" developed by the author, texts were analyzed to  determine whether religious and traditional values and beliefs are accorded equitable treatment. Findings indicate that the literature anthologies contain materials which expose students to traditional religious values, with amounts varying from negligible to significant depending upon whether the texts contain writings from earlier periods. The examination of three health/sex education textbooks and four secondary biology texts revealed the consistent taking of sides on controversial issues in the health/sex education texts and a shift from the traditional focus on biological concepts to controversial socio-moral issues in the secondary biology texts. Analysis of social studies texts also revealed an underrepresentation of the role of religious belief and the church in society as well as  a misrepresentation or underrepresentation of traditional values.

Studies 1 through 5 deal with how religion and some social and political issues are represented in social studies texts for grades 1-6. Study 6 deals with the same topics as portrayed in high school American history books. Study 7 investigates how religion and certain traditional values are portrayed in the books used to teach reading, in grades 3 and 6. The analyses were based on 60 commonly used social studies texts  produced by the following publishers: Allyn and Bacon (1983); D.C. Heath (1982); Holt, Rinehart, & Winston (1983); Laidlaw Brothers (1983); Macmillan (1982-83); McGraw-Hill (1983); Riverside (1982); Scott Foresman (1983); Silver Burdett (1984) and Steck-Vaughn (1983). The books were read and scored by the principal investigator; all results were verified by independent evaluators. The general finding of the studies is that public school textbooks present a biased representation both of religion and of many traditional values. Appendices (80% of report) include: (1) A list of the 60 social studies books listed by publisher, grade, and title; (2) adoptions of textbooks listed by state; (3) a text-by-text, page-by-page analysis of the presentations of religious values in text and in images  and family values in text; (4) analysis of the treatment of selected religious topics such as the Pentecostal movement, Martin Luther King, and fundamentalism; and (5) summaries of 670 stories and articles analyzed in study 7.

Education systems have conducted enculturation through thousands of years of history and pre-history. On the basis of anthropology it is argued that values are an inescapable part of any culture or subculture, including schools. To fulfill the socialization functions, schools must transmit the cultural heritage, the technology and the skills and tools necessary for survival, the norms of the mainstream culture, the awareness of other cultures, and the cognitive and affective  expertise needed to analyze, synthesize, and appreciate other value systems and cultures. Eight universals common to all cultures (a value system stressing preservation of society, a sense of community, social organization, body of knowledge and skills, economic system, form of governance, aesthetic system, and a socialization process) are discussed and ways that schools can actively enlist the support and engagement of parents to help meet the challenge of managing values transmission in schools are examined.

Both of these models have been developed in the last 20 years or so by education theorists at American universities and research institutes. The first model is known as &quot;values clarification&quot;; the other is based on the theory of moral development proposed by Lawrence Kohlberg. Additionally, a third and long-applied alternative, referred to as the &quot;character education&quot; model, is described. This alternative approach to teaching values has articulated such traditional  moral aims as promptness, truthfulness, courtesy, and obedience. Whereas the first two approaches aim to shape patterns of moral reasoning, the final approach aims at shaping conduct. It is concluded that as American education revives its concern for basic disciplines, educators should also return to the direct and indirect teaching of morality found in the traditional model.

Teams-Games-Tournaments (TGT) uses teams and format similar to STAD; however, students play academic games to show their individual mastery of the subject matter in weekly tournaments. In Jigsaw, academic material is broken down into sections, teams of two master the sections and in turn instruct other team-mates in their  areas of &quot;expertise.&quot; A case study is presented of a student experiencing the three Student Team Learning techniques.

The sample of 80 students were in elementary, early childhood, and special education programs. Questions posed were: (1) How well do the personal development instruments describe the students? (2) Are there relationships between personal development variables and instructional skill variables? and (3) Which students have extreme ratings of identity and anxiety, and how are these related to their self-ratings on instructional skill variables? The students varied widely on the three personal development variables of identity achievement, state anxiety, and trait anxiety. Personal development variables correlated consistently but moderately with  each other, but the only personal development variable to correlate significantly with instructional skill was trait anxiety, and the only instructional skill to appear consistently in this relationship was classroom management. Students with high identity achievement and low anxieties usually began confidently, realized early success, and made great progress. Students with low identity achievement and high anxieties tended to be slow starters, lacking in confidence and the ability to control children, making progress in spurts rather than gradually, and succeeding only toward the end of student teaching.

        "description":"Physical training is a significant element of Marine Corps basic training which may affect nonfitness basic training outcomes in addition to improving fitness. If so, physical training side effects should be considered when designing and evaluating physical training programs. This study capitalized on naturally occurring platoon differences in fitness outcomes to classify basic training platoons into relatively high and low improvement groups. The high improvement group had better attitudes toward the Marine Corps, greater perceived self-improvement, and performed better during basic training. The groups had comparable illness rates during basic training, but there was more medical attrition and overall attrition in the high improvement group. The groups did not differ with  regard to Fleet Marine Force promotion or attrition rates. These findings demonstrate that physical training programs may indeed influence nonfitness basic training outcomes. Additional research is needed to verify that physical training differences actually cause nonfitness basic training outcomes, to determine whether these side effects are large enough to be of practical importance, and to identify specific aspects of physical training programs that are important for promoting nonfitness basic training objectives.

Recruits from four Marine Corps basic training platoons (n=265) provided data for the study. Scores on the standard physical fitness tests showed that one platoon had substantially above average fitness improvement and another substantially below average improvement. A comparison of these two platoons on attitude and self-esteem measures showed that the high improvement platoon had more positive attitudes toward the Marine Corps and higher self-esteem. The attitudes included greater acceptance of the need for authority and discipline, greater identification with  the Marine Corps, higher commitment to achieving and maintaining high levels of performance, and greater satisfaction with the Marine Corps.

However, some research studies suggest that such efforts, in and of themselves, are unlikely to bring about any real change. Serious commitment is likely to occur only after teachers have had an opportunity to use the new program or innovation and have seen that it really assists them in teaching their students. Since serious teacher commitments rarely occur prior to the implementation of a new program, it is critically important to find alternative ways of encouraging teachers to engage in the new practice. Training by a person judged by the teachers to be credible is essential, and teachers must be  provided with information that is useful and applicable to their daily experiences in the classroom, not theoretical overviews. In a study of Direct Instruction (a highly structured, basic skills approach) teachers' attitudes began to change when they saw positive evidence that this method improved the academic achievement of their students. In Mastery Learning programs, teachers' attitudes changed when they saw improvement in students' performances on weekly tests, and greater student involvement during class sessions. These changes did not occur quickly but evolved over a period of time. (JD)",

A case study is then presented of one teacher's classroom and her goal statements and explanations for her actions (drawn from classroom observations, loosely structured interviews and stimulated recall interviews). The report then describes how the evidence in the case study might be usefully conceptualized in terms of two current models of cognitive processes (script- and schema-theory). Conceptual and methodological difficulties  entailed in using such models are then raised, and the report concludes by presenting an alternative framework for conceptualizing the linkages between teachers accounts of their goals and their actions in the classroom.

The MAT focuses on the character of academic tasks, the nature of the overall task systems that operate in classrooms, and the contexts associated with task accomplishment. The MAT is based on a definition of curriculum as a set of tasks students accomplish. The role of active content instruction in the task systems of four junior high school classes, two in science and two in English, was examined. Case descriptions focus on the circumstances and nature of observed instruction, its relation to students' work, cognitive focus, pedagogical strategies, and problems teachers appeared to encounter in conducting  instruction. Analyses suggest that instruction and instructional problems should be considered in the light of the tasks in which instruction is embedded. It is suggested that the concept of content instruction as a resource for student task accomplishment might serve as a useful way for secondary teachers to think about their teaching. (Author/JD)",

Case studies of three teachers in two schools (one in a rural, the other in an urban district) are presented. Objective characteristics of the school settings (e.g., patterns of material and physical resource distribution) are described in detail. The classrooms of the teachers, and their explanations and justifications of their practices, are then examined. The report concludes by summarizing the patterns of resource distribution operating in the two schools and districts and examining teachers' beliefs about teaching as a form of \"commitments\" to different definitions of teachers. Commitments are then explained in terms of the  interaction of organizational control patterns and teachers' strategies of adaptation to organizational settings. The central theme of the analysis is that teachers' classroom performances are not shaped by the independent influences of contextual constraints and beliefs and intentions, but are instead shaped by the interaction of beliefs and constraints.

Intended for classroom use with senior high school students, the 50 item Test on Appraising Observations is based on a comprehensive set of principles modified from Robert Ennes' conception of good observation appraisal. The test evolved through many versions using methodology developed from the construct validity theory that ability tests are valid to the extent that good thinking leads to good test performance and that poor thinking leads to bad test performance. The methodology involved the systematic collection of thinking about protocols of examinees while they worked through test questions. Data collection and analysis for two experimental  test versions are described in detail. Item and test statistics for the final version were collected from four southern Ontario high schools and compared to results of two other critical thinking tests. The appendices contain two versions of the Test on Appraising Observations; the Test on Assessing the Believability of Observation Statements; the Observation Test Interview Model, B; the Instruction Sheet to Cooperating Teachers; and the answer key and principles tested per item.

        "description":"Wait time, or the pauses between questions and responses, has been demonstrated to be an important factor influencing classroom learning. This paper reviews the key variables that have emerged in wait time research over the past 20 years. Progress in defining and measuring wait time has resulted in improved methodology for wait time research. Teacher training procedures have been improved through the use of several techniques, including modeling, pause feedback teaching aids, and strategies for modification of traditional classroom recitations, which lead to inquiry-based guided discussions and interactional dialogue patterns. Further research is needed to measure the effects of pauses and interaction patterns on affective transactions in the classroom. Research linking wait time  variables with achievement outcomes is also needed. (GDC)",

Data were collected concerning student attitudes toward such large classes: demographic characteristics, enjoyment rating, essentials for learning, preferred class size, and characteristics of large classes. In addition, direct observational data were collected, the cognitive levels of instructors' tests were studied, and instructor interviews were conducted. It was concluded that (1) most students and teachers prefer class size to be under 50 people; (2) adequate facilities and audiovisual support are  important; (3) students enjoy large classes more if they are tested at higher cognitive levels as in essay tests; (4) student participation increases as class size decreases; and (5) effective instructors are enthusiastic and knowledgeable lecturers and interact with the students well.

Nine bootstrap samples of N=10 and nine more bootstrap samples of N=25 were randomly selected. One thousand random samples were selected from each of the 18 bootstrap samples, and its mean and standard deviation were calculated. The cumulative means and standard deviations diverged from the parameter values as often, and to the same extent, as they converged toward them. It was also concluded that the bootstrap procedure was biased because it did not continue to approach the universe parameter as the number of iterations increased. The limit of convergence was not the universe  parameter. Hence, the bootstrap hypothesis regarding point estimates of means and standard deviations was not supported. (Author/GDC)",

The tasks involved informative, persuasive, and imaginative writing, and were evaluated at one of four levels of success: unsatisfactory; rudimentary or minimal performance; satisfactory; or detailed and controlled performance. In the informative or explanatory task, one-fourth of the fourth and over half of the eighth and eleventh graders were rated as satisfactory or higher. In another explanatory writing task, over half of the fourth graders were unable to perform the task, but 80-85 percent of the eighth and eleventh graders achieved satisfactory or better results. In a persuasive writing task, four percent of the fourth, 14 percent of the  eighth, and 21 percent of the eleventh graders wrote adequately and extensively supported essays. In an imaginative writing exercise about ghosts, 86 percent of the fourth, 91 percent of the eighth, and 95 percent of the eleventh graders achieved satisfactory or better results. Ratings on another imaginative exercise were lower. The 1986 NAEP will include reading, mathematics, science, computers, United States history, and literature. (GDC)",

The rating scale covered: (1) attainment of learning objectives; (2) progress during the clerkship; (3) overall performance, (4) frequency of contact between student and rater (number of patients discussed); and (5) confidence in the rating, to indicate raters' metacognition. A two-factor analysis of variance was performed on the results to explore the relationships among rater accuracy, level of contact, and rater confidence in the score assigned. It was concluded that confidence in the validity of a rating was not  related to the accuracy of that rating. Level of rater-student contact was, however, related to accuracy, with the most accurate ratings based upon discussion of seven to eleven patients. Low levels of contact were associated with overly stringent ratings, and high levels of contact were associated with lenient ratings. Individual raters differed in the leniency of scores, the tendency to make extreme judgments, and confidence in each rating. (GDC)",

Two feedback treatments were used: knowledge of results--whether the response was correct or incorrect; and information--an explanation of the errors and strategies for correcting them. Cognitive styles, the moderator variables, were field dependence-independence and conceptual tempo (reflectivity-impulsivity). Four measures of performance were used as dependent variables: response time, error rate, number of attempts on each item, and number correct  score. The results indicated that field dependent subjects had faster response times and fewer response errors when given an explanation of their errors and strategies for correcting them. Field independent subjects had lower response rates and fewer errors when given only an indication that an error had been made. Age and sex had minor effects on response time for some items.

LOTUS 1 2 3 is a versatile, commonly available, and well-known electronic spreadsheet package. Spreadsheets were originally designed to emulate financial ledgers and balance sheets. They are useful for estimating projected costs and for simplified budgets. Subtotals and totals for a number of categories are automatically updated when an amount is changed. Similar techniques may be used to collect, code, sort, and analyze research data--a particularly useful technique for tabulating questionnaire responses. It is also possible to enter questionnaire responses into the spreadsheet while conducting a telephone interview. Several  commands may be chained together into a macro, in order to simplify data entry at the terminal. LOTUS can be programmed to perform statistical procedures, and can sort and graph data. Data are stored on a floppy diskette and may be transferred to a mainframe computer, word processor, or software package. The amount of data which can fit into a spreadsheet is limited by the amount of memory capacity of the hardware system and the ease of moving around many screens of data. (GDC)",

The test developers are making a significant educational contribution by describing the reciprocal and dynamic relationship between language and thinking. Reading comprehension has been characterized by two general cognitive processes: understanding the structure of a text, and using metacognitive strategies to facilitate understanding of the text. Other cognitive skills involved in reading are concept formation, relating concepts to each other and to a larger framework, problem solving, and critical reflection. Writing also requires skillful use of these same cognitive activities. Successful readers and successful writers are  effective precisely because they have developed the thinking abilities which underlie the processes of reading and writing. A project conducted at La Guardia Community College supports the usefulness of ETS's test, which identifies thinking abilities of the reading and writing processes. Courses in reading, writing, and speech have been taught and linked to a critical thinking course. Faculty reaction to this approach has been positive. The results suggest that approaching language as a thinking process is appropriate and effective. (GDC)",

Competency testing programs are implemented at three distinct levels: (1) before entrance into a teacher education program near the end of the sophomore year in college; (2) at the end of teacher education near the end of the senior year in college or during the first year of teaching; or, (3) for certification renewal as mandated by the state. The paper includes an update on the teacher certification testing activities across the United States as well as a discussion of some of the issues and concerns associated with such programs. While certification testing appears to offer a solution to certain problems and issues  related to quality control and selection, it also raises a series of new problems and issues which should be addressed by states which are considering the development and implementation of competency testing for certification.

All or part of the samples in the studies were non-Americans who had not been a part of the populations presented in the DIT manual. The studies were aimed at the comparison of moral reasoning structure and development across cultures. Several aspects of the findings were reviewed: (1) the psychometric properties of cultural versions of the DIT; (2) effects of the examinee's ethnic background; (3) age and education trends; (4) sex differences; (5) correlations with other psychological tests; (6) religious differences; (7) urban-rural milieu; (8) delinquent behavior; and (9) familial and social factors. The studies reviewed in this report satisfy the evaluation criterion of the  generalizability of psychological theories developed in one culture to another culture. The DIT seems to have cross-cultural validity in detecting moral reasoning structure and its development in cultures outside the United States. The validation and explanation roles of the DIT in cross-cultural studies should be pursued together. (DWH)",

The items from two forms of these ASVAB verbal subtests were rated on five conceptualized cognitive storage processes: (1) perceptual processing; (2) executive or control processing; (3) short term storage--lexical access semantic, and syntactic analysis; (4) long-term storage of information structures; and (5) selection and execution of the response. The relative effects of the cognitive dimensions on Rasch model item difficulties were assessed for eight groups of army applicants and personnel, using linear logistic latent trait methods. Analyses  suggested that these cognitive processing variables were related to item difficulty. The logistic latent trait models predicted from 17 to 30 percent of the variance in the item difficulty values estimated by the Rasch models for the word knowledge items. However, results for the paragraph comprehension items were inconclusive. Sample test items are included. (GDC)",

GRE scoring procedures had recently changed, from a scoring formula which corrected for guessing, to number-right scoring. The three-parameter theory was used to assess (1) the effect of this scoring change on the probability of a correct response; (2) differences in the probability of correct response for each of the four item types (analogies, antonyms, sentence completion, and reading comprehension); and (3) prediction of guessing according to differences in probabilities of correct response. The LOGIST computer program was used to estimate item, person, and c-parameters. Analysis of  variance indicated that differences attributable to scoring instructions were small and not significant. For three of the four item types, the mean c-parameter was 15 to 20 percent lower than what would have occurred from random guessing. For the antonym item type, however, the mean c was equal to the probability expected from random guessing. Although some issues were raised suggesting further research needs, it was concluded that item response c-parameter theory was suitable for studying guessing. (GDC)",

The sample included children in grades three to six, as well as adults. The FES was administered to the adults twice, with a one-week interval. FACES-II was administered to the children twice, separated by a week. Item analyses, internal consistency and test-retest reliability coefficients, and factor analyses were conducted. Results indicated that the cohesion, conflict, and active-recreation scales of the FES had more acceptable psychometric characteristics than the FACES-II. The test-retest reliability results were higher than the  internal consistency coefficients, indicating that the measures detected reliable variance, but these were not sensitively reflected in the preidentified scales. Both internal consistency and test-retest reliability coefficients varied by ethnic group, with the highest reliability among Anglo respondents. It was concluded that investigators interested in the cohesion, conflict, or active-recreational dimensions of family functioning in minority group populations should use Moos' and Moos' Family Environment Scales.

        "author":["Reuter, Lutz-Rainer"],
        "description":"West Germany represents a typical case of how most West European countries have dealt with labor migration, common since World War II. West Germany's foreign workers are called &quot;Gastarbeiter&quot; (guestworkers), which implies that they are in Germany at the behest of the Germans, and for only a short period of time. Nonetheless, statistics show that the number of foreign workers is less than the number of foreign residents. This indicates that social immigration is occurring more often than simple transitory labor migration, that West Germany has indeed become an immigration country. Furthermore, the migrant population is apparently undergoing a process of normalization (i.e., the wage earner's separation from his family and the male/female imbalance in the foreign population are  being eliminated). This makes necessary an immigration policy that addresses the needs of the new immigrants for social integration, higher social status, and, especially, improved employment prospects. Because the Gastarbeiter are concentrated in positions requiring less education, they are the most vulnerable to job loss and discrimination in personnel policy. Existing systems for educating immigrants include bilingual programs (allegedly, to give the chance of return to the origin country), but these actually help to hold immigrants at the lowest social step. The immigrants and their children must be given the linguistic and cultural means of integration that will, in turn, improve their employment prospects. (The paper concludes with a list of recommendations for migration policy and  intercultural education; nine statistical tables are appended.) (KH)",

The report covers 1983-84, the first year of implementation. Recruitment efforts were extensive and the anticipated enrollment of 2,886 city students into county schools could have been met but for a court stay on additional transfers. Although numbers of transfers were good, it was recognized that in future it will be necessary to increase the number of transfers from county to city schools. Parents were given the opportunity to visit the new schools with their children.  Involvement in this program of students, parents, teachers, and administrators throughout the St. Louis metropolitan area was significant. The range of part-time program opportunities was broad in numbers and scope. The VICC approved a research project to provide feedback to assist the implementation of the settlement agreement in future years. Data collected by the VICC after a year of operation shows that transfer students are becoming an integral part of their new schools. Seven percent of students transferring city to county were referred for special education evaluation; 93 percent of students had no major disciplinary problems; and 90 percent were promoted. The attendance rate was commendable. The overall acceptance of the settlement agreement has been noticeable. Appendices list  VICC and subcommittee membership, supply samples of recruitment and publicity materials, and provide information on part-time programs. (RDN)",

In choosing to establish Hebrew as its standard language, Israel was working to proclaim both present and historical unity. The rapidity with which the language spread, the comparative ease with which large numbers of migrants came to use it, the skill with which it was developed for new domains of modern life, should not be permitted, however, to obscure one of the costs. In Israel, as in much of the modern world, children come to school speaking a language or a dialect different from the one valued by the school system. Failure to recognize this means that many  children, whether their home language is different from the standard or a stigmatized variant of it, face a barrier to their education. Educational linguistics, a field that is well developed in Israel, provides a means of studying this problem and of working to provide equal educational opportunity for all students in a multilingual society.

The project was planned to develop English language skills, to reinforce Spanish language skills, to offer counseling support services, and to provide career guidance information. Students from Theodore Roosevelt High School were to tutor project participants in English reading. Project implementation was delayed for a number of reasons. Nevertheless, the project director was able to identify and establish contact with the new participating sites; review student records to determine student eligibility; advertise and interview condidates for staff positions;  hire hourly personnel to develop career awareness curriculum; and identify, review, and purchase textbooks, workbooks, reference books, instructional supplies, and audiovisual materials. For the second year of the project it is recommended that (1) hiring and orienting of staff be expedited; and (2) given the modified project's reduced staff, the most fundamental component, instruction, be given priority.

The organization aims to improve the language skills of pupils with low academic achievement through intensive participation in creative arts activities. In 1983-84, the program served 305 second, third, and fourth graders from eight schools in Manhattan and Queens. The major findings of this evaluation were as follows: (1) in 1983-84, for the first time in five years, the reading achievement goal was not achieved; (2) no significant improvements in attendance were found but school attendance rates were high (over 90%); (3) reading and arts instruction were implemented as proposed; (4) psychological and social work services were provided only for students at the Manhattan site, where  the services were rated as moderately to very successful; (5) staff members felt that they had received sufficient training for the program; and (6) staff, home school teachers, principals, and parents believed that the program was worthwhile for participating children. The following recommendations were made: develop different measures to guage the program's impact; eliminate the psychological component; establish formal contact between C.A.C. and home school staff to discuss students' progress; and initiate standardized orientation training sessions for all home school teachers.

In 1983-84, the program was offered to a total of 625 general education students, 140 bilingual students, and 100 special education students (all in grades 2-6). Reading performance of general education students was measured by the reading subtests of the California Achievement Test. The overall mean gain for the fall-to-spring comparison was 13.1 normal curve equivalents (N.C.E.s); the spring-to-spring gain was 6.7 N.C.E.s. Statistically significant gains were found for each grade level except for grade three on the spring-to-spring comparison. Reading performance of the bilingual and special education  students was measured by a criterion-referenced test, the Wisconsin Design Skill Development Test. Eighty-one percent of bilingual students and 87 percent of special education students met or exceeded their mastery criterion. Students' writing performance was assessed by a holistically scored writing sample. All groups demonstrated some improvement in writing performance from pretest to posttest. A pretest-posttest improvement in attitudes toward reading was found among general education students. The following recommendations were made for program improvements: (1) there is a need for staff development sessions to address the lower performance of third-grade general education students; and (2) greater emphasis should be placed upon instruction in language expression skills at all grade  levels.

Program objectives were to (1) provide teachers with in-depth knowledge of archaeology and African cultures; (2) encourage teachers to implement related classroom activities; (3) improve teachers' ability to teach gifted and talented students; and (4) facilitate the development of a teachers' guide to museums' archaeological resources.  Thirty-two teachers attended four two-hour seminars at each museum. The program provided enrichment experiences for 32 teachers who taught lessons and offered classroom activities based on their workshop sessions.

Mentor consists of a series of one-day activity sessions and includes visits to state and federal courts and several supplementary activities such as mock-trial competitions. Each of the 22 junior and senior high schools participating in the program was paired with a New York City general practice law firm or a legal department. Evaluation findings indicate that participating students' knowledge of and attitude towards the law improved during the course of the program. Teachers found the newly  developed Mentor manual helpful and the training sessions worthwhile. Attorneys applauded the school system's effort to provide students with a realistic view of the legal profession. For the future it is recommended that (1) schools and law firms be paired early enough to allow for more program preparation, (2) a greater number of less academically prepared students be included, and (3) the feasibility of extending the program to a full year be explored.

The program also attempts to acclimatize students to American life and culture. Available data suggests that T.P.R.C. students are progressing in their knowledge of English syntax and mathematics. Generalizations about progress of the whole group are tentative, due to problems experienced in collecting information. Difficulties were aggravated further by the late receipt of funds. A further problem was that of identifying refugee  students. The Immigration and Naturalization Service decides who should be awarded refugee status, but there is no accepted definition of refugee.

The original program goal was to provide talented Haitian limited English proficiency (LEP) students with the opportunity to gain proficiency in English while continuing to develop their academic skills. The project proposed to use instructional assistants and aides to supplement each school's bilingual services. However, as only one of the schools had a basic bilingual program, at the other two  Project KANPE became the basic skills program. Curriculum development, likewise, could only be a major component of the program at one of the schools. At that school, staff development and parent involvement were promoted. Students were assessed in English language development; growth in mastery of the native tongue; mathematics, science, and social studies; attitude toward school and cultural heritage; and attendance.

Analyses indicated that there was a strong relationship between program attendance and student mastery of career education skills and a moderate relationship between attendance and mastery of daily living skills. These relationships were stronger than those observed in previous program cycles. The program continued to implement recommendations from previous cycles for early preplanning. In addition, in  response to the evaluation of the 1981-82 program, assessment of student progress was linked to ongoing instructional planning, which was expanded to include activities of daily living skills as well as career education.

Five schools participated as &quot;demonstrators&quot; because they were judged to have noteworthy holding power programs. Five additional &quot;buddy&quot; schools were chosen by the principals of the demonstrator schools. Each of the ten schools was allocated $100,000 to expand and improve holding power strategies aimed at incoming students. Spending was at the principals' discretion; in general, the trend was to use the funds for additional staff and staff time. The schools did not use uniform criteria in selecting program participants: though each school targeted ninth graders, two schools targeted some tenth graders as  well. Attendance monitoring was an important facet of the holding power program at all ten schools. In addition, all but one school placed primary focus on one or more of the following: high-interest classes, counseling, and concentrated staff time for small groups of students. Student outcomes showed that the most successful schools were generally those which served only special groups of ninth graders and had a large number of holding power program components. As a whole, targeted students showed higher attendance, promotional, and achievement rates than their comparison groups. (KH)",

In its pilot phase (from March to June, 1984), the project linked 13 school districts with 13 arts agencies to provide arts programming for 117 schools in all 5 boroughs, serving an estimated 19,000 students. An evaluation of the pilot phase found that, in general, the program operated well. Participants were very pleased with the program, believed that it had a positive impact on students, and wanted it to continue. The program goal of promoting positive student social development by channeling energies into arts activities was successful.  Artists established a creative relationship with students in assigned workshop classes and learned about the students' artistic interests. Teachers, in turn, learned about innovative art techniques. The evaluation produced four general recommendations for program enhancement: (1) complete, early planning is crucial to success; (2) to ensure that arts programming is a collaborative effort among districts, awareness about the diversity of arts activities should be increased throughout the districts; (3) each school should appoint a school coordinator to be responsible for implementing the program; and (4) all districts should evaluate their programs with appropriate pre- and posttest measures.

An evaluation of the five schools found that, in general, the program succeeded in encouraging students to engage in cooperative social interactions. The attendance data for the program  participants indicated that attendance was generally high for the magnet school students although, as in the general school population, the attendance rate did decrease slightly over the course of the school year. The frequency of suspensions was low for students in the magnet programs.

        "description":"Employer recruitment methods and how their use varies by race and sex groups, by public and private sector, by education level, and other variables were studied to develop and examine more realistic theories of education's role in career development processes and to develop practical ways to help students make a successful transition from school to work. The job recruitment activities of employers and the job search activities used by employees (aged 22-25) to fill openings in a nationally representative sample of jobs were examined from a survey of 4,078 employers. Major findings include the following: (1) particular methods are associated with high education level jobs (school placement, professional organizations, private employment agencies, and media ads), while other  methods are associated with low education level jobs (use of friends and relatives, public employment services, and unions); (2) high school placement services are infrequently used by employers or graduates to fill or get low education level jobs, but are used occasionally in recruitment for female office jobs; (3) social networks to which whites are attached are more useful for access to higher level jobs than are the social networks to which blacks are attached. Also for blacks, social networks are less useful for finding private sector jobs and some higher paying jobs in desegregated environments; and (4) jobs filled by women make less use of union referrals and more use of direct applications and media ads.

        "description":"The effect of job candidates' race on employers' job placement decisions was examined through an experiment in which white personnel officers were presented with a vignette describing a particular candidate, told that their company had employed that person, and asked what sort of position that person is likely to be hired in. The results suggest that white personnel officers tend to assign black male high school graduates to lower paying positions than those assigned to white male high school graduates. Similar patterns were observed for black female college graduates. However, these patterns of apparent bias in job placement were found to be offset to some degree in firms with strong affirmative action policies. These findings do not indicate whether a particular placement  officer's racial bias reflects a personal distaste for blacks (\"old fashioned prejudice\") or what Lester Thurow has called \"statistical discrimination\" --using the color of the respondent as a source of information based on actual or putative correlations between race and job-related skills and attitudes. In either case, however, the job applicant is being responded to only as a member of a racial minority group. (KH)",

The students were nearly all non-Hispanic American blacks, and a few were of Puerto Rican or West Indian ancestry. The main finding was that the desegregated black students obtained different types of employment than did the students in the control group. The desegregated students are now working in occupations which are less commonly held by blacks: for instance, men are salesmen rather than postmen, while women are secretaries rather than nurses' aides. In  general, those who experienced desegregated schooling are more likely to be working in white collar and professional jobs in the private sector, while those from segregated schools are more likely to be working in government and in blue-collar jobs.

        "description":"As part of a review of California's strategy for helping recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) find jobs through the Work Incentive Program (WIN), eight demonstration programs were analyzed. There were four major findings. First, the Department of Social Services (DSS), which targets AFDC recipients with recent job experience for WIN employment and training services, should instead target AFDC recipients who lack recent work experience. To that end, legislation is needed to redesign State employment and training programs. Furthermore, increases in participant earnings, not placement rates, should be made the primary measure of the success of employment programs. Second, the most cost-effective services are job search and skill training services. Third,  State and local coordination of WIN and Job Training Partnership Act services is essential if their impact on increasing participant earnings and reducing AFDC is to be maximized. Local WIN managers should be given responsibility for determining the types of services provided locally, and legislation should be created that requires DSS to develop guidelines and procedures for supplying local managers with the information needed to determine the types of services appropriate to different economic conditions. And fourth, the two primary goals of the WIN program are to reduce welfare dependency by increasing the earning power of AFDC recipients and to reduce AFDC grant expenditures. To address both goals, a two-tiered strategy is required. (KH)",

A total of 1,381 employers in Vermont and New Hampshire were surveyed through a mailed questionnaire, with a return rate of 518 employers (38 percent). Most employed 10 persons or fewer. The study found that most employers responding to the survey appeared to be heavily involved in training and/or retraining of currently employed workers. Of the 306 respondents who identified the types of training programs they conducted, 272 (89 percent) used on-the-job training. Employers also revealed that on-the-job training was often supplemented with orientation, self-directed learning packets, technical  workshops, employer-based apprenticeship, and factory/commercial training courses. Employers also seemed very interested in identifying additional training opportunities for their employees. As a result of the study the following actions were taken: (1) an adult education advisory committee was established at the Hartford Center, and (2) a plan was developed for offering skill development services in addition to the employee training activities provided by area employers.

        "description":"This paper reviews and classifies adult career problems and interventions reported in the vocational literature from 1979 to 1984. Campbell and Cellini's (1981) taxonomy of adult career problems was used to classify reports of vocational problems. The categories presented by Holland, Magoon, and Spokane (1981) were employed to classify interventions. A \"problem-treatment matrix\" was produced that indicated a significant relationship betwwen vocational problems and interventions, with an almost exclusive reliance on individual counseling, and a predominant concern about problems affecting job performance. Thus, adequate preparation of counselors working in this area must include skill development related to identification and treatment of performance problems, especially alcohol  abuse, in addition to the traditional emphasis on vocational choice. The benefits of individual counseling were not proven in the research reviewed. Future research in this area needs to become more evaluative, particularly as meta-analytic methods of analyzing aggregate data continue to develop. Finally, Campbell and Cellini's taxonomy proved to be fairly comprehensive and inclusive, although stress-related and career transition problems were often difficult to classify. Further work with the problem taxonomy seems warranted. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"For almost 20 years, from 1917 to the 1930s, the traveling Chautauqua circuits and festivals brought education, inspiration, and entertainment to remote and not-so-remote communities. Now in the 1980s, emphasis is once more being placed on the value of local community life, on self-reliance and mutual help with respect to the social, cultural, and economic well-being of communities. A revised 1980s version of the Chautauqua ideal may provide one of the catalysts for this movement across Canada. This handbook is meant to be used as an aid in planning and conducting a community Chautauqua, an event that could become an annual tradition. In a narrative format, the booklet covers the following topics: the Chautauqua coordinator, the Chautauqua committee, sponsorship, program ideas,  surveying the community, holding a public meeting, assigning jobs, beginning the detailed planning, planning ahead, coordinator's checklist, budgeting, concessions and vendors, charging admission, promotion and publicity, legal and administrative considerations, site management, and wrapping it all up. A contact person's name and address are given. Appendixes to the guide list resources, provide pointers on site selection, and describe a community Chautauqua example. (KC)",

        "description":"Recent studies conducted in developing nations throughout the world have made it possible to formulate a political theory of literacy for development that clarifies relationships between development ideologies and literacy policies and thus provides a greater understanding of the choices and decisions made by policymakers and planners. Depending on whether its development ideology is gradualist, reformist, or revolutionary, a nation's literacy policy will tend to follow either (1) the motivational-developmental model, (2) the planned development model, or (3) the structural-developmental model. An examination of the literacy policies of the nine countries of the Southern African Development Cooperation Conference (SADCC) reveals that a definite relationship exists between the  development ideologies of the regimes of the individual nations in the conference and their national literacy policies. Thus, although literacy promotion is not a part of the formal SADCC strategy for development, individual member-nations of the conference such as Tanzania and Zimbabwe are pursuing aggressive literacy policies. Some of their more moderate fellow members in the SADCC such as Zambia and Botswana, on the other hand, are pursuing literacy policies that could more aptly be termed as following the planned development model. The proposed connection between a nation's development ideology and literacy policies would also explain why Malawi, Lesotho, and Swaziland do not at present have active plans for universal literacy.

Unfortunately, managers typically digress to a simple cost analysis and ignore the realities of cost-benefit analysis and the potential of large financial benefits to the organization. A proposed model to forecast training costs and benefits identifies generic categories of training costs for summarizing those costs that may be unique to the reader's organization. Categories for costs incurred from losses of time, material, and production/performance are included. An important part of the Training Benefit Forecast Method (TBFM) is the value of performance. Performance value is defined as the worth of performance units produced in dollars. Making valid  comparisons of alternative training options requires the analyst to set a base time period to be used in calculating performance values for each training option. A case study is provided of the benefit analysis of three training options under consideration by a manufacturer. Tables illustrate the cost and benefit analyses. (YLB)",

Research and related literature suggested that a model for forecasting the economic benefits of training should include facility to identify and summarize costs and provide an assessment of the value of the resulting performance for a specified time period. The model (STCBFM) required that the increases in performance values, minus the training costs, and the resulting benefits be determined. The specific program addressed in the validation effort was a Geometric Dimension and Tolerance training program conducted at Onan Corporation, a manufacturing firm, in 1983. Participants were 136 employees who attended sessions before or after work hours.  Four individuals composing a forecast group were presented with the model and asked to make forecasts regarding the costs and resulting benefits to be derived from the training program using minimal available information, such as shop rates, production down time, and current problem resolution time. All the forecasts proved to be conservative. The analysis of the actual cost-benefit reinforced the predictions made by the forecast group. (A paper describing the model is appended.) (YLB)",

An individual who was unfamiliar with any of the particulars of actual costs and activities associated with the training projects made cost benefit forecasts for the two options.

Exploitation predates the age of industry; it is not the sole province of industry and business. Worker responses to exploitation in the evolving industrial democracy have taken the form of labor unions, political clubs, credit unions, and recreational clubs. Business and industry have not eradicated exploitation but have come a long way in neutralizing its effects through concern with quality of product, service, and work life. The complexity of modern industry and business and the multiplicity of interrelationships require a new model to explain the concept of exploitation as its relates to the workplace. It must delineate relationships where the possibility  of exploitation exists and describe what constitutes the absence or neutralization of exploitation. In a two-axis matrix, the environment of industry and business is broken down into groups of interested parties: owners, employees, and society at large. All of the groups exist in a state of tension because each seeks its own advantage. A line of equilibrium indicates the points at which the gains of both parties in the relationships are equivalent.

        "description":"Vocational education has been greatly increasing its services to special needs populations. For example, the enrollments reported by the states for school year 1982-83 indicate a 38 percent increase in the number of handicapped persons served in vocational education, a 65 percent increase in the number of disadvantaged served, and a 163 percent increase in the number of limited English speaking (LEP) students served in vocational education since 1980-81. The Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act sets forth the following new emphases: (1) the provision of information to handicapped, disadvantaged, and LEP students regarding the opportunities available in vocational education; (2) the requirement that each handicapped, disadvantaged, or LEP student enrolling in vocational  education receive an assessment of his or her interests, abilities, and special needs with respect to completing a vocational education program successfully; and (3) the mandate of counseling services to facilitate the transition of handicapped and disadvantaged students from school to employment. The Vocational Education Act also contains, for the first time, equal access language as it pertains to these populations. Special needs vocational educators have a tremendous responsibility in ensuring that these laws are followed and that vocational education is responsive to the special needs of handicapped, disadvantaged, and limited English proficiency students.

        "description":"In recent years, many dramatic changes have occurred in the field of adult and continuing education. Enrollments in the Federal adult basic education (ABE) effort alone have increased from 536,000 in 1970 to over 2.5 million students in 1985, with over one-fourth of these participants being Black or Hispanic. In 1985, Congress has reauthorized the legislative mandates for the adult vocational education programs, the national literacy effort has continued its efforts to bring the issue of adult literacy to national focus, and private sector involvement and support have continued in all areas of adult education. Included among the many projects in the area of adult education currently receiving support from the Department of Education (DOE) are the following: ADVOC-NET, a  telecommunications network designed to increase cooperation among leaders in adult and vocational education; the National Literacy Awareness Campaign, an effort to recruit volunteer leaders and tutors; and the Federal Employee Literacy Training (FELT) Program. In addition, DOE has established a number of task forces to examine ways of enhancing opportunities in adult education. Two particularly noteworthy task forces are one focusing on ways of infusing entrepreneurship education throughout the U.S. educational system and another that is involved in devising ways to increase the Nation's defense preparedness by raising basic skills levels among members of the Armed Forces to meet military job needs.

        "description":"Consumer education can be defined as &quot;a study of intelligent and effective methods of buying and using goods and services, competent money management, and the relationship of the consumer to the economy, the workplace, and the home.&quot; An important role of government is providing the individual with information so that the individual can exercise the option of choice provided by our system of government. On the Federal level, consumer education cuts across all departmental and agency lines. As a result of the Education Act of 1972, the Federal Government became involved in consumer education. Most junior and senior high schools today offer some courses in consumer economics as part of the home economics program or as part of marketing education, business education, or social  studies. However, these programs are funded by a much larger percentage of state and local funds than Federal funds. The challenge today is to get consumer information to the people who need it the most, including those who are disadvantaged or illiterate. Efforts should be made to use television, outreach programs, newspapers, and basic education courses as vehicles to bring consumer education to a larger proportion of the population, especially to those who need it the most. Officials at the national level encourage activities to support strong private and voluntary activity and partnerships for consumer education. (KC)",

        "description":"The primary purpose of this monograph is to describe how learning curves can be applied to vocational evaluation procedures to enhance the reliability and accuracy of performance prediction. Particular emphasis is placed on describing two techniques known as the &quot;best 20 percent method&quot; and the &quot;Performance Analyzer and Enhancer.&quot; The latter is a computer software program designed for use with inexpensive microcomputers in both vocational evaluation and work adjustment services. Together, they represent an effective and practical approach to learning curve applications in typical vocational evaluation settings. Three other approaches to learning curve use are also described. They range in complexity from Tillman's simple notion of constantly readministering a task and plotting  performance until &quot;peak performance&quot; is achieved, to sophisticated learning curve equations. Each of these techniques, while having significant limitations, also has much to offer current vocational evaluation practice. However, learning curve technology should be viewed as a complement to current vocational evaluation practices. It provides an additional means for better understanding client capabilities and limitations. Continued research and field testing, along with an increased emphasis among educators on providing training in learning curve technology to professional evaluation personnel, will perhaps lead to a wider use of learning curves in vocational evaluation programs as well as further refinement and improvement of many of the methods and techniques presented in this  monograph.

        "description":"The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners do not express the basic principle that would support a serious educational approach to prison administration. The crucial missing rationale is the concept of the inherent dignity of the individual human prisoner. This concept has certain basic educational implications, culminating in the concept of education directed to the development of the total human personality. Such a concept is quite foreign to contemporary approaches to prison administration. In actual practice, prison education is seen as a tool of incarcerational technology. Prison education, which normally includes both academic and vocational programs inside prison walls, is mostly of inferior quality. Most prison authorities attach little value  to conventional educational programs, and the idea of rehabilitation is largely being abandoned. The role of the prison is often reduced to the protection of society. A case for prison education should be approached from the ideas of right and fraternal obligation to fellow men. The educational approach to prison administration possesses characteristics related to these topics: the prisoner as a person, the prison as educational, and the educational model and justice. The Rules should be amended to express recognition of the principle of the dignity of the human person. (YLB)",

The following are the major changes to the Adult Education Act regulations: (1) the definition of &quot;adult&quot; was changed to permit services to persons under the age of 16 in some cases; (2) the definition of &quot;expansion&quot; has been modified to include &quot;efforts&quot; to increase enrollments, rather than just &quot;results&quot;; (3) the Act permits the Department of Education to collect demographic and statistical information as simply as possible; (4) the regulations governing state advisory councils are much less prescriptive; (5) expenditures for administration are not limited by a percentage; (6) for-profit agencies can apply for funds; (7) all applications for funding are to be  reviewed; and (8) multi-year rather than annual projects are now allowed. The following are some of the issues being discussed concerning the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act: (1) the need to make vocational education programs accessible to all persons, and the need to improve the quality of vocational education programs in order to improve productivity and promote economic growth; (2) the problem of excess cost regulations, which reduce the amount spent on special populations; (3) an inequitable ratio for funding programs for persons with limited English proficiency; and (4) vague provisions.

To meet the mandate for linkages and collaboration that appears in the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act of 1984, the Department of Education (DOE) has taken the following steps: (1) formulation of an interagency agreement with the Department of Labor to coordinate apprenticeship training and vocational education activities; (2) development of collaborative linkages with the Department of Defense to ensure that the U.S. civilian labor force has the skills needed by defense-related industries; (3) provision of funds for a  project, entitled the Precision Metalworking Skills Project, to enhance the skills and qualifications of persons entering skilled trades in the area of precision metalworking and to encourage students to consider a career in that field (in which a trade shortage of 238,000 workers over the next five years is projected); (4) establishment of awards to identify outstanding vocational education programs; and (5) organization of the Business-Higher Education Forum to encourage cooperation and collaboration among representives of the business and academic communities in the United States.

Perkins Vocational Education Act authorizes the use of community-based organizations of proven effectiveness, such as Opportunities Industrialization Centers of America (OIC), to be involved in improving the overall vocational education delivery system. State assistance for vocational education support by community-based organizations is one of five special programs authorized by Title III of the Act. The Act encourages eligible recipients who are operating vocational education programs to develop relationships with community-based organizations. The Act requires each community-based organization that wants assistance under Title III to submit jointly with the appropriate eligible recipient a specified application to the state board. States will provide financial  assistance to joint projects of community-based organizations within the state that provide the following special vocational education services and activities: outreach programs, prevocational educational preparation and basic skills development, special prevocational programs targeted to disadvantaged youth, career intern programs, student needs assessment, and guidance and counseling. Because of financial constraints and a shift in educational emphasis arising from the &quot;A Nation at Risk&quot; report, community-based organizations such as OIC will probably have more opportunity to be involved in vocational education in the future.

        "description":"The emphasis on achieving sex equity, begun under the Education Amendments of 1976, continues and expands with the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act. As in the 1976 amendments, the states are required to assign one person full-time responsibility for fulfilling mandated functions relative to sex equity. However, the new Act provides the financial resources necessary to meet the vocational needs of special populations and reduce sex stereotyping and bias in vocational education. The Act accomplishes this through two set-asides: one for single parents and homemakers, the other for young women and sex equity programs. The Act requires that the sex equity coordinator gather, analyze, and disseminate data on the adequacy and effectiveness of vocational education in meeting the  educational and employment needs of women. The Act also provides for activities for displaced homemakers who want to develop home-based or small businesses; employer-linked training leading to placement of women in nontraditional jobs; a sex equity resources center; mini-grants to local school districts; and a statewide program to identify and tap the talents of women who have the potential for upward mobility. To implement these provisions, local planners can draw inspiration from exemplary programs such as those conducted in several states and localities. The role of the sex equity coordinator in all of these actions is extremely important. (KC)",

The modules are suitable for the preparation of teachers and other occupational trainers in all occupational areas. This module provides five learning experiences that integrate theory and application on the subject of conducting an occupational analysis. Each learning experience consists of an overview, an enabling objective, required and optional activities, and a self-check. A criterion-referenced  assessment of the teacher's performance of the specified competency completes the module. The module covers the following topics: defining the scope of an occupational analysis; preparing an initial listing of duty and task statements by partially analyzing a selected occupation; verifying an initial listing of task and duty statements; and analyzing and reporting task inventory data.

The sample, which was balanced in terms of sex, type of disability, and area of residence (rural versus urban), was biased in favor of individuals having greater employability deficits (persons served by sheltered workshops or a comprehensive rehabilitation center). Approximately half of the sample was employed in competitive work, with about one-fifth of the sample having been unemployed since their exit from a vocational rehabilitation program. Seventy-two percent were helped by rehabilitation services at least to some degree; of those reporting dissatisfaction with the rehabilitation services they received, 79 percent cited inadequate  vocational training as their primary complaint. One-fifth of the sample indicated problems in working with supervisors and coworkers, meeting the demands of their jobs, and knowing how to get raises or promotions. One-third of those interviewed reported problems in learning about better jobs or promotions. From these results came recommendations for continued emphasis on such placement services as job-seeking skills training, career development programs, job clubs, postemployment counseling, job development services, and direct interventions with employers.

The college president's perspective is provided by including a 9-page paper by H. James Owen entitled \"High Technology and General Education\". Mr. Owen is President of the Tri-Cities State Technical Institute, Blountville, Tennessee. The bibliographic sources are provided via a 25-item selected bibliography entitled \"General Education and Occupational Curricula\". Mr. Owen's examination of the published views of  administrators of two-year colleges across the country provides support for strengthening the general education component of associate degree programs in technical education. General education and high technology are found to be complementary to one another. The rapidity with which technology is advancing has led to the virtual overnight obsolescence of some jobs and creation of others. Such a rapidly changing labor market has necessitated the development of high technology programs that will: (1) teach a specialized technology application with a high market value, and (2) provide program graduates with a commitment to lifelong learning and transferable skills necessary to hold a job, move into a new job, or change careers.

        "description":"For the past 18 years, Federal policy for adult literacy has been contained principally in the Adult Education Act of 1966 and in the administration of the program it supports. When this Act was passed, few programs for adult literacy existed in the states; thus, the Act authorized 90 percent Federal funding in order to encourage states to develop adult literacy education programs. At the same time, however, the legislation clearly required states to bear the responsibility for the education of all adults. The 1978 Amendments to the Adult Education Act contained some significant new policies. These Amendments required that services to adults be expanded throughout the public and private sector, instead of relying so heavily on the public schools as such programs had done  previously. The Act is expected to be reauthorized as it stands. The Reagan Administration created the Adult Literacy Initiative in September 1983, putting a national priority on a minimal education level for all adults. The Adult Literacy Initiative promotes decentralized and pluralistic approaches to expanding literacy services, while the Adult Education Act has supported centralized state planning. Tensions raised by these two approaches will have to be resolved. For the future, it is recommended that a new national organization be generated to support adult learning generally and adult literacy and basic skills specifically. This organization should be sustained by private sector resources and remain responsive to adult learning needs in an information society. (KC)",

Using an Apple Macintosh micro-computer, editorial staff of the newspaper, entitled the Express Press, collected articles written by ABE students and instructors throughout Arizona. Copies of the newspaper were mailed to each ABE program director in the State and were distributed without charge to students enrolled in ABE programs. The first four editions of the newspaper totaled over 40,000 copies. Plans were formulated to evaluate the responses to a staff and student evaluation survey included in the fourth issue of the paper and to consider incorporating suggestions from the surveys into  future editions of the newspaper. (Attachments to this project report include the first four editions of the Express Press, the announcement outlining plans to publish the paper and soliciting contributions, the form used to solicit contact persons from the State's ABE programs and a composite list of contact persons, copies of letters written during the course of the project and letters of compliment received from readers, the student and staff evaluation forms, and an estimate of the newspaper's readability as calculated according to the Raygor Readability Estimate.)

The following activities were completed during development of the comprehensive ABE/GED CAI program: identification and employment of a trained instructional aide and support personnel, coordination of a concentrated promotional campaign, purchase of supplemental software and GED materials, and dissemination of information concerning GED testing sites in Arizona. The CAI program was integrated with traditional ABE/GED materials and curricula normally provided at the project site in such a manner that students spent approximately half their time using the  computer and the other half completing more traditional paper-and-pencil activities. A resource guide was then developed for other ABE/GED programs and agencies throughout Arizona who were considering using CAI.

Described first are types of individualized instruction that have influenced videodisc development: programmed and computer-aided instruction, as well as computer graphics. Then the author explains how video technology operates, stating the advantages of the optical videodisc over videotape. Next, he illustrates different configurations for learner interaction with video. Advantages and disadvantages of such delivery systems as optical reflective disc players and direct-read-after-write disc recorders are described. Examples of the use of interactive videodisc in on-the-job training and instruction are provided. Because few such programs  are available, the next three sections elaborate a systematic process for designing, producing, and implementing video training materials. The design section follows the five steps of the Instructional Systems Development process (analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation). The topic of production centers around the use of the storyboard as a guideline for all production elements. Film and video production are compared. Next, major considerations in implementation are discussed: site preparation, facility requirements, teacher training, management involvement, and evaluation. The last section describes the author's production of a videodisc on machine lathe operations, a case study encompassing the stages of development, site preparation, field trials, and evaluation.

        "description":"Part-time faculty are essential to the accomplishment of the mission of postsecondary occupational education institutions. A commitment to excellence requires a comprehensive, systematic design for part-time faculty recruitment, development, assessment, and integration into the institution's delivery system. Careful attention to recruitment recognizes that the part-time teacher often personifies the institution for the student. Once recruited, part-time personnel must be integrated into the educational environment, made aware of its requirements, and provided with necessary support. A comprehensive orientation process for new faculty might include an intake interview, reinforced by group orientation. Use of a checklist guarantees that all important issues are discussed.  Institutions must develop an equitable remuneration system. The legal issues surrounding part-timers' property rights to the teaching position and tenure can be clarified with a contract specifying institutional policies. Faculty rights to equal protection, their place in collective bargaining, and the position of accrediting agencies should be considered. Use of a part-time faculty handbook and provision of adequate support services are important elements of the integration process. Other elements are systems of part-time faculty evaluation and development, which have a direct impact on educational excellence. From the demographics of their use to their role in needs assessment and institutional marketing, part-time faculty are an integral part of the mission of postsecondary  institutions. (SK)",

The majority of the literature is characterized as descriptive and program specific; the research is found to lack definition and theoretical foundation. The literature also reflects differing opinions on ideologies, professionalization of volunteers, methodology, and effectiveness. An overview of current delivery systems focuses on two national organizations--Literacy Volunteers of America and Laubach Literacy Action, the limited use of volunteers in adult basic education programs, the National Adult Literacy Initiative sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education, the role of public libraries, and the Coalition for  Literacy. The next section attempts to characterize literacy volunteer programs by (1) describing a dichotomy of individually oriented and community-oriented programs; (2) elaborating a four-part model--mass literacy through existing structures, literacy for immediate needs, movement-directed literacy, and literacy for political action; (3) listing six criteria for community-based literacy education; and (4) synthesizing these typologies into five variables--purpose, scope, organizational setting, professionalism, and finance. Specific programs illustrating each of these facets are then described. The next section addresses administrative concerns and policy considerations. These issues are discussed in terms of the five variables. A concluding section lists six common assumptions about  literacy voluntarism and recommends further research to improve policy and practice. A reference list and bibliography are included. (SK)",

In the first chapter, Joan Friedenberg discusses the development of English as a Second Language (ESL) teaching, including general ESL, English for special purposes, and prevocational and vocational ESL (VESL). Describing various delivery models, the author proposes that the ideal method for meeting the language needs of immigrants provides VESL concurrently with skill training. Strategies for developing a VESL lesson are outlined. Nancy Lee Lucas, in the second chapter, examines the why cultural values of different ethnic groups are reflected in language, education, and work behavior. She stresses that enabling the cultural adjustment  of immigrants, particularly in the workplace, involves cross-cultural training--a contrastive approach that explores areas of potential conflict. In chapter three, Nick Kremer focuses on approaches for meeting the diverse training needs of LEP adults. In-class and on-the-job models, adaptation of instructional materials, bilingual vocational training, staff development, support services, and funding are discussed. Finally, Tipawan Reed addresses the topic of employment services for LEP adults. Reviewing employers' attitudes toward hiring LEPs, she suggests strategies for enhancing their employability skills, including job clubs, marketing, and employer incentives. (SK)",

The methodology and vocabulary of underemployment are first examined, including a definition synthesis of hours worked, skill utilization, and compensation. The second section provides statistical measures of the incidence of underemployment for the following categories: part-time underemployed, and populations at risk--farmworkers, women, youth, minorities, and college graduates. Among the causes of underemployment described in the third section are the effects of automation, trade deficits and increasing foreign competition, high military spending, reduced Federal spending for retraining and enforcement of equal rights,  increased employment of women, and declining union membership. Suggestions for career assistance specific to each type of underemployment are made. For those employed below skill level, recommendations are made for improved labor market information and public employment services, and changes in the relationship of schooling and work. The part-time underemployed could benefit from national commitment to full employment, changes in work attitudes, job search skill training, and job creation. Employability programs and comparable worth legislation are suggested to aid the low-income underemployed. Finally, from two scenarios about the future of work the author draws implications for underemployment and predicts future directions for skill utilization and pay equity. A summary of positive and  negative trends leads to a conclusion of guarded optimism that the problems of underemployment are solvable. (SK)",

        "description":"An enormous body of literature illuminates various facets of the relationship between education and employment. Views of the proper role of education have ranged from cultural transmission to societal transformation and individual development, to the current belief that it prepares for transition to adulthood, i.e., the movement from school to work. The majority of research on the education-work relationship has used the status-attainment model to demonstrate that educational level is strongly related to occupational attainment. However, the experience of blacks and women, who are overrepresented in traditional, low-level, and low-paying occupations, refutes this explanation. There is evidence that the differential returns to education for minorities and women result from  continued discrimination in hiring and compensation. Another issue of education-work research concerns the benefits of vocational education. Despite the evidence, researchers appear reluctant to conclude that it provides little advantage. However, it may be more appropriate to judge vocational education by how well it does what it is meant to do. Research has also found that many workers are severely disadvantaged by lack of basic, employability, and job adjustment skills. Evidence also exists that both transferable and transfer skills are necessary for occupational adaptability. Research indicates that these skills are learned mostly in the work environment and not in school. This body of research could be improved by focus on specification of variables, less reliance on economic  formulations and overinterpretation of data, increased hypothesis testing, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

        "description":"Some writers have suggested that males and females differ not only in influencibility, but also in the strategies which they use to influence others. Although general sex differences in friendships may affect influence strategies, there is little research comparing males' and females' friendships. To explore differences between same- and opposite-sex friendships, 60 male and 60 female undergraduates were asked to think of a close friend of either the same or the opposite sex, and then complete a questionnaire regarding this friendship. The questionnaire consisted of background questions, a rank-ordering of activities they did with their friend, a version of Rubin's Liking and Loving Scale, and questions about the intimacy of the friendship. Subjects also responded to questions  concerning strategies they use to influence their friend. The results indicated that males and females perceived friendship differently. Women reported feeling more intimate with female friends than men reported feeling with male friends. Women viewed same-sex friendships as closer than opposite-sex friendships, but men did not. The influence strategies and power bases reported in these friendships differed from those found in research on marriage and dating in that sex stereotypic patterns of influence were not evident. All of the commonly reported influence strategies were direct rather than indirect. (NRB)",

Witnesses include Jean Netherton, a commissioner of the National Commission on Working Women; Elizabeth W. Markson, the director of social research at the Gerontology Center of Boston University; Shirley Sandage, the executive director of the Older Women's League; Eileen M. Lonsdale, the director of advocacy and support services for Western Older Citizens Council Incorporated; Anne  Moss, the director of the Women's Pension Project at the Pension Rights Center; and Nancy R. King, the deputy director of the Center for Women Policy Studies. Testimonies focus on what can be and is being done for women whose family responsibilites, personal choices, or changes in family circumstances have limited their entry into the work force and their opportunities once they begin working. Employment problems, health, and caretaking responsibilities faced by middle-aged and older women are also considered. (KGB)",

As a preface to the review, the typical police officer selection process is briefly described. Several common methodological deficiencies of the validation research are identified and discussed in detail: (1) use of past-selection research designs; (2) inappropriate comparison groups; (3) non-meaningful outcome variables; (4) alpha-inflated analysis; (5) over-emphasis of beta weights; and (6) the search for moderator variables. Validity evidence for several types of selection variables is discussed including biodata, measures of intellect, personality measures, interviews, interest inventories, and subjective background ratings. Of the 14 biodata categories researched  only 5 were validated as predictors of poor police performance (prior involuntary termination, criminal and vehicle code convictions, having been married more than once, and short duration of prior jobs). Measures of intellect, subjective background ratings, and personality measures provided mixed evidence of validity. Some scales of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory were found to have post-selection validity in more than one study. There was no meaningful evidence of validity for interest inventories or interviews as police selection procedures. (MCF)",

        "description":"Much of the thinking and writing about typical student affairs organizations has been grounded in core assumptions consistent with scientific and bureaucratic models of organizing. These questionable assumptions describe how things are supposed to work; however, most divisions of student affairs operate under multiple and sometimes competing preferences. Student affairs professionals often work in conditions which are ambiguous, conflictual, and harried. Richer and more descriptive counter assumptions about the organization as it really is suggest that interdependence between people and programs is more often loose than tight; staff are diverse and sometimes in conflict with the division's goals; and rational, systematic decision making is often compromised. In this context,  extraordinary aspects of ordinary divisions of student affairs are those processes, characteristics, or behaviors which exceed normal limits, are consistent with the values and purposes of the institution, contribute to a sense of well-being, and energize the work environment. In extraordinary student affairs divisions efforts at innovation are celebrated whether or not they are successful; opportunities for professional growth are available to all, but concentrated on those most likely to benefit; ordinary competence and high quality day-to-day relations with students and faculty are maintained; and ordinary programs can be suspended to enable some staff to do other things. Extraordinary student affairs leaders have a clear sense of what is important to those they lead, create a  supportive work environment, have a sense of humor, and resist making \"much ado about nothing.\" (MCF)",

        "description":"School interventions are often based on the assumption that such variables as self-concept and locus of control should have a meaningful impact on achievement. Yet research support for such influence is inconsistent. Because this inconsistency may be due to methodological problems, a study was conducted which used path analysis to determine the relative influence of self-concept and locus of control on achievement, while controlling for other influences. Data were obtained from a sample of the high school seniors (N=22,660) from High School and Beyond, a nationally representative longitudinal study of educational efforts. Variables representing race, family background, intellectual ability, self-concept, locus of control, and achievement were entered into a path model, which was  solved using a series of multiple regression analyses. The results suggest that intellectual ability has the strongest impact on achievement, and that locus of control also has a meaningful impact. General self-concept seemed to have a meaningful impact on locus of control, but no meaningful effect on achievement for this age group. These findings suggest that, at least for high school students, the improvement of general self-concept may not be an effective means of improving achievement. Programs designed to produce a more internal locus of control, however, may have a positive impact on achievement. (NRB)",

Subjects also completed the Extroversion/Introversion scale and guessed whether or not they had been given caffeine. Data analyses revealed that caffeine consumption produced no significant effects on reading comprehension, writing rate, tapping rate, reaction time, or serial recall. The drug guess test showed that subjects were not able to detect which drug they had received.

A national telephone survey of 71 directors of clinics that serve as practicum and internship sites for school psychology students was conducted to examine the organization and training practices of university clinics affiliated with school psychology programs. A structured questionnaire was used which addressed the areas of administration, funding, facilities, staffing, client population, coordination with other clinics on campus, contractual arrangements, supervision,  multidisciplinary involvement, fees, types of field experiences, and duration and sequencing of the clinic experience. Survey results indicated that school psychology practicum experience in a university-based clinic is a common training practice, and is used most frequently in doctoral programs. Many differences were found in how clinics were administered, funded, and staffed as well as in the extent of clinic experience required of students. A wide variety of models and practices were found in the provision of university-based clinical field experiences, reflecting differences in program and university resources, administrative structures, program training goals, community resources, faculty interests and competencies, and the availability of alternate field placements. Results are  reported both in terms of the percentages of programs reporting different practices and in specific, illustrative practices in providing clinic-based training experiences to school psychology students.

        "description":"Since married women typically curtail their employment behavior to accommodate the needs of their family, it is often assumed that women have a relatively weak and unstable work commitment. However, it is erroneous to infer work commitment from behavior, since work behavior is motivated and constrained by a myriad of personal and social conditions. The relationship of familial and work characteristics in women's expression of work commitment was examined in 420 employed wives interviewed in 1976 as part of the Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). All subjects were employed as either professional, managerial, sales, or clerical workers for 10 or more hours per week and reported having a child less than 18 years of age. Three PSID questionnaire items were used to  determine the work commitment dimensions of subjective orientation, work plans, and work preference. Other PSID items were used to construct the work/family variables work hours, husband's attitude, and fertility plans. The results of a multivariate analysis of variance revealed significant main effects of work hours and husband's attitude, and a single interaction effect of husband's attitude by fertility plans. Other results indicated that the significant interaction effect was predominantly a function of work plans, while both main effects were predominantly functions of work plans and subjective orientation. These findings are consistent with other studies reporting that women who work part-time express higher work commitment in terms of subjective orientation to employment than do  women who work full-time.

A national study was conducted to examine the perceptions of selected samples of 91 chief student affairs officers and 94 directors of housing at four-year postsecondary education institutions and 75 faculty members at institutions with departments offering master's programs in student personnel administration. A modification of the Tomorrow's Higher Education model enabled the identification of five competency categories of development: goal setting, consultation, communication, assessment  and evaluation, and environmental and organizational management. Respondents rated 33 professional competencies within these categories indicating, for each competency, the extent to which they agreed that recent master's graduates possessed that competency and the extent to which they believed the competency was important for assuming an entry level staff position in student affairs. The results revealed significant differences between faculty and practitioners on graduates' competencies for each of the five categories, and for 29 of the 33 individual competencies. Faculty usually perceived students as possessing the competencies to a greater extent than did practitioners. All three samples rated each of the five categories as essential or important for assuming an entry level position  in student affairs. Five data tables are provided. (NRB)",

        "description":"Self-handicapping strategies are behaviors or choices of performance settings which allow people to maintain self-esteem by avoiding negative self-relevant attributions. People will behave in such a way that accurate, nonambiguous attributions about their performance cannot be made. Research on self-handicapping has focused on clinically relevant behaviors such as drug choice, alcohol consumption, and test anxiety. A study was conducted to explore self-handicapping as a more general phenomenon. Task choice as a self-handicapping strategy was assessed under different conditions of attribute ambiguity. College students (N=43) were asked to sign up for one of two tests of social competence. One of the tests was described as an accurate measure, the other as a difficult and  inaccurate test. Choice of the inaccurate test was believed to be a self-handicapping strategy, since it would allow subjects to avoid negative self-relevant information. For half the subjects (low ambiguity) the two tests were presented as being in the same format, while for the other half (high ambiguity) the tests were presented as being in different formats. The results showed that subjects in the high ambiguity condition self-handicapped more than subjects in the low ambiguity condition. Subjects in the high ambiguity condition could attribute their choice to format, rather than the less socially desirable motive of avoiding accurate information. (Author/NRB)",

        "description":"Efforts to explain the harassment of women in the work place have focused on sex role socialization and cultural norms conditioning men to be dominant and initiators of sexual interactions. New work relationships, however, may bring new value to intimacy which may be differentiated from dominance gestures. To test the relationship of intimacy and dominance gestures reported by women in the corporate work place, 375 female workers were surveyed. The sample of 200 respondents was divided by age and marital status into four subgroups of comparable size: under 30 years of age, single; over 30 years of age, single; under 30, married; over 30, married. The subjects completed measures of intimacy and dominance gestures and sex-role liberation, and provided demographic information on  age, marital status, education level, religious affiliation, and length of service with the company. Analysis of results showed a low positive correlation between the reported instances of the two types of gestures explaining only 11 percent of the variance. This finding suggests the relative independence of the occurrence of intimacy and dominance gestures. On the average, about three times more dominance than intimacy gestures were reported. Age, marital status, length of employment, religious affiliation, and sex role liberation were not related to experiences of intimacy and dominance. There was, however, a weak positive correlation between education and reports of intimacy gestures, probably due to more educated women's heightened awareness. The results support the contention that  intimacy and dominance are separate dimensions. (MCF)",

        "description":"Although supervisors report important commonalities among beginning and more advanced psychotherapy trainees, individual differences in supervisees' background, personality, and ability are influential factors affecting the nature of the supervision process. For students who are just beginning to do psychotherapy, the overriding task is to manage their anxiety in the room. Beginners may be so anxious about what to say or do they fail to listen to the client. Beginners' work tends to entail more cognitive processes and less exploration of their own feelings and reactions to the client. Other characteristics of beginning therapists include reliance on process notes, dependency on the supervisor to do thinking and decision making, and dealing with anxiety by being passive or overly  active toward the client. Much of the reward for beginning therapists derives from initial experiences. Vulnerability to evaluations and doubts about competence are major problems for beginners. When sessions do not go well or when therapies are unsuccessful, it may be devastating to beginners' general self-esteem. Advanced psychotherapy trainees are able to apply more sophisticated techniques in therapy. Advanced students are capable of coherently summarizing and condensing a session and are better prepared to deal with their own feelings and fantasies about the client. They can settle into the therapist's role and start to draw upon their own personal strengths. They also may be more set in their ways and demand more respect than beginners. (KGB)",

        "description":"Although the problems facing dual-profession couples are almost universally acknowledged, studies on dual-profession couples have only recently emerged from those on dual-worker or dual-career families. To explore the perceptions that women in dual-profession marriages have of their roles, conflicts, and coping strategies, focus group interviews and case studies of nine women in dual-profession marriages were content analyzed. The findings indicated that for these professional women the identity of professional was very important to their self-esteem. Most had entered their profession by chance, and only two identified a future professional dream. Although the women expressed a need for recognition and praise for their achievement, few had had professional mentors or felt they  received sufficient praise or recognition from their husbands or colleagues. The order of saliency for their three major roles was mother, wife, and professional; unstated role expectations by others defined their boundaries of behavior, restricted their opportunities for career advancement, and often caused them guilt and resentment. Conflicts related to the dual-profession marriages were evident in attempts to balance career and achievement needs, equity and responsibility, money, and time and stress. Their most commonly employed coping strategies were accommodation/sacrifice, avoidance/withdrawal, hiring help, planning/scheduling, and role redefinition. (Six recommendations for future research on dual-profession marriages conclude the paper.) (MCF)",

        "description":"Splitting, a primitive defense mechanism of young children in confusing or ambivalent situations, in psychoanalytic theory is characteristic of those with borderline or narcissistic diagnoses. It may recur in adults negotiating co-parenting relationships following divorce and remarriage. Two types of splitting may occur: self-other in which the other is seen as different from the self; and object-object in which the other is seen as different from a different other (in this case the present and former spouse). To investigate a consistent pattern of devaluation of women by their former husbands, 63 divorced fathers, 39 in their first year and 24 in their third to fifth year of remarriage, were studied. Participants completed the Adjective Checklist four times, describing  themselves, their spouse, their children's mother (former spouse) and their ideal self. Analysis of the husband's descriptions showed that in their negative evaluations of their ex-wives husbands tended to contrast the present and former spouse and not themselves and the former spouse. Several trait domains were starkly polarized in this splitting process especially interpersonal power, interpersonal expressiveness, and impulse control. Although there may be reality-based explanations for husbands' devaluations of their ex-spouse, splitting is a useful construct for understanding the intrapsychic mechanisms influencing these reactions. The data suggest the widespread use of splitting in a non-clinical population. (MCF)",

        "description":"Inherent in the many roles of a school psychologist is a primary responsibility to act as a child advocate. Child advocacy carries with it a variety of definitions, all of which are concerned with aligning oneself with the cause of either an individual child or a group. Child advocacy involves asserting and defending those rights of an individual or group which have been formalized in law and working to extend (through personal or political intervention, legislation and litigation) the children's rights to include those elements which have yet to be formalized. Advocacy has an extensive heritage not only in the practice of law, but also in education related professions. Although it is relatively simple to recognize who is the legal advocate's client, the psychologist-as-advocate  must recognize competing loyalties to self, employer, parent, the child, and others. Where children are concerned, psychologists do not, generally, hold the same privileged client relationship as the physician, lawyer, or theologian. If a student wishes to discuss sensitive matters with a psychologist, at the beginning of the discussion the psychologist may choose to dislose the potential limits of confidentiality. Although child advocacy can be emotionally painful, psychologists are in an ideal position to advocate for children. In so doing, they can also model justice for children, help children understand their own rights and responsibilities, and help them become more effective as self-advocates. (NRB)",

Calls at the national level for a designation system of \"psychology\" programs, independent of American Psychological Association accreditation, coupled with the fact that there are no doctoral degrees granted in Idaho through any department or program labeled \"psychology\", underscored the need for additional information. In January, 1984, a mailing with a letter explaining the situation in Idaho, a survey, and a stamped, addressed envelope was sent to the psychology licensing boards in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Responses (N=45) were received from all boards except those in  California, Indiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Nebraska, and Vermont. Results of the survey showed that the states were divided almost equally in requiring a program labeled \"psychology\". It was also revealed that some state board offices did not know the provisions of their laws and regulations and that practice sometimes varied from the stated regulations.

        "description":"This paper presents a theoretical model for a primary prevention program for bulimia and anorexia nervosa to be used with adolescents and young women considered most at risk of developing these eating disorders. Characteristics of potential anorexics and bulimics are identified to aid in the selection of target groups for the program. It is recommended that subjects be paired by common characteristics and divided into experimental and control groups. It is noted that successful interventions in preventing anorexia and bulimia have not been identified yet. However, seven procedures are suggested as a starting point to be used with the experimental group: (1) taking subjects off reduction diets and teaching alternative ways of reducing or maintaining normal weights; (2) initiating  some type of family therapy; (3) stressing relaxation training and/or stress management; (4) using a cognitive-behavioral approach to change irrational belief systems and inappropriate behaviors; (5) incorporating techniques found to be effective in treating anorexia and bulimia into prevention programs; (6) beginning treatment for anxiety or depression; and (7) continuing long-term follow-up until subjects reach an age when the risk of developing these disorders is reduced. Possible benefits from this type of intervention are discussed and possible problems in developing such a program are identified. It is concluded that, in spite of these problems, the implementation of primary prevention programs may reduce the incidence of these eating disorders and may prove more cost effective than  traditional treatment procedures.

If women are less likely than men to use cardinality, it is not clear whether women lack the competence to use a coordinate system of reference or simply prefer another style of direction giving. To examine these issues, male (N=88) and female (N=88) college students' use of cardinal directions was compared when they gave directions spontaneously, and also after they were given instructions to use cardinality. Their use of cardinal directions was also compared when a map was perceptually present and when it had to be memorized. Subjects were assigned to one of three conditions (perception, memory,  memory prompted), were shown two maps, and were asked to give directions from one location on the maps to another to an unseen third party. Transcripts of subjects' direction-giving were scored for cardinality, relational terms, mention of landmarks, mention of mileage, and omission and commission errors. The results indicated that when the use of cardinality was not requested, males in both the memory and perception (before prompting) conditions used more cardinal directions and mileage indicators than females and committed fewer omission and commission errors. More cardinal directions were given by both sexes after prompting to use cardinality. These data provide empricial support for the view that males are more likely than females to use cardinality in their direction-giving.  (NRB)",

        "description":"Although many researchers have identified meaningful learning as the proper aim of education, the realization of that aim and the theoretical understanding of the prerequisites for meaningful learning in the school setting are far from complete. By integrating ideas from theories of meaningful learning with ideas from theories of purposeful, goal-directed action in psychology and socialization in sociology, a common concept of meaning and meaningfulness could be developed. This integration could facilitate the analysis of the interaction of cognitive, motivational, emotional, and social elements in learning situations. Whether a student experiences his school curriculum as being personally significant and meaningful depends on both affective and cognitive elements. Cognitive  meaningfulness can be further divided into logical and psychological meaningfulness. Behind the psychological meaningfulness of studying and learning there are structures of relevance. A hierarchical organization of relevance includes the student's experienced purpose of life interacting with his experienced meaningfulness of attending school, studying, and learning. In addition to these structures, there are social and intellectual dimensions of relevance. Four types of orientation can be identified, based on quality of sense of control and the kind of relevance experienced. These are task, social dependence, ego-related, and noncommitment orientations. The cyclical processes of learning situations produce cumulative experiences which lead to the development of individuals' motives,  conceptions, and behavioral tendencies in different directions.

        "description":"While many contemporary developmental theorists have avoided taking a stand on the controversial relationship between learning and development, this paper is based on the belief that the notion of &quot;bandwidth of competence,&quot; or L. S. Vygotsky's &quot;zone of proximal development,&quot; provides a useful framework for considering this relationship. As Vygotsky argued, learning in context, including the social context, creates development which in turn determines the level of learning and teaching for which the child is ripe. Any estimate of developmental status depends on the environment in which it is revealed. Contexts can be overtly social, as in the case of adult or peer assistance, or covertly social, as in the case of responding to an imagined or internalized audience. Children create  their own zones of competence by working recursively on their own theories of cognition. In the future, developmental psychologists should learn to understand (1) sensitive methods of assessing readiness for change, (2) self-directed learning, (3) the dynamics of social situations that are successful in inducing change, and (4) supportive experimental contexts. Nineteen pages of references and several tables and figures conclude the paper. (HOD)",

        "description":"To address the notion that the cognitive level of young children influences their ability to recall the logical sequence found in stories, four modes of language--story generation, retelling, dictation, and writing--were collected for three weeks from 35 second grade children. Through prior testing with the Goldschmid-Bentler Concept Assessment Kit-Conservation-Form A, children were classed as preoperational (nonconservers) or concrete operational (conservers). The story generation task addressed the issue of the preoperational child's ability to comprehend sequential order in stories and the retelling task measured the preoperational child's ability to remember stories in sequential order. Each of the stories was analyzed according to seven measures of linguistic quantity or  language output. Findings indicated conservers, with regard to linguistic quantity measures, used a greater total number of words and total number of dependent clauses than did nonconservers in the four story-language modes combined. With regard to rhetorical quality measures, conservers used the macrostructure categories of initiating event and reaction at a statistically significant level as compared to nonconservers. (HOD)",

        "description":"A study of the vocabulary and comprehension scores of juniors and seniors at Marygrove College was conducted during the winter term of 1983 in order to determine the reading levels needed for success in upper division courses. Because the research was designed to determine the reading levels needed for successful study, students on academic probation or taking more than one developmental course were eliminated from the potential sample. Sixty-six students were given the Nelson Denny Reading Test, Form F; three were subsequently eliminated, leaving 24 seniors and 39 juniors in the sample. Juniors had an average college sophomore reading level, and seniors had an average reading equivalent of late college freshman year. However, the scores encompassed a very wide range, indicating  that a wide variety of reading levels is applicable for successful study at the college level. It appears that juniors and seniors who have taken developmental reading never attain the reading level of those students who did not take such courses, but they do persevere. Therefore, it might be better to admit students with reading deficiencies and then provide the appropriate educational support to enable them to achieve a meaningful liberal arts education. Numerous tables and charts provide participant test scores and other data. (DF)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine the SMOG readability formula scores of currently available patient education materials. It was hypothesized that the reading level of the materials would be higher than 7.5, the reading level of the average American citizen; and that there would be a significant reduction in the measured document reading levels if key terms were assumed to be known (pre-taught) and were counted as one syllable words on the SMOG. The SMOG readability grade levels of 10 sample education pamphlets dealing with respiratory diseases were determined. Results indicated that the lowest SMOG grade level on the materials was 2.92 levels above the population mean, 7.5; and that assuming knowledge of key terms and counting them as one syllable words for SMOG calculations  reduced the lowest level to 1.98 grade levels above 7.5. The results suggest that readability formulas have a potential role in the evaluation of patient education materials, but that this potential may be limited to serving as a guideline. They also suggest that assessment of the patient's educational level be incorporated into patient evaluations, and that the inclusion of a vocabulary at the beginning of each document would result in a more readable and therefore more valuable document.

        "author":["McClain, Anita Bell"],
        "description":"Classroom teachers might consider teaching children to become critical readers through the use of traditional literature. It is not necessarily difficult to define critical reading, but it is a difficult task to teach students when and how to read critically. The six skills most important to critical reading are that the reader should (1) read material with an alert and questioning mind, (2) compare and contrast what has been read, (3) consider the author's viewpoint and be aware of other viewpoints, (4) detect propaganda techniques, (5) identify relevant and irrelevant information, and (6) differentiate fact from opinion. To critically analyze traditional literature (such as folktales, myths, or legends), one must first understand the characteristics of each genre and be aware  that each culture has unique beliefs and geographical positions. The task of the critical reader is to analyze and then apply literary elements such as main character, setting, plot, and conclusion to several tales. Possible titles for use are \"Too Much Noise\" for primary grades, \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" for primary/middle grades, and \"Cinderella\" for middle grades. Since the excellent variety of traditional literature lends itself to analysis, a classroom teacher could consider using it to teach critical reading. Tables illustrate ways to compare various tales or to note similarities and differences in the main character, setting, conflict, advice, animals, and resolution of conflict. (DF)",

        "description":"It is common in teacher education programs to require a course in reading or language arts methods, at least for students preparing to be elementary teachers. The question for teachers of methods courses is how they can best prepare students to be teachers of reading. A common approach to teaching a reading methods class is to provide information, such as what a basal reading series is and how many ways there are to decode words. Students are typically concerned about learning pragmatic teaching ideas. However, in a more phenomenological view of reading, the concern is to understand what reading is, what it is that people do when they read, what the experience of reading is, and what difference reading makes in people's lives. Suggestions for fostering this point of view include  providing questions for reflection and assigning different types of texts. Phenomenology has also emphasized the importance of stories, and a recognition of their significance can affect not only a reading program but also the way education students plan their programs. Given an understanding about and the beginnings of reflection upon the experience of reading, perhaps preservice teachers will be able to continue observing learning, and reflecting in such a way as to be able to act with insightful wisdom and understanding of their students' experience.

Literacy may not be in the genes, but it has come to be central to the processes of cultural transformation in all societies--developed or developing. When viewed collectively within an evolutionary perspective, those who are literate are better fit for survival than the illiterate. Literacy is a matter of life and death. Without literacy--the portal to all education--worker-citizens are confined to the lowest rungs of the economy and are consigned to the underclass, doomed to go through life mystified by the structures that oppress them. In the United States alone, there are some 25 million people who cannot read the labels on the things they buy. To combat illiteracy, the  governing classes must understand that the allocation of resources to literacy promotion will bring high economic, social and political returns. On the other hand, illiterates must do something for themselves. They need to dream, to commit, to sacrifice, to practice immediate self-denial for later collective good, and to be self-reliant and inventive. (HOD)",

Using procedures and tools from an earlier study, lessons were rated for explicitness, and students were interviewed to determine their awareness of the reading skills they had been taught. The results substantiated previous findings indicating that (1) there is a relationship between the explicitness of the teacher's instruction during reading lessons and what  students learn, and (2) this relationship exists regardless of whether the instruction is provided in a regular classroom using a basal reader or in a reading clinic using a variety of printed materials. However, qualitative analysis revealed unanticipated subtleties about how to conduct instructional interactions that may be important to improving verbal explanations in all settings. (Author/HOD)",

Both &quot;Profil&quot; and &quot;Macleans&quot; try to take &quot;independent&quot; or &quot;liberal&quot; stands. The results indicated that the North American magazines used polls to determine public opinion, while the European magazines relied on press comments. While polls undoubtedly were more representative of the public as a whole (the majority  supported the war), they were less effective in showing why the public had taken a particular stand. British public opinion contrasted sharply with the view of the four news magazines. Only &quot;Profil&quot; attempted to show what the &quot;new British pride&quot; was founded upon. The outburst of &quot;jingoism&quot; (a term used by all four magazines) in Britain in the spring of 1982 needed to be explained to Europeans and North Americans accustomed to viewing war as undesirable and unpopular.

The second is to use the categories provided by A. Kennedy and T. Deal, who considered five specific elements--business environment, values, heroes, rites and rituals, and cultural work--to classify corporate cultures as  follows: macho/tough guy, work hard/play hard, bet your company, and process. Finally, an organizational cultural index test can identify both the type of organization in which a person works and the type of organization in which a person would like to work.

Other material is adapted from the Index on Censorship and the Committee to Protect Journalists Update No. 10 (January-February 1984). The paper examines the current status of freedom of the press and information in Latin America and the Caribbean. Among the nations discussed are Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico,  Netherland Antilles, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Surinam, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The paper concludes by noting that the status of freedom of the press and of information is improving in the area, as is evident in (1) return of democracy in Argentina, (2) end of total censorship in Uruguay, and (3) maintenance of democracy in the three traditional democratic countries of Venezuela, Colombia, and Costa Rica.

Various methods for conducting this type of needed research include traditional legal research, surveys of practitioners, and surveys of persons outside the media who are directly affected by mass media, such as attorneys, judges, and elected officials. Problems with such surveys include self-interest and low response rate. A more direct method for analyzing the impact of media law is to measure the quantity and quality of specific legal activities in state and federal courts. An example of such a study is the Avery and Steven analysis of libel appeals in the states of Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, and Tennessee during the ten years before  the Gertz libel decision and the ten years after. In addition, there are various techniques for evaluating the outcomes of media laws by using unobtrusive measures and documentary evidence. Public opinion is important in studying media law as an ongoing process. Having hard data about the impact of media law should be preferable to remaining unaware of its implications. (DF)",

        "description":"A review of the literature on computers and writing reveals that a dichotomy exists. The great debate that has been taking place in the world of writing instruction mirrors the emerging debate concerning the implementation of computers in education. Applications and research fall into one of two categories: the computer as a teaching instrument of the basic skills or the computer used in holistic ways as a writing tool. There seems to be reason for optimism about the teaching of writing, the role of the computer in that process, and the fact that the current interest in writing and computerized instruction may serve to create a new emphasis and new strategies in the art. Word processing is probably the most common way the computer is used holistically as a writing tool. Various  studies done on computer assisted programs include Burns and Culp's experiment with a college freshman English group and Colette Daiute's studies on the effects of word processing with computers on children's writing. The question of how the composing process is affected using the computer is a complex one. Work in the area of computers and writing needs to take into account the ongoing research on the writing process, so that the best educational implementations of this new writing tool may be discovered.

The report includes a separate volume of appendixes containing, among other things, the student survey of the National Writing Project, the survey of Excellence in Teaching of the National Writing Project, a list of state projects that participate in the National Writing Project, samples of student writing and teacher response, and the teaching philosophies of the two participating ninth grade teachers.

        "description":"The paradox of the diffusion of innovations research is that in its efforts to find ways and means of breaking the communication constraint in Third World countries, it has generated many bottlenecks that cumulatively constitute the major constraint: lack of an efficient system for delivering adequate and reliable information, knowledge, and skills of a quality that rural people can understand and use to increase their productivity. For example, obsession with effects of mass media on behavior alteration through increased exposure to media gives little consideration to the content of the messages to which the audience is exposed. Among the other bottlenecks generated by diffusion research are (1) inadequate consideration of media message content and differences in their use and  perception by the audiences; (2) the assumption that adoption of nontraditional innovations is advantageous to all potential users; (3) the misalignment between what the communication theorists define and what the researcher actually measures; and (4) lack of knowledge about the shortcomings and deficiencies of the source or initiator of the innovation. It would seem that diffusion research has created more bottlenecks to the diffusion of information rather than identifying and breaking communication constraints. (HOD)",

Student papers produced on the word processor were compared with those produced without the word processor in two classes of freshman English--an experimental and a control. The teacher attempted to keep the teaching methods and curriculum in both experimental and control sections as nearly the same as possible, with the exception that students in the experimental class used the word processor in the production of their writing assignments, including proofreading and stylistic programs available at the computer center as needed. The results indicated that the experimental and control groups were very nearly alike in all of the correctness features analyzed except spelling,  which could be accounted for by the experimental group's access to a spelling checker.

Unit 2: \"Exploring Possibilities\" engages students in speculative and imaginative thinking about technology and its future applications, and includes such activities as brainstorming, making an invention, and preparing for an inventors' fair. Unit III: \"Investigating the Issues\" engages students in a  study of their own school, and involves them in asking questions; collecting, analyzing, and synthesizing information; and interpreting and evaluating findings. Unit VI: \"Probing the Future\" challenges students to project, predict, forecast, plan, and imagine what life might be like in the future. (EL)",

Designed to build on the thinking skills that the student already possesses and, ideally, on the experience gained in Book One, it provides training in analytical skills as well as systematic development of intuitive skills. In the first unit, students explore perception and the way the mind guides, focuses, and organizes perception, and they begin to reflect on their own thought processes. In the second unit, three kinds of relationships and connections are explored: comparisons (especially metaphor and analogy), whole/part relationships, and the  creation of new relationships. The third unit directs students in learning to distinguish between scientific problems and interpersonal problems and to improve their problem-solving skills with both types of problems. The fourth unit directs students to explore the creative aspects of the thinking process by reading about the experience of creation from creative thinkers and to stimulate their own creative powers by using activities based on research.

The highlights of the past decade are cited, including the angles from which traditional approaches have been attacked and through which current research is evolving.

An intermediate assignment can help bridge the gap between the totally personal search and the more formal and traditional research paper approach. The assignment asks students to look at events, people, places, and things that existed at the time the students were born and at similar events, people, places, and things that exist now. Their assignment is to identify clues in the materials they examine that suggest possible contrasts or comparisons between the two time periods and to build a case for the significance of these contrasts and comparisons. Students skim an issue of one magazine from each of the two  periods, then read them more thoroughly, completing a worksheet on the contents. Advertisements provide a good starting point for comparison and contrast. Once students find connections, they pull them out and look at them in isolation, trying to determine their significance and organizing them so that they lead to some kind of conclusion. Having arrived at the conclusion and having discovered how the gathered material supports the conclusion, the student organizes and completes successive drafts of an essay.

Faculty from 14 departments spend a year teaming with a member of the writing department; following that year of paired teaching, the content faculty become departmental writing coordinators. The final project will be a handbook on writing at Loyola. In evaluating the writing across the curriculum program, two codirectors, with professional assistance, developed a survey instrument, and the faculty will be surveyed three times in five years, producing a longitudinal survey. The first half of the survey assesses faculty attitudes, while the second half takes note of faculty practices in core courses  and upper-division courses. The survey, administered in May 1984, revealed that the overall tilt in attitude was toward helping rather than harassing students. Unfortunately, the practices did not accord with those generous attitudes. The biggest goal of the program is to have all departments discover the types of writing professionals do and then examine what cognitive skills are necessary across the four-year undergraduate curriculum if students are to be socialized into the discipline.

It was hypothesized that two different languages would emerge in the rationales for the solutions to the problems in the scenario: women's choices would be defended in language referring to the relationships described in the scenario, while men's choices would be explained with a  language indicative of a justice approach based on rights and rules. The data, coded and analyzed by chi square, revealed that there was no significant difference in response to the decision one character should have made or in the use of justice or interpersonal themes. However, a significant difference was found when subjects were asked to put themselves in the positions of both characters in the scenario and state the concerns of each character. Rather than attributing these differences to biological sex, the study indicates that they may be related to positions of power or status. (DF)",

Seen as a key social science phenomenon, it is viewed, along with power, as an inextricable component of human dynamics, and, in its relationship with altruism, possibly plays a causal role. A problem with research on empathy has been a lack of conceptual clarity. Three ways to improve empathetic listening are to avoid judgment, give the speaker time to speak without interruption, and focus on the speaker. Many of the helping professions have attempted training programs aimed at increasing the empathetic communication skills of practitioners in these fields. However, being told to listen  empathetically is not the same as being taught to listen with empathy; and in critique of the empathy skills programs that are conducted within the helping professions, a significantly raised test score does not mean that empathy has been attained. Although empathetic communication is a complex subject matter, skills associated with empathy and active listening have been perceived as being more important than skills associated with critical or deliberative listening.

        "description":"Only about 9% of the eligible American population actually donates blood, and the rate of donors who fail to give a second time is very high. Since many people who view blood-giving as a humanitarian act also see it as an unpleasant experience, persuasive appeals that promote a sense of moral obligation may be ineffectual in prompting donations. A study was conducted in which subjects were exposed to no message or to one of three persuasive messages that either highlighted moral reasons for donating blood, counterargued fears associated with donating blood, or used a combination of both these modes. Male and female college students listened to prerecorded messages and then completed a series of nine-point scales on attitudes toward the consequences of the act and attitude toward  the act itself, and attendance rates for members of the various groups at a campus blood drive were recorded. Individuals in the moral message condition indicated the most favorable post-message attitude toward the consequence of donating blood and felt a strong moral obligation to donate. However, combined message condition individuals indicated the greatest post-message intent to donate. (DF)",

It was hypothesized that abused and neglected children would be less active nonverbally than would control group children. Eight abused and neglected children, aged one through three years, were videotaped interacting with their caregivers in a daycare center, and their behavior was compared with that of a matched control group from the same center. Children were desensitized to the presence of the observers and were taped in a familiar room at the center, interacting with a familiar caretaker. After taping was completed, the tapes were coded into 9 categories in three areas of nonverbal behavior: proxemic (distance maintained from caretaker), kinesic (reaching, touching),  and gaze (eye contact) behaviors. The scores were analyzed to determine the differences between abused and nonabused children. The results indicated that the abused boys tended be either slightly more exploratory or slightly more active than their nonabused counterparts. The abused girls tended to avoid physical contact with the environment and social engagement with the adult more than their nonabused counterparts or the boys in either group. The results suggest that the abused children conformed more closely to sex stereotypes than did nonabused children. (HTH)",

The four social cognitive measures included cognitive differentiation, self-monitoring, perspective taking, and persuasive ability. The data revealed significant relationships among all combinations of the communication-related abilities. Each was significantly related to job level, and three of the four were significantly related to upward mobility.

        "description":"Empirical literature on two types of hearings, and their applicability in evaluating educational programs, is reviewed. An introduction describes the use and nature of hearings and distinguishes adversary hearings, in which two parties argue opposing sides of an issue, from committee hearings, in which a variety of positions are presented to a panel of decision-makers. Adversary hearings, the type primarily used in evaluation, are the main focus of the paper. Following a brief overview of literature on adversary hearings, the discussion covers strengths of the adversarial approach, hearing procedures (including a table illustrating basic steps and variations), applications (including a table showing recent uses of adversary hearings in evaluation), and problems and limitations of  the approach. Committee hearings and their uses, for which much less literature is available, are then briefly examined. The paper concludes that (1) adversary hearings effectively involve large groups in complex issues, and (2) committee hearings &quot;might provide some of the benefits of adversarial hearings without the same problems,&quot; and (3) &quot;much more public trial, testing, and revision are needed&quot; for both hearing types.

First, the full range of purposes for establishing such a system should be clarified. It must be decided whether the system exists to provide data for reporting or for decision-making, whether comparisons should be made within educational units or between them, and what emphasis is to be placed on various forms of learning. Second, the evaluation tools selected must be compatible with the purposes identified. The range of evaluation information gathered and the contextual data collected must be appropriate, and attention should be paid to whether the tools used are suitably diagnostic  and reveal significant facts. The third area of concern is the potential for misusing or misinterpreting the data. Full disclosure of a broad range of data, coupled with thorough explanation of how to understand it, is vital. Fourth, careful consideration must be given to the degree of collaboration that is desired with other agencies, and the extent to which other decisions affect the achievement of the desired cooperation.

The agencies disagree over the uses to which assessments should be put, the educational outcomes that should be measured, the extent to which various contextual factors affect  education, the specific indicators that should be used, and how the costs of assessment are to be controlled and allocated. Agencies need to develop policies for assessment that will resolve all of these questions in ways that are appropriate both to the individual characteristics of the state and to the demand for data that will allow meaningful assessment and comparison on a national level.

Thereafter, five recent studies on this issue are summarized and reviewed. The first, by Doug Chafe, is a review of the literature on criteria for retention or promotion. The second, by Jane K. Elligett and Thomas S. Tocco, describes the stringent promotion/retention policy in Pinellas County, Florida, and analyzes its results. The third, by Nancy B. Schuyler,  is a technical report from the Austin (Texas) Independent School District on its new stringent promotion/retention policy at the elementary level. Fourth is a California study, by Jonathan Sandoval and G. Penee Hughes, that analyzed a wide variety of indicators to determine predictors of success for retained first-grade students.

The instrument asked respondents to rate 10 problem areas in vocational education, special education and rehabilitation and to list and rate effectiveness of networks or resources which they have used. Respondents (N=416) were identified by state consultants. Results suggested that several problems were of particular importance to vocational teachers: needs assessment, least restrictive environment/mainstreaming and program evaluation. Minority group Ss also cited  least restrictive environmental mainstreaming as a signficant problem area. Psychologists, counselors, researchers, vocational evaluators, and parents/advocates cited problems in interagency/organizational collaboration and school to work transition services. Vocational teachers, teacher educators, and persons with doctorates pointed to concerns for preservice and inservice programing and/or certification problems and issues.

The document cites damaging effects of centralized education policy in Washington, D.C., noting a decline in academic standards and federal regulations that are ill-suited to local educational needs. False assumptions underlying advocacy of centralized education policies are reviewed, including the concept that the primary responsibility for dealing with an individual's disability lies with the larger political unit rather than with the family and immediate community. The paper points to the examples of Title I/Chapter 1 of the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act and disability legislation, including P.L. 94-142,  the Education For All Handicapped Children Act, as examples of expensive and ineffective federal initiatives. Recommendations include consideration of vouchers and tuition tax credits, repeal of Chapter 1, abolition of the Department of Education, and use of federal funds as the assistance of last resort rather than as a right.

Students were asked in self-administered questionnaires whether they had any of seven specific handicaps; whether they had a condition that limited the kinds or amounts of work or education they could obtain; and whether they had participated in special programs for the physically or educationally handicapped. Using the reports of students in 1980 and 1982, the percentage of continuously handicapped students was estimated at 4% for the senior cohort and 6% for the sophomore. To examine explanations for inconsistency between student responses at the two times, student self-identification as handicapped was examined in relationship to  cognitive tests, maintenance in school in 1982, and self-reported grades. Analysis revealed support for the hypothesis that self-reported handicap status is associated with real differences among students. Differences were also found in locus of control, self-esteem, and affective balance. Those students identified by teachers as handicapped in 1980 were likely to have poor test scores and were more likely to have dropped out by 1982. (CL)",

Drawn from the author's personal involvement with the Macomb-Oakland Regional Center (MORE) in Michigan, this document notes nine illustrations of progress from 1969-1984. It is suggested that staff at MORE are helped to acquire a sense of urgency, a sense of ownership for solving the problem, commitment to action on behalf of the consumer. Among different ways that agencies and associations have battled successfully with their own service structures are factors involving: relationships with parents, readiness reversal (suggesting that virtually everyone can move into the community if the right  alternatives are created), staff specialized in developing homes, approaches to dealing with the news media, and decisions to avoid distractions that could lead workers off task. Threats to momentum, including prejudice, complacency, and the pull of \"institutional gravity,\" are considered. The paper concludes by asserting the importance of seeing the larger picture in the lives of developmentally disabled persons. (CL)",

Preliminary investigations indicated that mildly handicapped students do exhibit deficiencies in this area, including attention to inappropriate distractors, failure to successfully employ prior knowledge and deductive reasoning strategies, and failure to identify correctly specific types of questions which call for different strategies. Deficiencies were also observed regarding use of separate answer sheets and expressed attitudes toward tests. In year 1, approximately 100 LD and BD elementary (grades 2-4) were randomly assigned to  treatment (training on test-taking skills) or control conditions. All Ss scored significantly higher on a test of test-taking skills. During year 2, approximately 100 LD and BD Ss (grades 4-6) were randomly assigned to treatment (training involving both reading and math subtest areas of the Stanford Achievement Test). Trained Ss scored significantly higher on two subtests and descriptively higher on a third subtest. Extensive appended material includes 19 items (journal articles, conference papers, and manuscripts unpublished or submitted for publication) on test-taking skills and their implications for LD and BD students.

The central hypothesis, that mothers who have adequate social support and are knowledgeable  about child development would demonstrate a better relationship with their infants, was supported in part. Observed quality of the parent-infant interaction was better in the case of mothers who lived with a number of other adults and who were knowledgeable about child development.

English, with over 300 million native speakers around the world, is difficult to characterize accurately.

Choosing the appropriate functional style and switching freely from one to another is done automatically by native speakers on the basis of complex psychological and social clues that are part of cultural and linguistic experience. Foreign learners are often unable to perform or even comprehend these switches because their level of acquired English is functionally flat. ESL teachers should be ready to offer explicit advice and concrete examples about the global, regional, social, and situational dimensions of English, and plan strategies and design exercises directing students to a broader understanding of this diverse language.

Two of the conclusions are the following: (1) multilingual countries must provide for a supra-regional language in education that serves a variety of sociolinguistic functions; and (2) in India, language policy has followed a pattern of evolution toward languages lower in the prestige hierarchy, which gain more valued roles in the educational system by weakening the  exclusive role of the prestige language. While the non-prestige languages have begun to gain status as a medium of instruction first at the elementary and secondary levels, then in early childhood education, and finally in higher education, even for the major languages this process has only begun, and it has not yet begun for many minority languages.

The Japanese people, historically controlled by the forces of nature, have formed groups as the minimum functioning social units. The individual is only part of the group, and individual rights and obligations have not been clearly developed. Disagreement, if expressed, is expressed ambiguously. Relationships are vertical, and people must determine the level of politeness to use in interactions. To maintain harmonious relationships, good speakers place themselves below the listeners, sometimes not saying enough and expecting the listener to understand by inference. Since the subject of a sentence is often not stated, speakers may give their opinions as someone else's or someone  else's opinions as their own. In contrast, native English-speaking peoples historically have not been as dependent on each other for survival; individualism and privacy are well-developed, and individual rights and obligations are clear. Individuals express their own opinions and emotions clearly. Human relationships are horizontal, and people like to think of themselves as equal to everyone else. This is expressed in gestures, manners of speaking, and eye contact. Teaching these cultural differences in language classrooms would help improve intercultural communication. (MSE)",

Italian was the most heavily enrolled of the less commonly taught  languages, but only 3% of high schools offered it.

Interviews, surveys, and analysis of written compositions revealed that the reason lies in ways these concepts are understood in other languages. Arabic speakers have difficulty grasping the role of the thesis as the organizing principle in English prose because the purpose of Arabic prose is to elaborate on an accepted viewpoint. Also, for Arabic speakers, a sentence consists of a number of independent clauses. Malays present and support a viewpoint in their essays; therefore, their writing conforms more closely to American standards of  unity. The reasons seem to be Malay academic requirements for tightly organized essays and straightforward sentences and the tradition of politeness toward teachers which requires students to write well-organized essays. Like Americans, Latins write to defend a point of view, and they include a range of arguments. However, like Arabic speakers, they write serial sentences. These findings should generate more effective explanations of unity and sentence structure in English prose and an increased awareness of good writing in other languages. (MSE)",

It is proposed that ellipsis is a simple explanation of the workings of the language in which much potent ideology is embodied, that sensitization to ellipses can help expose ideological confusion, and that through this exposure, rationality can be promoted. The focus of the analysis is semantic ellipsis. Elliptical sentences of this type are grammatical, are often unambiguous and with a known context, and appear ro be perfectly meaningful. However, what is omitted is the main bearer of evaluative weight, so that agreement and commitment can be obtained for the  speaker's values and aims, with no necessity for the speaker to specify or defend them. It is suggested that an understanding of how this form of ellipsis works can be an intellectual tool in counteracting ideology in which there is no other room for critical response. (MSE)",

The subjects were 304 native English speakers and bilingual program participants, speakers of Lao and Spanish. The data are derived from a locally developed assessment system that has been validated. The results, based on analysis by language subsample, by grade and across grades, confirm that there are qualitative and quantitativce differences between the groups in all the investigated facets of English language proficiency. Meaningful intercorrelations among second language, school-based proficiencies are found in LEP students. A statistically significant association between receptive communicative  proficiency and academic proficiency emerges for younger, but not older, native English speakers. A theoretical framework that captures the relationships among the stated proficiencies is found viable for both LEP and native English-speaking students. The implications of these findings for ESL and bilingual education programs are discussed. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"A study of language maintenance and language shift among Asian Indian speakers of Kannada in the New York metropolitan area within the first generation of settlement in the United States examines this issue from a sociolinguistic perspective. The variables examined include the following: (1) proficiency in and respect for the mainstream language prior to immigration; (2) access to the middle- and upper-class social roles soon after arrival; and (3) diversity of languages or regional subcultures within the ethnic group, including differences in intensity of language loyalty. The study also addresses the claim that Indian bilingualism is conducive to maintenance rather than shift. A 55-item questionnaire was administered to 21 families of Kannada speakers, requesting information  about demographic details, opportunities for Kannada use in the United States, indicators of rootedness in the ethnic tradition, parents' use of language in different domains, the children's Kannada proficiency, children's use of and attitude toward Kannada in various situations, parents' efforts toward language maintenance, and parents' attitude toward the future of Kannada in the United States. The results are discussed in light of the language maintenance variables examined and compared with the results of similar studies. (MSE)",

        "description":"Four studies of the reliability and validity of needs assessment instruments developed by the Taylor Public Schools, Michigan, are described. The studies focused on the stability of student scores, classification stability, content validity, and concurrent validity. Consisting of separate tests for kindergarten, first and second grade, the instruments were designed to assist the school system in student selection for its compensatory education programs. Test scores were only modestly stable over a period of two to three weeks. The instruments did not reliably classify students for eligibility for compensatory education. Classroom teachers believed the tests measured important skills well. Correlations between teacher nomination for compensatory education and test scores were low.  The studies indicate districts should place greater emphasis on teacher judgment rather than test scores to identify participants. Researchers expect that using cut off scores further from the median will result in improved classification stability. The reliability of selection test scores should be examined even if staff believes tests are adequately measuring important skills. The effectiveness of locally developed needs assessment instruments for student selection into compensatory education programs must be judged in comparison to alternative procedures. (DWH)",

Data were gathered from 26 representative high schools. Chapter 1 describes the six levels of curricular policy and decision making in California and the decisions made at each level. It also portrays characteristics of schools statewide and in the study. Chapter 2 addresses graduation and proficiency requirements, which are shown to have clear effects on particular cohorts of students but which do not standardize courses of study. The courses of study of three students in one school are described to demonstrate the very different paths students can pursue. Study schools are compared in academic,  nonacademic, and elective course requirements. Chapter 3 describes the curriculum structure at each school which differentiates students into various instructional cohorts, each receiving a different curriculum determined by the department-level tracking system. Sample curriculum maps from study schools are analyzed. Chapter 4 outlines student placement and monitoring processes, showing how students receive varying amounts of support and examining the complexity and problems of monitoring student progress. The fifth and final chapter compares the effects of the policies and practices found in terms of the academic programs available to cohorts of students. Appendices contain the complete list of study topics and sample student programs. (CMG)",

The first, entitled &quot;Acculturation in Puerto Rican Families,&quot; assesses the degree of acculturation of 100 sets of married children of 100 Puerto Rican families living in New York City. Attitudes toward language, identity, and values are used as criteria. The specific values the study investigates are: (1) attitudes toward the family; (2) the presence or absence of a fatalistic outlook; (3) attitudinal preferences for Puerto Rican ways; (4) response to the &quot;modernity&quot; of American society; (5) trust of people outside the Puerto Rican group. The study concludes that the married children are much closer to mainland values and ideas than their parents are, but notes that none of the 100 chose an entirely American identity,  indicating that, despite generational differences, they have still retained Puerto Rican culture as part of their identity. The second article, entitled &quot;Kinship Networks and the Settlement Process: Dominican and Colombian Immigrants in New York City,&quot; uses recent data from a survey of Dominican and Colombian immigrants in New York City to examine the relationship between kinship networks and the migration and settlement process. The data show that chain migration characterizes these flows, inasmuch as these particular migrants are well linked into a migration system in which some relatives and friends precede them, some come with them, and still others subsequently join then in New York. Relatives present at the time of arrival provide multiple forms of assistance, particularly with  accommodation and employment searches. In addition to receiving assistance during their settlement the migrants, particularly male migrants, continue to be an important link to relatives in the home country: they provide help for relatives who wish to migrate to New York and regularly send remittances to relatives in the home country. Furthermore, analysis of the data clearly demonstrates that familial aid received at the time of first arrival in the United States does have an impact on the subsequent course of events in the life-cycle of the immigrant. When the aid is more extensive, a tendency to remain within the portective confines of the immigrant community results, even when the different backgrounds among the migrants are taken into account.

In addition the data are described as providing a benchmark for assessing the Federal Government's commitment to affirmative recruitment. Overall findings are the following: (1) Minorities and women suffered disproportionately from the Reagan Administration's reductions-in-force; (2) Agencies which reported participation rates for minorities and women equal to or higher than the Federal government-wide averages and reported progress for these groups in 1983, tended to reflect greater distribution of minorities and women in the mid-level bridge positions and/or upper grades as well; (3) Despite affirmative  action goals and legislative mandates, minority status in the Federal workforce in 1983 had improved little over 1979--minorities continued to be clustered in the low salary grades; and (4) While women constituted nearly half of the total Federal Government Service (GS) workforce, they continued to be concentrated in the lower salary grades. They made limited progress in gaining employment at the mid or upper salary levels, but there was no significant advancement in their representation in the highest paying jobs. In the light of these findings and the prospect of a continued decline in the Federal workforce, it is concluded that a stronger commitment to affirmative action principles is called for. (RDN)",

However, educators need to be cautioned against expecting &quot;trouble&quot; from the child from a one-parent family. The diversity among research findings suggests that while, as a group, single-parent children tend to have more behavioral problems in school and are at greater risk in terms of truancy and dropout rate, the likelihood of any particular child having cognitive or behavioral problems depends upon the interaction of many factors. Among those factors are the adequacy of child care arrangements; the number of siblings; the structure of the child's environment in both the home and school; the amount  of nurturing the child receives; the age, sex, and race of the child; the socioeconomic level of the family; and the circumstances surrounding the separation of the parents.

Other conclusions are that the funds' allocation requirements are necessary but the program development requirements are excessively regulated, program management is efficient but monitoring is confused, and how much students develop in these programs remains hazy. The second review, &quot;Evaluating Compensatory Education&quot; (Husen), takes a broader perspective, based in part on the reviewer's earlier participation in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's review of  U.S. educational policies. Against this background, the reviewer discusses the role of education in the United States, the philosophy and strategies behind compensatory education, Title I targeting, and evaluation problems. This review concludes that: (1) in looking at the outcome of intervention programs, a broader perspective is needed than appeared in some of the NIE evaluation efforts; (2) well-planned small-scale longitudinal studies conducted where different models of compensatory education are operated would prove more than large-scale surveys; and (3) compensatory education programs are only small changes in the larger context of formal education, and minor changes in input should not be expected to produce dramatic results.

The report is limited to programs in alternative settings, including those operated by the Board of Education and those operated under private nonprofit auspices. Following a chapter on the funding of remedial education, the report discusses and describes services for older youth provided by three structures: (1) the Board of Education (dropout, basic skills, and general equivalency programs, alternative schools, outreach centers, and literacy centers); (2) City University colleges (student remedial programs, adult remedial programs, and (3) private nonprofit organizations (basic skills, life  skills, literacy, dropout, and Job-Training-Partnership-Act programs). The report also identifies areas where better coordination would improve both students' access to appropriate programs and the quality of the services offered. A chapter on services for young students discusses truancy and remediation, the school volunteer program, and three examples of remedial programs that work. A major conclusion of the report is that the provision of better services for high-risk students is hindered by a lack of coordination among institutions &quot;jealous of their turf and concerned about protecting their funding, their power, and their reputation.&quot; Recommendations are made for action to improve the situation at the Board and State levels, and for joint action by all involved parties.

Findings, gathered by questionnaires returned by 594 aides in seven southern and central Californian counties, are discussed in terms of the following: (1) personal characteristics; (2) working situation; (3) job satisfaction and career goals; (4) resources and support for career development; (5) perceived skills held and needed to be effective in the classroom; (6) attitudes regarding unionization; and (7) aides' perceptions of the linguistic and academic needs of limited English proficient and underachieving students at their school sites. The findings related to three critical issues in the professional development of  paraprofessionals are also described: (1) the level of congruency between aides' perceptions of the skills needed to teach effectively, the skills suggested by legal requirements, and aides' assessments of their own skills; (2) the discrepancy between the perceived impact of paraprofessionals on students' skills and their own skill level, and how districts are addressing the need for inservice training and career ladder support; and (3) the attitudes of paraprofessionals toward unionization. Recommendations are made relating to: professional skill development; support systems in career ladder programs; unionization of paraprofessionals; and aides employed in bilingual, migrant, and Title I programs. Appended are materials giving more details on characteristics of aides in bilingual,  migrant and Title I programs, a copy of the questionnaire, and a list of variables. (RDN)",

The thesis that jobs of &quot;comparable worth&quot; demand pay equivalency--at least as between male-dominated and female-dominated occupations--is unworthy of serious attention in both legal and economic terms. The consequences of accepting in the United States a system of compensation based on comparable worth would all be bad. The main criticisms of comparable worth are: (1) it is concerned neither with employment discrimination nor compensation discrimination but with the redistribution of wealth along gender lines; (2) it is difficult to determine how one would ascertain whether a certain job was comparable in value to another; (3) in an open economy individual compensation is  determined not by the intrinsic societal value of the job but by the marketplace factors of supply and demand; (4) the wage gap between genders can be explained by factors other than gender-based discrimination; (5) as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires only a showing of intentional discrimination, the demands of comparable worth go far beyond Federal civil rights legislation; and (6) comparable worth would increase taxes, require expensive administration, and increase unemployment.

        "description":"Since leadership studies tend to deal with powerful public personalities, and since leadership in the U.S. is biased in terms of race, class, and sex privileges, it is not surprising that the contributions of black women leaders go largely unrecognized and that studies on black female leadership are scant and present an incomplete picture. To correct this, more ethnographic studies of communities, church groups, and families are called for, in order to determine how leadership emerges, is exerted, and is taught. Whether it can be taught, indirectly by religious and educational institutions, or directly by special courses, is still being debated. As far as black women are concerned, educational and religious institutions have done little to foster leadership training. It has been  the social and church clubs and informal community networks that have been the training grounds for black women leaders. There are obstacles to such leadership training, however: (1) declining participation in the clubs; (2) the negative myth of the black matriarchy; (3) the socialization of black girls away from male-dominated areas such as politics; and (4) the neglect of black women community leaders by public institutions and the media. And finally, although it is debatable whether college extra-curricular activities have played a serious role in the promotion of black women's leadership except for the nurturance provided by women students' clubs and sororities, it seems that the extra-curriculum has become even less responsive to women's leadership potential over the past decade.

        "description":"In order to provide guidance for agencies in developing effective programs for pregnant and parenting teens, this article analyzes data from 21 federally funded care programs involved in a national evaluation. First, the question of a program's location and structure was addressed. Rural projects were found to be less service-rich than their urban counterparts and non-hospital programs of several varieties all delivered more services of most types and more total services than did hospital projects. It was concluded that the key to a good program lies more in competent management and good community relations than in specific structures or models. Second, with regard to client characteristics, girls who entered the programs pregnant were found to receive more services than those  coming in as entry mothers, and girls on welfare received more services than those who were not. Third, an examination of service costs revealed that even more important than the absolute cost of different client types was the contrast between clients' entitlements and what they get &quot;extra&quot; in these programs. Fourth, an examination of project implementation and management uncovered the need for adequate lead time to develop interagency coordination; the need for adequate case management, client record keeping and tracking; and the need for greater emphasis on services to parenting teens. Finally, programs are urged to take seriously the needs not only of pregnant teens but also of teen parents and school dropouts. (RDN)",

Its principal criticism is that Volume I fails to address the underlying intent of the commissioned study: (1) to assess the American involvement in the take-over of the Kingdom of Hawaii; (2) based on the finding regarding American participation in the coup d'etat of 1893, to ascertain whether American culpability for injuries or damages suffered by Native Hawaiians existed; and (3) to advise about how to approach and answer any such Native Hawaiian claims. This volume of the report further states that critical  support is lacking for Volume I's argument that the United States bears no legal or moral responsibility for the actions of American officals during the coup d'etat of 1893. After an executive summary, flaws of methodology, interpretation, and conclusion in the following areas covered by Volume I are discussed: (1) the historical review of American participation in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893; (2) the conditions and terms of American annexation of the Hawaiian Islands; (3) the trust responsibilities of the Hawaiian Homes Act; and (4) the cultural and social needs of native Hawaiians. Recommendations are presented regarding rhe resolution of compensable claims by Native Hawaiians for losses of domain and dominion. (KH)",

        "description":"Many states have mandated two possibly far-reaching legislative reforms within secondary vocational education: minimum competency requirements and increased course requirements for graduation. Most legislated educational reforms include only selected aspects of competency-based systems, primarily the specification of and testing for minimum competencies in reading and mathematics. The minimum competency movement often becomes a testing movement because testing is the most immediate way for legislators to satisfy the public. A particular danger in testing is that its advocates may have two different understandings of its purpose--accountability versus effectiveness. Because more state tests focus on basic language and computational skills, they may affect instruction by narrowing  the curriculum. The increase in required courses may deny students a vocational track because they have fewer electives. School personnel may not be given sufficient time to develop plans to substitute vocational courses for academic requirements. Both reforms involve the issue of what constitutes a proper education for today's technological society. Within business and industry, two apparently contradictory factions have emerged. One group emphasizes vocational education, career education, and basic skills; the other emphasizes a strengthened liberal arts curriculum. Both advocate, ultimately, specialized knowledge as well as employability skills. (YLB)",

Because U.S. agriculture has undergone unprecedented technological change since the 1930s, this provides an excellent case study of the effects of technology. Section 2 examines the potential impact of high technology on rural people and areas and concludes that high technology will influence rural areas more as users than as producers of such technology. The next two sections focus on two major high technology users--the farming industry and local rural government and  schools. Applications of computers in agriculture and telecommunications in marketing are described, forecasts of future microcomputer uses on farms are made, and selected applications by the public sector are considered.

Principal dimensions of employment opportunities in the &quot;old economy&quot; of the 1950s and 1960s are highlighted, and the impact of the emergence of the &quot;new economy&quot; on the aggregate structure of employment opportunities is identified. A short review follows of how major groups of disadvantaged workers have fared vis-a-vis this new structure of employment opportunities. The analysis of the transformation of employment opportunities is refined to show how the postwar expansion of the higher education system and recent technological advances have acted to alter required skills, the process of skill acquisition, and  job characteristics. These major conclusions are reached: the trend towards labor market &quot;bifurcation&quot; need not imply that all jobs in the labor market's lower tiers are becoming de-skilled, labor market misadjustments are occurring that require attention, the economy's continuing shift from manual to cognitive processes will continue to place a premium on better schooling and higher level training and retraining, and vocational and higher education institutions will continue to assume increasing importance in opening avenues for upward mobility.

Concepts from learning theory are translated to the world of educational software; these include: classical and operant conditioning, cognitive approaches, and learning efficiency and effectiveness. Instructional models that might be derived from learning theory are analyzed. Instructional methodology for  computer delivery is discussed in terms of the nature of the hardware available and the appropriateness of the software to the instructional objectives--both of which place constraints on using computers for instruction. Criteria used in available instruments for evaluating educational software are presented, including software objectives and design, acquisition, program content, hardware/software operation and the user, and compatibility and special system needs.

        "description":"In view of the rapid change in computer-related technologies and their societal applications, one would expect diverse opinions among educators about the need for computer literacy in schools and the best methods of attaining it. In addition, the definition of computer literacy has continually changed along with changing technological applications in various sectors of society. Indicators of the integration of computer-related tools, methods, and concepts into the curricula of vocational education programs are found in state and local education agencies' policies, curriculum guidelines, topics at vocational education conferences, teacher training, textbooks, and software developments. Because of the current information revolution and the lack of appropriate mechanisms for  vocational education to anticipate change, the rapid technology change makes predictions concerning skills requirements uncertain. Views regarding the impact of automation on employment include the less-skill perspective, the more-skill perspective, and the view that society is in a period of transformation or paradigm shift. Vocational education needs to find methods not only to respond to the changing workplace but to anticipate changes in it. (Appendixes include a study of computer literacy requirements in three sample occupations and a study of vocational instructors in computer specialist occupations.) (YLB)",

Section 1 describes robot characteristics (type of drive, method of teaching, lifting capacity, shape, type of motion or path, and sensory capabilities). Robot systems, computer-aided design and manufacturing, and flexible manufacturing are also defined. In section 2 the practicalities of robot applications are discussed in terms of payback periods and constraints on robot usage. The third section attempts to assess what may happen to robotics over the next few years, including changes in: (1) performance characteristics of robots  (sensory perception and control), (2) their degree of use, (3) producers, and (4) impacts of robots on employment. The last major section makes recommendations for robotics education at the vocational and two-year college levels. Recommendations include no robotics training in secondary vocational schools and teaching of robotics at the two-year college level as part of an integrated approach to automation, with electronics as the core curriculum. Recommendations are also made to industrial managers considering robotics and government manpower agencies considering retraining programs. (YLB)",

First, demographic and economic shifts and projections into the next century are discussed as the context for needed training. Second, the promise and positive impacts of new technologies in office and business settings are explored, along with the problems that may accompany the introduction of automation in such settings. Approaches to avoiding or alleviating these problems are then presented, along with an examination of the general barriers to adult participation in (re)training programs. The third section discusses the types of training programs available to adults from a variety of providers in the corporate sector (in-house programs, contracts with a  postsecondary education institution, tuition-assistance programs, union negotiated training programs), the education and training sector (noncollegiate postsecondary schools, four-year colleges and universities, two-year colleges, professional associations), and the public sector (educational brokering services, public school systems, local community programs, Federal employment and training programs, collaborative training programs). Examples of specific programs are detailed for each sector. Increased emphasis on programs and information that address the needs of adults for training in new office and business technologies is recommended. (Author/YLB)",

The text is divided into two sections. The Home Worker section provides a summary of the At Home in the Office Project, personality characteristics believed to be related to successful home work programs, characteristics of work that seem to be suited for working at home, and laws and agencies that affect the home worker. The Online Lines section supplies information to help home workers select appropriate hardware and software for the basic work station and optional equipment to add to the basic design. Other topics include defining a work space, selecting appropriate furnishings,  arranging the home work station, and telecommuting and its suitability for home workers. Five exercises are provided to help home workers evaluate the home work option more precisely. They cover assessing the suitability of one's personality and job to home work; assessing software needs; comparing hardware, software, and vendors; evaluating available software packages; and designing a home work space. Two other exercises help to figure the start-up costs and to ascertain the feasibility of telecommuting. A simulation of a typical home worker's day follows.

        "description":"This document summarizes the preliminary findings of U.S. House of Representatives and research on the workings of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) of 1982 during its first nine months. To prepare this print, the committee conducted Congressional forums and site visits in Seattle, Washington; Cleveland, Ohio; Nashville, Tennessee; and Portland, Maine. In addition, a field hearing was held in Jackson, Mississippi. Participants in the hearings and forums included state and local JTPA administrators, local elected officials, private industry council members, educators, spokespersons for various interest groups, and representatives of community-based organizations. The committee found that, in general, JTPA appears to have generated a great deal of enthusiasm among  commentators, and that transition issues seem to have been resolved. The researchers also found that some of the problems with the Act stem from lack of knowledge of its provisions, rather than from the Act itself; however, it was felt that performance standards should be adjusted so that programs were not penalized for helping more seriously disadvantaged persons. Finally, the initial findings indicated that the transition is still proceeding as the full impact of the change in public policy from the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) to JTPA is realized and institutional adjustments are completed. The report summarizes findings in each area of the Act (job training, program requirements, youth services, dislocated workers, job development, employment service, and national  activities). (KC)",

Data for the study were obtained from the National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experience, Youth Cohort (NLS Youth). In some cases, the 1979 data from the high school class of 1972 database supplemented the NLS Youth, and, for noneconomic outcomes, class of 1972 data were used exclusively. These data indicated that high school vocational education is associated with a clear wage advantage for vocational graduates in jobs related to their area of training. Postsecondary education also appeared to add to this advantage. Although vocational education brought an increase in labor force participation for white women, no  significant relationship between vocational education and employment stability was found for other demographic groups. Noneconomic outcomes of participation in a high school vocational education program turned out to be more difficult to assess; however, the noneconomic benefits of participation in postsecondary education were clear. Those who achieved a postsecondary degree were more likely to register and vote and to accept as positive the current societal trend toward broadening the role of women in the labor market. The earnings advantage of vocational education was most pronounced among white males and did not exist at all for minorities of either sex. The policy implications of these findings were examined.

Data for the study were compiled from a telephone survey of 3,500 employers; a mail survey of 750 employers from across the country; 493 employers, 71 teachers, and 1,565 students from 5 major U.S. cities who participated in an employability survey; and 76 Columbus, Ohio employers who attended a half-day hiring decision seminar. In-school preparation of youth for employment and for the transition from school to work was examined from the point of view of basic skills and the problem of student motivation, part-time work during high school, high school curricula, and the selection of young workers. Employer training practices were examined with  respect to the theory of on-the-job training (OJT), the magnitude of OJT, the impact of job-specific training on productivity and turnover, and reasons for underachievement in OJT. Policy implications of these practices were formulated.

        "description":"This three-part instructional guide was developed to assist vocational instructors in business and office occupations in presenting broadly applicable, nontechnical (often called quality of work life--QWL) skills, such as interpersonal and group process skills, problem solving and decision making, planning, communications, business economics, organizational management, and quality control. The first section of the guide describes in detail the important transferable, nontechnical skills needed for work and identifies specific opportunities to incorporate the development of these skills in business and office education programs. The second section of the guide presents instructional strategies as a source of ideas that the instructor can use in the classroom, laboratory, or  training workplace. The description of each instructional strategy contains the following information: (1) a description of the strategy and a statement of its purpose, (2) a discussion of the QWL competencies developed through the strategy, (3) its application in business and office curricula, (4) instructor and student roles during implementation of the strategy, (5) procedures and activities for use in presenting the strategy, and (6) an annotated list of resources. The last section of the guide contains a list of resources organized by nontechnical skill area, addresses of publishers listed, and addresses of associations of interest to business and office education teachers.

The review of the literature--information and suggestions for planning--is presented in dialogue form, since the conversational approach seemed appropriate for the focus on practical application rather than policy analysis. The paper is action-oriented: readers are asked to formulate questions to address to various writers of the references and apply the information to their action planning. The dialogue among a facilitator (the writer) and four hypothetical counselors centers on these general topics: theoretical concerns; adult needs, problems, and characteristics; service providers and specific issues; broad generalizations and specific  advice; additional program considerations; specific adult groups; and a brief look at the future. The summary of the findings is presented in the form of numerous questions that might assist the user in the planning process. Some concluding thoughts are followed by these recommended planning activities: probe the literature; enter the dialogue; weigh the advantages and disadvantages of planning through networking, linkages, and shared resources; use a planning model; plot out an ideal program; and complete the planning matrix that is provided. Ten pages of references are appended. (YLB)",

Chapter 1 discusses the development of a proposed framework identifying the elements of vocational education quality. The framework is composed of three critical components: context, educational experience, and vocational outcomes. Chapter 2 introduces and defines the elements of quality related to educational outcomes. These elements are categorized under two general types of outcomes: individual and societal, with a subset of societal outcomes specific to employers. Chapter 3 parallels chapter 2 in structure but focuses on the elements of quality related to the educational experience. It  discusses the school context and school process, and their components, which define the boundaries of the school context and school process domains. Chapter 4 presents some issues and guidelines regarding the development of quality indicators for the elements within the proposed model. It defines quality, describes approaches to assessing quality, and then suggests a process for identifying and prioritizing subelements within the model. References are appended. (YLB)",

It is intended for policymakers at all levels, professional organizations, and vocational teachers responsible for carrying out the actual implementation of program standards policy. Chapter 1 is an introduction that provides definitions, a historical review of standards in education, and a description of recent efforts to improve educational standards. Chapter 2 sets forth the problem: at what level of government--federal, state, or local--should program standards in vocational education be administered? In chapter 3 six criteria are presented for use in judging the three leadership options: curriculum  flexibility, evaluation use, articulation, program access, policy administration, and compliance. Chapter 4 contains descriptions of how a policy requiring vocational education to base its program on a set of standards might look at each level. In chapter 5 each of the three policy alternatives is analyzed in terms of the six criteria. Pros and cons are listed for each option. Chapter 6 recommends a state-sponsored standards policy as the most efficacious in enhancing excellence in vocational education and offers reasons for this policy choice. (YLB)",

Commonalities and differences among the studies were identified, and a selection of these was developed further with major emphases on teaching and learning. Topics were selected according to their immediacy and relevance for vocational education. The analyses of these studies highlighted the need for improvement of education in the public school system, concentrating on high schools. The most effective strategy was the improvement of teaching. Problems in the teaching profession and ways to differentiate and reward good teaching were identified. Needs were found for better teacher recruitment and retention, improved preservice education,  technological and professional updating of teachers in the field, teacher recognition, equity and equality in teacher education, and certification. Specific recommendations addressed improvement of instruction through incorporating basic academic skills in vocational education curricula, implementing competency-based instruction in the vocational classroom, and using time-on-task research. Attracting a different caliber of student to teacher education programs, adding more years of study to preservice programs, and modifying teacher certification were considered as possible and necessary steps to improve the future classroom teacher.

Criteria for estimating the appropriateness of evaluation findings are given, and recommendations are offered for creating an infrastructure among local, State, and Federal agencies to enhance utilization of evaluation findings. Section 1 explains the basic elements of excellence and evaluation using a three-step discrepancy analysis model. Attainment of excellence through the three stages of defining excellence, discrepancy identification, and discrepancy analysis is illustrated. Section 2 examines National studies in light of these elements of evaluation and excellence and presents  highlights of some states' and localities' use of evaluation results, especially in vocational education. Section 3 introduces three approaches to organizing for excellence: centralized, partially decentralized, and decentralized. Attention is then given to program improvement structures. Organization of vocational excellence councils is explored, the value of information networks connected by computers is stressed, and role responsibilities of local administrators within a State improvement system are discussed. Section 4 provides background from within and outside vocational education on perceived necessities for interactively attaining and maintaining excellence through evaluations at local, State, and National levels.

Section 2 summarizes predictions about the future of work and the needs of employers. The implications of these predictions are identified. Section 3 provides criteria for building a pretechnical curriculum that will be responsive to both the needs of employers and employees. These criteria are utility, personal options, transferability, and psychosocial value. Sections 4 and 5 describe transition skills and  problem-solving skills and their applications. Models for handling transitions and for problem solving are provided. Section 6 describes how the pretechnical curriculum may be implemented in the schools. Topics include responsibilities of academic and vocational educators, an implementation structure, responsibility for teaching generalizable skills, an instructional strategy for vocational educators, and resources and guidelines for implementation of the transition model.

Section 2 provides information on forces affecting criteria for evaluating policy options. These forces are summarized as four views of job training: human capital, signaling, training opportunity, and core and periphery. Section 3 discusses these criteria for assessing policy options: action oriented, equity effect, and efficiency effect. Section 4 presents three policy options for reforming job training in the  high school--eliminate job training from the high schools, reorganize high school job training to provide only general prerequisite skills to master any specific occupational area (diminish distinctions between academic and vocational curricula), and reorganize job training in the high school to enhance occupationally specific instruction (sharpen the distinctions between academic and vocational curricula). Discussion then focuses on student access reforms. Section 5 states recommendations intended to aid policymakers in their pursuit of effective and equitable job training programs. (YLB)",

The first part of the guide describes the scope and aims of DACUM and the role of the DACUM coordinator. Discussed next are procedures for planning a DACUM workshop and selecting DACUM committee  members. Guidelines for conducting a DACUM orientation, facilitating group interaction, and constructing a DACUM chart are set forth.

        "description":"Existing data on youth employment and career guidance programs were analyzed to identify factors that are most important in producing individuals who can find and keep a job. The data were obtained longitudinally from 419 youth employment training program participants and from 356 non-participants over approximately three years beyond the time of training program completion. Both descriptive and relational analyses were carried out. Findings showed significantly more months of employment, greater job satisfaction, and more months of education/training for the participants. These differences were sustained after controlling for the effects of age, sex, race/ethnicity, economic status, local unemployment rate, and preprogram levels of education and reading ability. The employment  effects were greatest in programs that emphasized work experience or on-the-job training. Participant-control differences in months of employment were greater for minority than non-minority youth and greater for females than males. Background, previous education, and local unemployment rates were shown to have a greater effect on economic outcomes than the effect provided by program participation. It was concluded that investment in youth employment training programs can be expected to have a direct payoff in reducing youth unemployment. (Thirty tables and 19 figures are included. The followup questionnaire is appended.) (Author/YLB)",

        "description":"A study investigated whether graduates of cooperative education programs, especially those who remain with a former co-op employer, report a greater sense of power in their jobs than other new college hires. Two mechanisms by which cooperative education might lead to this outcome were hypothesized: better organizational socialization and greater perceived relevance of job to career plans. The population studied was college graduates working on their first full-time job since graduation. Data were obtained by mailed questionnaire from 225 employees. Results showed that cooperative education graduates have more realistic expectations regarding their first job after college than do graduates of typical degree programs. Such expectations, which provide evidence of successful early  socialization to the company, were also predictive of an important outcome of socialization--commitment to the employing organization. More co-op graduates were concerned about and chose jobs relevant to their career plans. Although co-op status itself was not a significant predictor of employee sense of power, organizational commitment and job relevance were. Data showed cooperative education experience facilitates the transition from student to employee and may serve as a mediating effect to enhance employee sense of power on the job.

Tappey Turner) concerning the role of adult educators in the information age and the attitudes of adult educators toward the recent information explosion. In perspective 1, on the roles of the adult educator in the &quot;information ocean,&quot; it is suggested that adult educators must assume two roles: they must assist learners in making sense out of specialized information in light of the learner's life situation and they must help learners identify information that is needed and not available. After a discussion of Margaret Mead's assertion that the information explosion has made the transmission of knowledge from teacher to student a lateral rather than a  vertical process, in perspective 2 it is concluded that adult educators must focus on providing a sense of connectedness and increase their efforts in the areas of collaborative research, interdisciplinary sharing, and development of an atmosphere of collaboration among adult educators rather than one of competition. Perspective 3 expands upon the metaphor comparing coping with information to swimming in the ocean, and suggests that adult educators must learn themselves and must help adult students learn to be selective in focusing their attention on and attempting to come to terms with specific subject areas and levels of complexity of information, thus selecting that information that is most useful to their own needs.

If providers of apprenticeship training programs are to be able to follow this recommendation and to effect other changes in the structure of apprenticeship training programs that have become necessary as a result of recent technological, demographic, and economic changes, then a strong collaborative partnership must be maintained between the vocational education and private sectors. The two sectors must provide joint support for the following: research and development, demonstration projects and activities, curriculum development and related instruction, and apprenticeship school linkage  activities. In 1983, the U.S. Department of Education implemented several important projects in the areas of improvement of related instruction in apprenticeship training and improvement of linkages between vocational education and organized labor in the United States. Moreover, the new Federal legislation, the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act of 1984, contains several provisions geared toward improvinq the linkages and collaboration between apprenticeship and vocational education. (MN)",

        "description":"A project to develop grass roots alternative diploma study (Project GRADS) was undertaken for the purpose of formulating and implementing a multimodal, systems approach to preparing rural adults to pass the General Educational Development (GED) Tests. During the year-long, countywide program, GED programming was developed and delivered via the local public information television channel, videotaped lessons available for home use on videocassette records and televisions, regular GED study lessons published daily in the local newspaper, counseling and tutoring programs, and small group community-based study sites. By the end of the project, close to 400 residents of Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania participated in the outreach program. Included among the program participants were  inmates from the nearby county and State prisons, elderly persons, unemployed and underemployed individuals, Headstart mothers, and youths with a history of delinquent activity. It was concluded that the project can serve as an effective model of rural GED preparation programming.

        "description":"A study assessed the need for technology programs in the Bedford and Bloomington areas of Indiana. After compiling such background data as population projections for the cities, the educational level of adults living in the region, and the number and size of firms located in the area, the researchers formulated projected requirements for engineering technicians, computer programmers, supervisors, and quality control specialists in the area. Next, these projections were corroborated through interviews with representatives of local industries and appropriate agencies and by comparing the local projections with national employment projections for the same occupations. As a result of an analysis of these data the following actions were recommended: authorization to implement an  electrical engineering technology associate degree program, authorization to implement a supervision technology associate degree program provision of related adult continuing education and service courses, development and implementation of computer technology and quality control specialist programs, formation of technology advisory committees, and expansion of existing efforts in the areas of liaison and coordination.

        "description":"The goal of this special demonstration project was to develop adult secondary business education courses related to the computer. An additional phase focused on the development of a microcomputer-based program providing the needed computer literacy and applications for its use. An advisory committee identified five areas of instructional need: word processing, computer programming, computer accounting, data entry, and microcomputer use. The six instructors who would teach the courses developed course descriptions, topical outlines, course plans, and promotional material and examined and selected software for each area. Following the 10-page narrative, appendixes provide the materials produced. These include the materials for an introductory computer terminal applications course  (course outline, day-to-day plans), computerized accounting (course outline, software instructions, curriculum guide, and course plan), computer programming (structured BASIC course outline and day-to-day plan, COBOL course outline), word processing (introduction, course day-to-day plan, sample instructor assignment sheet), and data entry (course outline). Other appendixes contain promotional and certificate program information, a paper on microcomputer use in adult learning center classes, a description of a microcomputer use course, and ratings of evaluated software.

        "description":"A study was undertaken to determine how driver education courses in Texas schools can be designed to reach maximum effectiveness for a maximum number of eligible new drivers. The two-phased, classroom instruction plus an \"in-car\" practicum were found to be the type of driver education commonly offered. A consensus description of a quality driver education program was developed that outlined the curriculum (topics and suggested number of class and laboratory hours), graduation credit, teacher certification, supervision, and evaluation. Three alternatives for providing state-level funding to school districts for driver education were suggested: semester program (classroom only), comprehensive semester program (classroom and in-car instruction), and minimum program. Pre- and  post-driver education experiences and controls were recommended. The requirement of maintaining a minimum grade-point average as a prerequisite to receiving driver education was considered and rejected. Recommendations made for a comprehensive driver education program covered curriculum teacher training, classroom and behind-the-wheel instruction, credit for graduation, grade-point average prerequisites, state-level funding, post-driver training experiences and controls, supervision of local driver education programs, and evaluation. (Appendixes provide a description of the current driver education program, an outline of a comprehensive driver education curriculum, and driver education instructor training recommended course content.)

Among the complex causes of illiteracy are ineffective schooling, intergenerational transmission of literacy or illiteracy (reinforced by poverty and discrimination), and rising standards of functional literacy. Beyond the dollar costs, individuals and society pay a price when so many cannot actively participate in social, political, and cultural affairs. The magnitude and scope of the illiteracy problem require a coordinated, fully mobilized national strategy capable of facing the challenges of: outreach to the hard-to-reach illiterate population, lack of a legitimized niche for literacy education in the educational structure, paucity of research and  development data, and insufficient financial resources. To help those out of school acquire literacy skills as well as to ensure that children learn to read and write in their formative years, the following steps are recommended: (1) a broad, flexible definition of literacy, (2) a pluralistic delivery system, (3) expanded community-oriented efforts, (4) improved coordination and communication, (5) staff development for literacy educators, (6) more full-time professionals, (7) support services, (8) detailed program evaluation, (9) continued research, and (10) increased Federal support.

The sample programs included three military, three prison, three English as a second language, two job skills centers, one library, and one community based. At each site, program administrators, teachers, counselors, and students participated in formal and informal interviews, and program materials were reviewed to gather information on (1) counseling for academic and vocational, human development, and empowerment purposes, as well as peer support and ancillary support systems (e.g., child care); (2) staff composition  and teacher attitudes and behavior; and (3) types of materials and their appropriateness for student needs, concerns, learning styles, and contexts. In general, it was found that teachers carry the main burden of counseling and other support; peer support is an important need of adult learners; ancillary supports reflect a program's values; assessment of human development and empowerment gains is difficult; and the teacher's attitude of respect for the learner's background and experience is crucial to program effectiveness.

In order to determine the effects of sexual assault versus other types of violent crime, and of completed crimes versus those attempted but not completed, 2,004 adult women (a response rate of 84.1%) completed telephone inteviews with female interviewers. Subjects were contacted using random digit dialing. On the basis of their responses to screening questions, respondents were classified into victimization groups ranging from completed forcible rape to aggravated assault to nonvictims, and then were asked questions relating to their overall mental health. The results indicated that victims of violent crimes other than rape experienced some of the same mental health problems (nervous breakdowns,  suicide attempts) experienced by victims of rape and sexual molestation. However, the victms of rape and attempted molestation were found to have problems more frequently than other types of victims. While the mental health consequences of completed rape were found to be much worse than attempted rape, attempted molestation and attempted robbery had more negative mental health consequences than did the completed crimes. There was strong evidence that victimization had a profound negative impact on the mental health of victims, and that the majority of these problems came after the victimization experience. (LLL)",

In addition, participants' personal predictions of alcohol effects in three conditions were combined with their weight,  corrected for gender, to obtain a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) for each condition. Results showed that the majority of men and women report drinking alcoholic beverages; analysis of consumption by gender did not yield significant results. Large numbers of respondents had general information about alcohol, while fewer respondents answered questions dealing with directly useful information. There was no significant difference between male and female participants on knowledge of alcohol effects on women.

        "description":"The problem of human response to loss is complex. To approach understanding of this process it is valuable to use a number of models. Phenomenologically the application of a temporal matrix divides the reaction into three useful heuristic and empirical stages: initial, acute grief (1-3 months); mourning (1-2 years); and post-mourning, with no set time limit. Another approach involves separating the affective and behavioral functions that accompany the bereavement response. The adaptive goal of the bereavement response is the assimilation of the reality of the loss. Successful resolution refers to a positive quality in the bereaved's relationship with the internal model or representation of the deceased, and not to the death itself. Assessing resolution is a clinical judgment  regarding the state of this bi-directional relationship between the other and self. Resolution implies that the bereaved is neither compulsively preoccupied with, nor avoiding of, the internal representation of the deceased. The treatment problems in the management of the relationship involve examination of the current status of the bereaved and his/her recollections of the other; by looking for change and evolution, resolution can be approached, while leaving room for the relationship.

Recent results of the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) were obtained for each student. Results indicated strong, positive relationships between the Cognitive PCSC scale and ITBS scores. PCSC scales and sociometric ratings were found to be significantly related. Multiple regression analyses revealed the RCMAS Anxiety scale to best predict each of the PCSC  scales.

Results showed that older people typically fear crime more than young people. However, 84 percent said they felt safe all or most of the time in their neighborhoods. Fear of crime was a reflection of both personal factors (sex, health, and income), and locational characteristics (urbanism, tract population characteristics, housing type, and satisfaction with type of people in the neighborhood). While fear reduced subjective well-being, it had little relationship to  activity patterns. Social resources had little bearing on fear of crime and its consequences.

To examine whether aging is associated with attitudinal rigidity, nine surveys from the National Opinion Research Center were analyzed to determine whether older cohorts have kept pace with or lagged behind younger cohorts on the issue of sexual morality. Mean score trends were traced over a 10-year span and the direction of attitude change was determined for five cohorts. Scores were adjusted for possible compositional effects due to educational attainment and sex, and examined for inter-cohort and intra-cohort differences. Results of the analysis of the premarital sexual  relations item indicated that liberal, tolerant, or permissive attitudes were more prevalent among the younger cohorts than among the older cohorts, but there were no indications that the older cohorts had become more conservative over the period encompassed by the surveys. Equally stable patterns were characteristic of the younger cohorts. Analyses of the extramarital sexual relations and homosexual relations items revealed the same pattern. Attitudinal rigidity appears to be no more characteristic of older persons than of younger persons. (LLL)",

The questionnaire was organized into definitions of the mentor-protege relationship, self-ratings of mentor and protege personality traits and behaviors, environmental influences on the mentoring process, and frequency of the relationship within the department. Results indicated that students and faculty generally hold similar perceptions of mentoring and think it is a valuable process. Significant differences were found on behavior scores, with applied faculty members and third year  students scoring highest on a measure assessing mentor and protege behaviors.

        "description":"This report presents a summary of the findings of a study conducted to examine the costs, experiences, and ramifications of removing children from adult jails and lockups. The approach used to conduct the study during a 6-month period (December, 1981-May, 1982) combined a mailed survey questionnaire to access state level information, and a detailed interview survey process to determine the cost and ramifications of jail removal efforts in selected local/regional areas which have either eliminated the jailing of juveniles, or were implementing a plan to effect complete removal as required by Congress. The structure of the report reflects the multiple information sources used to estimate jail removal costs and ramifications. The integrated findings and recommendations have been  compiled through the use of the cost models on program operations, the 50 state surveys, and information on the actual experiences of the jurisdictions participating in the OJJDP Jail Removal Initiative. The discussion is organized under the three major topics mandated by Congress: (1) likely costs associated with implementing removal requirements; (2) experiences of jurisdictions which currently require the removal of juveniles from adult jails and lockups; and (3) ramifications which may result from the removal requirement. Within each major topic, results are presented in terms of the source of information (e.g., whether the results are from the state surveys, the experiences of jurisdictions currently requiring removal, or the cost analysis and models of currently operating  alternatives). Next, a set of conclusions drawn from the results is detailed. Finally, three recommendations following the last set of conclusions are presented. (MCF)",

The foreword supplies background information and hypothetical removal cost estimates. The approach used to conduct the jail removal cost study is described. The next section reviews information on the costs of alternatives to the placement of juveniles in jail. Three policy choices available to decision makers faced with removing juveniles from jails are discussed. The next sections present models for the three policy areas discussed: secure detention facilities, community residential care, and community supervision. Each section describes the characteristics of the programs  within each policy area and presents cost models derived from the sample. Results of the 50-state survey regarding existing juvenile populations, and costs and ramifications of removal are reviewed. The removal experiences of four jurisdictions involved in the Federal Jail Removal Initiative and those of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are analyzed. The potential ramifications of the removal requirement are discussed. and the costs and ramifications for removal are summarized. Conclusions and recommendations are stated for costs of removal, current utilization of alternatives and characteristics of the juvenile justice system, and removal experiences. (LLL)",

        "description":"Individuals may be stigmatized (discredited) if their attributes make them less than what is expected for the social categories into which they are placed. A tentative typology of situations can be developed, based on their potential for producing the stigmatization of old age. In daily situations that do not demand excessive physical or mental capabilities, those who decline to perform without legitimate excuses may be stigmatized. In physically or mentally demanding situations where adverse effects on one's physical or mental state are more likely to occur, stigmatization is likely. In situations where people have enough time to rest, take medications, or cover potential age stigma signs, potentially discrediting attributes are not revealed and individuals are not stigmatized.  Finally, in situations where chronological age is used for administrative decision making, individuals are reclassified rather than stigmatized. Other factors which influence the possibility of age stigmatization are commitment, generational contacts, performance norms, and gender. In conclusion, old age is an attribute with variable meaning within our society and is best understood within the specific situations in which its meaning and relevance are determined. (NRB)",

The need for reauthorization of this act over the years is described as a continuing effort to meet the special and changing needs of older adults. Statements are included from committee members, senior citizens, administrators, and service providers, suggesting changes and additions to the Older Americans Act. Testimony is given by Maryland directors of county commissions on aging, officers and  volunteers from senior centers and programs, representatives of the Maryland Office on Aging and the Maryland Association of Senior Centers, and a member of the American Association of Retired Persons.

        "description":"Despite the importance of activity programs in geriatric long-term care settings, there has been little investigation of the recreational needs, wants, and interests of male residents. A descriptive interview survey, which assessed self-reported leisure interests, time preference, and morale was given to 102 staff members and 55 male residents of a 473-bed multi-level residential care facility. Interests were dichotomized into Do Now and Would Like To Do categories. The number of Do Now activities reported correlated positively and significantly with functional ability, length of stay, and morale. No relationship was found between these variables and the reported number of Would Like To Do activities. Age and education were not significant predictors. Greatest interest was shown  in Social, Sports, Educational/Cultural/Entertainment, and Nature activities. Least interest was shown in Volunteer, Craft, Organizational, and Collection activities. Nature and Trip activities were most frequently mentioned in the Would Like To Do category. Although congruence was found between staff and male residents' reports of residents' leisure interests, differences emerged between these groups on time preferences and the value of sex-segregated activities. Input is needed from both groups to insure adequate programming. (Author/NRB)",

In addition, respondents indicated their perceptions of child care facilities and services needs. Data were collected for the 3-month period from October to December, 1982, and coded for analysis. The results showed that most children were able to be placed in facilities which met their needs. The children who needed different types of facilities were in need of comprehensive structured environments and/or specialized  counseling services. Male placements outnumbered females by over 2 to 1, and eight of every ten wards placed in residential care were between the ages of 13 and 18. (The major portion of this report presents the survey results in 45 data tables with accompanying text. The appendices include a detailed description of the study methodology and the survey instrument.) (MCF)",

Specifically, the study examined the focus of remedial instruction and the relationships of this instruction to the classroom reading program. In addition, it gathered data on what instructional activities remedial students missed when they left their regular classrooms. Information was gathered through observation of remedial reading students both in their classroom reading instruction and in their remedial sessions. Students were from five different first through fourth grade classrooms in four different schools. Four of the five programs were organized around a &quot;pull out&quot; model wherein the students left the regular classroom for remedial instruction. The fifth was an  in-class program in which instruction was delivered by a Chapter 1 aide. Results showed that while individual teachers used little instructional variety, they did use a wide range of materials. There was little evidence of the use of clear cut goals or of monitoring of student advancement toward goals, and teachers tended to use a single or small set of activities for all of their groups of students. Little congruence was found between instruction in regular classrooms and instruction in the remedial classes. Data also supported previous findings that Chapter 1 programs do not provide students with additional time for reading instruction. (FL)",

        "description":"A 15-minute reading inventory was administered to 188 students in seven rural districts to assess and compare the reading maturity of the college-bound juniors and seniors in those districts. Results showed that on a leisure reading attitude scale, the college-bound students had an average score of 60 points with 20 being the lowest and 100 the highest possible scores. Rural students spent an average of 68 minutes reading leisure books on a typical vacation day. They also reported reading 12 different kinds of books during the past year. When the findings were compared with those of a nationally representative sampling of seventh grade students and college freshmen, it was determined that there were no significant differences among the various groups in attitude toward leisure  book reading. However, the rural, college-bound high school student group did spend more time in leisure book reading during vacation times than did university freshmen. Also, the rural group's average time devoted to leisure book reading was significantly greater than the average times of each of the other groups. Finally, the rural high school students seemed to have a wider breadth of reading interests and listed more reasons for reading than did university freshmen.

        "description":"Models of similarity have traditionally assumed that the similarity relation is symmetrical. However, when reversed, similarity statements frequently have different properties from those of the original. Previous attempts to account for the asymmetry of similarity have focused only on literal comparisons, resulting in a tendency to underestimate the degree of asymmetry in nonliteral comparisons, that is, similes. In a model of similarity proposed to account for the varying degrees of asymmetry found in all kinds of natural language comparisons, asymmetry is attributed to an imbalance in the salience of the shared attributes. Studies that have tested key aspects of the model appear to provide converging evidence for the claim that asymmetry is due at least in part to salience  imbalance. (Author/HOD)",

In addition, semantic mapping and semantic feature analysis--instructional strategies that build upon students' prior knowledge--were compared with a modified basal approach for effectiveness as prereading instructional treatments for both vocabulary acquisition and passage comprehension. Fourth grade students from 13 classrooms were placed in either a full, partial, or control treatment group. Students in the full treatment group received prereading vocabulary instruction and read a basal passage prior to taking vocabulary and comprehension tests; subjects in the partial group either received vocabulary instruction or read the passage prior  to testing; and subjects in the control group neither received vocabulary instruction nor read the passage before testing. Results showed that all three treatments were effective in teaching target vocabulary words. Significant gains were observed between the vocabulary pretest and posttest for the students receiving full and partial instruction. Findings also confirmed a strong relationship between prior knowledge and reading comprehension. Students with a high level of prior knowledge did well on the passage comprehension test regardless of treatment. While there were no significant treatment differences between subjects on the passage comprehension test, when they were grouped by prior knowledge level, there was a tendency for comprehension scores of students in the mapping and feature  analysis groups to be higher than scores of those who received traditional instruction.

The first chapter provides a theoretical context for teaching analytical reading in the context of writing. The second chapter recounts a teacher's work with a basic writing student whose inexperience with reading interfered with his writing, and describes the individualized reading course that balanced familiar and unfamiliar reading materials. The third chapter describes adapting a similar approach in a class of 22 freshman English students, focusing on a single book, and how the teacher's responses to  student journal entries concerning their reactions to the book helped the students develop both critical reading and critical writing abilities. The fourth chapter discusses how the same approach was adapted to a sophomore literature class, and how the students' writing about reading allowed the instructor to take part in their attempts to understand the assigned texts at every stage of their reading. The book concludes with a 16-item annotated bibliography of works exploring the psychological and pedagogical theory behind this approach. (HTH)",

        "description":"In a &quot;College English&quot; article, B. M. Kroll describes the educational and philosophical foundations of three perspectives on the teaching of writing: interventionism, maturationism, and interactionism. These three developmental perspectives offer a useful way of reviewing, evaluating, and classifying textbooks written for basic writers. The predominant philosophy of basic writing instruction is interventionism. Essentially, an interventionist sees the purpose of the teachers and textbook as being to intervene in the learning process in order to teach the conventions of acceptable form and usage. Thus, an interventionist course is teacher- and text-centered. Two interventionist textbooks are William Kerrigan's &quot;Writing to the Point: Six Basic Steps,&quot; and J. D. Gallo and H. W.  Rink's &quot;Shaping College Writing.&quot; The maturationist perspective assumes multiple realities, individual voices, and diverse forms. The maturationist composition course centers on exploring the mind of the writer rather than on prescriptive conventions. R. B. Donald and others'&quot;Writing Clear Paragraphs&quot; is a maturationist textbook, somewhat similar in format to the Gallo and Rink book. The interactionist approach attempts to balance text, writer, and reader in the active process of creating a particular message in an appropriate form for an identified audience. Examples of interactionist texts include &quot;Writing Without Teachers&quot; by P. Elbow and &quot;Writers Writing&quot; by Lil Brannon, Melinda Knight, and Vara Neverow-Turk. A 24-item annotated bibliography on Basic Writing rhetorics is appended.  (HTH)",

In addition, back issues reveal a sense of history--not only of English teaching, but of American education and society as well. (HOD)",

        "description":"Because technical writing is a subject that exists in two separate contexts (a combination of practical and liberal arts), teachers of the subject must legitimize their profession by appealing to different authorities. Those attempting to strengthen the connections with the industrial world do so by (1) showing that technical writing is needed, (2) studying the way it is practiced in the real world and making present practice definitive, (3) creating courses that simulate real-life writing, and (4) emphasizing the need for teachers to have practical experience in the profession. Other writers argue that teaching technical writing is more than mere training, that writing is more than a set of techniques. Their articles can be seen as pieces of rhetoric aimed at their colleagues in  the liberal arts tradition, focusing on such topics as the use of communication/rhetorical theory to evaluate present practice, the application of theory to the subject of technical writing, the definition of technical writing, and the argument that English teachers can and should teach technical writing. From a rhetorical perspective, these articles are performing a valuable service. Since their immediate audience is the community of technical writing teachers, they can be seen as epideictic discourse that reinforces the faithful and continues to shape the community's view of what the discipline is. Thirty-one references are listed. (HOD)",

        "description":"A four-year study by the Bay Area Writing Project was conducted to determine the writing competency of inner-city secondary school students on proficiency tests. To determine whether patterns among secondary students reflected developmental trends, the study also examined samples of student writing from grades 4 through 12, for the years 1978, 1980, and 1981. The study concluded that the essays at the four levels of writing competency contained four underlying speech events: (1) encoding, (2) conversations, (3) presentations, and (4) expositions. Based on the theory of underlying speech events, which provides a way of understanding the problems of students who are attempting to move from one competency level to another, the study suggested fluency, focus, and form as three  primary problems for students as they move from low to high competency levels. (Writing samples are included in the body of the report, and appendixes include an example of coded copy of student writing during a videotape session, rankings of anchor- or prototype papers by national sample, examples of coding sheets, samples of the anchor- or prototype papers, and a ten-page bibliography.)

An examination of the data revealed several areas of concern, among them that (1) the criteria used for evaluation vary widely and appear not always to relate clearly enough to current instructional practices to be of much value; (2) appropriate training for evaluators in using specific criteria is lacking; (3) the apparent duplication of effort at both state and local levels in evaluating instructional materials  raises questions about the efficiency and effectiveness of the process; (4) reviews at the state level do not appear to have much uniformity, and textbook commission members frequently do not do the actual reviewing but pass that task on to friends and colleagues; (5) the translation of evaluators' reviews of text materials into final votes for adoption remains unclear; (6) economic factors seem to be a major influence in states keeping state-wide adoption practices; and (7) no available evidence indicates the optimum time for the reviewing process.

        "description":"Those seeking or those who have obtained a communications degree often ask what they can do with their degree. Their quest for universal employment categories uniquely appropriate for communication majors is shaped by four beliefs: (1) content expertise is the primary asset the communication major brings to a potential employer; (2) communication graduates are broadly similar because of common educational experiences within the discipline; (3) clear, uniform employment categories and job descriptions exist across organizations; and (4) degree recipients in technical or business programs fare better than communication majors. However, each of these premises is fallacious. First, content mastery is not the sole asset of the communication graduate. The cognitive and speculative  issues explored in communication coursework defy such simplistic reduction. Communication examines the fundamental symbolic process that operates in all personal and professional life. So, too, common sense dictates that communication graduates are not broadly similar because of common educational experiences. Clearly, students will differ markedly in personality traits, economic objectives, motivational drives, geographical preferences, private values, and social needs. In addition, positions with similar titles are not always identical since job functions differ broadly from one organization to another. Finally, technical graduates do not make the transition from academe to the work force more easily than communication students. (HOD)",

The fourth section discusses objections to peer evaluation that frequently occur, and the fifth examines six important results of peer evaluation: (l) a  widening of horizons, (2) an introduction to the joys and dangers of generalizing, (3) the development of skill in avoiding hyperbolic and authoritarian assertions, (4) the reconciliation of the emotional with the rational, (5) the development of a sense of responsibility, and (6) an increased ability to assimilate information.

The first section of the paper examines the research role and experience of the participant-observer as one of being both near and distant from the social phenomenon being studied. The second section briefly reviews the theory of SYMLOG, which uses three orthogonal dimensions to describe the quality of the behavior of group members or the images suggested in the content of what they say: (1) Dominant vs. Submissive, (2) Friendly vs. Unfriendly, and (3) Instrumentally Controlled vs. Emotionally  Expressive. The third section examines the SYMLOG coding procedures, and the fourth describes a study in which the coding procedures were used to score a meeting and the results compared to field notes of that meeting, illustrating the use of SYMLOG as an interpretive foil.

The haves of the computer society will be those who know the capabilities and limits of the technology. The have nots will be those who fear to know, refuse to know, or do not have the ability to learn. A judicious application of interpersonal communication principles can help anyone deal with the computer revolution in a productive and beneficial manner. For example, the role of goals and values is central to effective interpersonal interactions. People must feel as well as think. The computer can only help with cognitive activities and should be considered a tool, nothing more. Beyond  extolling the virtues of a good course in interpersonal communication along with courses in computer and computer literacy, the speech communication professional needs to address at least three other issues of concern to the entire profession. Of paramount importance is a position on &quot;communicating&quot; with computers. Speech communication must lead the fight for greater accuracy of expression when describing computer activities as well as person/computer activities. Second, they must take the lead in stressing the importance of person-to-person contact in order to remain human. Finally, they must emphasize the fact that computers lack emotion and are incapable of replicating human feelings. (HOD)",

To test this finding, a study investigated the language used by participants in legal proceedings (judges, prosecuting attorneys, defense attorneys, and plaintiffs). It was hypothesized that the language of judges, who hold the most power in a courtroom, would contain the least number of women's language features, specifically &quot;politeness.&quot; Tape recordings from two California courtrooms were  transcribed and coded. The results supported the O'Barr and Atkins finding, but not the hypothesis. It is suggested that judges, regardless of their sex, use a great deal of politeness to redress the many face-threatening acts that they must perform. The findings indicate that future research on sex differences in language usage should move from the documentation of sex differences toward an examination of underlying social and situational factors.

Ferguson&quot; and &quot;Brown v. Board of Education.&quot; The analysis revealed that the Supreme Court in both decisions relied heavily on its image of social reality in deriving axioms representing the universal audience at a given historical moment. The concept of equality was the central term requiring definition. While the &quot;Plessy&quot; Court assumed the inferiority of blacks, the &quot;Brown&quot; Court assumed the equality of races. &quot;Plessy&quot; reflected an empirical definition of equality; if both races were treated the same, that was all the law could command. &quot;Brown&quot; reflected a less  tangible view of equality; physical equality of facilities was not enough. The remaking of the concept of equality in correspondence with the tenets of the universal audience of its day, was the hallmark of the &quot;Brown&quot; decision. Thus, from the perspective of universal audience, the &quot;Brown&quot; decision appealed to a universal audience of greater wisdom than that of &quot;Plessy.&quot; The analysis suggests that legal precedent and legislative history are less significant than the Court's image of reality in framing its opinions.

        "description":"Since American colleges and universities will need to hire about 500,000 faculty members in the next 25 years, it is important that speech communication graduate schools and current graduate students who will be in that labor pool think about the professional needs of small schools as potential employers of speech faculty. The academic background of an applicant is the foremost qualification to be considered in a hiring decision. Small colleges seek the best qualified people available, usually doctorates from quality graduate programs who have shown an inclination toward scholarship. The second requirement is a commitment to teaching. Small colleges can no longer afford to hire PhDs solely interested in research; the strongest selling point for these small colleges will continue  to be friendly, caring treatment of undergraduates by highly educated faculty members. One other criterion is collegiality--the ability to get along with peers. Ultimately, choosing a small school for a career must reflect an individual's desire to work at the undergraduate level, to prefer active participation in the classroom to research in depth, and to view communication less as a specific field of study to be pursued in depth, and more as a central set of theories and skills that need to be integrated into the total curriculum of an institution.

        "author":["Hensley, Carl Wayne"],
        "description":"As the United States entered the nineteenth century, it did so under the influence of the Second Great Awakening. This was the second wave of revivalism to sweep the nation, and it originated in the frontier as the Great Western Revival. One pertinent characteristic of the revival was its rhetoric, a rhetoric that was a prime expression of a native rhetorical theory born on the frontier. For the adherents of this frontier rhetoric, the primary criterion of success was its emotional effect on listeners. However, in the midst of frontier emotional rhetoric the Disciples of Christ came into existence. The Disciples of Christ originated as a movement dedicated to ushering in the postmillennial reign of Christ. This ultimate goal would be accomplished by evangelizing the nation and  then the world. The movement grew to sizeable strength and influence with a rhetoric that was quite the opposite of frontier emotional rhetoric. Under the bold leadership of Alexander Campbell, the Disciples of Christ formulated a unique approach to conversion and conversion rhetoric. Empiricism, common sense, and lessons from classical rhetoric shaped Campbell, and Campbell shaped the disciples. The distinctive form of rationalism that characterized the movement set Campbell and his cohorts apart from most of their emotional contemporaries, and it enabled them to attract the unconverted and build strong cohesion among the converted.

        "author":["Wiethoff, William E."],
        "description":"Traditional assumptions about oral and written discourse persist among various philosophers and critics. Careful examination of the context for traditional assumptions, however, suggests that current scholarship should pursue altered lines of inquiry. Peculiar influences on Renaissance standards of purpose, style, and theme illustrate the nature of the problem, especially the works of Pietro Bembo, a Renaissance humanist chancellor and religious administrator. First, his forensic priorities in the principles and practice of rhetoric focused critical attention on a limited setting and purpose of discourse. Second, although written communications were customarily designed for oral proclamation, Renaissance developments in dialectic stressed the written word and promoted practical  training in communicative skills outside rhetorical studies. Third, the reassessment of literary standards in response to emerging vernacular discourse stigmatized the spoken word as inherently less significant than the written word. Drawing on the Renaissance thought expounded by Pietro Bembo, scholars may avoid the frustration that all too frequently accompanies inquiry into oral and written discourse by disclaiming generic distinctions. Instead, scholars should examine practical differences in purpose rather than distinctions in theme, as well as the potential sequential relationship of writing and speech rather than isolated mechanics of style.

        "description":"Local area networks (LAN) are privately owned communication systems that connect multivendor devices at high speed. As microcomputers become more common in schools, user interest in sharing information, software, and peripherals will increase. A basic understanding of the operation of all LAN's can be gained by knowing four elements: media, topology, method of channel access, and bandwidth. LAN's used for instruction provide advantages not available from a single microcomputer. Cost savings result from students sharing public domain and network-licensed instructional software as well as peripherals. Teachers can unobstrusively monitor students' progress while programs make the assessment of student progress easier. Communications devices turn the microcomputer into a library.  Administrative applications of LAN's include recordkeeping, word processing, budgeting, scheduling, and inventory control. The use of any micrcomputer LAN available today is limited by (1) the need for network management, (2) the shortage of technical support, (3) the lack of multi-user database management system (DBMS) software, and (4) the legal barriers to the use of single-user software on LAN's. School administrators should begin a process of hands-on LAN familiarity and training, site visitations, and data communications needs assessment before purchasing a LAN. Twenty-eight references are included. (MLF)",

        "description":"Conditions in schools that reduce the effectiveness and perceived value of instructional supervision can be diagnosed and corrected through a cyclical process called &quot;organizational learning.&quot; Rather than merely responding to symptoms, this method focuses on eliminating or mitigating the underlying causes of &quot;organizational errors.&quot; Under this author's guidance, a residential school for the handicapped conducted an organizational learning activity as part of a 7-day inservice program on instructional supervision. Before instruction began, the participants (mostly senior administrators) each recorded in writing their thoughts on the school's supervisory process. These reports, as well as interviews with and observation of the participants, were used to prepare a hypothetical &quot;map&quot;  of organizational behavior. This &quot;map,&quot; which was unanimously approved by the group, identified a variety of problems in the school, some of which were &quot;open secrets&quot;: that is, they were well known among the school staff, yet undiscussable. Much concern focused on a cycle of destructive attitudes and behavior set off by the superintendent's autocratic management. As a result of this trend the school's problems had become a barely manageable series of crises. Openly discussing such issues is a step toward establishing a climate for effective supervision.

        "description":"A model is proposed for enhancing family choice in public education; unlike many previous voucher plans, it would build on current trends in educational administration. Following an introduction that reviews these trends--highlighting recent developments in California school finance--two central assumptions are stated: that regulated competition will provide better education than centralized bureaucracy; and that with the current reform movement focusing on the state level, local school boards are becoming obsolete intermediaries. The voucher plan presented in accord with these assumptions includes the following components: (1) weighted vouchers to encourage schools to accept disadvantaged students; (2) parent-elected, state-regulated boards of trustees to govern schools; (3)  standardized formats for school publicity; (4) voluntary purchasing from regional service centers; (5) participation open to all schools conforming to state regulations; (6) freedom (within constitutional limits) for each school to set academic and disciplinary standards; (7) transportation vouchers; (8) some public boarding schools; and (9) community option to retain a traditional school district. Brief observations on the model's implications for tax allocation, collective bargaining, and the teaching profession complete the paper. (MCG)",

Each participating district evaluated its own project using a standard evaluation design. Data were collected on both participating students and eligible but nonparticipating students. The projects generally proved successful, with significant growth seen in basic skill acquisition at the elementary level and in course credit acquisition at the secondary level. Students who participated were found to perform  more effectively in the subsequent school year than those who did not. Projects focusing on a limited number of basic skills objectives, actively involving students, and offering meaningful rewards for success were most effective in basic skills development. Projects strengthening self-concept and eagerness to learn were most effective in motivating students to continue learning after the projects. Per pupil costs were significantly lower than costs associated with having students repeat grades. An appendix provides individual project reports for each of the participating districts. (PGD)",

Literature is reviewed and integrated, and an assessment system for matching individual students with learning environments is presented. Section one reviews literature on the following topics: the relationship of teacher expectations to school effectiveness; the formation, communication, and effects of teachers' varying expectations; and the status of research on teachers' expectations and teachers' attitudes and perceptions concerning their students. Section two, drawing upon pertinent literature, advances the concept of behavioral ecology as a guide to analyzing the behavioral demands of the environment (including teacher  expectations) and their relationship to affected individuals. Section three reviews an environmental assessment system, Assessment for Integration into Mainstream Settings (AIMS), which was designed for use with handicapped students but which may be applicable to others. AIMS identifies behavioral demands of classrooms and assesses child behavior relative to these demands and thus the child's adjustment to teachers and peers. The system's four instruments and results from tests of the system are described. Following a brief conclusion are an 11-page bibliography, a sample AIMS instrument, and two tables of data. (MCG)",

Reading and math achievement test scores of Chapter 1 students in grades 2 to 8 were compared with those of a matched group of low-achieving non-Chapter 1 students over 2 years (1981-82 and 1982-83). Chapter 1 students were provided with 30-50 minutes per day of extra remedial instruction in reading or math, and the achievement of both groups was measured by the California Achievement Test (CAT). An Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) procedure was used to address aptitude-treatment interaction (ATI) questions of whether Chapter 1 treatment affected students differently, depending on their  pretreatment achievement standing. Results, portrayed by a series of graphs and tables, indicate that for nearly all grades, 23 out of 28 within-grade comparisons showed slope differences in the same direction. These results indicate that initially lower achievers benefit more from Chapter 1 treatment than initially higher achievers. Implications of these findings for Chapter 1 selection criteria are discussed. (TE)",

        "description":"This study tests the fit of competing models of strike causes on a sample of public school districts in New York. The models are based on differing assumptions. One is that strikes are the result of mistakes or imperfect information; the other is that strikes are rational choices made in expectation of gain. The differences in these views are significant, since they can lead to divergent theoretical and policy conclusions. The models were tested by comparing 14 striking districts to a sample of adjacent or closely similar ones that did not strike in the same year. The gross comparison of the contract changes in strike as opposed to nonstrike situations shows at least three clear patterns: (1) there are more contract changes in strike situations; (2) the overall distribution of  gains and losses varies from strike to nonstrike situations; and (3) the relationship of union to board gains varies considerably across different subjects. In terms of overall winners and losers, strike situations seem to favor the board to a modest degree, while nonstrike situations favor the union. The evidence overall tends to support a random or error view of strike effects, while the model of rational choice is weakly supported. References are included. (Author/TE)",

The approach is predicated on a novel conception of principals as life-long learners and on the proposition that principals themselves can and should assume major responsibility for all aspects of their professional development. Principals themselves were enlisted as the architects, designers, and engineers of the center. An advisory board consisting of 19 principals and 4 Harvard faculty determines the content and format of activities and plans each half-year's program around their common needs. The results of four years' experience with this approach are described. The premises of the program have been fully validated, in that  principals demonstrated rigor and inventiveness in planning programs for their colleagues, a constructive dialogue has developed between university and practitioners, and principals have chosen to participate voluntarily, and do so with enthusiasm. As a consequence, a new model for professional development is emerging: the center helps principals reflect on their work, clarify their thinking through articulation, and converse with others to better understand and hence improve their practice. The success of the program is evident in its rapid growth and the spawning of similar centers elsewhere. (TE)",

        "description":"This paper presents a historical overview of the use of action research in education and describes the basic assumptions and expectations that continue to characterize collaborative research projects today. Action research was initiated in the 1930's by Kurt Lewin and adapted by educators in the 1940's. Interest in action research declined between 1953 and 1957, and, during the 1960's and early 1970's, action research became inquiry done by practitioners with the help of a consultant. In the mid-1970's, new and expanded views of action research began to appear, leading to a revival that has continued into the 1980's. In recent studies, the method itself has become a topic for inquiry. Certain common expectations about the process of collaborative action research can be identified  and grouped into the following three categories: (1) participation in the research process--teacher and researcher roles; (2) staff (practitioner) development--expectations and outcomes; and (3) conditions or requirements necessary for successful collaborative action research. Some of the problems involved in carrying out a collaborative action research project are also discussed. A 38-item reference list is provided. (DCS)",

This document is an evaluation report on the convening process used in 1983-84 to help the State of Mississippi implement its educational reform legislation. An NIE staff member observed the meetings and conducted interviews with the participants. Whereas some sessions involved all the participants, most involved two working groups focusing on school accreditation and teacher certification issues. Results indicate that almost all participants in both  groups agreed that the convening process was better than other alternatives such as the serial use of individual consultants or library research. The process was most useful for the school accreditation group, which adhered most closely to the initial convening process model. The conceptual knowledge gained by Mississippi participants during the convening process, and reflected in the consultants' reports, was incorporated into the implementation plans developed by both working groups.

The 13 states reported management improvements that focused on reduced time and effort in the preparation of applications and reports, changed or standardized administrative procedures, improved planning and budgeting, and better use of staff. The absence of uniform and consistent data at the state level precluded  measurement of state administrative costs. In 1984 Congress added new data collection provisions to five of the seven block grants, and the 1984 Single Audit Act created uniform audit requirements for federal assistance to state and local governments.

The project, which was divided into three subcomponents, utilized univerisity-based training as well as field-based training. In Subcomponent I, personnel new to the field of education of young, handicapped children were enrolled in an eight-course sequence with a two-credit practicum for student teaching with preferential placement in the collaboratives. Successful completion of the program resulted in the Master of Education degree and the Massachusetts teaching certificate, &quot;Teacher of Young (3-7 years) Children with Special Needs.&quot; Twenty teachers were trained under the full or  partial auspices of Project CoNECT. For Subcomponent II, liaisons with four educational collaboratives provided ongoing, professional and paraprofessional, multidisciplinary consultation addressing educational programming and staff training needs. Among training competencies addressed were: assessment and remediation in a developmental framework; curricular modifications for young, severely handicapped children; classroom and behavior management strategies; and consultation and communication skills for collegial and parent-staff teamwork. In Subcomponent III, a summer institute, &quot;Medical and Rehabilitative Aspects of Childhood Disorders,&quot; was held. Serving to update the multidisciplinary professional and paraprofessional staff of the collaboratives in this project and the program's  Master's degree candidates, the Institute addressed current efforts in diagnosis, medical treatment, and rehabilitation techniques with severely and multiply handicapped children. The management by objectives approach guided the implementation and evaluation activities of Project CoNECT. The summary evaluation, based upon the analysis of process and product data, demonstrated the Project's effectiveness. Additional findings led to recommendations to provide for consultation to administrators and provide processes by which valuable information can be exchanged efficiently among collaboratives.

Chapter 2 outlines the program goal approach and sets forth three major goals (and their related objectives): (1) a systematic process of screening, evaluation and reevaluation is used that maximizes identification opportunities for all students, K-12; (2) the scope and sequence of the gifted program at each grade level should provide defined differentiation that goes beyond the course of study intended for the majority of students in that school system at that grade level; and (3) the school system should demonstrate its commitment to  gifted education by providing for program growth and development. Chapter 3 proceeds with evaluation questions derived from each of the goal areas and program objectives. Chapters 4-7 outline the evaluation methodology with separate treatment of the following stages (1) establishing a selection sample, (2) collecting data, (3) analyzing data and reporting results, and (4) developing a management plan. Appended materials include sample instruments (student record review, gifted parent survey, administrator surveys, and gifted student surveys). (CL)",

Students were 60 learning disabled fifth and sixth graders with reading difficulties. A mini-computer collected observational data reflecting student-teacher interaction (discussion) following the reading of a narrative story. Techniques taught to the students focused on oral discussion. Written comprehension tests were administered before and after the workshops as well as 1 month after. Results indicated significant differences between workshop teachers and control group; workshop teachers asked significantly higher level questions. Students responded with higher level answers. There was no difference  between the two groups in their performance on written comprehension tests, suggesting the difficulties LD students have transferring oral skills to written tasks.

A clinical case study approach was used to analyze student characteristics from individual program folders, and policy and practice were examined. The appropriateness of the data, expertise of the professionals, and the role of the languages of the bilingual and limited English proficient (LEP) students were examined. Findings revealed that: the linguistic characteristics of Hispanics, bilingual, and LEP students were evaluated with the same instrumentation used for native English speakers; a minimal role was ascribed to the native language in the evaluation process; English speech and language production and poor academic performance along with teacher referral were  the most significant variables determining special education placement; and professionals' data analysis demonstrated limited professional abilities and knowledge related to special linguistic and culturally different populations. Recommendations are offered for professionals, including greater emphasis in teacher preparation programs on working with linguistically/culturally different students; additional training for diagnosticians; and increased focus on identifying best practices for referral, assessment, diagnosis, placement, and intervention of bilingual and LEP students.

A competency-based curriculum in Adapted Physical Education (I CAN) was used for both IEP development and resultant precision teaching. At the end of the quarter, IEPs were evaluated by the faculty teaching the associative courses. IEP composite evaluation data was based on a 215 point scale in seven areas. Development of IEPs were directed toward six basic goals areas of adapted physical education from I CAN which included: (1) locomotor skills, (2) object control, (3) body awareness, (4) body control, (5) fitness and growth, and (6) posture. There was a  total of over 140 individual performance objectives for the six goal areas from which students could develop and implement IEP's. Each performance objective had been task analyzed into skill levels and focal points for precision teaching at the four skill levels. Results indicated that university students from various educational majors can, in fact, develop and implement appropriate IEPs for all ages and types of handicapped children. However, accomplishment of such is dependent upon a highly structured practicum experience in which students are given the opportunity to submit rough drafts and receive constructive input prior to the final IEP.

Three chapters in section II address interactions in integrated settings, with separate attention to providing opportunities for interaction, assessing those opportunities, and promoting interactions. Section III concerns ways to educate nonhandicapped students about individual differences and includes discussion of the rationale, assessment procedures, and a model for educating nonhandicapped students. Section IV consists of two author contributed papers on  training social and other skill areas in severely handicapped students to facilitate their interaction. A final section provides three papers on additional information useful to classroom teachers in promoting the positive integration of students both in the classroom and the community. (CL)",

        "description":"The study attempted to further clarify the relationship between speed and memory span by directly examining whether slower identification of item information is the source of span difficulties in learning disabled (LD) children. Forty-eight sixth grade boys participated in the study, 24 LD and 24 non-LD. The method involved pretesting each subject to obtain mean naming latencies for each of 8 classes of stimuli. The experimental procedure then presented each S with two memory span tasks: one using stimuli that had produced comparable group naming latencies, and the other with a stimulus class that had produced significant group differences in naming speed. The results indicated that span performance varied directly with naming speed. Results were discussed within the working  memory framework of A. Baddeley and G. Hitch (1974), and it was concluded that a causal relationship exists between item identification speed and memory span performance. (Author/CL)",

In study 1, 39 fourth to sixth grade learning and behaviorally handicapped students tutored regular class first graders in reading. In study 2, 17 intellectually handicapped students tutored regular class peers in sign language. Comparing tutors' performance with that of other handicapped students in appropriate comparison groups, results showed that tutors scored higher on reading achievement (study 1) and experienced more social acceptance (study 2) than students who did not tutor. While measures of general self-esteem were similar for both tutors and nontutors, tutors in study 1 scored higher on specific subscales assessing their perception of ability in reading/spelling  and general academic ability. Results suggested that handicapped students would make more academic and personal/social progress if they were to spend some regularly scheduled time tutoring other students from the regular classroom.

Detailed descriptions are provided of two main experiments in which learning disabled and intellectually handicapped students tutored students from the regular classroom in sign language and reading. Both parents and teachers were overwhelmingly positive, citing the dramatic increase in reading ability by both tutees and tutors and the increase in feelings of self-worth among handicapped tutors. Two other experiments that featured learning disabled and behaviorally disordered students as peer and cross-age tutors are briefly discussed. Findings on individual progress charts and pre-post test gains indicated that handicapped students can  be quite potent as tutors of other handicapped students. Findings of all four studies indicated that both tutors and tutees experience growth in the topic tutored, that socially isolated handicapped students often experienced increased social acceptance as a result of tutoring nonhandicapped peers, and that parents, teachers and tutees perceived reverse-role tutoring as an effective intervention strategy in special education. Extensive appendixes include interview guides, rating scales and checklists, forms, and a literature review. (CL)",

        "description":"A program in which Spanish-speaking first grade children were encouraged to write stories about subjects of interest to them, using microcomputers and composing a personal storybook, has the advantages of using little-used computers, providing a link between oral and written language, encouraging creativity in students often perceived as learning disabled, and providing a product for students to be proud of. The example used is the creation of the little collection of children's writings called \"Michael Jackson y Otros Cuentos\" (i.e., Michael Jackson and other stories). The children were familiarized with the computers and a standard word processing program and were asked to compose a story about a favorite or interesting subject. The stories were printed out and copies given to  each child for editing in class. The edited versions were then copied, made into books, and illustrated by the students. Two undergraduate student teachers provided enthusiasm, bilingual skills, lack of fear of computers, and creativity. Alternative computer-based class activities included question-and-answer communication between visitors and students, copying from storybooks, and playwriting. As the students progressed, their skill needs changed, and the teacher/facilitator role also changed. Results after three months included improved student self-concept as learners, more active participation in and initiation of learning, and improved attitudes toward writing. The children also began to read for meaning and ask questions about language, developing a sense of text and audience.  (MSE)",

        "description":"A study of learner modality in second language learning conducted at a small, private liberal arts university had as subjects 20 freshmen in a second-semester Spanish course. The students' modality strength (visual, auditory, kinesthetic, or mixed) was correlated with Scholastic Aptitude Test measures, grades, and gender. The findings support previous research studies showing that modalities become integrated as students mature, and also suggest a possible role played by memory strategies, especially chunking, when modalities are measured by the Swassing-Barbe Modality Index (SBMI) among college-age subjects. It is suggested that: (1) teachers consider use of the SBMI for diagnostic purposes when students have difficulty learning, and (2) the mismatch between the teacher's  preferred mode of presentation and the students' preferred mode of learning be lessened by reteaching in a different mode and by varying the mode used from day to day.

First, a theoretical framework for bilingual language acquisition is outlined, looking at the nature of communication, aspects of communicative competence (grammatical, sociolinguistic, discourse, and strategic) in the context of bilingualism, and language environment. Relationships between first and second language acquisition processes are then examined. A section focusing on simultaneous bilingualism in very young children looks at research on input  characteristics and effects, language attitudes, two stages of language system development (single and differentiated), aspects of communicative competence, and the awareness of two languages. A section on sequential bilingualism in preschool children outlines research on developmental stages and aspects of communicative competence. A section on sequential bilingualism in school-age children reviews research on language environment and second language proficiency in school contexts. A bibliography is included. (MSE)",

Language dominance varied considerably, depending on whether linguistic or communicative tests were used, with linguistic measures increasing Spanish dominance and communicative tests favoring English dominance. Field independence was found strongly related to all measures except Spanish linguistic competence, with the latter having an expected negative relationship to  length of United States residence. Self-concept was strongly related to language tests and academic achievement. English language proficiency, achievement, self-concept, and field independence increased with length of U.S. residence and seemed related to acculturation. English linguistic and communicative competence tests related strongly to global English competence evaluation and quantitative measures of language quality in speech samples. Both communicative and linguistic competence measures are recommended for making educational decisions, as well as research on the relationship of motivation types to achievement and special characteristics of students who adapt well to the U.S. (MSE)",

Results showed a significant positive relationship between phoneme production and reading achievement for some groups of third and fifth-graders, as well as for Anglo first-graders. The difficulty pattern varied across the ethnolinguistic groups, but the greatest pronunciation difficulty for the language-minority children was with the phonemes  acquired last by first-language English speakers.

        "description":"A group of studies of children's understanding of narratives, the degree to which knowledge available in the child's first language is used in understanding second-language input, and the relationship between knowledge use in two languages as children become bilingual and acquire age-appropriate literacy skills are discussed. The subjects were bilingual children in kindergarten through fifth grade with either English or Spanish as a first language. Their reading and listening comprehension of selected Aesop's fables was measured by means of story recall, \"why,\" and moral-of-the-story questions. The results indicated that knowledge used to guide story comprehension in a first language is also used to guide it in the second language, contingent on mastery of basic auditory or  orthographic coding skills in the second language. This finding reinforces the instructional practice of using the primary language as the language of instruction while English is introduced as a second language. In addition, while there may be some skills that require direct instruction, on which students may be expected to differ as a function of classroom lesson plans, these seem to be transitory, not persisting for more than one grade. The data also indicate that narrative comprehension skills as assessed in these studies are no different for students learning in either one language or two during elementary school. (MSE)",

Original plays were used for a number  of purposes: as motivation to continue learning, to encourage the children's creativity, to develop expressive speech, to encourage the students' self-confidence, to develop talents, and to promote parent involvement.

The data consisted of student scores on two attitude inventories, one measuring semantic differential on twenty pairs of bipolar adjectives and the other the Bogardus Social Distance Scale measuring the degree of actual and desired social contact with persons from twenty nations or provinces. The instruments were administered just before final  examinations. The results support previous research indicating that ethnic and social attitudes may include a tendency for a person to act in a way corresponding to his or her cognitive and affective combinations, and that the &quot;occidental-good, non-occidental-bad&quot; distinction continues to influence American students. Generally, the results suggest that culturally conditioned perceptions of reality stubbornly persist even after language study. French teachers should adopt techniques relating real attitudes, behaviors, and experiences to Francophones, and students must learn to tolerate ambiguities and differences. (MSE)",

An introductory chapter outlines fundamental assumptions about the loci and intentionality of second-language learning, and the second chapter describes the research design. Chapter three examines the contexts of second language acquisition in terms of language use and learning behaviors. The fourth chapter, on the central importance of lesson value and lesson confidence, looks at past research, the competence-incompetence paradox examined through interviews with teachers, and the interaction influences of lesson value and lesson confidence. The fifth chapter focuses on strategies of  learning and non-learning in the classroom as a measure of the interactive influences of lesson value and lesson confidence. Chapter six examines the relationship between learning strategies and language attitudes, and chapter seven discusses engaging language learning opportunities in the classroom through the interplay of language orientations and learning strategies. A summary chapter and a list of references are included, and appended materials include the quantitative instruments for children used in the study, the learning strategies Q-sort, and the teacher and principal interviews.

        "description":"A comparison of the salient characteristics of Canadian and United States bilingual education programs suggests various settings where it would be desirable to introduce children to schooling in their home language. These settings include: (1) the various ethnic communities in the United States, (2) multilingual developing countries, (3) parts of Canada where groups of non-English-speaking residents have congregated and where the home language is one of lower ascribed social or economic status, (4) places where there does not exist uniformly high pressure within the home and community to encourage literacy and language maintenance, and (5) places where many teachers in the educational system are unaware of or insensitive to the values and traditions of the minority-group pupils.  The schooling should take the form of a carefully developed language arts program integrated into a general curriculum in which content material is also taught in the native language. This will sustain and nurture children's linguistic and cognitive development while teaching the second language and gradually introducing the content materials in the second language, without abandoning the language arts or content material taught in the native language. Immersion in the target language is not recommended, although in some social settings where the home language is highly valued, parents and peer groups actively encourage literacy and native language maintenance, and the children's success is encouraged, schooling can begin in the second language.

The videotape technologies examined were bidirectional or interactive television and videotape. The variations of computer technology examined were determined by the configuration of the computing equipment. The study found that technology can have a significant positive effect on limited-English-proficient (LEP) students. In the case of video, the effect was concentrated in two areas: bidirectional television was found to make scarce resources available to geographically dispersed students, and videotape brought the outside world into the classroom while giving the teacher a  versatile tool. Computers were found to have the potential for permitting students to learn at their own speed in a highly motivating and non-threatening environment. It is suggested that to maximize the computer's potential, administrators and teachers need training structured for computer application to educational problems. The major impediment to the use of video technology in schools was found to be cost; impediments to the use of computer technology were the lack of instructionally and technologically sound software and lack of training in computer use and planning.

An early survey revealed that teachers desired training to improve the transition process for students moving from native language to English-language instruction, and the study focused on developing techniques for this purpose. A comparison of native-language, English-as-a-second-language, and standard English programs suggested that the transition process is made more difficult by discontinuities in teaching strategies and language skill sequences in and across all  program types, and that more careful coordination of instructional chains and sequences across programs would improve both transitioning and interprogram communication. Because of the study's functional-collaborative structure, increased coordination and communication was an immediate result of the research, and this research strategy is recommended for future research efforts in education.

        "description":"This study looked at preschool and first-grade children's ability to draw script-based and text inferences in comprehension of stories they heard. In two experiments, children were asked to recall brief stories and answer two inference questions: one script inference question requiring them to fill in information about the event that was not specifically stated in the story, and a text inference question requiring them to infer relationships between story propositions that could not be inferred on the basis of event knowledge alone. In one experiment the text inference question required a propositional inference on the basis of two premise statements in the story, and in the other experiment the text inference question required an invited inference based on children's real world  knowledge. Results suggested that children aged 4 to 6 years are better able to draw inferences based on schematically organized event knowledge than inferences requiring the construction of relationships between propositions not already represented in a schema. Results suggest that text inference questions are inherently more difficult than script-based inference questions and that invited inference questions are easier for children in this age group to answer than propositional inference questions. It is concluded that development of inferential processing in oral text comprehension is characterized as a progression from automatic use of a familiar schema to more purposeful deductive reasoning.

Court decisions suggest that religious programs advocating a particular religion or religion in general, when sponsored by a student government, union, or other official entity, should be avoided. However, it is legal to sponsor programs that examine values and in which religious lifestyles are  compared and contrasted, as long as the religious lifestyles portrayed are only representative and not encouraged. Also, forced participation in religious exercises at private universities may constitute a denial of freedom of exercise. As long as universities treat student groups equally regarding meeting space and support, they are in compliance with court rulings. Part two of the article focuses on demands placed on the student union by religious groups and the union's responses. Issues that unions may face include: student demands to support a boycott (e.g., lettuce and grape boycotts), and the nature and degree of proselytizing and evangelizing that religious groups can engage in when using the student union. In considering the educative role of student activities and college union  departments, active partnerships may be formed with the chaplain, campus ministry, and local clergy in developing ways to present basic infomation about religion, and tactics and dangers associated with aggressive cults and sects. Referral networks for counseling on religious issues and advisory groups to deal with religious concepts may also be formed cooperatively. It is suggested that while the college union is not engaged in ministry, per se, it can offer the space and environment for discussions of sensitive human issues. (SW)",

Even though special events vary significantly in type and purpose, some questions should be answered in advance, with the participation of student groups, promoters, and student advisers. These concerns are: the purpose of the event; who will attend; crowd size; advertising for the event; start/end time; the site; the admission fee; crowd control provisions; rules, regulations, and local and state laws; the performer's record at other campuses; traffic and parking; and whether a report will be done on the event. While regular crowds that attend athletic games are  familiar with the campus setting, rules, and accommodations, persons visiting the campus for the first time may be unfamiliar with them and need special attention or assistance. It must be decided in advance whether marshals are to intervene in a crowd disturbance or should summon police/security. It is recommended that university safety officials be involved in pre-event meetings, since securing planning for special events will provide the basis for a legal defense in case of a tragedy.

Six instruments were administered to students during their freshman and senior years. Attention was directed to moral development, ego development, and conceptual level, as well as freeing interpersonal relationships, establishing identity, and developing purpose. Each of the three measures of cognitive development showed significant increases in the seniors' scores over their freshman scores. No consistent pattern of college experiences was found to be related to growth on the cognitive measures. For the interpersonal measures, scores showed students' developed increased tolerance and acceptance of differences among individuals and also increased their capacity for  mature and intimate relationships, along with growth in confidence and sexual identity. Study results indicate that participation in various types of extracurricular activities such as those provided by college unions is related to growth in certain psychosocial areas of development. Intervention strategies that deal with students' psychosocial needs and increased emphasis on the cultural, recreational, and social development in college union programming are recommended. (SW)",

The data are weighted to represent the population of freshmen. Extensive statistical data are reported separately for women and men, and for 37 institutional groupings, based on the school's enrollment size, degree of selectivity, control (public, private-nonsectarian, Roman Catholic, and Protestant), religious affiliation, and racial composition. The survey results revealed several continuing trends in student attitudes on political and social issues. Student values continue to show increasing materialism that is also reflected in preferences for careers in the professions, engineering,  and business. The data also show declining student participation in government aid programs. High school grade inflation declined, and further evidence was found of the growing role of computers in education. Included are: a narrative summary of the results, information on the research methodology, the 1984 Student Information Form, a specification of region categories and the coding scheme, a list of participating institutions, and a sample freshman survey report provided to a participating institution.

Factors accounting for the enrollment decline of this group include entry into the labor force of a larger number of black high school graduates and an increase in the number of black students going to colleges outside of New Jersey. In addition, the number of black undergraduates enrolled through the Educational Opportunity Fund (EOF) program has declined. The data show that 418 fewer black full-time, first-time freshmen enrolled in New Jersey colleges in 1983 than in 1980, while there were 406 more high school graduates in 1983 than in 1980. About 75 percent of black freshmen annually are recent high school graduates from New Jersey. Options chosen by high  school graduates other than college include attending nondegree-granting institutions, entering government service and the civilian labor force, and other activities, including homemaking. Attention is also directed to: the impact of out-migration, the recruitment power of colleges, and the contribution of the EOF programs.

The sponsor, the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, focused on building more effective communication and working relationships between the university chief executive officer and school superintendents. University and school chief executives of five cities met to identify common issues and problems and to develop an action agenda to reduce transition problems of urban high school graduates as they enter college or the workforce. The university and school officials in the participating cities convened a joint task force of senior staff from both institutions to review current collaborative programs and  to plan for joint activity. Private foundations supported the effort. Among the factors associated with improved collaboration were both commitment and support of the chief executive officers and designation of institutional staff resources for the collaboration. In addition to discussing the expansion of the program in 1984, brief descriptions are provided of initial collaborative activities in Detroit, Milwaukee, Cincinnati, Boston, Birmingham, Kansas City, and Oakland.

Ten suggestions are offered to help colleges evaluate current linkages with industry, unmet local or regional needs, and school educational and personnel policies. A conceptual model of academic/industrial cooperation shows the economic goals and development strategies that relate to each type of linkage, as well as the extent of interaction that characterizes specific cooperative arrangements. Fifteen pages of references conclude the document. (SW)",

Many strategies to influence the distribution of physicians and other health professionals are directed to recruitment, selection, and training of students. Other strategies concern fiscal incentives and community recruitment of practitioners who are already trained. The policies of special recruitment and preferential admissions have been used to locate rural students, minority applicants, and women who desire to work in underserved areas or specialties, including rural and inner-city areas and such specialties as family practice, psychiatry, and geriatrics, as well as public service programs. Other  strategies that might be coordinated by states include: offering students loans or work-study contracts that are forgiven for service in needed areas, but that require severe penalties for defaults; providing strong academic instruction and clinical and residency training in needed specialties/settings; offering role models and counseling for practice in needed settings; involving communities in practitioner recruitment and aid; assuring reasonable income for work in need areas; and changing regulations and laws, such as licensure laws.

A special target group was the freshman student. Instruction covered cognitive and motivational theory and reasons why learning strategies work. Students practiced the learning strategies and were made aware of the possibility of choosing a strategy, rather than studying in the same way in every situation. The course involved two lectures a week and a laboratory that allowed: practice, discussion of lectures and text material, and teamwork in the development and evaluation of a learning strategy. Student evaluation included self-report measures administered at the beginning and end of the semester, grade  point average in subsequent courses, and student comments in the year following the course. In addition to substantial success in students' self-reported study habits, modest success in student achievement in later semesters was found. Improvement was found on measures of learning strategies, anxiety, and need for cognition. An attribute-treatment interaction revealed that students high in anxiety were particularly helped by the course. (SW)",

The general approach is to briefly review cognitive research, especially that which concerns common pitfalls in thinking. Students are introduced to strategies to guide thinking, as well as to situations that illustrate the usefulness of different strategies. Practice in using the strategies is also provided. Short writing assignments are incorporated, since writing skills and thinking skills  seem to be linked. In addition to subjective techniques for assessing thinking-skills courses, the following objective techniques are discussed: final examinations, performance in other courses, intelligence or critical-thinking tests, and Piagetian tasks.

        "description":"The roles of urban community colleges, state universities, and state government in promoting the attainment of bachelor's degrees among urban community college students were investigated in the following urban settings: Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Miami, Newark, Philadelphia, Phoenix, St. Louis, and Tampa-St. Petersburg. In each city, the community colleges serving the highest proportions of minorities and the public universities to which a majority of their students transferred were assessed. Surveys of students who transferred from community colleges to adjacent public universities were undertaken, along with visits to state agencies. It was found that the urban community colleges enrolled large numbers of minority students who were underrepresented in other segments of the  postsecondary system, and many of these students were severely underprepared for college. Strategies selected by the community colleges included providing a supportive environment, emphasizing vocational education, and reducing the rigor of academic work. It is concluded that leadership in improving the transfer process and improved communication between university and community college faculty are needed. The use of common course numbers and standardized course descriptions is recommended, along with exit competency testing at the community college. (SW)",

The programs are the result of searches made by the staff of the National Commission on Excellence in Education, although neither the staff nor the Commission has validated these programs. Responses to the Commission's searches were voluntary. The programs are divided into six parts: (1) academic time: calendars of institutions and individuals; (2) retention and academic work; (3) the uses of instructional technology; (4) language: expanding personal space; (5) joint ventures of colleges and employers/worker education; and (6) assessment: the bottom line. Academic time was  approached in two ways: as a resource and as an alterable variable in the teaching/learning process that affects student achievement. Most of the profiles in this section address different temporal frameworks within which adults seek education. The section on language focuses on writing, but also addresses reading, listening, and speaking skills, as well as some foreign language programs. The section on assessment covers both student evaluation and the use of assessment information to improve performance measurements. Included is an index listing each institution (as presented in both Volume I and Volume II) with addresses. A letter from the American Council on Education is appended. It explains the categories chosen by the National Commission on Excellence in Education for the  identification of notable academic programs. Lists of these categories and of the items to be covered in determining notable programs are presented as an attachment to the letter. (SW)",

A review of the history covers the Statute of Anne (1710) and English common law through the various Copyright Acts of the United States government. A discussion of computer software and programs examines the issue of whether copyright law is more applicable to computer programs than protection by patent law or protection through the trade secret law. The concept of fair use--an exception to the rule that copyright enjoins one person from making copies of the works of another--is also explained. Several cases are cited to demonstrate the continuity of purpose of copyright  law, including Data Cash Systems, Inc., versus J.S. & A. Group, Inc.

Three indices were used to assess program viewership: a personal  telephone survey, computer phone survey, and a school-based survey. Results indicated that students were viewing the classes; the parent activity packets were successful in providing parents with useful learning activities; and the procedures for disseminating the packets should be reviewed. The computer Phon-a-thon messages were not successful, with about 75% of the parents indicating that they had not received the messages. (LMM)",

An opening statement by Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, the text of comments and materials submitted by R.E. Turner of the Turner Broadcasting System, Stephen R. Effros of the Community Antenna Television Association, and Shane O'Neil of RKO General, Inc., are included. In his opening statement, DeConcini states the purpose of the subcommittee on Patents, Copyrights and Trademarks as exploring with the members how best to protect intellectual property in this era of expanding technology. Noting that cable television will be one of the technologies with the greatest impact, he briefly  describes the situation as follows: The Free Market Copyright Royalty Act of 1983 was introduced to bring equity in the relationship between copyright holders and one group of users of copyright materials, i.e., national cable broadcast networks. S. 1270 is designed to provide a free market alternative to an artificial government-imposed relationship between parties and imposed decision-makers at the CRT. Originally created to serve as an effective and fair referree in a legally and economically complex area, the CRT was charged by Congress in 1976 to adjust the royalty rate set by statute for the retransmission of distant non-network television programs under a compulsory license if certain rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission were changed. The focus of this  document is a reconsideration of the anticompetitive effects of the CRT decison and the statute--S. 1270--upon which it is based. (THC)",

First, introductory comments look at current needs and expectations from work and life, changing demands of the labor market and future employment skill needs, and expectations for an increase in the demand for workers with a middle range of skills. The next section looks at the job skills that will be required of the technician of the future, followed by a brief summary of the educational issues that have emerged from recent reports  calling for change and reform at all levels. In response to these demands, the next section advocates the development of the 2 + 2 Tech Prep/Associate Degree program to provide access to a mid-level range of career choices. A review of existing models of high school/college partnerships is followed by a list of assumptions upon which the degree program would be based, a description of how the program would operate, and the ways in which the program could address current concerns about education. Finally, a Tech-Prep Fact Sheet, sample help wanted ads of the future, and charts showing sample articulated programs are presented. (LAL)",

After highlighting the mission of the VHS in promoting the socialization of its constituents, the paper contrasts the VHS and community college in terms of enrollment, admission, costs, programs, facilities, governance, organization, and finance. Emphasis is placed on the &quot;open access&quot; provided by the VHS, its low student costs (i.e., an average of $8.00 per class), its provision of special interest courses, the existence of a degree comparable to the associate degree, and the provision of funding for the VHS by federal, state, and local governments. Next, similarities and differences in the overall social objectives of the VHS and community college are considered. It is pointed  out that the American community college is committed to providing a flexible, community-based educational program responsive to the needs of local business/industry and the college's individual constituents, while responding to national priorities and issues. In contrast, the VHS, although operating in s aimilar arena, is portrayed as having leadership objectives that are less tangible, but more social, defined in terms of societal and cultural goals. Finally, the centrality of the goal of socialization to the community college's leadership objectives is stressed, and the recognition and promotion of the socialization objective of American community colleges is urged.

Next, &quot;Current Perspectives,&quot; by James Gollattscheck, looks at the strengths and weaknesses of the associate degree within higher education, and considers ways of ensuring its transfer to four-year institutions. &quot;A Path to Excellence: The Review and Revision of Degree Requirements at the College of DuPage,&quot; by Paul J.

Next, historical events influencing the establishment of the community college mission are highlighted, including the 1944 GI Bill of Rights, the 1947 President's Commission on Higher Education for American Democracy, and the postwar leadership of  Jesse P. Bogue. Next, the boom years of the community colleges are discussed in terms of the rise of statewide systems and state support in the 1960's and 1970's; the advent of the open door philosophy; student aid legislation; changes in leadership and mission; and new services and clientele. The final chapter analyzes the current status of the community college, focusing on changing patterns of governance, the role of the Association of Community College Trustees, the Presidents Academy, political influences, the evolving mission, enrollment trends, faculty characteristics, the development of a body of literature on community colleges, the role of the ERIC Clearinghouse for Junior Colleges, the influence of Dale Parnell on the two-year college field, and future concerns.

Following introductory remarks and general thoughts about the report's strengths, changes in mission and clientele associated with the growth of community colleges are enumerated, followed by a discussion of the problems currently confronted by these institutions. The next sections offer recommendations for establishing excellence in community colleges, focusing on three conditions: (1) increasing student involvement by, for example, expanding the services for and contact with general studies and vocational-technical students,  increasing contact between teachers and students, improving guidance and advisement, eliminating student isolation and passivity, and involving part-time and commuter students; (2) realizing high expectations by, for example, specifying the knowledge and skills required for graduation, establishing collaborative partnerships with feeder schools and senior institutions, developing liberal arts requirements for students in different programs, and ensuring that remedial students perform well in subsequent courses; and (3) improving assessment and feedback by, for example, selecting assessment instruments to match knowledge and skills addressed and stated program objectives, training faculty to use assessment as a teaching tool, and using student evaluations of programs and the learning  environment as a basis for educational improvement.

        "description":"Project Follow Through has not yet been properly evaluated by researchers guided by appropriate assumptions. Tests used in the basic Follow Through evaluation had no clear relationship to most Follow Through programs. Still, conclusions of the evaluation have been presented with certainty and lead to the judgment that Follow Through does not work. Suggesting otherwise is the fact that, at some Follow Through sites, between 10 and 13 percent of the children have scored above the 50th percentile on the Metropolitan Achievement Test. This fact should be examined in detail through comparisons of high- and low-performing programs. There is much to recommend such a comparison. Certainly, it is not difficult to find educational data that reveal long-lasting, positive outcomes of good  teaching for students thought to have limited potential for achievement. Along with a focus on child outcomes, future Follow Through evaluations should focus on teacher behavior and the way treatments, or models, are implemented. It will be absolutely necessary to insure that measurement instruments employed are appropriate to the task. The methodology for making precise comparisons among educational treatments presently exists. Contrary to generally held views of experts, Follow Through has not been a failure; Follow Through children have not failed to respond to good teaching. When educators become clear about the goals of education and commit themselves and their resources fully to good teaching, academic success for children will be assured. The alternative is a dangerous academic  rationalization and legitimization of the status quo. (RH)",

A total of 444 children were tested and only the data from children who could correctly recognize one or more, but less than 26, letters were analyzed. Children were grouped according to the number of letters known (e.g., 1-5, 6-10, etc.). An analysis of the data revealed that &quot;x&quot; and &quot;o&quot; were correctly identified most often, regardless of whether they were presented in upper or lower case. Examination of the data for patterns across children provided a basis for excluding several possible explanations for the order of alphabet letter name acquisition.

The assistant secretary for HHS discussed current programs and stated that more research was necessary to find out the causes of the discrepancy between Black and White  mortality rates. Questions to him focused on planned merging of existing programs into block grants and subsequent loss of funds, the possibilities for increasing the accessibility of health services and nutrition programs, coordinating research efforts with the Public Health Service, and problems in receiving information from his agency. Representatives from the Children's Defense Fund, the Food Research and Action Center, Public Advocates, Inc., and Satellite Clinic, Harlem Hospital also testified.

Each set of guidelines takes account of knowledge, understanding, and skills and includes related strategies for preservice and inservice training. The personal framework, the practical framework, and the  conceptual framework are identified as three essential components of the ideal teacher training program. Assumptions essential to guideline and strategy development are discussed, and definitions of terms are provided. Guidelines and strategies are designed to be used in a range of teacher training situations but are not seen as a prescriptive plan. Rather, they can be used as a framework for planning courses, modules, seminars, or workshops on parent involvement as well as for developing training materials.

This pilot study attempted to discover key indicators of day care center quality other than those measured on the CDPE and also to find out about the relationships between these quality indicators and child development. Ten day care centers were assessed using the CDPE and two other measures, the Early Childhood Environmental Rating Scale (ECERS) and the Caregiver Observation Form and Scale. Results indicated that nonprofit centers had higher scores on the two measures of quality than profit centers. However, children who attended profit centers had higher socioeconomic status and higher scores for  cognitive, language, and social development. After a certain level of state compliance, program quality scores were found to fall as state compliance scores rose. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis to determine the predictors of child development revealed only one small effect for program quality. Ten items from the ECERS were found to be good predictors of overall program quality. It was concluded that compliance with state regulations is not an indicator of program quality, and that a comprehensive, state-wide study of day care quality should obtain separate samples of profit and nonprofit centers, should include lower and middle class children from each center, and should explore funding as a factor in day care quality.

Licensing mandates a basic level of quality because it is the floor below which it is not legal to operate. Licensing is selective in that it usually follows children who are placed by public agencies or children whose care is paid for by public agencies. Licensing also increases following tragedies and scandals that receive public  attention. Strong arguments exist for administering licensing at the state level, but state level licensing means that there is variation in standards from state to state. Licensing for child placing agencies has been one of the least effective areas. In all kinds of licensing, multiple forms of protection are needed, i.e., credentialing of individuals, program accreditation, and parent involvement (especially in day care). Licensing, like any form of regulation, may interfere with the rights of persons who wish to carry out a certain enterprise, but society has a legitimate interest in protecting the welfare and rights of children.

        "description":"An investigation was made of the effects of age and sex on preschool children's discrimination of intensity in musical contexts. Subjects included 92 children ranging in age from 37 to 70 months. A total of 47 females and 45 males participated in the study. To determine preschoolers' loudness discrimination abilities, a new test was designed: The Loudness Discrimination Test (LDT). This instrument utilized a 12-note melody based on a Jamaican folk song rather than pure tones or white noise. The LDT presented the stimulus melody at four intensity levels in discrimination comparisons (50 db, 60 db, 70 db, and 80 db corresponding to the musical dynamics of p, mf, f, and ff). To provide a comparison of the span of the dynamic range, two additional dynamic levels (55 db and 75 db)  were included on the test tape. Whereas no significant interactions between age and sex factors were found, significant differences associated with age were found across all age groups, with younger age groups scoring lower than older age groups. Progressive, significant differences across age were noted for both loud-soft and soft-loud stimulus presentation orders. Improvement in scores occurred across all three age groups for the loud-soft presentation order. With regard to type of judgment required of subjects, judgments of &quot;louder&quot; produced higher mean scores within all age groups than did judgments of &quot;softer.&quot; Age also was found to be a significant factor in the analysis of data concerning single and varied task types.

        "author":["Dail, Paula W."],
        "description":"An investigation was undertaken in an effort to further understand the role of young, traditional dual-parent families. A total of 249 parents were asked to complete the Iowa Parent Behavior Inventory. Responses were categorized into parent involvement, limit setting, responsivity, reasoned guidance, free expression (mothers only), and intimacy. Responses were further divided according to styles of childrearing; these included authoritarian, authoritative, or permissive patterns of parental behavior. Results indicated that correlations between sex of parent and style of childrearing was highest in those categories representing more nurturant behavior (responsivity, intimacy, and reasoned guidance). Mothers scored higher than fathers in these areas. A very low correlation between  sex of parent and parental behavior existed for the category representing more instrumental behaviors (limit setting). Two policy implications that can be extrapolated from the data concern child care and family stress levels. It is argued that child care and more equitable sharing of housework will be prominent issues for the 1980's and 1990's. Changes within the family would require assistance in the form of policies to support fathers' efforts to work at jobs allowing time for house and child care. A third policy implication concerns the development of social programs which would relieve the economic strain that often forces mothers into employment. (AS)",

It is suggested that future research endeavors take the following parental/familial variables into account: family size and structure, socioeconomic status, educational level of parent(s), parental attitudes toward working mothers and children in self-care, and parental expectations of children in self-care. The study of factors related to the child should include examination of the child's ordinal position in the family; self-care versus sibling-care; child's age when first left alone; hours left alone per day; child's sense of self; child care  arrangements during vacations, holidays, and illness; child's attitudes towards the parents' job; child's attitude toward self-care, and child's health, including nutritional status, illnesses, school absenteeism, and injuries. The paper ends with a discussion of the role of physicians and teachers in becoming aware of what their patients/students do after school, on holidays, during vacations, and while ill. (AS)",

        "description":"The literature on how parent gender influences responses to children has grown enormously in the past decade; mothers and fathers have been found to differ on many dimensions and to be similar on just as many. Conflicting evidence also exists on how a child's gender affects parenting style. This paper reports some important gender differences in the way women and men respond to their children and discusses mediation of these effects by parent personality and other variables. The Family Changes Project, a study of post-separation families, allowed analysis of several aspects of these questions. Children in mother-custody families reported that their fathers often gave them no reason for the divorce, while mothers more often gave an explanation. Videotaped observations of mothers  and children playing, made during the first post-separation year, revealed differences in children's responses by sex and age. Also, Type A mothers (impatient, achievement-striving, and aggressive) were found to be more directive with their sons, while Type B mothers were more directive with daughters. Results from the Pregnancy and Parenthood Project revealed parent gender differences in child caretaking, some influenced by the child's birth order and gender. It was concluded that the development of today's children will be influenced by the paradox of receiving direct messages that boys and girls are equal while being surrounded by evidence that their parents behave very differently in their family roles.

Results were expected to add to understanding of the sources of gender differences in adults' orientations to marriage and parenting. Retrospective data regarding adults' recall of their parents' behavior were available from the Family Relationships and the Pregnancy and Parenthood projects. In addition, from the Family Changes Project a great deal of data were available from a younger generation of 6- to 12-year-olds. The latter information concerned participating children's perceptions, feelings, and beliefs about both parents (who had recently separated). While  variables and data from each project were different, similar questions could be asked across the studies. Results indicated inconsistent child gender differences. However, there were differences in children's views of mothers versus fathers. In general, mothers were described as being warmer but also more authoritarian and controlling. Finally, there were also some differences in the ways children of different genders viewed their mothers and fathers, and some indications that the current generation of children is not as differentiated by their parents along gender lines as previous generations.

Ten subjects from each of the four age levels participated in the 4-year investigation, which lasted until the 2-year-olds reached 5 years of age. Children met individually with the investigator for 15 minutes at a time; each session involved three improvisational phases. During phase one, free exploration, each child was given a free opportunity to explore the xylophone. During phase two, guided exploration, the children's explorations were directed through two improvisational tasks: &quot;let's pretend&quot; (to evoke different emotions) and &quot;conversations.&quot; During phase three, exploratory improvisation, the child was asked to improvise a melody  while the investigator played a 24-measure bordun accompaniment. All sessions were recorded on cassette tape, and notes were written after each session. Results lent support to prior research indicating that characteristics of children's improvisations change in relation to chronological age. Improvisations were grouped into three stages. Stage one, motor energy, was characterized by plodding and accented durations. Stage two, experimentation, was characterized by the child's experimenting with many phrases and combinations. Stage three, formal properties, was characterized by repetition, larger formal structures, and decentered perception. Results were discussed in terms of implications for teaching practice. (CB)",

A total of 60 second graders were pretested for self-efficacy on four learning tasks: a paired-associate learning task, memory for unfamiliar vocabulary words, rote memory for a list of numbers, and simple subtraction problems. Subjects, shown each task for about 2 seconds, were asked to judge how sure they were that they could perform the task. Children were then given generalized memory-monitoring training and taught two strategies for memorizing word pairs in a paired-associate memory task. Ineffective word  repetition and effective sentence elaboration strategies were taught to each subject. In a post-training test trial, subjects were instructed to choose the best way to remember and were tested on a third list of noun pairs. After the testing trial, children were posttested for self-efficacy on the four learning tasks used in the pretest. Results indicated that 39 subjects chose the elaboration method for the final paired-associate learning task, while 21 resorted to the repetition method. The effective elaboration strategy improved self-efficacy not only for the paired-associate learning task but also for the similar vocabulary word memory task.

Data were gathered through questionnaires, follow-up telephone conversations and personal interviews. The data support a general stage theory conceptualization of innovativeness. For this sample, the stage sequence was further differentiated by a series of steps that characterized the degree of willingness individuals displayed regarding the adoption of microcomputers. Individuals varying in innovativeness with respect to microcomputers differed significantly in their self-efficacy and psychological attitudes about computers, as well as in their previous experience with and knowledge about the technology.

In this study, language delay at age 2 was investigated in 502 children who attended physicians. Language assessment is not routinely carried out at this age because current screening instruments must be administered by a physician or his staff. For this research a screening test was devised which does not need a professional to administer it. The Language Development Survey (LDS) required the parent to indicate whether the child produced word combinations and to check off, on a list of 250 words, all words produced spontaneously. The criteria for &quot;clear delay&quot; were fewer than 30  words and/or no word combinations at age 2. In the first year of the study, 351 children were surveyed in five different pediatric groups; 14 percent met the clear delay criteria. The range across groups was from 9 to 17 percent, with the highest prevalence in an urban hospital medical clinic. In the second year, 151 children were surveyed in the same hospital medical clinic; 16 percent met the criteria for clear delay. The rate of clear delay was higher in boys than in girls. Total vocabulary size was significantly associated with sex and socioeconomic status, with girls and children in the upper social classes having larger vocabularies. Preliminary attempts to collect validity data on the LDS suggest that it will be useful in future research. (Author/CB)",

During the period from January through May of 1983, 26 observational visits were made and 80 hours of child-to-child social behavior were recorded. Teachers, the school principal, the classroom aide, selected district staff, and parents were interviewed. Unobtrusive data (school and district reports, student records, and student- and teacher-produced artifacts) were also utilized. Spradley's Developmental Research Sequence Model was used to guide data collection and analysis procedures. Findings were reported in the form of an \"analytic  description.\" While dominating behavior was seen consistently in only a few children, almost all children used peer interactions to attempt to manipulate or control the actions of others. Ways to practice and respond to self-promotion and ways to put others down and defend against put-downs were noted. Contrary to the views of Piaget and Goffman, results indicated that children actively participate in the construction of social events, demonstrate an awareness that peer status is a product of social interaction, and use sophisticated interaction strategies to promote and protect their status.

        "description":"The first of two hearings on the topic of health care costs, their effects on the economy, and ways to curb costs was held in Washington, D.C. Testimony was heard from representatives of Chrysler Corporation, Ford Motor Company, American Farm Bureau Federation, Washington Business Group on Health, American Association of Retired Persons, American Hospital Association, American Medical Association, National Association for Home Care, and Health Insurance Association of America. Each panelist described the effects of rising health care costs on his or her organization or its members. Issues included shifting costs from one group to another while actual health care costs increase; prospective payment systems and hospital rate review commissions to curtail hospital costs; federal tax  reductions for health insurance premiums; the possibility of health care rationing; a possible national commission on health care costs; Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement for home care expenses; preferred provider organizations; and health maintenance organizations. The second hearing was held in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Testimony was heard from 23 individuals and organizations; four panels represented the perspectives of consumers, health care providers, funding sources, and organizations involved in future planning. While many of the issues addressed were the same as in the first hearing, new topics included rural hospital cooperatives, the revision of business insurance plans, and company-provided preventive health care for employees.

        "description":"A meta-analysis of findings from 31 separate studies showed that ability grouping has significant positive effects on the academic performance of elementary school children. The benefits of grouping tended to be small in the typical study of achievement --an increase from the 50th to the 58th percentile for the typical student in a grouped class. One subgroup of studies, however, produced especially clear effects. In this type of study, students of high ability, or \"gifted\" students, were put into special classes in which they received enriched instruction. Studies of this type usually reported significant results and usually reported effects on achievement that were moderate in size. Meta-analysis also showed that ability grouping had trivially small effects on the self-concepts  of elementary school pupils. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"A review of anthropological, psychological, and educational research pertaining to the quiet manner of American Indian students in classroom situations is presented. This phenomenon has been explained using the research perspectives of the learning style theory and interference theory. The learning style theory states that Indian children behave quietly in school because at home and in their community they learn primarily through nonverbal mechanisms, while the interference theory proposes Indian students are quiet because the classroom situation is not structured in a way that permits these students to display their existing verbal competence. A critical evaluation of samples of old and new testing literature is made in considering the influence of intelligence test results on  models created to explain the verbal-nonverbal behavior of Native Americans. A discussion of the differences and similarities between the learning style and interference perspectives follows. Based on the research, 15 teaching techniques are suggested to enhance verbal performance and classroom participation of American Indian children. The suggestions are organized into four general categories of general atmosphere and classroom organization, observational and experiential learning, verbal activities, and community relations. A curriculum vitae of the author concludes the paper. (ERB)",

The 9 preliminary reports generated discussion at 12 public hearings, plus written testimony, and served to catalog rural New York's strengths, define its problems, and establish goals to guide state policy development for the next two decades. This report begins with a discussion about working toward a &quot;new&quot; rural New York, provides comparisons of population change in rural/metropolitan New York counties and New York's rural population ranked with all state populations, and cites dominant themes and recurring issues found in the symposium proceedings and in  public commentary. Each of the nine discussion areas is then addressed, beginning with a list of symposium workshop participants in that area and followed by an introduction. Selected quotes from the symposium proceedings are displayed beside public commentary on the same topic. The nine areas include: human services and community life; health care; elementary, secondary, and higher education; business, economic development, and employment; agriculture; environment, land use, and natural resources; transportation; community facilities, housing, and community renewal; and government and management.

These assessments, prepared by five prominent minority gerontologists (John Red Horse, Sharon Y. Moriwaki, Sylvia Yuen Schwitters, Jean Keith Crawford, and Maurice Jackson), reflect what is known and not known about aging and older persons in each minority group; identify contradictions, trends, and gaps in data; address the most important aging human service issues; discuss possible implications of a proposed Human Service Model for older persons in each minority group; and provide recommendations for future research and human services policy. General observations are given on the history, trends, and gaps in  minority aging research. To provide perspective, the introduction and summary of the report \"Future Directions for Aging Policy: A Human Service Model\" (1980), by the Subcommittee on Human Services, Select Committee on Aging is provided. These reveal some of the basic assumptions that guide the Human Service Model. A cross-cultural summary with broader minority aging conclusions highlights the important shared perspectives and variations on themes. The monograph concludes with six state-of-the-art bibliographies which constitute a comprehensive collection of 1,600 references by subject area and ethnic focus. Although many of the materials can be located at major libraries, the majority are located in the archive collection at the University Center on Aging, San Diego State University.  (NQA)",

        "description":"Measures of school achievement over a 4 year lag period in Virginia's 95 school districts were used to investigate the relationship of investment in education to student achievement since variations in spending among counties would have four years to affect student achievement levels. Because educational output is a function of selected inputs--some of which can be modified by local decision makers--analysis of the production relationship of public education is of particular importance to rural communities faced with limited tax revenues. Analysis of the lagged 1974 cross-sectional achievement scores (grade four) and 1978 achievement scores (grade eight) showed that increasing local inputs for public education had a positive influence on educational output (standardized  achievement test scores). The population measure was also significant, providing some support for the hypothesis that the complex community interactions available in more populous areas have a positive influence on educational production. However, using the 1974 data as both input and output measures suggested completely different conclusions; per capita income became the primary determinant of educational achievement and increasing expenditures for education would not necessarily improve school performance. Policy decisions based on research that does not incorporate the proper lag structure could provide results far different from those intended by decision makers. (BRR)",

Many policies and programs affecting the elderly seem to be designed for urban areas and then applied to rural areas almost as an afterthought. A population density factor and a factor of distance from larger population centers must be included in a rural definition. Because the Federal Government has no rural strategy, the rural  elderly do not receive their just share of the support and assistance available. Transportation and the quality of available health care continue to be major problems of rural senior citizens. Federal housing programs do not adequately address needs of the rural elderly. Many States indicated that there is no clearer illustration of rural-urban inequities than across-the-board regulations for the nutrition services program. The Older Americans Act lacks adequate funding levels for rural planning and implementation. (BRR)",

The Migrant Student Record Transfer System (MSRTS) reports and statistical information from National Education Association profiles also were used. Data were collected from the 1981 fiscal year encompassing the 1980-1981 school year (September 1, 1980-December 31, 1981). Since in 1981 Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Hawaii did not receive grant awards, data from these states were not obtained. In addition, several states were in the first year of program operation  and state data collection systems were not formulated. A review of the activities indicated that extensive, supplementary educational services were rendered to migrant children via state migrant education programs. Data indicated that in fiscal 1981: 618,526 children and young adults were eligible for service and were registered on the MSRTS (duplicated count); 392,824 children were registered with a grade level designation; 225,752 migrant children were served in regular year reading programs in 38 states; 43,450 general health screenings were provided; and 35,307 migrant children received dental screenings.

Each student responded individually to six Piagetian tasks designed to measure their levels of function on the six variables. Students were then asked two questions. The first question (which tested understanding of the concept &quot;Plant growth is not affected by chemicals.&quot;) required correlational reasoning, combinatorial logic, separation and control of variables, and exclusion reasoning. Although the 22 students could have shown formal thought 88 times, only 24 such instances were found. The second question (which  tested understanding of the concept &quot;Heredity and environment interact in the expression of traits.&quot;) required combinatorial, probabilistic reasoning, proportional reasoning, and separation of variables. Again, although it was possible to demonstrate formal thought 88 times, only 25 instances were found. These and other findings indicate that using specific formal operations with which students demonstrate they can function, is not a good predictor of success on a question whose satisfactory response requires those specific formal operation. Thus, the exact formal operations necessary to understand a formal concept need not be isolated. (Author/JN)",

        "description":"This study investigated which classroom variables are related to changes in students' (N=409) conceptions of the nature of scientific knowledge. Eighteen high school biology teachers/classrooms were compared with respect to students' conceptual changes on six aspects of the nature of science (amoral, creative, tentative, testable, parsimonious, unified) as measured by the Nature of Scientific Knowledge Scale (NSKS). In addition, comparisons of overall student changes were performed. Thirty classroom variables significantly differentiated between the &quot;high&quot; (exhibiting the largest student change) and &quot;low&quot; (exhibiting minimal student change) of teachers/classrooms on at least five aspects of the nature of science. In general, teachers/classrooms in the &quot;high&quot; group were typified  by frequent, inquiry-oriented questioning, little emphasis on rote memory, decreased seat work, and increased emphasis on depth, breadth, and accuracy of subject matter. In addition, teachers in these classrooms were more pleasant, supportive, and had established better rapport than those of the &quot;low&quot; group. Finally, implicit references to the nature of science were more commonly found in the &quot;high&quot; group. Eleven additional variables were also found to differentiate between the &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; teacher/classrooms on less than three subscales of the NSKS. Implications of these and other results are noted. (Author/JN)",

        "description":"This pilot study tested the hypothesis that the logical thinking skills of middle-grades students are enhanced by teaching them computer programming using the BASIC programming language. A quasi-experimental design was used with 36 students randomly selected and assigned to one of two treatment groups: 18 students received no instruction in programming (the comparison group) and 18 students received programming instruction for 10 weeks (the experimental group). The Test of Logical Thinking (TOLT) was used as a pretest and posttest measure of logical thinking skills. The posttest scores were analyzed using analysis of covariance procedures with the pretest TOLT scores as the covariate. The results indicate no significant differences in level of logical thought at the .10 level of  significance (F=2.52; p=.12), suggesting that instruction in computer programming does not significantly enhance growth in logical thinking skills. However, this conclusion must be considered as tentative due to the small sample size and limited scope of the study. In addition, 10 weeks may be too short a time period to expect much growth in logical thinking skills. (Author/JN)",

A mainframe computer program that permits an Apple microcomputer user to select a particular 40 by 40 pixel sub-scene from a Landsat computer compatible tape and download it to Apple computer diskette via telephone was developed at the University of Oklahoma. Because this mainframe program was designed to operate with United States format Landsat computer tapes, the program was modified to run with Canadian Landsat tapes. In addition, since the U.S. program operates on an IBM mainframe, additional modification was necessary for the program to run on the University of Alberta's Amdahl mainframe. This report discusses the modifications made on both  the mainframe and Apple programs and provides information to operate the mainframe program using Canadian Landsat tapes. This information includes: (1) the steps necessary to run the Landsat Digital Image Analysis Program; (2) an example of a complete run; and (3) a list and purpose of files and routines written for the preprocessor package.

        "description":"The 1980 &quot;Global 2000 Report to the President&quot; was based on a study which attempted to project international trends in population, pollution, and resource availability through the year 2000. This document discusses: (1) the background of Global 2000; (2) Global 2000 and the media; (3) Global 2000's impact on the environmental movement (indicating that its most important, and probably least recognized impact has been in strengthening the environmental lobby in Washington); (4) Global 2000's impact within federal agencies (considering factors which have limited the report's direct influence on Reagan administration policy); (5) Global 2000's influence on legislation (including its influence on issues related to population policy, forestry, species extinction, and global foresight);  (6) Global 2000's international impact; (7) Global 2000's influence on education; and (8) the institutional impact of Global 2000. It is the position of this paper that Global 2000 is a severely flawed piece of science which nonetheless has had wide-ranging consequences. Among the most serious are that it has: helped inject limits to growth philosophy in schools; boosted funding for such foreign assistance activities as tropical deforestation, population control and species extinction; created the issue of global foresight, promoting a trend toward more futures work within federal agencies; stimulated creation of organizations determined to address the problem of shrinking world resources; and legitimized the arguments of environmental interests groups thus significantly increasing their  influence and constituency.

Three personality variables were used for the purpose of matching: Maslowian need level; locus of control; and cognitive style. This study used the ninth-grade physical science students (N=301) participating in the previous study to (1) examine differences in the cognitive and affective entry characteristics of students expressing different Maslowian needs and (2) to determine the effects of teaching a 3-week unit of instruction using a strategy designed to meet the locus of control and cognitive style needs of students whose physiological and safety needs had not been accommodated. Results show: significant differences in the cognitive and affective entry characteristics of students of  differing need levels; students differed in their attitudes toward science in general and their prior knowledge of physical science; and matching was not beneficial for students primarily concerned with fullfillment of low needs. In addition, differences in achievement (not attitude) were found to be dependent upon the extent of matching. These and other results are discussed in terms of the matching model of instruction and the desire to design instruction to accommodate the diversity of student needs in secondary school physical science courses.

        "description":"Economical, short forms of three measures were developed to facilitate science teachers' use of classroom climate assessments. The Classroom Environment Scale (CES) is a 24-item measure requiring a true or false response for each item. The My Class Inventory (MCI) is a 25-item measure requiring a yes or no response for each item. The Individualized Classroom Environment Questionnaire (ICEQ) is a 25-item measure requiring a Likert-type response for each item. When each instrument was administered to a large sample of science classes, results supported each scale's internal consistency reliability, discriminant validity, and ability to differentiate between the perceptions of students in different classrooms. Case studies involving use of the CES in a ninth-grade class and the MCI  with sixth-grade students are included. Steps followed in both studies included: assessment (actual and preferred forms were administered); feedback (teachers considered profiles of mean class scores and identified actual-preferred discrepancies); reflection/discussion (deciding which classroom dimensions to change); intervention (activities aimed at changing the dimensions); and reassessment (determining if changes had occurred). In the junior high study, improvements occurred for the two dimensions (and only the two dimensions) on which change had been attempted. The paper includes a 7-page reference list. The ICEQ, CES, and MCI short forms are appended. (Author/JN)",

        "description":"A sample of 217 students (from grades 4 to 8) who were enrolled in an elementary school science-oriented gifted and talented program were compared to 91 mainstreamed subjects in grades 7 through 10. Assessement instruments included: a battery of Piagetian measures designed to assess combinatorial reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, and the ability to isolate and control variables; the Propositional Logic Test; and a variation of the four-card hypothesis testing task. Results show that the gifted and talented sample was accelerated over the comparison group by two to three grade levels, suggesting that the former students are truly gifted in regard to very basic reasoning skills. The criteria for inclusions in gifted and talented programs vary from case to case, and are rarely  well defined. Standardized aptitude tests may be appropriate for an academically-oriented acceleration program, but are probably not for local pullout enrichment programs. A more general battery of reasoning tasks, such as those used in this study, should be included in the selection of students for such gifted and talented programs. (Author/JN)",

Data were collected from over 800 seventh-grade and over 1,400 tenth-grade students during a longitudinal, multi-dimensional study of the relationship between the variables of home, school, and self as related to attitudes toward and achievement in science. This population was examined by ability, grade, and time of school year. The two family-oriented subscales were targeted for examination as regressors to the dependent variable or attitude toward science. One of these, the family science subscale, included items to assess student perception of their family's science support. The other, called family general, consisted of items to assess student opinion of the quality  of their family life. The regression model developed the probability level which indicated the relationship of the family science variable to science attitude was highly significant (0.001 level). This was true for ability-group tracks at each grade level and over time for each grade level. The family general variable was found to be an important predictor of attitude toward science for general ability groups for both grade levels and over time for the tenth-grade but not for the seventh-grade. Implications for improving student attitudes are noted. (Author/JN)",

        "description":"This 10-day study compared the effects of alternative ways of using microcomputer simulations on the achievement and attitudes of sixth- and seventh-grade science students (N=173). Nine classes were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: (1) microcomputer simulations; (2) laboratory activities; (3) a combination of simulation and laboratory activities; and (4) conventional instruction. Topics covered during lessons included the process skills of observing, hypothesizing, testing, classifying, and recording data. Simulations were completed as a class with the teacher operating the microcomputer and simulation programs. Students worked in groups of two or three during laboratory activities. Simulations were presented prior to activities in the combination treatment. Results  show: that simulations, activities, and combination of these two instructional strategies results in higher achievement than conventional instruction; no achievement or attitude differences among groups receiving computer simulations, laboratory activities, or a combination of the two; and no attitude differences among the four groups. Other findings show: that students at the high and middle levels of logical reasoning ability out-achieved students at the low level of logical reasoning ability; no differences in attitudes among these three groups; and the effects of alternative instructional strategies to be consistent across levels of logical reasoning ability.

        "description":"Chemists have bemoaned for years their students' inability to solve problems in introductory chemistry courses. However, at least part of this inability must be attributed to the fact that chemists have historically tried to teach their students to solve problems by doing nothing more than working examples. In recent years, chemists have begun to realize the importance of general strategies or heuristics in problem-solving, and they have become particularly enthralled with the &quot;road map&quot; approach to problem-solving. There is abundant evidence, however, that students who understand this approach all too often still cannot solve &quot;simple&quot; stoichiometry problems. The hypothesis behind the research discussed in this paper is the assumption that there is a preliminary stage in  problem-solving which most chemists have neglected. During this preliminary stage, relevant information is disembedded and the problem is restructured. Until this stage is successfully completed, students cannot proceed on to the analytic stage in which the road map heuristic can be applied. Preliminary evidence supporting this hypothesis is presented which suggests that there is a linear correlation between students' ability to handle disembedding and cognitive restructuring tasks in the spatial domain and their ability to solve &quot;simple&quot; stoichiometry problems. Nine references are listed. (Author/JN)",

        "description":"This study investigated the role that spatial ability has in achievement in organic chemistry. Spatial ability was defined as containing two subfactors--spatial visualization and spatial orientation. Spatial visualization is the ability to mentally manipulate pictorially presented stimuli; involved in the processes of manipulation are the abilities of recognition, retention, and recall of a configuration in which there is movement along the internal parts. Spatial orientation is the ability to remain unconfused by changing orientations in which a configuration may be presented. Subjects were students in a course designed for nonscience majors, particularly for students in agriculture and health sciences. Findings show that students in the low spatial group scored significantly  lower than students in the high spatial group on the organic chemistry examinations. Similarities and differences between the work of the high and low spatial students were also examined. The high spatial students made more use of drawings than the low spatial students on questions that asked for drawings and also on questions that did not ask specifically for drawings. It was also found that students, regardless of spatial ability, who drew pictures, scored higher on the examinations. (JN)",

This model must consider the continuous nature of education and the creativity of the mind, which Bronowski divides into two modes: science and the arts. The scientific mode relies on the process of induction, including concept formation. By including scientific induction in the new model of education, students would take a more active role in their education by pursuing individual or group inquiries. The artistic mode explores alternatives and develops what  Bronowski calls sympathy. By including sympathy in the educational process, competition can be diminished and cooperation fostered. Teachers' and students' roles would change in this model and a more open process would result. (IS)",

They were also asked to complete a questionnaire that focused on social dilemmas in a technological environment. The dilemmas focused on the acceptability of copying someone else's program or altering passwords. Analysis of variance and regression techniques were used on the questionnaire data and these were compared to results of the observations. Results indicated distinct behavior patterns. Students had not considered the social implications of using another's information or data nor the right to privacy that might be invaded by the misuse of information technology. When their own privacy was infringed upon, participants  demanded harsh penalties. Most students engaged in group problem-solving strategies while solving technology related problems, thus circumventing traditional individualistic learning patterns. While working with information technology systems, student behavior patterns seemed directly related to previous experience with computer games and other popularized forms of information technology.

A total of 172 students in 7th and 8th grades participated in experimental and control groups. The programs varied in their intensity; students in the experimental group met for 40 minutes once a week for 15 weeks during the school day, while students in control groups met for 40 minutes once a week for 10 weeks. Results revealed that students in the more intensive program gained greater knowledge about reproductive physiology, contraception, and the consequences of teen pregnancy and parenthood, and became more familiar with various birth control methods. Changes in personal acceptance of premarital intercourse and perceived responsibility for  contraception were observed only in the most intensive program. The impact of school-based sex education programs is discussed and suggestions for improving such programs are provided. (Author/IS)",

Figures are based on the July 1, 1982, population estimates and race definitions and are projected using the cohort-component method with alternative assumptions for future fertility, mortality, and net immigration levels. The combination of all the assumptions portrays a future American population that will grow relatively slowly, if at all. The birth rate will change but little, while the death rate will increase. The population is likely to be much older and contain more minority members. The major portion of the report consists of detailed tables. (RM)",

Graphs are used throughout to identify changes from the 1970 census. Findings indicate that the rapid growth of the American population after World War II will probably not occur again; that the American population is shifting south and west, out of large cities, and to suburbs and the countryside; and that minority groups are growing faster than the population as a whole. Other changes include an aging population, more education, later age at marriage, more participation by women in the work force, a drop in the poverty rate,  especially for senior citizens, more home ownership, and a slight income rise when incomes were adjusted for inflation.

The students were divided into three groups according to IQ scores; students in each group were randomly assigned to receive a programmed lesson that had long, moderately long, or short instructional frames. Other than the length of the frames, the three lessons were identical. Immediately after the lessons were completed, the students were tested for comprehension of the material, which dealt with President Wilson's attempts to establish peace after World War I. Results indicated that certain students, e.g., those with low IQ scores, may benefit from programmed instruction, particularly if the  frame lengths are relatively short. (Author/IS)",

        "description":"The great variety of cultural and legal backgrounds of present-day immigrants to Chicago and the lack of adequate resources with which to fund programs has made assimilation a difficult challenge. Chicago schools are committed to provide bilingual programs to students with limited proficiency in English and 75 bilingual programs have been developed. Although plans call for citizenship instruction in students' native languages, there are no programs or materials available. Programs for adults usually focus on teaching enough English to meet basic needs. Learning about the American legal system is rarely emphasized, yet this is a crucial need because so many students, both young and older, come from societies with legal systems different from that of the United States. Some  programs, such as the Citizens Information Service, begun by the Illinois League of Women Voters, have tried to provide such information but more must be done. A possible way to improve citizenship education is by using concrete cases, such as the case of Walter Polovchak (the 12-year old who refused to return to Russia with his parents), to provide useful information about the American legal system. A format designed by the Constitutional Rights Foundation for use by teachers in bilingual programs is described. Appendixes contain a list of 18 major bilingual programs taught by language and a sampling of curriculum materials on United States history and citizenship. (IS)",

        "description":"The first volume of a two-volume report on the study of sex equity in classroom interaction presents findings of previous studies of classroom interaction, methods used in the study, observations of classroom interactions, possible causes of sex segregation, sex differences in classroom leadership, and intervention implementation effects. The final chapter presents a summary of results. The two-year study (1980-82) involved 38 fourth- and fifth-grade classrooms in two districts in California and Connecticut. A total of 356 boys and 359 girls served as target students during the first year and 132 boys and 139 girls served as target students during the second year. Over 8,500 student hours of observation were augmented by in-depth interviews with teachers who participated in the  study. In addition, an APPLE observation system was used as the study's major tool for observing and preserving classroom processes for analysis. Data from the study do not support the notion that classroom teachers play a major role in creating and maintaining inequities. Despite findings that boys are more disruptive (and thus receive more teacher attention), data suggest that teachers respond to the nature of the student behavior rather than to student gender. Findings concerning peer interaction showed that despite an overwhelmingly strong same-sex preference on the part of both girls and boys, students actually engaged in cross-sex interaction quite frequently and with no observable consistent differences from same-sex interaction.

Leming analyzes the research on a wide range of approaches to socio-moral or values education. In Chapter 5, Jane J. White discusses ethnographic research and the paradoxes and problems it raises for social education. Chapter 6, by  William B. Stanley, is a discussion of recent research and development in the foundations of social education. The chapter focuses on the wide variety of rationales developed, critiqued, and refined by mainstream social educators since 1976. In the final chapter, Jack L. Nelson and James P.

The study's purpose was to determine if the emphasis in the literature of the past decade on collaborative planning and needs assessments beyond a teacher survey appears to have influenced their receptivity to, or use of, these particular practices. It was hypothesized that the coordinators would express an interest in investigating additional collaborative planning efforts for the region, and would report a low present use but high effectiveness rating for competency-related needs assessment strategies. In general the survey responses confirmed these hypotheses, and indicated that the emphasis on  collaborative planning among educational organizations and on more diversified needs assessment approaches has yet to make a significant impact on teacher inservice planning practices.

        "description":"The current debate about merit pay and career ladders requires that educators, board members, and the general public examine more closely the assumptions that are made about schools and the teachers in them. In this monograph, the complex issues surrounding the question of merit pay and career ladders are addressed. Six common perceptions on the part of the public on the subject of teachers, teaching, and compensation are discussed. A brief history of merit pay and career ladders illustrates the political and administrative problems involved. It is suggested that in responding to such initiatives and before designing merit pay and career ladder programs, the political, economic, and cultural contexts of particular states or school systems must be considered. It is recommended  that any decision to implement a pay incentive program should be an informed choice that recognizes all pertinent local variables and clearly comprehends available options. (JD)",

Findings indicated: (1) states vary considerably in the types of screening policies and testing requirements for teacher education candidates; (2) many areas covered in the assessment of individual teachers are not focused on in teacher education programs; (3) remediation is encouraged by many state policies but funding is often  lacking; (4) states that have introduced new policies perceive them as strengthening teacher education programs; (5) passing rates for different ethnic groups show similar patterns in most states; (6) many states perceive their policies as affecting teacher supply; (7) data on individuals screened out of the profession by state policies suggest that shortages of certain types of teachers will continue to occur or be aggravated; and (8) current efforts are being directed toward enacting more or stricter standards.

While many of the studies reported findings that tended to favor clinical supervision over other supervision practices, these findings were generally not statistically significant.

In the study, a group of 20 student teachers classified as returning students or adult learners was compared to a matched group of 18 college-aged student teachers. Results reveal that the two groups had different types of expectations, concerns, anxieties, and commitments to teaching.

Trainees were experienced and successful teachers from other subject areas with established classroom management skills who had an aptitude and desire to learn and teach mathematics and science. Effective programs had close cooperation with local school districts, state education agencies, and institutions of higher education. Trainees were provided opportunities to practice teaching with a master teacher, beginning with short period of teaching relatively easy subject matter, and gradually  progressing to longer periods of teaching more complex content.

The 65 item RSLSI assesses children's preferred learning styles in nine areas: projects, simulations, drill and recitation, peer teaching, discussion, teaching games, independent study, programmed instruction, and lecture. Administered to 150 sophomore and junior educational psychology students, RSLSI data were analyzed for reliability and for relationship with the independent variables sex and self-reported grade point average (GPA). Results indicate overall patterns consistent with the 1983 study findings: (1) females prefer to engage in more independent, individual learning  activities and discussions than males; (2) high GPA students prefer lecture and peer teaching; and (3) low GPA students prefer lecture, teaching games, and peer teachings. Both high and low GPA students in the 1984 study showed a significant increase in preference for discussion and simulation over the 1983 population. Overall similarities support the utility of the RSLSI for assessing the learning preferences of college students. (BS)",

Data from GRE files for 9,375 examinees in 12 fields of study representing 437 undergraduate departments from 149 colleges and universities were standardized within each undergraduate department, and then pooled for analysis by field. There were differences by major field in average performance on the various item-type part  scores within each test. The reading comprehension subtest carried most of the predictive load in the GRE verbal measure. Item-type part scores on the other measures also exhibited differential patterns of relationships with the self-reported undergraduate grade point average. The findings suggest that the different item types within the respective broad ability measures may be tapping somewhat unique skills and abilities and that further exploration of their potential contribution is in order.

The studies involved: (1) formulating an operational definition of writing competence; (2) designing and pretesting writing assessment instruments; (3) identifying and controlling parameters influencing a writing assessment program; and (4) the scoring and interpretation of measurement outcomes. Data from 638 college applicants representing three foreign language groups plus a small sample of native English speakers were collected from four writing samples scored by several methods, Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores, and Graduate Record  Examination (GRE) General test scores. Correlational and factor analyses revealed these key findings: (1) holistic scores, discourse-level scores, and sentence-level scores were so closely related that holistic scores alone should be sufficient; (2) correlations among topics were as high across topic types as within topic types; (3) similar scoring by different types of raters suggest substantial agreement in the standards used; (4) writing sample and TOEFL scores were highly related but each also measured other aspects of English proficiency; and (5) relationship patterns between holistic writing sample scores and item type scores within GRE General Test sections were consistent with other GRE studies.

TOEFL is currently required by more than 2,500 colleges and universities in the United States and Canada to determine the English proficiency of applicants whose native language is not English. It is also required by various agencies and boards that accredit and license professionals trained abroad. While a few descriptive papers are included to provide historical background, the summarized papers are primarily research reports. Studies focussing on other instruments which provide data that relate performance on those instruments to TOEFL are also included. The summaries are indexed by nine major categories: (1) TOEFL's relationship to similar,  standardized objective English language proficiency tests; (2) TOEFL's relationship to other measures of English language proficiency; (3) TOEFL's relationship to tests of intelligence, academic aptitude, and achievement; (4) TOEFL's relationship to later academic performance; (5) simple relation of TOEFL to student characteristics; (6) complex relations involving student characteristics; (7) statistical analysis involving TOEFL; (8) miscellaneous research issues; and (9) general descriptive papers.

        "description":"Classical statistical methods and the small enrollments in graduate departments have constrained the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) Validity Study Service to providing only validities for single predictors. Estimates of the validity of two or more predictors, used jointly, are considered too unreliable because the corresponding prediction equations often possess implausible characteristics. This study investigates two statistical methods--empirical Bayes and cluster analysis--to determine their applicability to these validity problems. Data on 6,946 students from 190 participating departments were used. It is concluded that, by using the new class of empirical Bayes methods, it is possible to obtain, at the department level, useful and reliable estimates of the joint validity  of several predictors of academic performance. Further methodological refinement will allow the question of differential predictive validity to be addressed at the departmental level. The technical appendix describes the estimation problem following from the empirical Bayes model. (BS)",

This paper examines the impact of the evaluation process on the success of the program, emphasizing major factors that contributed to its success: (1) the evaluation was adequately and independently funded; (2) it was designed to be useful; (3) the evaluators monitored the program closely, including full participation at all levels; (4) evaluation results were thoroughly communicated to all participants; and (5) the  evaluation was technically sound. An evaluation, it is concluded, needs to be participatory and committed, working with program management over the entire life of a program from conception to replication in order to have an impact on the program's success.

        "description":"Futures research involves speculation about alternative developments based upon existing data and potential choices. Effective futures research requires creativity in scientific practice rather than an overemphasis on reason. In discussing the important role of intuition in futures research, characteristics of creative scientists are reviewed and two models for creative processes are presented (Mansfield and Busse, 1981, and Wallas, 1926). The stages in Wallas' model are discussed in terms of critical cognitive processes and relationships between creativity and hemispheric dominance in information processing. A generic framework for problem-solving is also detailed (D'Zurilla and Goldfried, 1971). Integrating contributions from these approaches, techniques for developing  intuition, and enhancing creativity are presented for each stage of the futures research process: (1) general orientation; (2) problem selection; (3) problem definition and formulation; (4) preparation and effort; (5) incubation and generation of hypotheses; (6) illumination; (7) decision-making; and (8) verification. Both active problem-exploration and passive self-exploration approaches to overcoming habitual reasoning methods are presented. Journal writing, attaining personal/professional synergy, applying general systems theory, relaxing or mediating, using art, analogizing, self-centering, and brainstorming, are some of the many techniques discussed to develop intuition and enhance creativity. In the final analysis the rational, systematic procedures of conventional science and the  intuitive, \"discontinuous,\" contributions of highly creative researchers complement each other. (BS)",

The identification of these factors and their hierarchical contribution to achievement is investigated in a model which includes three subsequent stages involving: (1) achievement of applicants, (2) achievement of all successes in higher education, and (3) achievement of successes in university education. The data on which this study is based are derived from a 10 percent random sample of high school students throughout Greece. Factors addressed include in-school achievement, national examination achievement, school and teacher characteristics,  personal characteristics, family characteristics, previous school achievement, and aspirations (curriculum track). Results show that achievement in high school is related more to previous school attainment and less to family social characteristics or personal characteristics while achievement in the national entrance examination is related primarily to curriculum track, previous attainment, followed by family social characteristics. Statistical tables reflecting multiple regression and correlation analyses on all factors are appended. (Author/EGS)",

The method focuses strongly on estimating the true variance of study correlations and effect size. This validity generalization procedure has been applied to over 500 research literatures in employment selection--each one representing a predictor-job performance combination. This procedure goes beyond the Glass methods of meta-analysis in providing methods for correcting both variances and means of correlations or effect sizes for the distorting effects of the artifacts of sampling error, measurement error, and range restriction. These meta-analysis methods have been successfully  applied to non-employment selection topics. Twenty-seven references are listed. (BS)",

The biasing influence of measurement method on achievement has been recognized. Campbell and Fiske (1959) suggested that a considerable proportion of the variation in test scores may be due to features of the form of test (method) used rather than the individual characteristics (traits) which the test is designed to measure. Using a sample of 15-16-year-old Irish school students, gender differences in achievement were examined for three school subjects (Irish, English, and Mathematics), assessed by two methods (multiple choice test, and written public examination). As has been found in other countries, males performed significantly better than females on multiple  choice tests, compared with performance on written examinations. An additional hypothesis that the gender difference would be largest for the languages and smallest for mathematics was not supported. This finding runs contrary to an explanation of this phenomenon in terms of greater verbal skills of females. Alternative explanations are proposed and educational policy implications are discussed.

A primary characteristic of this method of instruction is the feedback-corrective enrichment loop. This study was conducted to determine whether class time could be allocated for the principles of mastery learning within the fixed amount of available time without placing one group of students at a disadvantage while increasing the instruction for others. The teacher training program emphasized improving the ability to understand the principles of mastery learning and increasing the opportunities for learning effective classroom management strategies. The training activities incorporated staff development practices which would increase the likelihood that teachers would implement the  instructional strategies presented. Results of the study indicated that teachers who participated in the staff development program made greater use of the feedback-corrective enrichment loop in their classroom lessons. Teachers and students utilized available instruction time more purposefully. This study does not support Marshall Arlin's contention that group based mastery learning programs deprive the academically rich to provide corrective instruction for the academically poor. (DWH)",

This participatory model provided both an effective means of evaluation and a systematic framework for program change and improvement by faculty, residents and staff. (BS)",

The study methodology involved a two-part questionnaire being mailed to 122 composition teachers at three Oregon universities and two Oregon community colleges. The first section of the questionnaire, the attitude identification component, consisted of scales for measuring teacher attitude toward instruction in written composition, while the second section contained questions on training, experience, and demographics. Additionally, follow-up personal interviews were conducted with six  respondents. Results of a factor analysis pointed to a weakness in the scale items themselves--their tendency to limit attitude response to student-centered or content-centered priorities. However, the profile of the &quot;average&quot; part-time composition teacher emerged as female, under 40 years of age, having no Ph.D., having less than seven years teaching experience at the post-secondary level, and with graduate training in literature (not composition). If she had a teaching assistantship, it was very influential. It is concluded that prescriptive, content-centered orientation was evident among the part-time instructors and that further research should focus on the training of graduate teaching assistants and employment status.

Other findings showed that the judge knew the previous year's score of each publication evaluated, while statistical comparisons of the years 1980 through 1983 showed no significant differences when previous years' scores were either known or not known.

It would seem, then, that teachers of writing need to find ways to create situations in which written language serves purposes the students see as real and is supported by an authentic, pragmatic structure of intentions. One pedagogical approach might be a course with its own &quot;subject matter,&quot; in which written language is introduced in a functional way into the communal learning situation. Some of the characteristics for this situation in an introductory literature course might include the following: (1) assignments in which students report to the other students--via photocopied and distributed short exploratory writing  assignments--on segments or aspects of a common subject; (2) assignments in which students construct precis of articles or literary works for the use of the rest of the class who have not read those particular works; (3) situations in which spontaneous exploratory writing is circulated and responded to; (4) situations in which students respond in writing to comments on their work or their ideas by the instructor, and in which the instructor uses writing to respond in turn; and (5) situations in which the instructor does not merely describe what sort of rhetorical stances are possible or what organizational strategies might be useful in a specific situation, but actually models them by participating in the writing community--by performing the same tasks for the same purposes.

Forty-one college students were asked to complete a 25-item version of the Personal Report of Communication Apprehension (a self-report measure) and the Communication Competence Self-Report Questionnaire (a 38-item measure of behavioral ability). To derive a measure of communication competence, students were asked to complete the  Communication Competency Assessment Instrument. Results showed that all students did not perceive their behavior as others perceived them. Students seemed to have a somewhat accurate view of their ability to defend and express a point of view, but a somewhat inaccurate view of their introduction behaviors.

The communication responsiveness of each instructor was measured by the Conversation Self Report Inventory (CSRI), which taps three modes of responsiveness--mastery (an assertive mode), flexibility (a supportive/adaptive mode), and neutrality (a communication-avoidance mode). Discriminant analysis revealed a respectable relationship between grading style and communicative responsiveness of instructor.  It showed that neutral responsives exhibited more lenient grading patterns than other instructors, but that they became more severe in their grading toward the end of the course.

The final grades for 1,578 students in a basic communication course were used in discriminant analyses. The level (the mean of all grades given) and the spread (standard deviation of all grades given) were estimated for each of 17 instructors. The communication responsiveness of the instructors and students was measured by the Conversation Self Report Inventory. Instructors' judging habits and students' and instructors' communication responsiveness as well as the instructors' knowledge of the students' gender and college major were measured against the final course grades. The results indicated that a substantial portion of the grade was the result of the instructor's  differentiation between students. Both level and spread had a significant impact. The chances of getting an A rather than an F were enhanced if the instructor had a more lenient, low-spread grading style than if the instructor had a more severe, high-spread style. None of the variables associated with communication responsiveness of the instructor proved significant in the analysis. However, the communication responsiveness of the student had a pervasive influence on the final course grade received. The impact of stereotypic knowledge upon grades was striking. Females were much more likely to get a high grade in the course. Gender accounted for 15.8% of the variance in grades. Being a major in the colleges of engineering, agriculture, and home economics increased the chances of low course  grade. (HTH)",

Future research needs to test the specific effects of quality circles in various organizational contexts upon organizational functioning and the individual employee both to learn the degree to which they can be a successful intervention strategy, given the cultural differences from the country in which they originated, and to assess the conditions under which they operate most effectively.

An analysis of these issues suggests that researchers should adopt an integrative approach to theory development--one that recognizes the situational differences of various organizational interviewing contexts. Interviewing methodologies also need to be strengthened to enhance the generalizability of research findings, and greater attention needs to be given to communication variables in the interviewing process. Interviewing research in organizational contexts needs to be validated and qualified in view of various job classifications, and increased research efforts need to be made in the context of organizational forms of  interviewing other than the selection interview. In addition, future research should test and further validate coding schemes utilized in organizational contexts. The development and validation of prototypical scripts for organizational interviews through empirical investigation may also prove to be a rich source of communicative data.

At small colleges, faculty are hired as teachers, rather than as researchers. Because speech teachers at small colleges must be generalists, and because it is often difficult to replace departing faculty members, speech programs are often in danger of being cut. In terms of administration, channels are informal and contacts are personal for department chairs, a situation that has both advantages and disadvantages. Small colleges also demand a palpable loyalty, although such loyalty is very time consuming. However, teachers at small colleges tend to see themselves more as members of a unified faculty and less as members of  individual departments. While the elements of multiple roles and responsibilities, informal channels, loyalty, and emphasis on teaching may exist at larger institutions, their presence characterizes the small college. It is thus within this context that the small college department administrator must operate. (HTH)",

        "description":"The high attrition rate among North American expatriate executives has become a significant problem for firms doing business in foreign countries. A review of the literature reveals a number of factors contributing to attrition, including culture shock, family problems, managerial style and practice differences, insensitivity to host cultures, and an ignorance of the geography, history, and language of the host country. These problems are often compounded by the expatriate executive's need to carry out organizational goals and policies in the same way he or she had done in the home office. To reduce high attrition rates among expatriate executives, firms should improve their selection and screening processes, provide candidates for foreign jobs and their families with  comprehensive training, and provide them with techniques for coping with the stress of living and working in a foreign culture.

In a rapidly advancing technological society, the media communicator's task is twofold: first, to firmly grasp and conquer telecommunications technology, and, second, to redirect the role of the media from that of carriers of information to that of actual art forms themselves, capable of creating unique events, idiosyncratic only to the particular medium. The training of media communicators dictates that trainers estimate accurately and underline with precision the extent to which the main communication media have managed to replace old forms of information  dissemination with new global ones. Media communicators must also be better prepared for the challenges of future international relations, recognizing the significant role the mass media can play in breaking cross-cultural barriers. Background in the theories of television composition, understanding of semiotics as they relate to the communication media, media symbolism as expressed by the sights and sounds of pictures, and satellite communication are but a few areas of immediate concern to future communicators.

These include (1) direct government funding of educationally oriented broadcasts; (2) strengthened Federal Communication Commission rules mandating more educationally oriented television; (3) a national center for children and television; (4) tax incentives for research, development, and production of educational broadcasts; and (5) continuation of the status quo. Each of these policies was judged by several criteria, including efficiency in promoting education, the equity in distributing costs and benefits, and the degree to which each satisfies individual preferences. The resulting data, along with data gathered from existing research and  from a survey of 119 people involved with children and television, suggested that the present arrangement in broadcasting for preschool children is unsatisfactory and ineffective. However, alternatives to the status quo, including direct funding and tax credits and, to a lesser degree, a center for children and television, showed promise of effectively promoting educational benefits through television. Tax credits, rulemaking, and--to a lesser degree--the center and direct funding options appeared the most equitable of the options, while direct fundings and tax credits appeared best in satisfying preferences.

The first two chapters consider why school administrators perceive the need for negotiation rights. Chapter I incorporates literature on the changing role, status, and work ethos of educational administration. Chapter II discusses four approaches to affiliation that administrators may take: with community, top managers, teachers, or with one another in a union-like relationship. Chapter III surveys the process of public policy-making and its effects for school supervisors, focusing on the passage and implementation of California's Rodda Act. Chapter IV details the implementation of state labor laws by school districts and by state bodies in  California and Florida. Chapter V analyzes the metamorphosis of school administrator associations from clubs to unions in response to state policies and presents comparative data on administrator organizations in six districts. Chapter VI, which explores changes in the ideology and attitudes of school administrators as local bargaining develops, reports a survey revealing that union membership and collective bargaining among school middle administrators are strongly related to the level of agreement with top managerial opinions. Chapter VII speculates on future developments in unionization of school administrators and other public sector supervisors. (MJL)",

This digest, designed to help school administrators begin computerizing their offices, depicts tomorrow's computerized office, introduces computer applications in management, and outlines procedures for computerizing an office. A fictional principal in the first chapter uses his desktop computer--linked with others in a &quot;local area network&quot;--to communicate, to coordinate his staff, and to analyze information. Such networks can be developed with present technology. Accordingly, the second chapter explores the following computer applications: (1) database management systems, used to store and analyze a wide variety of records; (2) electronic spreadsheets, used to make  budget projections and analyze expenditures; (3) word processing; (4) graphics; (5) communications and networking, particularly local area networks; and (6) others, including registration and class scheduling, support service management, energy management, and nonadministrative but related tasks. The final chapter describes and recommends a process for putting these technologies to work, modeled after professional systems development practices. The discussion includes independent school-based computerization, consulting services, systems analysis (evaluating needs and planning to meet them), systems development (creating detailed specifications and selecting technology), and system implementation.

The Q.C. approach meets Maslow's theory of motivation by inviting individuals to self-actualization activities that challenge their creative and developmental potential. Those closest to the problem become personally committed to the effective implementation of the solution. The Q.C. approach can and has worked where that was the genuine desire of all involved. In higher education, the wide variation in administration across the country allows the potential for Q.C. management in some selected institutions. At  the public school level, Q.C. management has had successful results in the Special Education Department of the Muskegan, Michigan, school system. Eventually the Q.C. approach will be the wave of the future in administration. Attachments to the paper include a newspaper clipping, a list of elements essential to a successful Q.C. program, and a 47-item bibliography. (MLF)",

The study's procedures included analyses of shared organizational understandings as well as identification of the principal's influence on the school. Analyses of organizational characteristics revealed that channels for providing constructive criticism on instructional and professional matters were restricted and that the faculty felt a need for communicating with the principal on such matters. In evaluating leadership characteristics, the researchers found that the faculty shared the belief that the principal was nonsupportive and unduly influenced by external forces. Succession characteristics  exhibited by the faculty included the belief that the new principal would provide more instructional leadership and that the faculty had little input in the principal selection process. The findings in this case study substantiate previous research findings. The study identified beliefs about school administration that correspond to existing theories on administrative behavior.

Each paper is followed by references. The appendixes contain sampling and data collection procedures; profiles of the 16 school districts; and an analysis of claims about the use of evidence. (MLF)",

The documents represent a cross section of ages as well as types and severity of disabilities and include journal articles, books, monographs, and other papers. In content, the documents fall into three major categories: psycho-social aspects (roles and concerns of family members, family reactions and dynamics); intervention with family systems (including counseling/social services and family education); and intervention by family systems (including advocacy activities and skill training). Cited in an analytical synopsis are studies dealing with family stress, counseling processes and outcomes, and change agentry. Literature is also analyzed in terms of type of  research product (personal observation and data-based publications). The author concludes that there is a need for more rigorous empirical research and for research on families of older persons with disabilities. Twenty research questions are listed in areas including outcome factors of different approaches, siblings, and effective strategies.

The &quot;system&quot; at RICA-Cheltenham emphasizes the development of a network or community effect whereby certain important messages are emphasized through specific means of communication including a common language. The sense of community is emphasized through the development of family alliances and stability, the focus on self-esteem and the resulting respect for self and others, and the enhancement of growth,  development, independence, and responsibility. These latter emphases represent the treatment objectives at RICA-Cheltenham. (Author)",

It was necessary that the curriculum be based on as broad a source of information as possible. It had to be responsive to the unique characteristics of the mildly handicapped population and, finally, the method of presentation of the social skills content had to be maximally adaptable to settings where the students would learn to use the skills. The major problems faced in developing the Social Skills Curriculum were the selection and specification of target social skills, the identification of situations in which these skills were appropriate, and the integration of the skills and situations within an effective teaching methodology  that could be utilized in schools and other service-delivery settings. Efforts to solve these problems have resulted in a curriculum designed to offer a practical approach to teaching important skills in a neglected area. (Author/CL)",

Illustrations included in this discussion are examples of potential learnings to be developed through play and games in the middle school curriculum. Although extensive examples are drawn from an operating middle school program, these are to make the theoretical stance concrete rather than to feature a particular program. Thus definitive evaluative statements about the  results of the emphasis of play and games in this particular program are not made. In addition, data evaluating the program have not been collected to isolate particular aspects of the curricula. Impressionistic experiences, substantiated by outside observers of the program, indicate that the role of play and games in this curriculum are important determinants for student growth.

The project was designed to examine curricular modifications for deaf students entering the National Technical Institute for the Deaf and to examine career development (personal, social, and intellectual development) needs of postsecondary deaf students. Five statements were formulated regarding student characteristics associated with career development problems. The statements focused on the following areas: preconceptions of careers and majors, limited self knowledge, use of unsophisticated decision making processes, lack of coping skills, and an inadequate knowledge base regarding cultures. Fourteen topics which appeared to encompass the problem  areas and general statements were identified and papers were commissioned on each topic. An introductory paper offers a conceptual framework for the Foundations project, focusing on the interaction among the student, the teacher, and the curriculum. The remaining papers in the volume center on the development of the learner and the learner's processing of experiences and situations; they include: \"Theories and Models of Human Development: Their Implications for the Education of the Deaf\" (I.

Further, it is suggested that Foundations experiences be designed to incorporate the following features: a learner-centered curriculum, maintaining a degree of content and instructor orientation; a high degree of interaction with faculty and peers; a set of rigorous institutional expectations, explicity stated; a curriculum and support system planned to optimize a student's experiencing success provided that expectations are fulfilled; and efforts to enhance cognitive, affective and psychomotor development that begin at the concrete experiential level and move toward abstraction and generalization.

The first section addresses research on normally hearing students in classrooms with different motivational orientations. Advantages and disadvantages of classrooms with autonomous, competitive, cooperative, and intrinsic motivational orientations are identified. Problems facing hearing impaired students in each of the classroom types are noted. Low self-esteem, less developed senses of personal responsibility, and fear of rejection by peers in competitive situations are cited as potential reasons for the difficulties of hearing impaired students under the different orientations.  The need for developing techniques to help students establish positive but realistic expectations of themselves in autonomy-oriented settings is suggested. Practical approaches to helping hearing impaired students feel more comfortable in competition-oriented classrooms are discussed, such as establishing a minimum grade for the course. The lack of data on hearing impaired students in cooperation-oriented classrooms is also noted. (CL)",

A transfer classification scheme is proposed based on the notion that an individual's knowledge can be divided into two general categories: content and skills. In one section, research on content to content transfer (the impact of content knowledge learned in one situation on subsequent acquisition of new content knowledge) is reviewed. Traditional studies of transfer with word lists are briefly discussed, followed by a review of the research on the retention and transfer of meaningful verbal learning. Task, instructional, and learner  variables are also considered. Recommendations include using concrete instructional materials liberally supported by pictures and illustrations, and tailoring methods to fit the styles, aptitudes, and preferences of learners. The next section focuses on skills to skills transfer (transfer of learned skills from one situation to another), including an examination of research on cognitive and motor skills. Recommendations include presenting knowledge relevant to acquiring a new skill without an excess of distracting stimuli. The next section examines skills to content transfer (skills that subsequently facilitate the acquisition, retention, retrieval, and transfer of knowledge). Recommendations center on the importance of stressing learning strategy skills rather than rote memorization. A  final section discusses the educational implications of transfer-related research, specifically regarding instructional material development, teaching methods, and supplementary courses in learning and problem solving.

Nine of the concepts were neutral to the study's objectives, and the tenth was the concept of differential address for men and women. The scales used represented three universal components of affective meaning: evaluation, potency, and activity. It was found that on the evaluation scale, males and females agree that the four forms of address connote different degrees of goodness, with &quot;Ms.&quot; receiving the lowest ratings. Comparisons showed &quot;Ms.&quot; and &quot;Mr.&quot; were rated lower than &quot;Miss&quot; or &quot;Mrs.&quot; On the potency scale, males and females rated &quot;Mr.&quot; lowest in  potency, with &quot;Ms.&quot; not siginificantly higher. Males rated &quot;Mrs.&quot; significantly higher than the other three titles, while females rated &quot;Miss&quot; higher than the other three. On the activity measure, male and female subjects agreed that &quot;Mr.&quot; and &quot;Mrs.&quot; were lower in activity than &quot;Miss&quot; and &quot;Ms.&quot;, with the latter receiving the highest absolute rating and &quot;Mr.&quot; receiving the lowest. In sum, both males and females ascribed different affective meanings to the four forms of address on all three basic dimensions.

        "description":"An administrative policy adopted at the University of Washington providing an alternative to relying entirely on English language proficiency tests for determining foreign students' ability to succeed in an academic program is described. Issues from which this program evolved are discussed and the related literature is reviewed. The issues include English proficiency as a predictor of academic outcomes, institutional responsibilities in establishing foreign student policies, identifying proficiency levels, admission policy alternatives, and models for providing language services to foreign students once admitted. Following this, the University of Washington's model is outlined. This model sets a score of 500 on the Test of English as a Foreign Language as the minimum requirement  for admission contingent on further assessment and a score of 580 as the requirement for admission into a full-time English-medium curriculum for both undergraduate and graduate applicants. Students with the lower score are given provisional admission status pending additional work in English as a second language (ESL). Fees are assessed for ESL courses, which do not earn credits but do count toward full-time enrollment for visa status. The incorporation of ESL classes into the academic program is felt to be essential to program success, since it helps to meet the primary needs of all constituencies without excessive financial burden on students or institution, and to eliminate the isolation of traditional intensive language institutes. Most important, this approach is designed to allow  institutions to admit students based on their proven academic abilities, so that subsequent decisions can be based soundly on prior academic performance.

        "description":"An investigation of the stability and replicability of aptitude, attitude, and achievement factors in second language acquisition used 31 groups of over 100 second language students each from five grade levels (7-11) and seven Canadian geographic areas of varying degrees of bilinguality. The groups were administered a series of related measures that were factor analyzed within groups. Although the number and type of variables used in the groups varied slightly, these primary factors emerged: integrative motive, French achievement, self-perception of French competence, language aptitude, evaluation of the learning situation, evaluation of the French teacher, evaluation of the French course, multilingualism, and semantic differential. Another set of analyses involved the factor  analysis of the original factor matrices for a more rigorous test of comparability across samples. This demonstrated that the factors of evaluation of the learning situation, self-perception of French competence, French achievement, and integrative motive were consistent across all grade levels within monolingual regions and across lower grade levels within bilingual regions. Similar consistency was demonstrated only for the factors of evaluation of the learning situation and integrative motive within bilingual regions for the upper level students. Interpretations for these results are offered. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"Undergraduate students of English for Science and Technology (EST) are confronted, in their English textbooks, with a variety of rhetorical forms intended to convey a variety of information, including specialized rhetorics of definition, classification, and argumentation. The rhetorical form of EST argumentation is the organization of written presentations in EST textbooks intending to support or invalidate hypotheses and theories through presentation of experimental evidence. The ability to understand literal meanings of sentences contained in these arguments is insufficient for the full comprehension of the arguments because of their frequently elliptical character. In addition, the skills needed to interpret elliptical EST arguments are very close to those required to  interpret ordinary conversational English, and teaching reading comprehension of EST arguments amounts to teaching communicative competence in EST.

In this natural variation study, approximately 350 children taught by 200 teachers in 20 schools in six districts are tracked through the primary years. Their reading development and mastery of formal language is examined in detail each year through multiple measures, as is their instruction, through an array of indices, including classroom observations made throughout each academic year. In addition, information about the teachers' background, training, and language skills is gathered. Data available at this stage of the  study, from a subsample of 63 children in grades 1-3, on several of the components of an interactive reading assessment in English and Spanish are analyzed and presented in detail, including charts of average growth and performance profiles for a variety of the measures used.

For a small but representative sample consisting of eight school districts serving minority language students, the study provides answers to five questions: (1) What services are being delivered? (2) How do the patterns of service vary by district type? (3) What specific deficiencies in language assistance services are perceived by beneficiary groups and educators? (4) What is the apparent cause of these deficiencies? and (5) Do local beneficiary groups and educators see any need for federal regulation, and if so, what should the rules encompass? Key findings  include these: (1) services to language minority students vary enormously among school districts; (2) language assistance services are seldom available in secondary schools despite the growing need; (3) few districts have adequate means for identifying need or assessing when it is appropriate to terminate instruction; (4) districts have serious problems finding qualified teachers and materials for some less common language groups; and (5) programs most favored include those that involve local communities in developing appropriate services. Two broad recommendations are made: that federal regulation is needed to assure that districts do not neglect the education of language minority children, and that the federal government should support research and development to improve language  assistance programs.

Faculty hypothesized that developmental English and freshman ESL students made many similar grammatical errors, and to test this hypothesis, a computer assisted test containing 32 multiple choice problems testing verb tense and subject-verb agreement was given to 113 developmental English students and 106 ESL students. Comparison of the groups' results showed many of the same errors being made and the same answers given by approximately equal numbers from each group. A second test administration at the semester's end showed that many of the common errors were corrected by both  groups of students. It is concluded that both groups of students have the same needs in these areas and that texts with similar content could be used satisfactorily with both groups. Further investigation of grammatical areas in which the groups' needs may be similar and instructional materials can be used in common is recommended. (MSE)",

The community is described from a broad-based sociolinguistic perspective in order to assess community values and attitudes; an overview of the phonological and grammatical structure of the English variety is given; and a detailed linguistic analysis of the structural category of tense markings is made. Based on the results of the sociolinguistic description, a set of principles for teaching English as a second language  within this context is suggested. Results of the study of writing samples, showing that writing problems stem largely from habituated patterns of spoken language divergence from standard norms rather than from mechanical or spelling problems, is discussed in the context of the underlying sociolinguistic values and attitudes within the community.

Its objective is to make LEP adults more employable by teaching them both English and job skills. Such a project uses a team of two teachers, a vocational and a language instructor. A major advantage of this model is that students do not have to wait to learn English in order to learn job skills. Experience has shown that the employment rate of participants is higher than average, and that participants' earnings tend to keep pace with inflation. Many techniques and resources designed for these programs can also be adapted for other adult education and LEP program use.  Available program planning and implementation materials cover such topics as (1) components to be considered in planning, administering, and evaluating programs; (2) overcoming obstacles to full trainee participation; (3) language teaching techniques specifically for job-related English, (4) identifying occupations in which foreign language skills are an asset, (5) vocational oral proficiency testing, and (6) strategies for using external program resources.

In Britain this has taken the form of a national effort, called the Mother Tongue Project, including research on the linguistic diversity of local communities and support for primary curriculum development. Instructional and supporting materials were developed from this initiative. In the United States the initiatives have taken the form of a federal bilingual education program, with controversy focusing on both cost and program  direction. A variety of materials and programs have been developed within this national trend, with varying results. In Britain, arguments are strong for supporting children's bilingualism. In the United States, school districts confronted with growing immigrant populations are seeking a middle ground between native and English language emphasis. What are clearly needed are further research, curricular materials, and teacher education. (MSE)",

Withdrawn from the typographic-video world that engages them daily, students are deprived of their most comfortable means of knowledge acquisition. Typography and visual images can be an immeasurable aid in language teaching provided they are subordinated to the student tasks of both understanding and producing oral standard utterances. The best way to instill correct models of such utterances seems to involve memorization of written texts whose structures will be expanded through written and oral drills. The materials memorized should be both tolerable and relevant to the students' peer groups, but without obsolescent or biased content. Once  guided conversation begins, the somatic component should be encouraged, with students being prodded to use gesture and facial expression and permitted some movement in the classroom. Using print and computer-assisted instruction as a bridge to oral performance is not a short-cut, but a path to better achievement for more students, representing the best chance for success within the print biases and time constraints in the current academic world.

The structures of traditional foreign language simulations and of computer simulations are outlined and compared, and a model for computerized foreign language simulation is outlined. One simulation program currently used to teach elementary school students basic geological concepts is described. Three short-term classroom-centered studies of computer simulation in upper-intermediate and advanced level  ESL at Portland State University are then described and their results are discussed. It is concluded that although no definitive claim can be made, computer simulation does increase active involvement in reading for understanding, is integrative and flexible, requires extra time, and should be stopped when goals are achieved and be followed immediately by followup feedback and exercises.

Real CAI in classical language instruction will appear when the profession: (1) draws on colleges and universities for the best-designed materials, (2) uses innovative techniques toward sensible ends, (3) develops and tests materials on mainframe computers and then converts them to microcomputer form, and (4) does not ignore the centrality of the textbook in instruction. Two CAI projects illustrate the importance of these principles: the Montevidisco Project  at Brigham Young University--a videodisc simulation of a visit to a Mexican town, and the University of Delaware's Latin Skills Project using the computer to inflect variable parts of speech in Latin. The latter not only incorporates all the desired development features but also provides a greatly increased number of exercises without corresponding additional memory need, gives more sophisticated judging of student answers and feedback on partially correct answers, adds the ability to review missed verb forms \"invisibly,\" by presenting a similar form several items after the missed one, and enhances flexibility without loss of individualization.

        "description":"Recent trends in dental education and the supply of dentists for the South are examined to assist state policymakers and school officials. The supply of dentists has increased faster than the population over the past decade and will continue to increase through 1990; in the south the rate of growth exceeded the national rate. At the same time, the demand for dental services has declined, primarily due to a slowing in population growth, a depressed economy, and reduced dental disease for some groups. The ratios of dentists to the population vary significantly among states and within states, and shortages of dentists in inner-city and rural areas have been documented. Changes in the population and economic base of the state influence the demand for dental services. The scope and  number of public dental service programs and the availability of dental insurance also affect demand. The current decline in dental school enrollments and the increase in tuition will have an adverse effect on access to dental education for minorities. Recommendations are offered concerning opportunities for minorities who want to study dentistry, educational supply and demand in dental schools, the distribution of dentists to underserved areas, the efficiency of state-supported dental schools, and general practice residency positions.

In order to increase personalized assistance, a group of students was selected and trained in School of Business procedures, basic counseling, and college services. Peer advisers must meet a grade point average standard and submit an application with two faculty recommendations. A team of peer advisers and a faculty adviser review the applications, and final applicants undergo interviews. A 2-day training program involves team building, basic counseling skills, college support services, the writing and reading center, the educational opportunity program, and the counseling center. While continuing to provide drop-in advising services to  students, peer advisers now have increased responsibilities, including newsletter writing and participating in interviews with prospective students and their parents. As part of evaluation of the peer advising service, data have been collected on the number of student requests for specific services. Common role play situations that are used for peer adviser training are identified. A list of questions for peer advising interviews and a rating form for the interviews are included. (SW)",

The services requested and the reimbursement for the services can be negotiated by the faculty involved. Since it is the affiliated hospitals of a university with a 3+1 program that have the instrumentation for clinical instruction, testing cannot be managed at the university. The university can provide phlebotomy services and interpretation of the laboratory test results. As a test, services have been provided to researchers in the physical education and home economics departments. No revenue was generated for these  services for two reasons: the feasibility of offering the service was still being determined, and the graduate student researchers had limited funds. Based on the initial test, however, charges for the services will be implemented. As the project grows, a course in phlebotomy may be developed.

When using the checklist, the evaluator ranks the specialist's competencies on a three-point scale  ranging from low to high. Under each of the five broad categories, skill competencies and knowledge prerequisites are detailed. For example, under the category of \"instruction,\" the first skill is the ability to individualize instruction.

Suggestions are given on creating an efficient office environment, researching the topic, and drafting the manuscript. One way to improve efficiency is to compress teaching into a few days, leaving the remaining days free. Some textbook publishers will pay the college to free the faculty member to write. Word processing is beneficial when producing many drafts, and the publisher can be provided with a copy-edited product on diskettes. Information for writing the text can be obtained by reading abstracts of articles, selecting relevant articles, and sending for convention papers. Three types of sources are valuable: authoritative literature  reviews, content analyses of leading introductory texts, and the reports of expert consultants. Before beginning to write, reading a style manual is useful. Writing for the student is important, and retaining a writing coach to review the writing style and choice of words can help improve the writing. Finally, eliciting detailed comments of an editor and the criticisms of professional colleagues on every chapter is advisable. Some reference is made to writing psychology texts. (SW)",

Objectives were: to examine selected agency indicators of practica satisfaction, determine the extent of integration between field practica and other social work courses, ascertain the contribution of the social work curriculum in preparing students for their first social work position, and determine the role of field practica satisfaction as it relates to retention of BSW students and recent graduates. The study sample consisted of 86 juniors and seniors majoring in social work and 101 BSW graduates for the years 1977 to 1980 from one social work program. The majority of respondents were white, female, Kentucky residents, and 22 years old at time of graduation. The questionnaire focused on:  career choices, program satisfaction, extent of satisfaction with social work course preparation for work, demographic and academic information, and practica experiences including level of responsibility of agency assignments, significance of agency assignments, satisfaction with placement for learning needs, frequency of supervisory conferences, and extent of effective integration of practica with other social work courses. The model of field instruction utilized the organizing framework of teaching-learning centers. (SW)",

Over the years, the ITFS system at CSU, Chico, has been expanded to a network of 16 remote sites throughout Northeastern California, including community colleges, county school offices, military bases, hospitals, and industries. Off-campus ITFS students can complete a bachelor's degree in a number of fields. In September 1984, CSU, Chico, in a cooperative arrangement with the Hewlett Packard (H-P) Corporation, will provide the first courses in a program leading  to the master's degree in computer science. H-P students around the nation will be able to access the Chico collection for educational purposes. Consideration is being given to the potential of new electronic partnerships and the delivery of entire degree programs via satellite.

        "description":"This document records the hearing of a Subcommittee of the House on its 3-month investigation of the College Housing Loan Program and the Academic Facilities Loan Program, which are administered by the Department of Education. These programs have awarded about $5 billion in loans to finance the construction of dormitories, dining halls, student unions, and other campus buildings. The loans have been made at an interest rate of around 3 percent spread over 30 to 40 years for each borrower. The majority of the loans--4.5 billion dollars worth--were made for college housing. Attention is directed to ways in which effective and efficient management of programs can be achieved. General Accounting Office audits of the Department of Education's management of the program have found the  programs to be mismanaged, and the Department of Education to be lenient to colleges that have defaulted on their loans, which was confirmed by the Subcommittee's investigation. Included in this hearing are the Department of Education's audits of 10 institutions that had loans in default. Problems were found in billing and collection, loan security and controls, program regulations, staff utilization, and audit and inspection fees. Six of these 10 institutions were also in default on academic facilities loans. The hearing also includes letters and statements of Department of Education officials (Edward M. Elmendorf, Ronald Kimberling, and Mitchell L. Laine); as well as a paper entitled &quot;Public Policy Debt Deferment for Higher Education Facilities Loans,&quot; written by Joseph P. O'Neill to  attendees of a meeting sponsored by the Conference of Small Colleges, February 22, 1982 (minutes are included). (SW)",

Data were obtained from the National Center for Education Statistics regarding degrees conferred in these professions during 5-year increments. A 32-item questionnaire was developed and sent to deans at 464 professional schools. A total of 336 responses were obtained. In 1960 the percentage of women graduates for all six professions was 1.4 percent compared to 24 percent in 1980. The legal profession had the greatest increase in women graduates, graduating 2.5 percent women in  1960 and 41 percent in 1980. The greatest increase of women occurred during 1975-1980, after the enactment of legislation regarding women's rights. The most influential factors reported by deans included: increased number of female applicants, increased cultural acceptance of female professionals, increased social sanctions making the combination of a profession and family more acceptable, and positive female role models.

A questionnaire was administered to a sample of 270 incoming freshmen in 1973 and to 389 freshmen in 1983. Findings suggest a continuation of the trend of decreasing religious orthodoxy among students, with both groups showing little interest in participating in organized religious activities. The most notable change among students over the 10-year period appeared to be in designated religious preference and attitudes toward moral issues. Though the three traditionally dominant religions (Catholic, Jewish, and Protestant) were still indicated by the majority of students, a marked decrease in students indicating Jewish was shown in 1983 compared to  1973. Students in 1983 also indicated less supportive attitudes toward abortion, premarital sex, and the buying of term papers, and more supportive attitudes toward personal involvement in war. Analysis of sex differences indicated that females, compared to males, tended to have differing views of God, more positive attitudes toward religious activity, and appeared more supportive of integrating religion more broadly into their lives. Blacks differed from whites on religious preferences, views of God, and attitudes toward several issues. (Author/SW)",

Current applications of microcomputers are discussed, including numerical work, drill and testing, tutorials, simulation, and real time use. A review of the literature on alternative conceptions focuses on the concepts of speed and force in physics instruction, and a model of conceptual change is outlined which implies that instruction should involve the identification or diagnosis of student conceptions, the lowering of the status or remediation of alternative conceptions, and the raising of the status of the new instructional content. Two specific programs  designed to diagnose some alternative conceptions of speed and force are described, as well as the results of using the programs with first year university science students. These results indicate that the programs effected dramatic changes in a common alternative conception of speed and were able to diagnose several interrelated aspects of alternative conceptions of force.

An overview and brief history of educational computing is followed by suggestions which emphasize the need for planning, including pitfalls to avoid, establishing a planning group, and funding strategies. A range of state policies, practices, and services are described. Computer applications are listed and categorized as using the computer either as teacher, tool, object to be taught, or management tool. Ways to fit computers into school practice are also described, including the location of computers in relation to school use. Additional topics include the types of information needed  to begin a program; information sources; hardware; software/courseware; staff development programs; and program evaluation criteria. An appendix contains a decision model for microcomputer purchasing; a reference list of periodicals, software review sources, bibliographies, books, and associations; sample software evaluation forms; a partial list of northeast user groups; a partial list of software suppliers; and charts from an August 1981 survey of instructional computer use in public schools in the New York State capital district.

        "description":"A survey of the availability, use, and support--financial, personnel, and staff development--of instructional media in United States public and private elementary and secondary schools was conducted by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the National Center for Education Statistics. This study expanded on a 1976-77 study of school utilization of television by adding audio/radio and computers. A sample of 619 school superintendents, 1,350 principals and 2,700 teachers were queried about any in-school instructional applications of programming and equipment during the 1982-83 school year. When classifying responses, district size and wealth and school level were used to illuminate similarities and differences that existed in media use. Results of the survey showed that all  three media were available to at least some teachers in most school systems; media use varied across media and school levels; financial support differed greatly according to district size and wealth; over 90% of districts offered inservice teacher training in some media; and some have media support personnel. Comparisons with results of the earlier study show that the status of television for instruction has remained relatively stable from 1976-1977 to 1982-1983, with fewer elementary and more secondary teachers using television.

        "description":"The concept of \"structured programming\" was developed to facilitate software production, but it has not carried over to documentation design. Two concepts of structure are relevant to user documentation for computer programs. The first is based on programming techniques that emphasize decomposition of tasks into discrete modules, while the second was developed in discourse analysis to explain strategies used by readers and to model their cognitive processes in forming mental models of text content. Consideration of the text production and text comprehension approaches together provides a basis for designing \"user-friendly\" software manuals. A model for structured documentation suggests the need for: modules to be appropriate macropropositions (global content of the text); clear  identification of module function as a tutorial, operational, or reference component; planned ordering of modules and explicit superstructures to help readers identify effective strategies; and adequate access points to modules through such devices as indexes. An examination of the surface structures of 15 manuals for microcomputer file management indicated that structural guidance in existing manuals is inadequate. Nine references and the manuals that were examined are listed. (LMM)",

        "author":["Leach, Eugene E."],
        "description":"During the first two decades of radio broadcasting in the United States, commercial broadcasters persuaded federal regulators, much of the public, and many educators that there was little need for independent noncommercial stations. Educational programming could be entrusted to &quot;cooperation&quot; between commercial hosts and guest educators. An organization called the National Advisory Council in Education, backed by the Carnegie Corporation and the National Broadcasting Company, was particularly effective in promoting these ideas. The &quot;cooperation&quot; doctrine crucially undercut support for educational radio stations during the formative years of American broadcasting. Its wide acceptance helped reduce the number of independent educational broadcasters from 128 in 1925 to just 36 a  decade later. This article reconsiders the origins of the public broadcasting system, underscoring the crippling effects of the cooperative idea, sketches the rise of cooperation and the sharpening antagonisms between cooperators and independent educational broadcasters in the 1920's, and advances the thesis that the &quot;phantom&quot; of cooperation was a potent cause of radio educators' defeats during the 1920's and 1930's. A 106-item reference list is included. (Author/LMM)",

The role of consultant poses unique hazards and opportunities, as it requires the use of relationship and interactional skills quite apart from the instructional skills in which the instructional designer may be trained. Crucial issues include credibility, impossible or inappropriate demands, vague goals, and \"techniques first, objectives later.\" Some useful techniques for dealing with these problems include assertiveness, strategic control of information, doing one's \"homework,\" attending and focusing on the client as a person before focusing the  problem, reflecting and summarizing, and focused questioning.

        "author":["Cramer, Stephen E."],
        "description":"In early computer assisted instruction (CAI), negative feedback often insulted students and/or provided no useful knowledge. In classroom settings, teachers use the following approaches in dealing with students' wrong answers: (1) ask the question again, louder and slower; (2) ask the question again, using different words; (3) back up and reteach the past three minutes/hours/days; and (4) keep still, listen to the students and let their behavior reveal where the source of the misunderstanding lies. The latter approach suggests that students answer correctly or incorrectly for a reason and that observation of their behavior can indicate ways to help them correct their misunderstandings. For example, using algorithms to describe student behavior can help minimize student errors in  learning a procedure. Designing CAI materials for procedural learning should include two steps: construction of the correct production system or algorithm and construction of potential &quot;buggy&quot; or incorrect procedures, followed by incorporation of instructional error checking into the program. This paper concludes with the description of an interactive video program developed to teach procedures for diagnosing reading problems which included three incorrect algorithms. Responses to students' choice of incorrect algorithms were positively phrased and offered hints. Responses for correct answers explained why the answer was correct. Three references are listed.

        "description":"In a study designed to see how students accommodated a new technology, 27 eighth graders used a microcomputer in a middle school science class to access a commercial videotex service containing an electronic encyclopedia as part of an assignment to write a theme. Field observations of computer use and student interviews were used to collect data. Although the students exhibited the usual motivations for learning, such as grades and pleasing the teacher, they accounted for their expressed preference for computers over books by claiming that computers were easier to use, despite clear evidence to the contrary. This rationale lay over a stereotypical vision of personal futures requiring knowledge of computers which motivated them to learn to use computers. Results also showed the  greater salience of information obtained from electronic sources than print sources. The students assigned four functions within the school academic and social context to the hard copies of their electronic information--including achievement, reference, content, and interpersonal uses--and valued printouts especially for their portability and alterability. Overall, the students accommodated computers and videotex within their school context but assigned the new technology greater value than traditional learning media. (Author/LMM)",

Surveys were mailed to 119 vocational agriculture instructors who had completed a university-sponsored workshop in the use of the personal computer. The survey asked respondents to describe their vocational program and status of computer usage within that program, and to rate the importance of 50 specific computer competencies. Based on 115 usable surveys, findings indicated that the most important instructor competencies were those required for using  computer hardware and software in the classroom, rather than computer programming. Such factors as years of teaching experience, student enrollment in vocational agriculture, student enrollment in high school, and number of personal computers available for class use were not strongly related to the teachers' ratings of the four competency areas (hardware, instruction, programming, and software). Fourteen references are listed, and ten tables display study data. (LMM)",

        "description":"There is no one universal definition of the term &quot;computer literacy,&quot; which, in fact, is used so generally that people often preface references to microcomputers in education with their own definitions of computer literacy. The term is organized semantically in a variety of ways, and central to this semantic organization is a problem of deciding how to integrate &quot;knowledge of,&quot;&quot;knowledge about,&quot; and &quot;knowledge through&quot; the computer into the conceptual organization of knowledge in general. Efforts to introduce the microcomputer into the curriculum are encouraging careful discussions of just exactly what computer literacy is, can be, or should be. Until recently, &quot;literacy&quot; referred to the ability to read and write and to being well-educated or knowledgeable. The meaning of&quot;well-educated&quot; may have altered, however, to encompass knowledge of computers. It is held that any rhetorical confusion resulting from attempts to deal with this phenomenon is natural, insightful, and necessary to maintain the dialogue that will develop our understanding of the microcomputer's impact on knowledge and education. A chart illustrates the distribution of references to computer literacy in educational literature, and a 20-item reference list is included. (LMM)",

The first study, conducted in April 1982, consisted of 478 telephone interviews of Cox Cable subscribers in San Diego. The second study, conducted in summer 1982, consisted of face-to-face interviews with 107 respondents, selected through random digit dials of households in the San Diego Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area. Interviews for the second study were conducted after respondents were exposed to a half-hour demonstration of a working videotex system in a laboratory. The potential effects of three potential intervening variables--automated teller machine usage, prior \"hands-on\" computer experiences, and Home Box Office subscription status--were controlled. A  strong, linear, negative relationship between consumer age and predisposition to adopt videotex services in both studies was found which was independent of the three variables. (Author/LMM)",

Through the development of these two innovative programs, the fine arts have found their place in the community college curriculum, providing a valuable and practical educational experience. The AGS is an individually designed and college-approved degree which considers the student's prior job experiences, personal achievements and previous educational course work. The program involves an orientation session, assessment of student  background and abilities, the formulation of educational goals to be pursued, the assignment of a mentor with expertise in relevant areas, and the completion of the requirements of the student's educational plan. The Independent Study in the Fine Arts Program is a more specialized educational experience focusing on the skills necessary to produce a marketable and competitive art object. Similar in concept to the old world practice of apprenticeship, the program involves students learning through practical experience under the close supervision and guidance of the instructor. Independent study opportunities are available in ceramics, painting, and photography. A discussion of program benefits and an outline of the independent study program are included. (LAL)",

Introductory material discusses the negative cycle of student-teacher interaction that may be provoked by large classes, and the use of permanent, heterogeneous, six- or seven-member student learning groups as the central focus of class activity as a method of breaking this cycle. The next sections briefly examine the formation of groups; the sequence of instructional activities (i.e., individual study followed by individual exam, then group discussion and exam, lecture, and application-oriented activities); the organization of course material so that each topic provides a conceptual framework for the next; and the development and management of group-oriented classroom activities such  as tests, problems, case analyses, and role plays. After commenting on the importance of ensuring sufficient space and time for group work, the paper discusses two methods of providing feedback and handling student challenges. The final section summarizes the results of team learning in large classes, focusing on the in-class and out-of-class benefits for students and instructors. Benefits for students are seen in their active involvement in the learning process, the provision of immediate feedback, ready access to individual help, and the opportunity to work on challenging problems.

The information is not prespecified in Camelot and, consequently, can take many forms including instruction, counseling, prescription, and task assignment. The basis for individualizing the information is also not predeclared; therefore, users can choose their own criteria for individualizing the information they wish to disseminate. In educational settings, Camelot can create a personal teaching-learning environment for each student, provide individualized feedback, and guide students at optimal speed through the course or program. Once the course designer has given Camelot descriptions of the course assessment procedures, the student characteristics to be used as the basis for  individualization, and the content for feedback to different types of students, the system automatically assesses students' levels of understanding, analyzes students' responses to objective tests and the results of teacher-marked assignments, monitors students' current learning status, and composes and prints individualized feedback letters. Camelot includes: (1) management modules to create, update, and maintain student records; (2) test-scoring modules to process various types of tests and inventories; (3) word processing modules to create, edit, and store feedback information; (4) decision rules modules that link database and feedback information; and (5) report-generating modules to print reports about students and tests.

At Sinclair Community College, a writing across the curriculum approach was implemented by one instructor through a system of paired classes. Students were offered the opportunity to sign up for specific sections of a writing course and a humanities course, earning three credits for the completion of each. Students do the usual writing assignments for the humanities course, and work on these and other assignments in the writing course. In this way, writing becomes a special way of  mastering the content material. The humanities course is structured according to mastery learning techniques in easily manageable units. At the end of each mastery learning unit, the students must produce a written composition to fulfill an assignment, and throughout the unit the students are actively seeking, writing down, and relating information. The humanities and writing classes are scheduled back-to-back, which allows extra flexibility in using class time. (HB)",

        "description":"Modeled on a similar study conducted in Scotland, this study reports on preschool children in two cities of England's Midlands Region (Birmingham and Coventry). Subjects had special needs including physical, mental, behavioral, speech, and second language problems; in addition, some were gifted. A survey identified children with special needs in ordinary preschool units such as nursery classes, day nurseries, and play groups. Structured interviews with the persons in charge of ordinary units and units attached to special schools yielded data on staffing patterns and training; parent involvement; accommodations; involvement of outside professionals; records kept on each child; and nursery policies regarding admissions, catchment area, and waiting lists. Two observational studies  were conducted between October 1979 and December 1981: (1) timed sample structured observations of 17 children with special needs in ordinary preschools; and (2) observations of the communication of seven children, involving a language test and transcriptions of videotape recordings. Interviews with the parents of 13 of the 17 children with special needs focused on parents' choice of preschool unit, special provisions for their child in the preschool, and attitudes toward special preschool units. The final chapter summmarizes results of the research and discusses implications for educational policy. (CB)",

Crucial events appear to take place at the start of the second year of life. At this time, fathers begin to treat their sons and daughters differently, while mothers continue to treat infants of both sexes similarly. From the time their daughters are 3 years of age, fathers tend to interact in expressive rather than instrumental ways. When fathers do behave instrumentally, their behavior is ineffective and confusing. In later years, the pattern continues, with girls eliciting more affection from their fathers and receiving less encouragement for independent  achievements. This pattern has held up to a degree even in a sample of nontraditional fathers who had accepted greater child care roles. Although fathers who were their daughters' primary caregivers made a greater effort than did traditional fathers to foster their daughters' intellectual growth, these fathers' behavior still varied according to the sex of the child and remained consistent with sex-role stereotypes.

This report builds on previous data from the WPP by expanding the sample of dual-earner families to include 30 single-working-mother families. Research with this sample focused on processes linking workplace policies and the social supports available to the single mothers. Data were collected from Anglo, Black, and Mexican American single-parent (divorced) families through in-depth and structured interviews concerning family demographics, work history, and information about characteristics of the mothers'  jobs. Findings are reported under the following headings: (1) involvement in schools; (2) family types, focusing on authoritative, inadequate, no control, and dependent mothers; (3) family type and school involvement; (4) fathers' involvement; (5) ethnic differences; (6) mother-child relationships; (7) support networks; and (8) dual-earner and single-parent families. The study recommends that employer assistance programs be expanded to include some services related to the mental and financial health of workers and their families, e.g., on-site education and training activities such as stress management, parenting education and financial counseling.

The goals of the project were to provide alternative day care arrangements for low income parents and to offer senior citizens extra income and strengthen their self-image. Advantages of home-based day care were determined to be (1) fewer transportation difficulties for low income mothers; (2) siblings remaining together; (3) more attention for each child; (4) lower costs, especially important in light of funding cutbacks; and (5) no costly regulations applying to the care of more than five children. The program was implemented at local levels by Head Start agencies, aging offices, day care projects, and other social agencies, which in part  used the services of volunteers. These local sponsors assisted in recruiting, training, equipping, evaluating, and monitoring day care providers; in addition, they helped link the family day care network with existing social services. The project was successful in establishing 60 day care homes, serving 290 children. Formal evaluation of the program was not possible, but informal interviews generated information about the kinds of services needed by parents and about the program's effect on the health, self-concept, and economic status of day care providers.

Five topics are specifically addressed: microcomputers and intellectual structures, microcomputers as cultural events, microcomputers and strategy repetoires, instruction and the self-construction of minds, and microcomputers as functional learning environments. In addition, the discussion offers an analysis of ideas concerning the interconnection between behaviorism and microcomputers in early childhood education. In this context, six topics are investigated: microcomputers and skill-training in education, major criticisms of the use of microcomputers in education, behaviorist theories and microcomputers in education, concerns about  the skill-training use of microcomputers, behaviorist methodologies in Logo, and claims of behaviorism that go beyond behaviorism. It is concluded that, while the computer may have beneficial educational utility from a cognitive-developmental point of view, great care must be given to ensure that computers have a liberating rather than a constraining influence on children's cognitive development. Further, it is asserted that, while skill-training, microcomputers, and behaviorism will always play a role in early childhood education, the algorithmic nature of both microcomputer programs and behaviorism should not be allowed to predominate.

        "description":"Recent American research has explored developmental trends in gender segregation of children's peer groups. However, it is important to differentiate systematic trends in children from systematic changes in their environments. This report, based on data gathered from 1972 to 1975, presents evidence on gender segregation in Kipsigis children's peer groups in Kokwet, a rural community in Kenya. Gender segregation is examined in culturally characteristic settings and is discussed in relation to both developmental and cultural issues. Observational data from 152 children ages 18 months to 9 years reveal that there is no segregation by gender in peer groups until around the age of 6. At that time, changes in settings, parental expectations, and customary duties result in an increase  in the proportion of same-sex peers in the peer group. Even within this pattern, there is some evidence that children do not interact more with same-sex peers. A contrast is drawn with the adult pattern of gender segregation, and emphasis is given to the importance of culture and development as interactive systems. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"To provide a context for a discussion of parental modernity and child development, this paper explores concepts of societal and individual modernity and examines historical evidence of increasing levels of intellectual competence and an active orientation in the conduct of life. Specific attention is given to sociological theories of Bell (1973) and Etzioni (1968). Beliefs, values, and behaviors are discussed that can be interpreted as parental modernity, and the correlation of parental modernity with parent education and child academic competence is examined. Additionally, a summary is offered of cross-sectional and longitudinal research on correlations between parental modernity and child academic competence. Findings reveal that maternal cognitive orientations, cognitive  skills, behavior with interviewer, and behavior with child intercorrelate with and predict child competence. Implications of the analysis and findings for influencing academic competence of adults and children are suggested. Vygotsky's (1978) discussion of internalization of higher psychological processes is seen as providing a theoretical basis for interpreting parent variables as influencing children's development of academic competence.

        "author":["Holahan, John M."],
        "description":"Using the analogy of language syntax, this paper describes the development of music syntax in children ages 5 months to 5 years. It is suggested that music syntax enables the child to comprehend familiar and unfamiliar music and to reproduce familiar music and create novel music. Observations were made in a day care center and a nursery school of 150 children who were provided with informal music activities. Children of different ages performed activities such as rhythmic movement, chanting, and singing. Data were interpreted as suggesting three stages of music babble: (1) At the first level, the child performs discrete music elements concurrently &quot;in time&quot; with a musical stimulus. (2) At the second level, the child performs combinations of discrete music elements arranged  synchronically &quot;in time&quot;, but those discrete elements do not give rise to tonal or rhythmic organization. The emergence of spontaneous performance apart from a musical stimulus is interpreted as an objective indication that the child is capable of representing musical sounds mentally (audiation). (3) At the third level, the child's performances become more coherent and resemble, but are not identical to, familiar songs. It is concluded that children can learn a great deal through informal exposure to music and that this exposure should begin before kindergarten. (Author/CB)",

The survey of administrators and teachers was made to determine whether (1) goals were set for both FDAD and HDED programs; (2) the same curricular elements were deemed important by FDAD and HDED principals and teachers; (3) the same curricular elements  were taught in FDAD and HDED schools; (4) equal time was spent on curricular categories in FDAD and HDED kindergartens; and (5) the attitudes of teachers in FDAD and HDED kindergartens toward their scheduling plans were equitable. The survey of directors provided information concerning state aid, bus transportation, and scheduling patterns.

Questions regarding philosophy and content include the following: (1) Why should my child attend kindergarten? (2) What will my child be taught? (3) What is the kindergarten teacher's responsibility concerning reading? (4) What do you do for the child who comes to kindergarten able to read? (5) Will my child learn to write in kindergarten? Other questions have to do with classrooms, materials and teacher aides. Sample parental concerns reflected  in the remaining questions include: (1) How will I know my child is getting along at school? (2) Will my child be wasting his time in kindergarten? (3) Why does my child reply \"play\" when I ask what she did in school? (4) How can I be more involved in my child's education? (5) Should I just stop by to see the teacher?

These competencies represent the organizational, evaluative, decision-making, and manipulative skills required of early childhood educators in the field; not, however, the theory and knowledge that must also be acquired in order to perform these functions capably. These competencies specify the functions that must be carried out with a group of children in any preschool or day care setting and form the basis for evaluating the student. Most of the competencies are to be met by the completion of an initial classroom experience  combined with field experience, while others are competencies necessary for a preschool supervisor. These advanced competencies are to be acquired through at least a year's work experience and continuing education programs. Competencies are organized into nine general areas: (1) knowing the individual child, (2) program planning, (3) guiding and caring for children, (4) health, (5) communications, (6) interpersonal skills, (7) interacting with families, (8) administration, and (9) professional conduct and attitude.

It is suggested that social problems arise when some aspects of society change while other intimately related aspects lag behind, especially when the lagging circumstances are improving but not fast enough. The thesis is that the social equality movements of the last 2 decades produced rapid change that has not been paralleled in other aspects of society, creating task overload, a focus on self, and stress adversely affecting family life and children. It is suggested that, while some people have grabbed at quick fixes, more effective solutions are likely to come when the lagging aspects of society catch up. Four areas or groups  needing to catch up are discussed: private industry, government, fathers, and family institutions (including early education and alternative care programs, which should be encouraged to become multidimensional family resource centers).

From a comprehensive collection of over 1,400 documents concerning Head Start, 71 studies were selected for review and coded to permit a meta-analytic, quantitative analysis of findings. The coding system recorded a statistical estimate of effect size, which was an outcome measure based on a comparison of the cognitive performance of two groups. The 71 studies yielded 148 comparisons and 449 effect sizes. For each effect size, the characteristics of the Head Start experience for each group investigated and the characteristics of the children in each group were coded. Additional information was also recorded on the design of the selected  studies and on the measurement of the cognitive domain. After an overview of the report provided in chapter I, chapter II briefly discusses the review in terms of cognitive development and the methodological and analytical procedures employed. Chapter III (1) specifies the kinds of cognitive gains made by children participating in Head Start; (2) discusses the program in terms of duration, classroom composition, staff training, the special parent program, curriculum, and the program operator; and (3) describes demographic characteristics of children served by Head Start, with specific attention being given to maternal education, single-parent families, family size, IQ at enrollment, effects of minority participation, and age at enrollment.

There appear to be reasons both external and internal to anthropology which have contributed to the anthropologist's changing position among Native Americans. External factors include legislation and an increase in the political power of Native Americans. A major internal factor is the  anthropologists' new awareness of their identification with a superordinate power imposed on native peoples from the outside. The result has been a change of direction and today the focus of anthropological activity among Native Americans is directly related to explicit Native American concerns. The anthropologists' employer has also changed and many now work directly for Native American groups or public agencies responsible to Native Americans. Other changes are: a shift in time perspective from reconstruction of the mythical ethnographic present to studies of the present-day situation; and greater participation of Native Americans in anthropological work.

The participation of women in wheat-based farming systems in Ellis County, Kansas, is examined as related to the ethnic background of the farm families and changing land tenure patterns of the area. In addition to childbearing, women settlers engaged in subsistence activities (gardening, sale of eggs, butter and cream), hired out for domestic work, and collected bones and chips from buffalo and cattle for sale to fertilizer companies. Because daughters assisted with subsistence activities and/or were sent to work in town as household help, increase in number of  daughters was significantly correlated with increase in farm size. For both ethnic groups, participation in subsistence production reduced female educational opportunities. Today, male interests still dominate, but there are more choices available for farm children. Children's choices, in turn, limit choices of the mother. Women continue as gap fillers and shock absorbers. Farm women still identify themselves as such. Like their ancestors, daughters leave the farm when possible. Women continue to garden, raise poultry, and milk cows, but more as a hobby, a way of seeking self-fulfillment, rather than because of economic necessity. (NEC)",

Service providers were college faculty and staff from Minnesota and one border institution. Factors which contributed to remaining through graduation included personal motivation, adequate parental and financial support, positive faculty responsiveness, and support of friends. Impacting factors on college completion also included parents' level of education and attitudes, identified career goals, and attendance at Indian student organization meetings.  All three survey groups reported inadequacies in precollege advisement and academic preparation, poor study skills, and lack of funds and child care services. Key informants cited as an additional obstacle cultural alienation while service providers indicated a need for American Indian faculty and staff. Indian student retention will be most facilitated by family and Indian community support, improved high school preparation, precollege workshops, additional financial aid, institutional commitment to Indian student support, and encouragement of return to college by dropouts.

        "description":"Findings from current literature form the basis for this examination of five critical elements of change and development within the local community setting which impact on agriculture: population, employment, land, water, and environment. Renewed rural population growth during the 1970's has reversed small farm trends but placed strains on local governments, frequently resulting in higher property taxes. Increased off-farm employment has provided supplementary farm income, resulted in less family labor available to support farm production, increased the number of small farms, and tied farm family living standards to economic conditions in the nonfarm sector. Rural community growth has intensifed the demand for agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes, resulting in high  land costs that are a key barrier to entry into farming. The quantity of water required for agricultural purposes and the detrimental influence that agricultural activities are having on water quality are being scrutinized by local governments and residents. Agriculture is being viewed as a major contributor to air pollution through overuse of pesticides. Because affairs of the community and farm sector are intertwined, it is essential that local governments, farmers, and residents work cooperatively in shaping policies and programs that ensure the continued viability of both agriculture and the community.

The principal objective of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is to actively encourage Indian and Alaska Natives in the self-determination of their own affairs. Education is the largest line item in the BIA budget; in fiscal year 1984 the BIA funded 206 education facilities (72 day schools, 49 on-reservation boarding schools, 62 tribally-controlled schools, and 15 dormitories) with an estimated average daily attendance of 43,193. Johnson-O'Malley  funds provided supplemental programs for approximately 175,000 public school Indian students in 26 states. Total BIA appropriations for higher education were about $26 million, including grants for the operation of 19 tribally-controlled colleges. In April, 1984, there were 291 federally-recognized tribes and 197 federally-recognized Alaska village communities. The 1980 United States population of 1,418,195 for American Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts reflected a 71% increase since 1971. Much recent Indian economic development can be credited to the policy of self-determination which has contributed to an Indian entrepreneurial explosion. (BRR)",

Since learning styles, like cultural features, may vary for Indian students, the effective teacher will master a matching teaching style adapted to emphasize unique cultural strengths rather than to compensate for perceived inadequacies. Although there remain individual differences, common patterns of intellectual abilities, thinking styles, and interests characterize those who share a common cultural background. The resulting learning style encompasses sensory mode and perception, physical setting, general learning conditions, and cognitive processing. Learning style is &quot;the usual or characteristic manner of acquiring knowledge,  skills or understanding.&quot; Studies of Indian learning styles have focused on perceptual and spatial abilities, environmental factors, impulsive vs. reflective response, relational vs. analytical styles, and simultaneous vs. successive processing. Results indicate Indian student strength in imaginal coding, holistic processing, and simultaneous processing, but relative weakness in verbal coding.

Reliable studies will evaluate the quality of education according to preparation for total living, facilitation of free life and work choices, and enabling of individual advancement. They will include promotion of identity and self-worth,  completion of high school, school achievement, and Indian self-determination as product variables and Indian philosophy and cultural relevance, quality of curriculum and instruction, facilities, and teacher preparation and inservice training as process variables.

Activities are carefully sequenced as to difficulty, and group discussion periods between activities allow participants to verbalize together what they have learned. Five major categories are 1) group activities requiring cooperation and teamwork but a small amount of trust, 2) group activities requiring high amounts of trust, communication, and teamwork, 3) activities involving two  people and requiring communication and cooperation, 4) individual activities promoting self-confidence and/or trust in others, and 5) individual activities requiring a high degree of self-confidence and/or trust in others. Specific instructions for each activity include materials needed, objectives, instructions to participants, and safety procedures and teaching hints for the instructor. Sample activities are beams, cable cooperation, flea hop, trust fall, and welcome aboard. (MM)",

        "description":"As part of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program effort, the conference explored the impact of high blood pressure (hypertension) on Native Americans. Participants, including health professionals, health service consumers, and volunteers providing health services to Native Americans, discussed these issues: traditional Native American treatment of hypertension; training and utilization of ancillary health personnel in hypertension control; resources available for hypertension control; development of protocols for screening, treatment and control of hypertension by the Indian Health Service; hypertension from the paramedical viewpoint; and current research efforts. Two resulting recommendations were that Native American and Alaskan Native high blood pressure control  projects be implemented, both on and off reservations, and that curriculum materials on chronic disease management and detection be developed for outreach workers. The report contains the keynote address concerning the use of ancillary health personnel in community-based high blood pressure programs and two presentations, one concerning the role of the Health Services Administration in state high blood pressure grants for reaching hard-to-reach population and the other concerning the implementation of Native American recommendations about high blood pressure. Also included is the text of a panel discussion on historical/traditional research and current research concepts. Fourteen recommendations are listed. (BRR)",

        "description":"As part of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program effort, the conference explored the implications and impact of the prevalence of hypertension in Spanish-speaking populations in California. Approximately 150 experts in health fields, representing all levels of government, public and private health care providers, consumers, and health care services in Mexico, attended workshops on the collection of hypertension data in the Spanish-speaking community, effective approaches for high blood pressure control, coordination of resources for high blood pressure control programs, educational approaches to high blood pressure control in the Spanish-speaking community, and legislation and hypertension control. Recommendations from the workshops included the following: schools  providing professional health training (i.e., medical, dental, nursing schools) within a service area of large concentrations of Spanish-speaking Spanish surname populations must provide cross-cultural training including both bilingual and bicultural elements; legislation must be promoted to emphasize intensive multimedia, public education, and school programs in health education for the Spanish-speaking communities; and programs on weight and obesity, stress and anxiety avoidance, and general health awareness must be promoted among adolescents, with special emphasis on school-based programs. This summary report contains an overview of the material presented, an agenda, recommendations from each workshop, and an overview of each workshop. (NQA)",

Representing various local, state, and national health, education, and media organizations, the 108 participants attended sessions on sociocultural factors, health values, and perceptions affecting health communication, and use and evaluation of media in disseminating health information. Each session consisted of a keynote address, three or four related research presentations, and a workshop session. Workshop participants used a health communications methodology to complete a case study which involved the design of a model health communications campaign to educate the  Mexican American community about services provided by a health maintenance organization for cardiovascular disease. A media critique session provided participants with guidelines for content and production which should be considered in designing health communication materials. Topics of the research presentations included the determination of Hispanic knowledge, attitudes and practices related to cancer for the purpose of education programs; alternative methods of presenting bilingual health education messages; and a videotape package to reach Hispanics with cancer health education.

The observation system used was a modified version of two systems, the Brophy and Good teacher-student dyadic interaction system, and the Dweck et al. observation system to code evaluative feedback. Analyses and discussion focused on similarities and differences of teacher-student interactions between the elementary and junior high regular and advanced levels. While there were no differences in the total number of interactions experienced by students at each school level, differences were found in how these observations were distributed across four behavioral categories and in the behavioral patterns associated with the various  interactions coded. Evidence suggests that the roles assumed by teachers and students at the elementary level differ from the roles assumed by teachers and students at the junior high school levels. (Author)",

Six expert elementary school mathematics teachers were identified. Observational logs, videotapes, audiotapes, and interviews with teachers and students were collected and analyzed. A matrix mapping the relationship between routines and activity structures was developed, teachers' actions during the introduction of routines in the first four days were described, and the  attachments linking the teacher's actions to the routine were identified and coded as management, support, or exchange. Major findings summarized include: when routines occur, how many are introduced at the beginning of the year, and how many of these exist in the middle of the year for each teacher. The three types of routines are then reviewed with some specific examples, and students' explicit knowledge of a sample of routines is examined. A lengthy appendix contains a description of each teacher's actions during the first four days. (MNS)",

However, with only occasional exceptions, national agricultural and population policies have failed to take soil depletion into account. Projections of world food production always incorporate estimates of future cropland area, but what has been lacking has been an effort to project changes in inherent productivity of the projected cropland area. To help remedy this shortcoming in world food supply projections, an estimate of the worldwide loss of topsoil from cropland is presented. Areas discussed include: (1) the causes of soil erosion; (2) dimensions of the problem in various countries; (3) the effects of erosion (particularly related to loss of  topsoil) on agricultural productivity; (4) the effects of erosion on other areas (indicating that the loss of topsoil that reduces land productivity may also reduce irrigation, electrical generation, and the navigability of waterways); (5) economic aspects of soil conservation; (6) the role of governments; and (7) global aspects of the problem.

The context of these recommended priorities is given in an executive summary, and more fully set out in the report's three chapters. Chapter I describes the nature and purpose of materials research and the status of several major research facilities in the United States and other countries. Chapter II outlines the research that has been done with existing facilities and that will be facilitated with the proposed new installations. Chapter III offers a fuller rationale for the priorities, briefly analyzes costs, and surveys facilities considered but not included in the priorities. (JN)",

Some discrepancies were found between data from a special survey and the CBEDS, but these were not of sufficient magnitude to justify the costs of collecting new data. Therefore, CBEDS data for 1982 were used to analyze enrollments and levels of teaching effort for mathematics and science courses in grades 9-12. Mathematics accounted for 12.6% of  the enrollments and 13.3% of the effort, while the data for science were 6.4% and 6.5%, respectively. Course content was examined, using beginning algebra for the textbook analysis. On the average, about two-thirds of the lessons in the four textbooks were devoted to topics in the state competencies statement. While the structure and content were similar, differences in textbooks were also noted. A comparison with SAT content indicated some disparities with the competencies statement. Tables present the data and other information. (MNS)",

The purpose was to determine whether news reporting in developed nations is different from news reporting in developing countries. Methodology included quantitative and qualitative analyses. A systematic discourse analysis provided explicit descriptions of thematic structures, conventional superstructures, local meanings and coherence, style, and rhetoric. The number of articles, coverage size, and story content in developed and developing countries were very similar. Less background coverage was provided, however, in newspapers from developing countries. Major differences between first and third world newspapers  exist in their different sources of information: the third world press was almost fully dependent on the transnational news agencies, whereas developed countries had many sources. Two major factors explain the homogeneity of the news: (1) an internationally shared system of news discourse and production rules, and (2) the dominant role of the transnational agencies.

        "description":"Based on a preliminary version of this study, project aims were to learn what college freshmen knew about presidents in office from the late 19th century to the present and to determine the students' writing levels. During the first class of each of five semesters, students enrolled in an American History Since 1985 course were asked to write one paragraph about any post Civil War president. Student evaluations of 17 post Civil War presidents (compared to only 4 in the preliminary study) were analyzed. The following categories were used to classify student statements: background/biography, integrity, leadership, intelligence, policies/accomplishments, courage, public image, value to country, historical perspectives, sophistication, and factual errors. In addition, an analysis of  student spelling resulted in a listing of 75 most frequently misspelled historical terms. The bulk of the document consists of a category-by-category analysis of student responses for each president in the order chosen: Richard M. Nixon, John F. Kennedy, Jimmy Carter, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, Harry S. Truman, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ulysses S. Grant, Woodrow Wilson, Andrew Johnson, Warren G. Harding, Rutherford B. Hayes, and Calvin Coolidge. Findings indicate that although students demonstrated a substantial body of knowledge concerning post Civil War presidents, attempts to communicate their knowledge were marred by their inability to communicate in written English.
