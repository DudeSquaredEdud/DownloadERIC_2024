In order to determine the effects of the programs at the state and local educational-agency levels, data were obtained from visits to the 31 state departments of education involved and to three randomly selected local agencies, as well as from a mail survey of a 50% sample of local Right to Read directors. Assessment included a summary of program processes across the 31 states, focusing on the following topics: characteristics of program directors, program objectives, the establishment of reading as a top priority, task forces, advisory councils, technical assistance within the program, dissemination of information and  amassment of public support, equitable distribution of services, training of directors, needs assessment, accreditation and certification of teachers, evaluation of program procedures, adult literacy, communication systems, and a comprehensive plan of action.

Data are grouped into nine major categories of investigation: estimated participation in programs, projection of total participation, training activities, authority of state program directors, duties of the state advisory council, legislation passed or pending that might affect the program, changes in teacher certification, program coordination with adult basic education, and effect of the loss of federal funding. Analyses of specific state programs reveal that the approach taken by the federal administrators responsible for the state components of the program resulted in meaningful effects  while utilizing a relatively modest amount of money.

Using &quot;Standards of Excellence for Reading in Delaware&quot; and its accompanying checklist as the assessment instrument, committees in each building met with members of the Delaware Department of Public Instruction reading team to complete the checklist, discuss their responses, and record findings. From these findings a district committee, composed of representatives from each of the building committees, identified needs and ranked them in order of priority. Needs which the committee felt to be most vital became the basis for a written plan of corrective action.

Second-grade and sixth-grade children were tested in the fall and spring with the Metropolitan Achievement Test and either the Cooperative Primary Test or the Sequential Test of Educational Progress. Questionnaires were used to gather information about demographic characteristics, organization and implementation of programs, educational attitudes, pupil characteristics, and classroom activities. The data were analyzed using separate four-factor analyses of variance (sex by SES by instructional time by instructional emphasis) for each grade and program type. Results indicated that time spent in formal reading instruction was  most strongly associated with gains in reading achievement. Instructional emphasis had less impact than instructional time, although in second-grade compensatory programs low instructional emphasis on skills combined with a maximum amount of time produced larger comprehension gains than did high emphasis on skills combined with maximum instructional time. Considered apart from instructional characteristics, sex and socioeconomic level did not influence gains in achievement. (AA)",

        "description":"This study attempted to assess the relationship between misreading of high-frequency words and utilization of semantic and syntactic cue systems. A 250-word passage from a second-grade basal reader was altered in two ways: in one condition, the sentences were randomly ordered, and, in the other, the words were randomly ordered. Twenty-four fourth graders, 12 good readers and 12 poor readers, were asked to read orally both the altered versions and the original passage. Data were collected on general word-identification accuracy and on time needed to complete the readings in each condition. The analysis indicated a considerable difference in mean time needed to complete the readings for both groups. Despite the fact that the random-word condition depressed performance for both  groups an almost identical amount, the proportional increase in time needed by good readers was dramatically greater than that needed by poor readers. The random-word condition had a more disturbing effect on poor readers' performances with regard to high-frequency, low-discriminability words. The clearest implications of these findings consitute a rejection of the notion that misreading is simply traceable to perceptual confusion. (KS)",

The model included a randomly selected sample of subjects drawn from 280 children, aged eight through seventeen, participating in a sports program at Memphis State University. The 60 experimental-group students were placed in four subgroups based upon instructional emphasis (comprehension vs. vocabulary) and grouping strategy (homogeneous vs. heterogeneous). After four weeks of instruction, subjects were evaluated using the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Tests, the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale for children, and a locally developed satisfaction scale. While the instructional period was too short to result in any significant differences  between groups, interesting trends were observed favoring vocabulary study and homogeneous grouping. It was concluded that the posttest-only, control-group design was the appropriate choice for evaluation purposes and that the program was worthy of further development.

The research reviewed is organized into three broad components: (1) decoding, (2) accessing the meaning of single printed words, and (3) text organization processes, or obtaining meaning from larger stretches of text. Results from various studies suggest that good and poor comprehenders differ primarily in the first and third components. Speculations are offered on the interrelationships between these components and their effect on reading comprehension processes. (Author)",

The program focused on decoding skills taught through SRA materials in a reading skills laboratory. Because many of the students had had many years of unsuccessful remedial reading instruction, the program attempted to retrain them, as though they had never previously tried to learn to read. After one year, 39 of the 59 students who attended the course had completed the decoding phase and were able to read all of the spelling patterns covered by the SRA series. All but one of the students advanced at least two levels in the SRA series and were evaluated by teachers as having considerably improved their decoding skills.  (AA)",

For each individual school, charts and graphs are presented which show mean scores for reading tests, deviation of these mean scores from national norms, gain scores, and attitude test scores. It was apparent that with a few exceptions, little measurable gain has been accomplished since the introduction of these programs. The relatively short (six months) duration of program operation most likely accounts for these findings. (KS)",

During the workshop, participants learn to describe the type of task individual items involve; to determine whether the skill is being introduced, clarified, expanded, or practiced; to recognize the assumptions the task makes about the student; and to estimate the value of the task in generating new insight or further learning. Objectives for the workshop, suggested agenda, a trouble-shooter's guide, a discussion guide,  examples of tasks and assessments, and a task-assessment form are included. (AA)",

This paper discusses the operation of a communication skills program within a college communication skills center which functions as a supportive resource service and provides students with the basic communication tools for academic achievement and self-image improvement. The discussion focuses on reading, writing, and speech programs, as well as on the staffing of a center, on the selection of students for a skills program, and on the evaluation of a skills program. The paper concludes that the success of a communication skills center may be measured by the number of students completing the program, by  the reduction in the college drop-out rate, and by the improvement in test scores of graduate students.

Smeall, outlines the historical basis, and perceptual limitations, of the use of print media alone in classroom instruction. Suggestions for encouraging children's recitation of poetry are based on the notion that memorization is best facilitated through a process of listening, imitating, and performing. Robert King's \"Excursions into Poetry\" presents ideas for using the following vehicles to introduce poetry to children: haiku (limited by a specific topic or associated with an art project), rhyme utilizing jumprope chants and satires of popular ads, poetry by both children and adults, and structured and  group-written poetry. A 20-item annotated bibliography of resources on poetry and creative writing for children is included. \"A Bicentennial Note\" contains ideas for teaching the concepts of past, present, and future through the development of children's personal histories.

Educational objectives now include many aspects of creative behavior. The use of textbooks, supplementary materials, tests, and training methods which facilitate creativity has increased to the point where students achieve higher creativity scores than did comparable groups nine years ago. We seem to be moving to a stage in which creative problem solving and creative expression will be integrated into the total curriculum rather than just in specific subject areas. One emphasis is on assisting students to see relationships between what they are asked to learn in school and  their future careers. Specific examples are given of techniques the language arts teacher can use to help children learn about the future. (AA)",

Analysis of results indicated a clear pattern in which education is positively related to the use of print media which in turn is positively related to knowledge of public affairs. In the same way, the frequent meeting attender (who is also a high print consumer) is highly educated and highly knowledgeable about public affairs. The more educated older person goes out more often to visit friends, which is also associated with higher public affairs knowledge. Television, radio, movie,  and phone use have little to do with level of education or with public affairs knowledge. Education, income, and race were important antecedent variables in this study, with age and sex showing no significant relationships with them.

Although voters were interested in the campaign (particularly as it came to an end), they rarely engaged in political activities other than discussing politics and voting. Political activities measured included door-to-door campaigning, working for a candidate, contributing money, wearing a button or displaying a sticker, writing or phoning on behalf of a candidate, and attending a political rally. Voters were assessed on the basis of degree of use of television and newspaper as high-TV/high-newspaper users, high-TV/low-newspaper users, low-TV/high-newspaper users, and low-TV/low-newspaper users. The majority of voters reported high  usage of both media, and those who made greatest use of these news media were more likely to engage in other political activities. These findings added support to the idea that use of mass media during a campaign is a form of political behavior. (Author/KS)",

Essential areas of study in such a course (vocabulary, grammar, translation, and to some extent, environmental exposure) can be programmed on a computer. In fact, a computer supplies the perfect tool for instruction because it can be constantly changed to accommodate new information. Further, a computer-aided approach eliminates the need for a strictly controlled classroom setting and provides the opportunity for extending the university-without-walls concept. Although a 2741 teletype terminal linked to an IBM 360-50 proved useful for a course in Black English at the University of California at Riverside, different computer systems and  languages (such as PLATO) may be more efficient for other instructional situations.

        "description":"After reviewing previous research on communication in organizations, the Organizational Communication Division of the International Communication Association (ICA) decided, in 1971, to develop its own measurement system, the ICA Communication Audit. Rigorous pilot-testing, refinement, standardization, and application would allow the construction of a normed, computerized data bank, which could be used both for comparisons between organizations and to test organizational communication theories. Phase 1, the development of audit procedures and instruments, lasted three and one-half years and involved 163 researchers and practitioners from six countries. Phase 2, the pilot-testing of the procedures and instruments, lasted two years, included ten pilot tests, and resulted in revised  instruments and procedures, organizational structure for the audit, and a plan for disseminating results and information. Phase 3, the implementation of audit procedures, is now underway and offers researchers the advantages of externally valid findings derived from a commonly employed methodology. (AA)",

All of the selections were written by participants in the dialogs. The task of the dialog sessions was to build an understanding of the specific implications of an emerging right-to-communicate policy in Hawaii. This document contains a discussion of the dialog topic and descriptive reports of each of the sessions held, with lists of key persons, of participating organizations, and of policy issues. Some of the policy issues discussed are as follows: Are students and new immigrants taught adequate formal communication skills in schools? How can community groups and individuals gain access to the  news media? How can a community maintain its cultural diversity and pluralism through development of communication rights? How can people be motivated to provide more citizen input at state and local government hearings? (JM)",

Competency-based education may help to establish standards of behavior which are objectively measurable, but the fact that this approach is often implemented for political rather than educational reasons demands that caution be exercised in accepting this method. Similarly, educational innovations in materials, methods, and concepts are often made on the basis of persuasive arguments rather than on empirical evidence of their worth. Evaluation of the academic preparation of teachers should gauge not only knowledge of methods of instruction but also attainment of skills in the specific content area. Prospective teachers should learn also that theories  are speculations, not facts; the encouragement of varied viewpoints is essential. Finally, the areas of decision making and control in teacher education must be clarified. (KS)",

In the second experiment, 54 kindergarten subjects and 60 fifth-grade subjects were each administered a double motor (a motor response followed by a second motor response), a double vocal (\"Go,\"\"Go\"), and a combined vocal-motor reaction-time task. The results indicated that when two overt responses are combined, the initial response is somewhat inhibited, but that there is nothing unique about the vocal response in this process: the latency of the initial response was the same whether it was followed by a vocalization or by a second motor response.  Further, by the age of four, there was no difference between the ability to combine two motor responses and the ability to combine a motor response and a vocal response. (Author/AA)",

Two interpreters, one male and one female, each performed six monologues, three of which were feminine and three of which were masculine in nature. The audience consisted of 275 undergraduate members of a communication arts and sciences class at Queens College in New York City. Each of 12 randomly selected groups drawn from this audience pool viewed one videotaped interpretation of a dramatic monologue. Analysis of data revealed that a significant interaction effect existed between sex of interpreter and sex of dramatic character depicted, with regard to subject  ratings of performer effectiveness. Similarly, audience comprehension of the passages varied on the basis of the sex of the dramatic character portrayed. (Author/KS)",

The author argues that, because unintentional moral training takes place in all schools through their &quot;hidden curriculum,&quot; schools should develop a deliberate and systematic approach to moral education. The booklet is organized into three major sections. Section 1 presents a brief case study of the West Virginia textbook controversy and points out the difficulties that public controversies over evolution, sexism, and racism create for textbook selection. Section 2 discusses the background and rationale for moral education and reviews  some representative literature on the topic. Section 3 examines different approaches to designing a moral education program, focusing mainly on Kohlberg's moral development model and on various criticisms of Kohlberg's approach. (JG)",

An alternative is the Citizen/Teacher Curriculum Council (C/TCC) approach, which calls for direct involvement of community members and classroom teachers in curriculum development. The C/TCC would function in an advisory capacity to the school district's program specialists, administrators, and school board; in turn, academic specialists and curriculum developers would counsel the C/TCC on technical matters. To ensure a minimum level of qualifications for C/TCC members, the school district should develop appropriate training programs in curriculum development. Because of the differing background and training of  council members, separate training programs for professional and lay members of the C/TCC would be advisable. While the C/TCC model emphasizes direct teacher and citizen participation in curriculum development, it is not meant to exclude administrators. Rather, the structure of the C/TCC process should guarantee the interaction of administrators, teachers, community members, and specialist consultants. (Author/JG)",

The study was an effort to develop and implement evaluation techniques for determining what educational practices affect student behavior and what costs are associated with those practices. Overall purpose of the 1974-75 study was to continue development of the analytical techniques reflected in the cost-effectiveness model that was employed in the 1973-74 Michigan Cost-Effectiveness Study. A critical part of this continued development was an attempt to cross-validate the variables identified in the 1973-74 study. In addition, the 1974-75 study also sought to identify new variables related to student achievement and to investigate the relationships between achievement and  various identified variables. Data for the study were collected from 25 Michigan school districts with highly successful compensatory education reading programs and 25 districts with highly unsuccessful programs. Within each of these districts, the highest and lowest achieving buildings were selected for study. The study focused on only those educational variables subject to control by the schools and did not examine variables such as race or socioeconomic status. (Author/JG)",

In addition to the negative impact of suspension on students, districts lose some state financial aid when students are not in school because they have been suspended. A continuing assessment of suspensions in Richland County School District No. 1 has occurred in the last few years primarily because of the differential application of suspension on black and white students. In 1975-76 there were 3.4 suspensions among blacks for every one suspension among whites. This represents only a fractional reduction from the previous year (1974-75) when the ratio was 3.6 black suspensions to one white. The report contains basic data over a two-year  period on seven high schools, two junior high schools, and nine middle schools. The name of the school, number of suspensions by grade, number of suspensions by race, and number of suspension days are listed for all the schools.

The evaluation requires information that enables individuals to identify the crucial areas and components of competence that are necessary for each principal to adequately perform his tasks; to design and implement inservice educational programs based on a needs assessment approach; to identify the areas of congruence shown as a result of the similar role expectations expressed both by the principal and by his subordinates and superordinates; to identify the areas of role conflict where perceptions and expectations  appear to be in direct contradiction; to facilitate role clarification and role definition for all principals by providing feedback to them and those subordinates or superordinates who have either false role expectations or conflicting role expectations; and to provide reliable information about the expected areas of competence required to successfully perform the role of the principal in each school.

Survey data were gathered from questionnaires completed by all secondary school principals in Vancouver, as well as from written comments submitted by six school board coordinators and three assistant superintendents. At the time of the survey, 12 of Vancouver's 18 secondary schools used semestering in at least some courses. The five main concerns expressed by survey respondents were (1) that semestering provide sufficient flexibility for students' course selections, (2) that there be continuity of instruction within a semester, (3) that courses be modified to fit into a  five-month semester, (4) that there be continuity of instruction between semesters, and (5) that attention be paid to the increased pressure of semestering on administrators, counselors, and teachers.

Initial analysis had predicted that a shift to statewide taxation would result in greater educational resources at a lower tax cost for lower income families and fewer resources at a higher tax cost for wealthier families. However, this analysis overlooked the role of nonresidential property values in the tax base. This paper presents simulation results for California school districts of three alternatives: statewide property taxation, district power equalizing property taxation, and statewide income taxation for education. The results show that any alternative for taxation has the result of most families being &quot;better off.&quot; Property tax proposals shift  the costs of education to industrial and commercial land uses, and the income tax alternative shifts the costs among families.

This new role has generally been referred to as that of a disseminator of research results. In actuality, it would go beyond the role of an informal/formal disseminator. The requirements for skills in research/evaluation methodology are apparent, as is the ability to develop and direct formal in-service training programs and to prepare appropriate dissemination documents that would present research findings in an easy-to-read and concise format. With these new responsibilities, the instructional supervisor would indeed assume the role of an instructional leader in the school division. Another important result of assuming these new roles would be the bridging of the gap between the educational  researchers and the practitioners. Bridging this gap is the key to a more effective relationship between the educational researcher and the practitioner and is considered a most necessary step in attempting to achieve the real goal of education--the best possible educational experience for today's youth.

These four governing systems are (1) hierarchy (control by professionals), (2) bargaining (control by competing elites), (3) polyarchy (control by nonelites), and (4) price (control by consumers). Attention is given to the particular decision-making arrangements employed in each model and to the conditions that have made these arrangements successful or unsuccessful in producing decisions responsive to the interests of the public being served.

Respondents were divided into four categories based on their response to the materials, ranging from group A, individuals who chose to discontinue contact with MDAP, to group D, individuals who indicated the greatest interest in MDAP. Phone interviews were conducted with a random sample of individuals from each group and the resulting data were analyzed to determine similarities and differences between the early dropout group and the three more tenacious groups. It was  hypothesized that individuals with limited previous experience with institutional change would be less responsive to MDAP than individuals with extensive previous involvement. However, individuals across all four groups reported extensive previous involvement, and members of group A differed little from members of group D in this respect. (Author/JG)",

Hypothesis for this study is that the distribution of the linker-stabilizer behavior characteristic has a general base in terms of technically trained personnel and is not unique to a select population. Comparison of responses to a survey questionnaire administered to a sample of 1,128 naval civil engineering officers and a similar questionnaire administered to a sample of 1,598 federal government civil engineers indicates that commonality of technical training is a more dominant factor than the  decision to be a naval officer or a government employee. The appendix contains copies of both survey questionnaires, as well as a series of histograms and tables comparing questionnaire responses for each of the populations studied. (JG)",

The authors first describe the organization of the technology transfer program and then attempt to evaluate its effectiveness over the three-year period 1972-74. In order to improve the accuracy of cost/benefit comparisons, a &quot;benefit evaluation decision model&quot; was developed. The authors discuss the design and use of this model and then apply it to the analysis of data for fiscal year 1974. This analysis of the technology transfer and utilization program shows that it produced $2.72 in benefits for each dollar spent. (Author/JG)",

The JPC project is intended to provide sustained interaction between the Philadelphia School District and the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. During 1975-76, 102 joint programs involving 354 teachers and 5,284 students from 66 public and 60 parochial schools were in operation. Data for the evaluation were gathered through onsite observation of joint programs, as well as separate questionnaires completed by a sample of principals, teachers, and students. Evaluators found that most JPC participants were satisfied with their program activities and credited the project with improving communications between  public and parochial schools. Although the survey showed no significant change in student attitudes, teachers and students reported that intersystem social relationships were established and progressed throughout the year. Sample copies of the observational report form and the survey questionnaires are included in the appendix. (Author/JG)",

CBI programs should be developed by a cross-sectional approach to specify valid competencies, and the program should assume responsibility for providing experiences through which students can gain specified competencies. Professors in CBI programs need to develop a repertoire of approaches to teaching and learning and see themselves as instruments for  learning. (MLF)",

Increased attention to student rights and concern for civil liberties have contributed to closer examination of suspension and expulsion in particular. School districts and state education agencies all over the country are revamping discipline policies to provide for more alternatives to these two disciplinary measures. Good inschool suspension programs offer educational alternatives, not merely other forms of discipline. Alternative inschool suspension programs are frequently housed in separate buildings with a complete education program tailored to the individual needs of the students. This paper surveys national  trends in alternatives to suspension and expulsion, as well as state and district policy changes. The positions of some professional associations (such as the National Education Association and the National Association of Secondary School Principals) toward these two controversial disciplinary measures are also presented.

For complex analysis, SYMAP can generate maps based on census data, which can be used by educational planners in conjunction with geographic origin maps to determine  the best location for future college facilities within the college's overall service area.

Most of the data for the study were collected in experiments conducted with four different groups of students at the University of Goteborg over a period of three academic years. Based on an analysis of data from all the experiments, the author concludes that although it is easy to influence the orientation of a student's attention toward the superficial structure of a text, it is far more difficult to influence a student's cognitive  attitude, that is, the way he or she defines a learning situation.

        "author":["Rubin, Larry"],
        "description":"This paper attempts to explain the educational and legal implications of New Jersey's 1975 Public Education Act, which was designed to meet the New Jersey Supreme Court's mandate in the landmark case of Robinson v. Cahill. Because the state constitution requires establishment of a &quot;thorough and efficient&quot; educational system, the court ruled that each child must receive an adequate, as well as equal, education. The 1975 act considerably modified the state's educational system in response to that requirement. This paper summarizes the portion of the act that creates the foundation for operation of the state's educational system, as well as the Administrative Code designed by the State Board of Education to amplify that legislative foundation. Separate sections of the paper discuss  the process-oriented philosophy of education that underlies the Administrative Code, the limitations of the process approach, the necessity for statewide minimum competencies as part of the process approach, and the role of the teaching profession in New Jersey's new educational system.

        "description":"This paper reports on part of a longitudinal study of the interaction between labor relations and governance in one suburban school system. It focuses on the all-important relationship between the school board and the superintendent in an Illinois school district. When dissension between these two parties occurs, it is possible for teachers to bargain with both, playing one management faction against the other in contract negotiations. Thus arises a kind of three-way (multilateral) bargaining process, with the superintendent caught in the middle. Two dimensions (consensus and the degree of vulnerability in the governance structure) are most relevant to the interaction between collective bargaining and governance. The combination of these dimensions yields conflict, in varying  degrees. For example, high vulnerability and low consensus mean high persistent conflict. The concepts used in this case study are useful for studying the whole school governance process. (Author/DS)",

The first three chapters cover an introduction to protective services, the definition and major elements of service systems, and methodology of the study (including background of the research project, general objectives, research  design, evaluation criteria, and limitations). Two chapters report on the findings regarding each site in terms of its relationship to collateral systems, systems operations, and observed problems. Provided in a final chapter are a discussion of the similarities and differences between the two systems in terms of system structure, a comparative evaluation of the systems' functions, a summary of major insights, and a presentation of recommendations (such as that intake into the mandated protective service system be provided on a 24-hour basis).

The proceedings are one of an interrelated group of products for each year of studies, which includes a volume of research reports, training videotapes, and a videotape record of the conferences. Explored during the first, Theories of Emotional Disturbance Conference, were the convergences and divergences of the following: (1) biogenic theories, (2) learning and behavioral theories, (3) psychoanalytic and psychodynamic theories, (4) sociological theories, (5) ecological theories, and (6) countertheories. In the second, Intervention Strategies Conference, interventions  suggested by the above theories were explored and innovative programs employing these interventions were discussed. Experts at the third, Service Delivery Systems Conference, examined the following delivery systems which had been studied: (1) mental health, (2) education, (3) corrections, (4) social welfare services, (5) religious welfare services, and (6) counterinstitutions. The fourth, fifth, and sixth were futures conferences which attempted to predict and make recommendations for future directions in the field of child variance. The fourth, focused on Child Care in a Strained Society, made such recommendations as the elimination of labeling and classification and consciousness raising among professionals. Schools, Melting Pot, and Differences was the title of the fifth conference,  which covered such issues as school dropout rates and cultural deprivation. The sixth, Who Cares for America's Children, made such recommendations as shifting emphasis from helping troubled children to rearing healthy children who are resistant to damage. Names and affiliations of the participants are included and a list of 34 videotapes is appended. (IM)",

The role of both \"traditional\" and \"less traditional\" medicine is reviewed, including the role of nursing, physical effects, prevention, developmental effects, and the interface of medicine with other social and cultural issues relating to child abuse and neglect. The legal review covers criminal laws, reporting statutes, neglect statutes, jurisdiction, the relationship of law and other disciplines, and parents' and children's rights.  The social work perspective provides a definition of neglect and discusses influences contributory to neglect, early warning signals, and sequelae.

A section on the methods and procedures used in the study includes information on the Ss (participants from a residential classroom), apparatus (a cassette tape recorder for recording researchers' observations), lighting (either general illumination alone or both general  illumination and tract lighting), color (including \"hot\" and \"cold\" colors), space density (ranging from 500-400 square feet), procedure (which entailed the manipulation of four environmental conditions), and the recording of two types of behavior (on-task behavior and ambient-task movements). Among the effects reported from manipulating color, space, lighting, and space-color were that ambient behavior associated with hyperactivity was not increased by color change and that space reduction resulted in increased on-task behavior.

Program activities (such as conferences with employers) and the needed professional personnel (such as a school psychologist) are outlined for each of the following areas: teacher aide training; vocational experiences in health care, food services, laundry, occupational therapy, and grounds maintenance; work as garage attendants; and the provision of positive feedback for students' program performance. Cases and comments of several students in the program are provided to illustrate the positive effects of the project. The project evaluation is noted to reveal that positive feedback was  transmitted to the students; that parents reported personal growth in their son or daughter; and that 11 students showed positive and generally substantial growth in their behavior patterns. Also covered are critical aspects of the project (such as providing students with pre-job training when possible) and some of the unanticipated program outcomes (which included the support and help received from the community).

To assess parental attitudes, the Parent Attitude Survey was administered to parents at 6-month intervals. Preliminary data showed that there was a significant change in the parents' attitudes about the importance of their role in actively helping their handicapped child at home. During the weekly group sessions, each mother-child pair was observed to obtain information on mother-child interactions. Among the findings were that there was a lack of negative behaviors in the  samples recorded and that the mothers of the more severely retarded children showed the most positive mothering. Findings suggested that there are ways of measuring change in parental attitudes and behaviors following involvement in an early intervention project. (SB)",

Sections focus on the following topics: the Southeastern region's need for a high school hearing impaired program, the impact of the state invitation to develop such a program, the follow through of local and regional acceptance and program design, the Taunton High School program, program evaluation, and program cost efficiency. It is reported that the program has resulted in the specification and accomplishment of such goals as mainstreaming each handicapped student, whenever possible, into regular school and classroom activities. Noted is the active participation of enrolled students,  their parents, their resource teacher, and their building administrator in a critique of program effectiveness. Stressed is the linkage relationship of the program with a preschool program serving hearing impaired children within the region. It is concluded that multi-faceted evaluation has determined the program to be a productive and cost efficient operation which is to be continued and expanded.

Thirty-three students (approximately 25%) with potential to use the standard telephone were tested in the areas of hearing discrimination, average hearing level, frequency range of hearing, speaking ability, and English skills; and were enrolled in a third special  course. These students were taught (1) to analyze their problems on the telephone; (2) to overcome those problems with six specific strategies such as asking for repetition of information and spelling of names; and (3) to gain confidence through use of the strategies in telephone practice with strangers. By the end of the course, 15% of the students were able to communicate using one or two strategies, 73% by adding one or two more strategies, and 12% relied on all six strategies. (IM)",

Drills and repetition of patterned phrases do not, in and of themselves, lead to real language use. We should begin giving students opportunities to use language in unrehearsed, unstructured situations much earlier than we currently do. The focus should be from communicative competence to linguistic competence, not vice versa. A research project revealed that a group of beginning French students who had been given systematic opportunities for creative use of French in a variety of unrehearsed settings far outperformed the control group in tests designed to evaluate communicative competence. A cultural context can be  simulated to give authenticity to language learning and bring about emotional involvement on the part of the students. Games are as yet a relatively unexploited means for generating spontaneous language transactions. \"Mais vous etes ma femme!\" is an example which meets all criteria for a good language game. The primary concern of the language teacher must be authenticity in the classroom. Grammatical exercises and drills are most effective following, not preceding, the opportunity for free use of language. (CFM)",

        "description":"This paper is one of a number of studies within the conceptual framework of natural phonology, according to which phonological processes are of two kinds, context-free and context-sensitive. Context-free changes can be explained by the character of the sounds themselves; context-sensitive processes are explained largely by the function of the actual processes and by the character of the sounds affected by them. This paper investigates the operation of complete consonantal assimilations within this framework. Complete assimilation results in the complete identity of the two sounds involved. Evidence from English casual speech is offered supporting the principle claiming that complete assimilations normally occur only when the segments involved are already very similar. Sandhi  phenomena in Arabic and Yakut are shown to support this principle. Latin assimilations and Finnish consonant gradation are considered. The following points are emphasized: (1) Complete assimilations normally affect sounds already very similar; (2) If relatively different sounds assimilate completely, so will less different sounds - assimilations operate hierarchically; (3) Nonphonological conditions can play a role in triggering assimilatory processes.

The principle discovered and defended is: A sentence, or part of a sentence, once subject to subdivision, may not be further subdivided by a foregrounding operation.

        "description":"Following reading and listening tasks, adult long-term memory is high in semantic information and low in syntactic and lexical information. Comprehension during reading and listening must depend to some extent, however, on short term retention of linguistic information that is less abstract and shares more features of the input than the semantic products of comprehension observed in long-term memory. This paper describes a study focussing on short-term memory for discourse, with three basic issues: (1) the role of linguistically marked units in recallability of words just read, (2) information organization schemes as opposed to short-term memory handling of information, and (3) oral vs. silent reading. Thirty-two third and fourth graders from an urban parochial school in a white  working class neighborhood were divided into two different skill levels determined by scores from the Metropolitan Achievement Test. Both simple and difficult reading tasks were given. The overall results support a model of reading comprehension skill emphasizing short-term memory quantitative differences in memory function during reading. The fact that differences were found between the groups in listening, silent reading and oral reading but not in probe digit performance suggests that differences in language memory functions are not wholly dependent on decoding or simple short-term memory capacity.

        "description":"The total teacher-training program must take into account the needs of the teacher as well as realistic expectations as to further training, school facilities, hours to be taught, etc. Within this context, the methodology course will illustrate and synthesize the general aims of the training, as well as providing specific training in technical skills appropriate to the subject to be taught. Teacher training must relate theory to specific situations. To do this the trainer must have experience with the institutions the trainee is being prepared for. In addition, it is desirable to involve the trainee in planning the training course. A suggested methodology scheme for EFL teachers in a secondary-school setting includes twenty major components (various language skills, testing,  materials, etc.) against which seven possible areas of overlap are noted: history, sociology, philosophy, linguistics, psychology, statistics, and resources. The scheme includes an initial theoretical framework, followed by specific illustrations, and finally a number of general points by way of summary. The emphasis throughout the training should be on various forms of small-group activity, and cooperative student effort, with a minimum amount of lecturing on the part of the trainer. (AM)",

        "description":"English is now the leading foreign language in Croatia. Within the framework of a general reform of the Yugoslavian education system, between 1972 and 1975, a particular attempt has been made to reform the ELT program in the four-year secondary-school cycle. One important distinction to be made was that of the differing needs of students in the technical program and those in the humanistic program. Therefore, performance objectives were to be set for English for Special Purposes, and for English for General Communicative Purposes. Curriculum reform was to be carried out in the areas of: syllabus design; textbook rewriting and adoption of new materials; the multi-media approach; individualized instruction; and teacher training courses. Teachers have enjoyed full participation in  decision-making, and student motivation has been taken into account throughout the period. The Croatian Education Department has also included outside groups in its planning. Experimental materials have been developed for use with radio, television, and documentary series. The possibility is being examined of Croatian publishing houses producing modular materials for use in Croatian secondary schools. In addition, non-Yugoslav expertise has been invited in the form of workshops, consultations, etc. Although many problems remain, it is felt that the reform represents a break from a structuralist to a pragmatic and eclectic approach, and that further progress can only be made with experience.

        "author":["Johnson, Keith"],
        "description":"The notion of a functional syllabus has received widespread attention in recent years, so much so that in many cases it is being used where it is not suitable. One question is to what extent the functional syllabus may provide a framework for learning language structure, as it is difficult to impose any kind of structural organization on a functional syllabus. Where this is important, as in beginner courses, a functional design might better be avoided. A grammatical approach at the elementary level, followed by a functional approach at an advanced level, may be the best solution. A recommended approach is one that proposes gradual, small-scale development of functional materials to be integrated as part of already-existing programs. One example of how a functional component may  be so integrated can be found in the third- and fourth-year program of Croatian secondary schools, where a specialized program is in use, but a common-core syllabus represents areas of common needs irrespective of specialization. A functional component integrated in the common-core syllabus could use theme-specific materials of the source texts as a starting point for a wide range of topics, and could be expected to help develop communication ability in everyday conversational interactions.

        "description":"American Sign Language (ASL) is historically related to French Sign Language (FSL) of the early 19th century. A study underway at Gallaudet College is researching the historical development of both languages treating syntax, lexicon and formation. This paper deals with data in the form of still photos collected in France and published in a dictionary by Pierre Oleron. Comparison is made of formational differences between modern FSL and modern ASL signs. Differences are discussed in terms of fluidity in compounds and differences in locations, movements and handshapes. Some differences relate to historical change processes in ASL: variations in fluidity of compounds; centralization; elbow-to-hand shift; morphological preservation; compensatory lengthening; simplification of  movement; assimilation of movement; rule of thumb; loss of handshape; assimilation of handshape, and G-to-H change. Other variations may be products of early creolization of FSL and ASL: movement metathesis; maximal differentiation of movement; metathesis of handshape and maximal differentiation of handshape. When there is a relation of historical change between signs of FSL and ASL, the FSL sign usually has an older form. Relationships between FSL and ASL are highly systematic and similar to historical relationships among oral languages. (CHK)",

English as a second language has traditionally been ignored by English departments, and second language teaching in general has received little attention in language departments because of the emphasis on literary studies. ESL and EFL have emerged under the aegis of linguists interested in language acquisition, and have traditionally been directed at foreign students, while neglecting segments of the American population that are proficient in other languages or are in need of instruction in English as a second dialect. Psycholinguistics has contributed to alter this situation by attempting to understand the learning process. Sociolinguistic studies have contributed by: (1) examining what  elements of culture and what cultural patterns are necessary to facilitate the communication process between different cultural groups, (2) defining the study and the awareness of the language teaching process, and (3) studying motivation and language attitudes.

The problems encountered in classes taught by untrained amateurs are discussed, and the strategies of the professional teacher are outlined. She or he begins by finding out who the students are, what they need to know, and how they will have to use English. In this way, contexts that have meaning for the student can be provided. The language is to be taught as it is used in society and not in an artificial manner. Specific ways of getting at real language usage are described. The need for order in teaching is stressed, as opposed to a \"bits and pieces\" approach. Teaching language also involves the teaching of culture. This entails an awareness of the students' cultural background in order not to force  some aspects of American culture on them too quickly. The professional language teacher should also be capable of effectively evaluating textbooks and teaching materials. (CLK)",

Fifty-seven calls were placed at different times during the day over a period of several weeks. The sentences used to elicit responses and the number of utterances per call were noted. All utterances were judged to be grammatical, for the most part elliptical constructions or abridged sentences. In all of the calls, the person called spoke first. In terms of the rules governing responses and relationships, the telephone appears to work as a control over those using it. Upon a summons, one must pick up the phone and speak. The answerer pauses to allow the  caller to provide the topic, and alternative question-answer pairs follow. The person called does not inquire the caller's name or his reasons for calling, and his answers do not digress from the topic. Brevity, relevance, politeness, and clarity prevail, and in the case that politeness and clarity conflict, the latter takes precedence. (CLK)",

The traditional definition of the paraprofessional is a non-certified aide, usually a student with little or no instruction in how to tutor ESL students, who helps with oral reading problems and specific language problems. A new kind of paraprofessional is emerging, however: certified teachers with a Master's Degree in English, Linguisitcs, language studies, or English as a Second Language, who may be responsible for running class sessions. This involves not only correcting homework, but planning class sessions, testing, and grading. Regular paraprofessionals and M.A. paraprofessionals do have one thing in common, however: their rate of pay. The term  paraprofessional does not always refer to the education, training or ability of a given assistant, but it can be seen as a category specifying salaries. This paper constitutes a plea for professional benefits and recognition, also in terms of earnings, for those paraprofessionals holding Master's degrees. (CLK)",

The responses of 113 students from 20 different countries, speaking twenty-four languages, were compared with those of thirty-five American students having English as their first language. The course consisted of readings in poetry, drama, and short stories, accompanied by discussion and written analyses. Reading selections were from the recent past, so that they would be modern in language and content and related to current life, and yet far enough removed to be seen as a pattern and examined as such. Both multiple choice tests and essays were used for evaluation purposes. Tapes and films were also used to supplement instruction. It was  found that students enjoyed the course and felt stimulated to read more. Students suggested having more discussion and student participation in the choice of test materials. Test scores indicated that reasoning and writing in English were the most difficult tasks encountered by non-native speakers. Scores also pointed to the relative importance of a given literary form in a given culture. (CLK)",

One of the most organized forms of speech performance, the lecture functions as a referential monologue and has a necessarily topical focus. Specifically dealt with are the ways in which lecturers introduce new topics, link together topical utterances, and close out episodes. Various transitional tactics are examined as general features of speech that correlate closely with the transitional devices in written communication. The analysis is based on the assumption that connectives are normative features in lecture-type speech acts and that they are rule-governed according to the direction imposed by the speaker on the narrative. The three general rules for maintaining and directing relevance in  speech are: (1) topic continuation, (2) topic recycling, and (3) topic change. The editing rule is at work when the lecturer interrupts himself to redirect the lecture. It is found that smooth transitions are attempted by all lecturers regardless of style differences in performance. Examples are provided in an appendix. (CLK)",

        "description":"In the preparation of a thesaurus for the Language Information Network and Clearinghouse System (LINCS), a number of already existing indexing tools was consulted. Many of these provide important secondary sources of terminology and of term relations, in addition to the primary sources available in original texts. Others are models of thesaurus construction, and some are indexing tools with which the LINCS thesaurus could interface. The discussion of indexing tools, which follows, first treats briefly two models of thesaurus construction (Project LEX and Roget's) which are relevant to LINCS, then discusses in some detail secondary terminology sources, their nature, and the way in which they can be used. Finally, the report considers the question of interface in view of the nature  of several indexing tools in contact with LINCS. An appendix lists core terms in the LINCS collection of language oriented terms, as well as their intersection with another source. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"Improvements in the technology associated with the information sciences will have their primary potential impact on the distribution of costs, information flow level, information availability, and use among information channels. This improvement implied not only a capability to perform a given function, but a lower cost. For example, the trend towards multi-access computers implies cheaper and more accessible processing. In considering storage costs, microfilm appears the most economically feasible for new information systems, although this presents new problems regarding the number of data banks and accessibility. The expansion of the micropublishing field should result in reduced relative costs, which in turn would mean greater availability. Vertical integration of channels  suggest some answers for active subject areas with a high publishing rate and sizable community. The development of low-cost mini-computers has made possible searches by a remote user. Finally, the creation of standard formats and transferable computer programs will allow for tapping other data banks. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"Variability is a term used to cover several types of phenomena in language sound patterns and in phonetic realization of those patterns. Variability refers to the fact that every repetition of an utterance is different, in amplitude, rate of delivery, formant frequencies, fundamental frequency or minor phase relationship changes across the sound spectrum. Articulator movements, muscle contractions and neural signals also vary. The theory of the phoneme was developed to explain the phenomenon of variation, although problems arose in defining the range to be covered and in classifying variations. The sciences of phonetics and phonology diverged, with phonetics dwelling more on factual accuracy and phonology on theory. The two branches are now more compatible, and must be for their  data to match. The emphasis in phonetics has switched from how we speak to what we need to know to speak. Empirical evidence suggests that some constraints and speech variations are intentional. It is clear that major constraints on phonology are provided by the neural processing limitations of the brain and by knowledge of the properties of the speaking apparatus. (CHK)",

The work tries to describe the current state of knowledge concerning socially conditioned language variation in the subcontinent. Each of five major language families contains numerous mutually intelligible and unintelligible dialects. Different dialects of a language may be required for written and spoken use and for different social groups. Bilingualism and multilingualism are common for communication between groups. Language choice is important for education, politics, radio and television. Chapter 2 of this book enumerates criteria used in the taxonomy of language forms, discussing a number of theories of dialect formation from the points of view  of linguistic innovation and diffusion of linguistic change. Chapter 3 surveys literature on classification of South Asian languages. Chapter 4 considers South Asia as a distinct linguistic area and Chapter 5 evaluates literature on South Asian social dialects. Chapter 6 examines linguistic codes encompassing elements from more than one autonomous language. Chapter 7 considers the ways in which the lexicon of South Asian languages and dialects contain elements that structure themselves into concrete systems. (CHK)",

Three major goals were to: (1) investigate the current supply of, and demand for, linguists; (2) study the status of women and minority groups in the profession; and (3) look into potential new areas of employment for linguists. The principal sources of the data were three questionnaires sent to working linguists, graduate students and department and program heads. The report begins with a statistical description of linguists and linguistics students. It goes on to assess: the current and probable future state of the job market, unemployment and underemployment, the mechanics of matching applicants and jobs, and the responses of individuals to these subjects. Linguists who  specialize in uncommonly taught languages are also discussed, followed by respondents' comments on other aspects of graduate training and the job market. The following general conclusions were drawn: (1) the supply of linguists at the doctoral level will continue to exceed demand, and even more so for the master's level; (2) minority representation in the field of linguistics is very small; (3) women linguists appear at a disadvantage professionally when compared to men; and (4) linguists can contribute toward needed basic and advanced materials as well as training in the uncommonly taught languages and area studies. Appendices contain: sample questionnaires; information on the uncommonly taught languages taught at the Foreign Service Institute in Washington, D.C.; a report on the Summer  Institute of Linguistics; a list of tables found in the report; and a bibliography.

Previous studies have been limited, and restricted to consideration of the written language and &quot;literary&quot; speech. The project consists of three phases: the acquisition of recorded texts, transcription and other preliminary processes, and selection and utilization of representative materials for analysis of linguistic structures and pedagogical application. Tape-recorded speech thus constitutes the principal data source, and native Thai speakers served as informants. A subsidiary phase of the project showed that students of Thai made significant gains in passive language abilities after intensive exposure to taped speech examples. A  cassette recorder was used to tape a wide range of Thai, such as formal speeches, official interviewing, media presentations, guided tour commentaries, extemporaneous discussions and conversation. Some findings are briefly indicated, regarding Thai lexical units, modal auxiliaries of the preverbal type, principles organizing placement of noun phrase groups with respect to governing verb phrase units, and phrase/sentence aspects of unit definition. The main part of the paper discusses linking in Thai discourse, from a sociolinguistic view and as related to text environments, reiterative schema and feedback. (CHK)",

Denver School District No. 1. Lau v. Nichols was an action brought by non-English-speaking Chinese-origin students claiming to be denied an education because they could not comprehend the language in which they were being taught. After two appeals, the Supreme Court found in favor of the students under the 1964 Civil Rights Act, without prescribing a specific remedy. However, in Serna v. Portales the Circuit Court required bilingual education as a solution when a &quot;substantial group&quot; is involved. The decision in Aspira v. the N.Y. Board of Education required testing of students in English and their native language to  determine who should receive bilingual education. The Keyes decision specified that students should receive both instruction in English and native-language instruction in other subjects until they are competent in English. It seems clear that school systems must provide non-English-speaking students with special English instruction and that they must give these students an opportunity to learn the other school subjects as well. HEW's Office of Civil Rights has issued guidelines for eliminating illegal educational practices; these involve pupil evaluation and placement in the proper type of language program. (CHK)",

The December 8, 1975 issue of \"Newsweek\" contains several allegations, notably by Mario Pei, castigating linguists for causing the decline in writing ability in the United States. In this paper an attempt is made to refute each of Mario Pei's accusations, citing the published work of various structural and other linguists. It is suggested that the fault for his and the public's misunderstanding of what linguists actually believe about language is partly on both sides. The well-known CCCC paper referred to in the \"Newsweek\" article offers evidence that poorly understood linguistic information results in well-intentioned but misdirected  policy shifts among educators. Linguists have a responsibility to make the results of their research available to society in terms which are accurate and clearly understandable. Their failure to do so has resulted in their being blamed for events not under their control. It is noted that there are some possible real causes for the writing problem mentioned in the \"Newsweek\" article, and the contributions linguists might make to the effort to find a solution are discussed.

The goals of the study are to provide a syntactic description of the points at which switches from Spanish to English and English to Spanish are possible and to assess the extent to which actual behavior conforms to stereotypes represented by acceptability judgements. Use of the quantificational technique of accountable reporting of relative frequencies permits investigation of a wide range of questions, including (1) Do implicational relations exist among syntactic environments such that it can be predicted that a speaker for whom a switch in environment A is possible may also switch in environment B,  but not vice-versa? and (2) Are the constraints on code-switching uniform throughout all populations and in all social situations or are there differences in frequencies and/or implicational hierarchies? The data consist of taped conversations of adults and adolescents collected by bilingual participant-observers in the San Joaquin Valley of California and in South-central Texas. Preliminary findings indicate that differences between speakers are variable rather than categorical but that implicational relationships do exist and that these are related to social phenomena.

The subjects were 279 fourth- and fifth-grade pupils and 18 teachers. A matched guise technique was used to measure both pupils' and teachers' attitudes. Pupil achievement was measured by a relative gain score in reading; reading and English grades; and performance on oral proficiency tests. In general teachers and pupils rated standard English higher than other speech varieties, and attitudes were not changed in  the workshops. Pupil evaluation of standard English over other varieties was positively related to pupil achievement on some measures. Teacher attitudes toward code-switching seemed to have a negative relation to their pupils' relative gains in reading as measured by objective tests and English grades assigned by the teachers.

        "description":"The field of ESL in recent years has drawn much criticism from bilingual educators. This criticism is related to three areas: the former use of ESL in Americanization programs, the role of ESL in legislation providing for transitional bilingual programs, and the failure of the ESL component in certain bilingual programs, due either to the teacher, student, or evaluator factor. Certain recommendations can be made to improve the three areas mentioned. Through individual as well as group effort, pressure can be brought to bear upon school boards and state and federal legislatures to view ESL as the tool to make children bilingual, not as the tool to convert them to monolingual English speakers. In addition, improvements in preparation of evaluators and teachers can be made. Since  ESL is part of bilingual education, the progress of bilingual education as a whole depends on the quality of each of its parts. (Author)",

The project followed a year-long research effort of previous work done in this area of language and medicine, and reflects the discovery of the idea of using cartoons and phonetics together as a means of facilitating communication. The results attained surpassed the expectations. In every instance the doctors using the system understood the responses given to them and it was determined the 95 per cent of the patients understood the questions when spoken by the health care personnel. Thus, the system  should play an invaluable role to quick medical treatment in emergency situations when a language barrier exists between the health care personnel and their patients and a translator is not immediately available.

        "description":"Twenty-four children aged five and twenty-four children aged six were interviewed individually three times during a calendar year. It was found that not only did the children's language develop over the period, as judged syntactically and lexically, but they also showed an increasingly fluent control over their own style. All the children exhibited, however, certain common factors in their linguistic performance which correlated with factors other than their grammatical competence, namely, the presence of certain features in the situation of the interviews. These non-linguistic features were isolated as: the task set for the children; the topic they were asked to discuss; and the conceptualization by the child of the role of the listener. Although largely ignored by research on  child language, situational factors may be very important for assessment, where not only linguistic performance but linguistic competence is concerned. They are important for development theories because where a child uses his best language is a clue as to where language is acquired. Finally, situational effects are important for the design of educational programs because they suggest how we can facilitate the child's talking and his talking in his most advanced language.

The task was a modification of Vygotsky's experiment on concept formation using concrete material. The performance criteria were: time taken to solution, number of moves, and amount of verbalization. The presence of the name of the concept given in feedback speeded the time to solution and reduced the number of moves required. Specific instruction speeded the solution but did not reduce the number of moves, whereas verbalization reduced the number of moves but increased the time of solution.  (Author)",

As background to the project, a survey is included of the increasingly important position of teaching English from the 1940's through the great school reforms of the 50's and 60's. Developments in foreign language teaching in the elementary schools of other countries are reviewed, as well as psycholinguistic and other research which has investigated various aspects of foreign language learning in the elementary grades. The aim of the EPAL project is to make a detailed investigation of the effects of beginning the study of English in the second term of the first grade. The experiment is being conducted in the school district of Vasteras, where an experimental  group and a control group, each consisting of 24 classes, are being compared in various areas from grades one through six. The total amount of instruction time during the first six grades is the same in the experiment as in the regular curriculum for grades 3-6. A number of problems connected with the project have developed into subsidiary projects. These include: pronunciation measurements; systematic classroom observations; foreign language and the immigrant child; and learning to read English. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"A large-scale test development project at the Language Teaching Research Center of the University of Gothenburg aims to develop tests in English as a foreign language for use in various areas of business and public administration. After testing, certificates stating current proficiency level in each of the four language skills (listening, reading, writing and speaking) will be given. Each person's knowledge of the language will be rated on a five-point scale. The project work involves correlation studies of the interrelationship between different parts of the test and between language proficiency and various intelligence factors. In one investigation an English language placement test was administered parallel to a battery of psychological tests covering analogies, opposites,  verbal fluency, spatial ability and Pukort, a Swedish version of the Purdue Creativity Test. Personality tests measuring dominance, deliberateness, sociability, emotionality, flexibility, perseverance, emotional stability and independence were administered. Results show that certain relationships exist between language proficiency measures and personality and psychological variables. This should be considered when assessing foreign language mastery.

        "description":"Language students at the intermediate level can often read and write but cannot speak the target language. This hinders the student from developing what is usually the most sought-after skill: the ability to speak a foreign language. Students in the third and fourth years of language study are capable of speaking as well as they read and write. However, because articulation involves almost simultaneous retrieval of various linguistic elements, students often feel frustrated as they attempt to speak. By analyzing the causes of the frustration, a teacher can enable his or her students to master an exciting new skill. Among the ways in which teachers can induce a class to speak are by: (1) using the foreign language more themselves in order to familiarize a class with the sounds of  the spoken language; (2) emphasizing aspects of pronunciation which are problematic; (3) encouraging the formation of individually constructed sentences through imaginative oral drill sessions which also serve to alleviate fear of grammatical errors; and (4) offering students a variety of programmed exercises according to their abilities so that no student feels that he or she has nothing to say. Examples of several such exercises are included in the text. (Author/CLK)",

Three basic issues are addressed: (1) the identification of an independent, self-supporting student; (2) the determination of how much money is needed to educate such a student; and (3) the delivery system for needed funds. It is recommended that these students be defined in a completely separate category, with the source of his funds for all purposes being the determining identification factor. The offering of partial financial assistance is seen as the most feasible solution for support, and it requires accurate projections of real costs and available resources. Priorities must be established to guide the distribution of funds. Suggestions are offered  for developing budgets. The delivery system issue would be resolved by an option that concentrates funds for education on strictly educational costs in a descending order of priority. The proposed solution calls for utilization of a separate, two-step need analysis involving determination of Basic Opportunity Grant eligibility as well as Supplemental Financial Assistance awarded on the basis of projected yearly income.

Mastery of the cognitive aspects of the course was also assessed. While performance significantly improved on the Behavioral Science part of the National Boards, no change in attitudes was demonstrated. Further study revealed that entering medical students were more negative in their attitudes toward psychiatry than was the general population and that students shared with the psychiatry department faculty a fairly negative view of patients and psychiatrists. A number of factors are proposed as sources of difficulty in promoting a humanistic orientation in  the pre-clinical years. It is suggested that clues to overcoming these difficulties lie in the systematic investigation of physician-patient behavior in a natural setting, such as a doctor's office. By increasing understanding of the day-to-day practice of medicine, the focus of teaching in Behavioral Science can be directed toward those things a physician needs to know. (Author)",

        "description":"Specific issues in counseling are examined from the user's perspective. The book is a collection of issue papers written by students and recent graduates. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the counseling profession and discusses the controversy between educational and therapeutic counseling, the predominance of high school counselors, and the relative ineffectiveness of counselors. The second chapter considers the counseling process itself. Chapter 3 deals with regional and community-based counseling centers as an alternative to the traditional high school counseling system. Minority counseling programs and minority student needs are addressed in Chapter 4, and the fifth chapter describes the information and counseling needs of women. Three primary changes in the counseling  system are identified: (1) the focus of counseling should be client-centered; (2) counselors need to be able to collect and manage the information that prospective students need; and (3) counseling should be moved out of the schools and into the community.

The reasons for this failure have been the lack of consensus among economists about the effects of educational attainment upon the productivity of the economy, and about the distribution of benefits from additional schooling. Recent discussion on these subjects is reviewed. Three sections are presented: (1) a summary of the discussion of the effects on educational attainment of productivity in the light of recent controversies surrounding the aggregate production function; (2) an analysis of  recent writings on the benefits (rates of return) of educational investment and the manner in which these benefits are distributed; and (3) an analysis of the implications of these two topics upon federal policy for education.

What is a possible new perception of higher education financing for New York? The radical shift in enrollment from independent to government-sponsored campuses, and the steep escalation in tax-levy burden for higher education resulted in the New York State system of colleges and universities fiscal disaster. Possible ways of maintaining collegiate access are by fuller utilization of capital facilities and by reforming public policies now on the statute books that are aimed at eliminating family economic circumstances as the sole criterion in a college-bound student's institutional choice. While the state system of higher education is essential to its future cultural and economic  health, it cannot be allowed to become a hindrance to state fiscal recovery. Public policy in higher education must clearly reflect the job to be done and the most cost-effective way of doing it. (Author/KE)",

The new Calendar divides the fall and spring semester into 7-7-3 week modules and the summer semester into two 4-week modules. The Calendar's major purposes are to encourage curriculum innovation and faculty development, attract new learners, and increase alternatives for continuing students. The framework for the Calendar was developed by thirteen special Calendar committees involving over 100 faculty, students, and administrators. The committees dealt with concerns such as budget, faculty development, student progress, faculty responsibility, curriculum, scheduling, administration, public relations, new learners, new students,  academic policies, and evaluation. The new Calendar includes such innovations as self-paced, autotutorial instruction, computer-monitored instruction, programs for adult learners; and programs offered in public libraries that are being primarily funded by base reallocation. In addition, the two-year calendar experiment has incorporated a comprehensive evaluation program that uses national and local instruments to assess changes in students, faculty, and administrators' attitudes about the calendar.

Part I indicates those influences and deals with the State Agency's understanding of the concept of program evaluation from the standpoint of definition, purpose, nature, and process.

Described are factors that need to be considered as planners attempt to better understand the specific context surrounding state support decisions. The kinds of higher education institutions supported in the state, the extent to which other sources provide funding, the differential financial ability of states to furnish support, and the effects of inflation are all influences that need to be examined. Abstracted are a number of key facets of the analysis process as they affect institutional-state relations. For example, some of the tradeoffs concern the level of detail at which  such analysis is conducted and how this relates to management jurisdiction; the choice between using existing data that may be less accurate but more timely and less burdensome for institutions than the collection of new data; the appropriateness of comparative analysis, both between states and within a single state; and the responsibility of researchers in presenting analytic findings and limitations.

The comparison concerns the direct instructional program unit costs produced by the two systems and does not attempt to compare the two systems generally. The specific issue addressed is the effect that different levels of direct cost aggregation have on student program direct unit costs. The summarized NCHEMS/Purdue cost ratios reflect overall similarities in program direct costs per full-time-equivalent student whether costing on an average  cost-per-credit-hour basis by course level (NCHEMS System) or attaching costs to each course and flowing those costs to the programs based upon the program course enrollment (Purdue System).

The criterion of student progress is completion of the baccalaureate within four years after college entry. Baccalaureate completion still stands as a significant indicator of success. The criterion also directs federal concern beyond the initial step of providing equal access to higher education toward the more complex and persistent issue of equalizing educational outcomes. Data for the study comes from the American Council on Education's undergraduate longitudinal file, which consists  of information on students surveyed first at the time they entered college as first-time, full-time freshmen in the fall of 1968, and followed up four years later in the fall of 1972.

All of the written agreements in effect at four-year state colleges, a total of fourteen covering thirty-seven institutions, were analyzed. The \"scope of bargaining\" is defined as the degree to which each written agreement included thirteen subjects traditionally considered in a \"model\" contract. Next, several research questions were posed to examine implicit assumptions held by practitioners and stated in the literature that may contribute to an extended \"scope.\" Results showed that the type of law enacted by a state may influence the \"scope of bargaining\" of a written  agreement. However, the type of organization representing faculty, the composition of the bargaining unit, the use of third-party intervention, and binding arbitration clauses in the agreements failed to significantly affect the content of the written agreements.

Moreover, a great many future possibilities are open to the university once it is realized that its cultural function is not limited to the pursuit of knowledge but encompasses the full range of meaning. On the basis of this analysis, current developments in the university can be interpreted. Teaching and research contribute to both these functions, and this gives rise to an enduring tension in the university. This tension is not likely to be dissolved by the elimination of either the cultural or the institutional  function, nor is the performance of the institutional function likely to be effortless in the foreseeable future. Even though some aspects of this tension will be reduced by the growth of alternate forms of postsecondary education, coping with functional tension, especially in the activities of teaching and research, will continue to be a necessary task for those engaged in university work.

Anthropology is briefly described and compared to sociology and psychology, and some examples of anthropological thinking are given. The possible contribution of anthropological field methods to reducing the conflicts facing institutional researchers is examined. These conflicts include suboptimization, goal conflict, goal displacement, and internal conflict.

This system has been and will continue to be implemented in stages so that effects can be observed and appropriate corrections or modifications can be made. Three major questions concerning the management center system are addressed: (1) how the system was developed, (2) how the system  operates, and (3) what the impact is of introducing the system.

        "description":"Trend-demographic enrollment projections recently have been modified by new assumptions regarding the economic returns of education, the growth of the so-called \"Learning Society,\" and changing patterns of student preference. The net result is that institutions are confronted with a wide range of competing projections of the level of future enrollments. Regional variations, the \"career-orientation\" of many students, differing prospects of different types of institutions, and the timeliness of enrollment data complicate the projection further. Presented are enrollment projection strategies that accommodate both short-term fluctuations and long-term uncertainty. These strategies combine demographic, economic, regional variation, and student-choice variables. They tend to be  probabilistic, frequently revised, and more detailed than efforts in the past. The major goal of these strategies is to enable institutions to make decisions that will maintain institutional options, a necessary outcome under conditions of uncertainty. (Author)",

In the four college years, these students improved their status and their prospects; in spite of a crowded college labor market, they enhanced their competitive position for a better job and stable income. The author suggests that only by understanding more fully the impact of different types of institutions and programs on different types of students and by considering the issue of the match between types of students and types of institutions can we uncover new and promising college effects.

The decline in public confidence in American institutions is also a factor to be considered in educational planning. In planning new delivery systems for postsecondary education, the issue of credentials (licensing and accreditation) will be significant. An agenda for improving postsecondary education is proposed by the director of the National Institute of Education. It includes: (1) revisions in evaluation systems to reward a variety of talents in students; (2) cessation of the use of credit hours generated per faculty FTE as the only measure of educational  productivity; (3) allowance by state agencies for flexible planning by institutions serving adult part-time learners; (4) consideration of alternative uses of educational facilities; (5) attention to the needs of various ethnic groups and social classes; (6) coordination between higher education institutions and noncollegiate institutions; and (7) definitions and effectiveness of degrees themselves.

In 1972, the faculty adopted a new nontraditional educational program primarily for adults, called the Center for Community Education. The purpose of the Center was to offer a variety of innovative programs leading toward the baccalaureate degree. A comparison of values, attitudes, and aspirations shared by the recipients of the nontraditional degrees with the graduates of the traditional program provides insight into the similarities and differences between the groups the College is attempting to serve. This analysis compares the graduates of both traditional and innovative programs regarding their  backgrounds, their motivations for enrolling at the College, and the impact of the degrees on their professional aspirations.

While a substantial body of research on student rating of instruction exists, the ambiguous or actually conflicting results of several of these studies has also led to concern by many professionals about the functional utility of student ratings. Using a sample of nearly 2,000 courses offered at the University, comparisons were made of: (1) correlations between Global Instructor Rating (GRI) and static course and student characteristics; and (2) predictor variables, order, regressions of student and course characteristics on GRI. The study collected  one of the largest and most comprehensive sets of data on the subject of student evaluations of teaching. On the basis of the analysis it appears that, at a minimum, only a rather small portion of the total variance in instructor ratings can be attributed to demographic characteristics over which they have little control.

Dunn court case) in Nashville; (3) the plan being implemented in dealing with the dual system of public higher education in Nashville; (4) the general views of school administrators and state officials with regard to dismantling the dual system; and (5) the success of efforts to dismantle the dual system. It was found that the black colleges were rapidly losing status in the total nationwide educational spectrum and were educating a smaller percentage of college  graduates than a few years ago. It was determined that there was no official plan for dealing with the dual system of public higher education in Nashville, and that school administrators and state officials did not have parallel views on dismantling. Most felt the dual system could not be handled adequately unless all higher education institutions in the state were equally involved. Follow-up studies are recommended. (Author/LBH)",

Under new presidential leadership, the college has just undergone a comprehensive year-long evaluation and planning process designed to redefine its mission, evaluate its programs and practices, and then to plan its future course as it enters its second hundred years. Found are expected tensions in the trade-offs involved between efficient and effective management and democratic governance. The perception of all groups is that \"efficient and effective management\" overshadows \"democratic governance\" at the institution's present state of development. However, since the goal of efficient and effective  management is also held higher than democratic governance by both students and faculty in the \"Should Be\" dimension, and democratic governance is seen as equal in importance to efficient and effective management by administrators, this is an indication that the institution may be accepting the demands of accountability, while at the same time seeking ways to improve the participation of all constituents in governance.

A review of the literature showed that faculty should participate in governance on a shared-authority basis. The study was designed to survey the faculty to see how they perceived the governance of the college. The survey was divided into areas of leadership, motivation, communication, interaction, decision-making, setting goals, and feedback control. Particular recommendations were made in areas that were found deficient. The results of the survey demonstrated that the faculty perceived the governance structure somewhere between the benevolent authoritative and  consultative forms. The ratings, calculated from highest to lowest, were communication, setting goals, interaction, leadership, motivation, feedback controls, and decision-making. The highest rated question concerned the accuracy of upwards communications; the lowest, the level at which decisions were formally made. Specific recommendations were made for each area involved that had serious deficiencies. In general, the recommendations were to make the governance structure or the college more participatory.

        "description":"House Resolution 745 called for disapproval of proposed amendments to the family contribution schedule and regulations of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The amendments were concerned with the expected family contribution in the Basic Opportunity Grant Program. Testimony is presented from representatives of the Office of Education, student financial aid administrators, Educational Testing Service, university administrators, American Council on Education, and others. Difficulties are noted in measuring, on a systematic basis, a family's ability to pay for postsecondary education. Commentary is offered on the OE proposal to make adjustments in the asset reserves for families deriving their income from salaries and wages, and particularly for the recognition that the assets of a  farm or business family are different from those who do not depend upon their property for income generation.

These data were used to compute costs in commercial pricing systems. Charges for peripheral equipment, which are included in the contract fee, were prorated according to the ratio of use of each data base against the total use for all data bases. Estimates were obtained for comparable peripheral equipment, adjusted for percentage of time used, and added to search costs to complete the comparison. Differences in cost  and access to the computer were noted, and it was recommended that the New York State Library remain with the SUNY-BCN system and plan also to join the Lockheed DIALOG system for data bases not available from SUNYBCN. A fee schedule that includes a surcharge for development and refinement of search and retrieval procedures also was recommended. (CH)",

For example, at the State University of New York (SUNY)/Buffalo the allotted 6.25 square feet for each full-time equivalent student provides one seat for every four enrolled students, a workable ratio. The amount of space needed per seat depends on the kind of seating and the arrangement. At SUNY/Buffalo a table seat requires 20 square feet, an open carrel 25, and a lounge seat 30. Closed carrels and closed work spaces require larger spaces. (LS)",

His emphasis was on teaching with books, making them more accessible, and integrating them into the instructional program. Louis Shores expanded on this theme with his idea of a Library-College. This system would provide individualized instruction for students who would be tutored by someone with special subject training and who also could provide bibliographic guidance. Patricia Knapp, in her work on the Montieth Project, developed theoretical bases for library use and cooperative links with faculty which led to improved student library use and skills. More recently Evan Farber developed a program to integrate library instruction  into courses at Earlham College. Using a case study approach and bibliographies of appropriate references, librarians provided lecture-demonstrations to classes in a wide range of subjects. While faculty at many academic institutions regard the library as a separate entity, at Earlham College the library and librarians are integral parts of the college community. (LS)",

A resolution from NCLIS asking CONTU to request that Congress take only interim action on photocopying was found inappropriate for action by CONTU. A representative from the Institute for Computer Sciences and Technology of the National Bureau of Standards presented objectives and areas of study for a project on the interaction of law, economics, and technology in the use of copyrighted materials. Of special interest  was the ownership of material translated into machine or some other code for later retrieval. Another study, done at Indiana University, dealt with library photocopying trends in the academic community and the costs and fees involved. The ad hoc group on photocopying discussed the hazy area between fair use copying and systematic reproduction of copyrighted materials. Future directions and meetings were considered. (LS)",

Dr. John Shaw Billings, who was in charge from 1865 to 1895, greatly influenced the growth of the library and also initiated production of the widely used &quot;Index Catalogue&quot; of author and subject listings as well as the monthly &quot;Index Medicus.&quot; Since then NLM has introduced microfilm (1937), photoduplication (1942), and the mechanization of &quot;Index Medicus&quot; (late 1950's). In 1960 NLM began developing its computerized Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (MEDLARS) to allow bibliography production and rapid data base searches. The MEDLARS photocomposition techniques proved highly successful and cost-effective. The MEDLARS On-Line (MEDLINE)  remote terminal network became a reality in 1971, and now serves 500 institutions nationwide. At present, NLM coordinates a network of 11 regional libraries supported by 125 resource libraries and provides interlibrary loan service for the national medical community. In the future NLM will have to learn to cope with new technology and even larger amounts of material if it wishes to avoid going the way of the dinosaur. (LS)",

In that year, however, in spite of recession and joblessness, the citizens voted a $3 million tax increase for schools. The success of the election may be traced to several factors. Citizens were concerned about the declining quality of education, city leadership was socially and economically progressive, and the school improvement objective was easily understood and acceptable to the citizens. While the support of community leaders was being sought, the elementary schools were doing a self-study preliminary to accreditation. Following a community survey on the tax election, a campaign strategy was developed which featured arranging for a single-issue  election, identifying supporters and getting out the supporting vote, and having ready a last minute media campaign in case it was needed. Educational gains are already being seen in Birmingham since the tax election was passed. (LS)",

The uses of both print and non-print materials are organized according to their instructional setting: classroom, small group, career center, independent study, workshop, and training institute. The materials presented indicate that career education has permeated many aspects of the school curriculum, but that instructional units often are not related clearly to stated educational objectives. The report covers both materials for student use and materials for teacher use. (EMH)",

Some 1,200 of the teachers in 20 out of 44 designated metropolitan areas answered questions about their classroom use of magazines as well as other media. About 70% of all the respondents used magazines in their teaching. Magazines exceeded all other mass media--newpapers, television, films, charts or maps, books, records and tapes--as a teaching supplement. Teachers used the magazines for discussion, encouragement of reading, displays or project resources, homework, individualized work and free time activities. The kinds of magazines favored were related to the teachers' subject areas. Teachers' conceptions of the ideal  magazine were not far afield from the currently available periodicals. (KB)",

No definitive information prescribing the space and equipment needs for using microform or CRT catalogs is available. Experience to date suggests that microfilm and microfiche readers require five square feet of space. The readers have been placed in carrels or on counters in some libraries. The number and placement of electrical outlets and the ambient lighting conditions should be considered in making location decisions. A survey of use activity in a comparable facility can give a library a reasonable  estimate of the number of readers needed. (KB)",

The CAM is a tool for measuring projected capital facilities needs in relation to current capital facilities, in terms of projected day on-campus enrollments. It is composed of space standards for 11 types of space utilized in the community colleges, based on estimated area requirements for each type of space as well as expected utilization of the space. This report evaluates the CAM in terms of three management functions: the planning function, the operations function, and the management review function. Lack of measurable long-range capital  facilities objectives and reliance on short-range enrollment projections are cited as the greatest weaknesses of the planning function. CAM space standards and space utilization standards are compared with actual space utilization and the space and occupancy standards of 21 other states in the operations review. The management review function of the State Board for Community College Education is stated to be limited by the Board's desire to &quot;sell&quot; the CAM as a capital budgeting tool. A summary of recommendations, examples of alternative classroom utilization and seat occupancy rates and potential cost savings, and extensive statistical data for each community college are presented in appendices, as are comments on each recommendation by Washington higher education agencies.

Information on average tuition and the high/low range is organized by state using maps, tables, and graphs. Private and public two-year college tuition is compared for resident and non-resident students, and to total student expenses in a variety of post-secondary institutions. Typical budgets for students residing in a variety of situations are presented. The report concludes that costs are up in all segments of higher education, but that phenomenal growth in costs has occurred at public two-year schools. Tuition and fees at public two-year schools have increased  by 29% over 1975-76 or 130% since 1970-71. Concurrent with increases in tuition and other student costs is an overall decline of 13.9% in the full-time attendance rate and a 20% drop in attendance for dependent youth from families earning less than $15,000 per year. The whole concept of the \"open door\" may be in jeopardy unless the trend toward higher tuition and fees can be resolved. (Author/JDS)",

The most recent inventory of college boards of trustees was conducted in l967 by the Educational Testing Service (ETS), but only 20% of the two-year public and private institutions were included in the study sample. The ETS study found: &quot;In general, trustees are male, in their 50's, white, well educated, and financially well off.... As a group, they personify 'success' in the usual American sense of that word.&quot; It was hypothesized that if the community and junior colleges represent the innovation, opportunity, and freedom they espouse, then the characteristics found for the community college trustee should vary from those in  the ETS study. Forty-two percent of the 323 ACCT member schools were surveyed and 72% responded. The results of this study show the demographic data reported to be aligned with that determined by the ETS study in 1967: 92% of the trustees were white, 85% were male, 90% were married, 59% earned more than $20,000 per year, 74% resided in either urban (34%) or suburban (40%) areas, 69% were Protestants, 39% held postsecondary degrees, and only 7% had no children. Tables comparing ETS data to that obtained in this study and the study survey instrument are included. (JDS)",

Department of Health, Education, and Welfare provided regulations for the implementation of Title IX. This report reviews the implications of these regulations as well as several of the court cases in which discrimination on the basis of sex has been declared unconstitutional. A discussion of problems associated with mandated institutional self-evaluation and advantages and disadvantages of various methods used are included. Effectiveness of such self-studies still requires some time to assess. A brief review of the historical and present situation of women in higher education is presented, and its importance noted as the type of discrimination discussed provided the impetus for adoption of Title  IX. However, Title IX represents departure from similar legislation (Titles IV, VI, and VII) in that sex discrimination is prohibited as opposed to specifying females as a specific target group. Women generally, and particularly in higher education, are still discriminated against. Implementation of Title IX regulations depends on the commitment of institutional chief administrators and the aggressiveness of the women charged with monitoring Title IX stipulations.

The data in this report are predicated on the Biographical Inventory of the Comparative Guidance and Placement Program which was administered to students applying for admission to NYCCC during fall 1975. Approximately 4,498 potential students completed and returned usable inventories. This study had two basic purposes: (1) description and analysis of the characteristics of entry-level students in a multi-campus urban community college, and (2) examination of that population in comparison with a nationwide sample of first-time students enrolled in 100  comprehensive two-year colleges, and in comparison with previous student populations entering NYCCC. A total of 42 student characteristics are described in this report with the data for each measured characteristic reported in an appendix. The socioeconomic backgrounds and career interests of students entering NYCCC clearly differentiate them from students entering four-year colleges and from those who do not attend college. Because NYCCC's student population is rapidly changing, research on the characteristics of its students should be a continuing effort. (JDS)",

The survey was conducted by telephone using work-study students who were trained in the use of the survey instrument. Trial calls were utilized to develop a level of proficiency with the instrument and to reduce the possibility of injecting bias through the  interviewer. The population selected was a 4% sample of all residential telephone numbers from the county telephone directory. The percentage of the sample population reached was 3.4%. Thirty separate analyses of each survey question were performed utilizing the number and percent of respondents who answered each item.

This estimate is based on extrapolation of the \"saturated\" models evident in such states as Florida, Washington, California, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, and New York, where a campus is within commuting distance of 90-95% of the state's population. Major changes in organizational form are not anticipated, although the most prominent form will be the local institution founded and organized by a local governing board and receiving some state assistance. Employee bargaining units and professionalization of management will remove the last vestiges of paternalism. Although the economy controls the job market, the community college will continue in the field of adult education and will attempt to  effect firmer liaisons with proprietary schools. In terms of curricula, short-term, non-sequential, modular courses will gain ground while credit for experience practices will diminish. The current practice of institutions offering similar programs or duplicating services will persist and become an even greater problem. The job of instruction will depart from the present model and more part-timers, para-professionals, and 40-hour-a-week-do-it-all instructors will have their efforts supplemented by a very few full-time faculty.

Educational support requirements include programs which will improve the individual's potential to lead a more worthwhile and independent life as well as those designed to educate and train manpower for service-rendering functions to the aged. The responsibility for providing these educational services must be shared by school boards, community colleges, and universities, although it appears that the community college is the most flexible comprehensive organization capable of acting in concert with school boards and universities. This  dissertation presents a comprehensive plan for educational support services to the aged at Pensacola Junior College in Florida, including: pre-retirement education; continuing education requirements (adult basic education, career education, credit courses, cultural enrichment); manpower training for service to the aged; community service programs; library services; and federal, state, local, and private funding sources.

American higher education is entering a new era in which the community college president may expect intensified pressures in the areas of finance, governance, public confidence, employees' search for security, and governmental control brought about largely by a changing student market. Presidents will face a difficult task in satisfactorily answering the public's questions regarding the value of a college education. Institutional research must become an integral part of the community college in order to present the facts pertinent to the success of the community college. Economic problems, which may affect the \"open door\" philosophy, must be  resolved, and presidential judgment will be required in this regard. As the collective bargaining movement grows, presidents must be prepared to cope with the pressures it implies in all areas of administration. Community college presidents can expect increased levels of governmental regulation, coordination, centralization, and control, with a concomitant increase in emphasis on governmental relations. Their role of influencing policy for educational enactments will also expand. No simple solutions can be equally successfully applied to every community college problem although some actions are suggested herein. (JDS)",

Forty states were surveyed; 87.5% responded. Results of the survey indicate that 26 state community college agencies have a position responsible for equal opportunity/affirmative action, although in 17 of the 26 states, the positions are also responsible for other administrative areas. Establishment of the position resulted from legislative mandate in 5 states, direction of the agency head in 15 states, federal action in 4 states, and executive order  in 2 states. From the survey data, a profile of incumbents in these positions is presented and, although the nature, role and responsibilities of the position vary widely from state to state, the incumbents are categorized as coordinators, administrators, consultants, liaison agents, monitors, and/or facilitators.

It is flexible so that a college can adapt the system to its unique needs in order to obtain consistent information for use in local planning and evaluation. Elements of the system, which can be utilized individually or in combination, include: (1) Student's Educational Intent, (2) Withdrawal Follow-up, (3) Nonreturning Student Follow-up, (4) Graduate  Follow-up, (5) Employer Follow-up, (6) Adult and Continuing Education Follow-up, and (7) State Follow-up Reporting. Among the characteristics of the system are pre-tested procedures and instruments for data collection, flexibility, provision of a mechanism for system evaluation, and structure around the concept of an educational management information system. A statewide Delphi technique study was utilized to obtain consensus on needed system characteristics. Procedures of the Delphi study are described, and the system brochure is appended. (JDS)",

Subjects of the study were 595 ACC students, 257 males and 338 females. Follow-up questionnaires were formulated using standard developmental techniques. Graduating and withdrawing students were exit interviewed by staff personnel and some received an orientation to future follow-up questionnaires. In addition, a sample of the study subjects received the treatment by telephone rather than in person. It was found that graduating and withdrawing students who were exit interviewed and oriented  to future follow-up questionnaires were much more likely to subsequently respond to follow-up questionnaires than students receiving exit interviews and no orientation. It was recommended that exit interviews with orientation to future follow-up contact are worthwhile institutional investments and that questionnaire-type follow-up programs should be conducted to provide current feedback from nonreturning students. Such information can enhance student retention. Questionnaires, related materials, and a bibliography are appended. (JDS)",

In 1975, a computer-generated random sample of 500 students was drawn from a population of 1,256 students who had attended COM in the spring of 1972. A 48% response to a follow-up survey of the sample was achieved. A random subsample of 70 non-respondents was drawn and interviews were conducted with 56 who could be located as a validity check. A similar survey of spring 1973 students conducted in 1976 resulted in a 42% response rate and a random subsample of 78 non-respondents was drawn for interviewing. The total samples and total  populations showed no significant differences on variables of age, sex, and GPA in either year. However, significant differences between mail-respondents and the total sample were found in terms of age and GPA (grade point average) but not sex in the first year, and in terms of GPA in the second year. Consistent differences were also found between mail-respondents and total populations and between the mail-respondents and interview samples. Sampling methods are reviewed, and causes and implications of non-response bias are discussed. Alternative bias correction methods are suggested.

An advisory committee was formed to guide the general organization and design of the system. Three types of questionnaires were tested: a 28-question booklet, a one-page 21-item fill-in-the-blank questionnaire, and a 13-item computer-generated form. Response rates were found to be similar for all. Two hundred eighty-eight 1975 graduates were exit interviewed by telephone (83) or personally (205) to test the  impact of exit interviewing on the response rate to mailed questionnaires; although this seemed time-consuming and nonprofitable overall, as much as a 20% increase in response rate was noted for some groups. Problem areas in the study included questionnaire design, postage expense, identification of certain types of students, and maintenance of voluminous information.

SAC found that a follow-up schedule that included an initial mailing of a cover letter and a questionnaire, followed by a reminder postcard, a second cover letter and questionnaire, and a final strongly worded cover letter and questionnaire, each at ten-day intervals, was an effective means of  conducting a graduate follow-up study. Response rates for the four separate groups studied ranged from 57.9% to 82%.

Findings of the survey are presented in four categories: the college and the community (demographics), community awareness, community attitudes, and educational aspirations. In general, the survey confirmed that the college was serving its constituents effectively. However, there were mixed perceptions of accessibility. Although attitudes were generally positive, there was a feeling that  program quality could be improved, particularly in the transfer area. There was a high level of awareness of the college's presence and community residents looked to the college as a resource and as an agency which should take the lead in providing additional, sometimes innovative, educational programs and services. The potential market in the college's service area was determined to consist of 31.2% of the total service area population.

Respondents to a nationwide survey of 1,493 humanities faculty and 505 non-humanities faculty in 156 two-year colleges were grouped into high, medium, or low satisfaction groups, based on responses to certain questionnaire items which allowed construction of a Satisfaction Index. Among the findings of the study with regard to humanities faculty were: (1) ethnicity and satisfaction seem unrelated, although age is related; (2) sex has little bearing on degree of satisfaction; (3) very little difference exists between full- and part-time faculty relative to satisfaction; and (4) more members of high  satisfaction groups are found in public colleges, fewer in private institutions. Study findings with regard to non-humanities faculty are also reported and discussed. It is suggested that the construct of satisfaction is a function of the person (personality correlate) as much or perhaps to a greater degree than it is a reaction to the work place (situational response).

Subjects of the study were 1,493 two-year college humanities faculty, representing a nationwide sample. Based on responses to specific survey items, respondents were assigned to either high, medium, or low FP groups. Results showed that more people in the high FP group tend to become involved in activities, are more concerned about students and faculty, and are more related.  Statistically significant associations were found between the FP groups and Research Orientation, Curriculum/Instruction, University as a Reference Group, Preference for Further Preparation, Concern for Students, and Concern for the Humanities. For a control group of 505 non-humanities faculty, significant associations pertain to FP and Satisfaction, Research Orientation, Curriculum/Instruction, Concern for Students, and Concern for the Humanities. Because of notable differences between high and low FP groups in certain areas, it is felt that the hypothesis of FP as a basic and almost pervasive personality dimension holds clearly.

The survey was designed to elicit responses in three major areas: the value of an associate degree in the working world, an evaluation of job preparation given to MCC graduates, and suggestions for improvements in individual curricula. Of 339 graduates, 263 were working and 71% gave permission for their employer to be contacted. Sixty-five percent of the employers surveyed responded, including private firms, federal and local government agencies, hospitals, and medical/dental offices. While two-thirds of the employees employed other two-year college graduates, half gave no hiring preference to associate degree holders. However, over  half stated that an associate degree increased chance of promotion and upgraded an employee's position in terms of job tasks and responsibilities. Job preparation was viewed as adequate to more than adequate by a majority of employers. More than 90% of the respondents stated they would hire another MCC graduate with the same degree. Study recommendations focus on the apparent lack of recognition by employers of the associate degree as a certification of a specific skill level.

Responsiveness to community education needs and &quot;open admissions&quot; are posited to be two important aspects of the mission of the community college. To integrate these mission concepts with a rationale for general education, five values of general education are put forth: (1) it enables individuals to integrate their knowledge; (2) it offers opportunity for commitment to lifelong learning; (3) it enables students to intensify the self-actualization process; (4) it enables students to find meaning and value in their life experiences; and (5) it enables students to better understand their places in the world and to  more fully realize their potential. General education is defined as that which has as its fundamental nature and purpose the integration of every student's knowledge, skills, attitudes, and experiences. The goals of general education, expressed in terms of competencies, are listed as are principles for curriculum development.

The newly adopted statement of philosophy and goals emphasizes the community college's role as a community-based institution of lifelong learning. In addition to presenting this new statement, the report details the planning process to be used in updating this plan, reviews the enrollment projections obtained from various agencies, presents a series of proposed state-level policies, and describes the district program and facility plans approved by the Board of Governors for the first year of the plan and tentatively proposed for the last four years. An examination of the master plans for the various community college districts shows that 440 new academic and vocational programs are scheduled for  implementation during 1976-77. The largest relative growth is anticipated in the areas of regional studies, health services, home economics, law, and public affairs and services. The appendices contain the information and documentation utilized in the development of the master plan. Included are enrollment and job opportunity/employment summary projections, extended social forecasts, and discussions of future contingencies likely to have some effect on the community college. Analyses of existing programs and district profile summaries complete the appendices. (JDS)",

The system is designed to provide adequately for state-level decision making and most local decision making needs, as well as to provide a basis for developing analyses for decisions about programs and objectives. The expenditure structure of the system is designed to be compatible with that used by elementary and secondary schools and county school superintendents. The activity structure is designed to be compatible with the Program Classification Structure  developed by the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems (NCHEMS). It provides the district with a base for comparative fiscal analyses, use of new fiscal management tools, and state-level and federal fiscal reporting. The bulk of this document is devoted to extensive presentation and explanation of the system. Appendices include a discussion of accounting principles unique to community college districts; a list of supplies, equipment and capital outlay; stores system procedures, controls, and accounting; accounting terminology; and data processing terminology.

The study was conducted subsequent to an expressed concern that perhaps the college could do more toward recruitment and retention of minority students. Results of an analysis of enrollment and withdrawal data indicated that Mexican-Americans comprised 46.9% of local high school students in fall 1974 but only 30.2% of Reedley students. However, while approximately 8% of non-Mexican-American students withdrew from Reedley in both fall 1974 and spring 1975, only 5% of the Mexican-American students withdrew. Reasons for withdrawal (financial, needed at home, work v. college) were compared across both groups with no significant differences  found. The significantly greater persistence of Mexican-American students is attributed to a combination of effective recruiting, peer advising, financial aid, and other support services provided these students. It is recommended that efforts should continue to reduce all withdrawals, regardless of ethnic origin. Data used in this study and subsequent results of analysis are presented in six tables. (JDS)",

The multimedia lab, operational since 1973, replaced the relatively ineffectual Basic English remedial course. Personalized instruction is the primary characteristic of the laboratory, each student moving at his own pace through ten learning areas according to specified behavioral objectives. CAI plays an integral part, providing nearly instantaneous feedback and additional tutoring, as necessary, to student users. CAI has also been adapted for use with hearing-impaired students. Results of the  multimedia laboratory, in addition to increased levels of competency, include: individualized learning of basic skills at the student's own level of performance, individual review and testing, increased motivation, immediate reinforcement, improved attendance and student involvement, a sequence of instruction, and self-tutoring. A comparative study of students' subsequent freshman composition grades has shown that grades of D and F decreased from 54.02% in pre-lab years to 38.64% since implementation of the lab. (JDS)",

A questionnaire was sent to the chief executive officer of 294 two-year colleges to gather information on degree of need for specific areas of staff development and to elicit respondent opinion on the most desirable sites, times, modes of presentation, and costs of such programs. Of the 207 returns received (70%), only 21 (7%) were unusable. The chi-square test was utilized in the data analysis to determine significant differences on dimensions of type of control and size. Results indicated that the colleges surveyed had definite staff development needs in three areas: needs  related to the unique role of community colleges, needs related to instruction, and needs of administrative staff. Specific needs in these areas are listed and discussed as are findings and conclusions regarding the logistics of staff development programs. Data resulting from the study are presented in extensive tables and figures, and the survey instrument is appended. (JDS)",

Subsequent to acceptance of the contract, a modularized self-paced and self-instructional curriculum was developed, and students were recruited according to specified criteria. Although an abundance of potential trainees was anticipated, a total of only 15 students were selected from 46 applicants. One student withdrew early from the program and 11 of the 12 who completed the  Associate of Science degree program passed all sections of national and state dental hygiene board examinations on their first attempt. Curriculum requirements for the paradental contract program students were the same as those of regularly enrolled students but were compressed into 15 months rather than the traditional 18 months. Analysis of the contractor's performance reveals several problem areas, particularly in the total number of students trained. However, numerous benefits, aside from the success of the students, are noted. Recommendations for future application of this type of program are made. Contract materials are appended. (JDS)",

Objectives of the study were to establish a demographic data base on students who first enrolled in the Fall Quarter of 1970 and in the Fall Quarter of 1971, to identify their educational objectives at time of entry, to obtain student evaluation of the college's instructional and support services, and to determine what happened to students after they left the college. Questionnaires were mailed to 2,765 randomly selected members (25%) of the study populations. Response rates were 17.49% and 15.92% respectively for the 1970 and 1971 subgroups. Results indicated that, at time of enrollment, a &quot;typical&quot; student was a full-time day student, a caucasian male  between 16 and 18 years of age, single, not a veteran, with a high school diploma or GED, and no previous college work. Almost half of the respondents originally planned to transfer to a four-year college, one-third enrolled to take courses for enjoyment, and only 13.8% and 16.2% respectively intended to complete a vocational-technical program. One-third of the respondents stated they did not meet their objective. At least 60% of the 1970 and 1971 enrollees withdrew at some point prior to completing their objective, although one-third later re-enrolled. Several recommendations based on the study findings are made, and the survey instrument and student comments are appended. (JDS)",

From a population of more than 50,000 full- and part-time baccalaureate oriented students enrolled in 14 Chicago-area community colleges, a random sample of 241 was drawn. Subjects were surveyed through use of the personal interview technique. Results of the study indicate that there are four major factors which characterize the transfer institution which community college students select for completion of their baccalaureate degree: (1) the institution must offer the program preferred by the student; (2) the students prefer that it be located close enough that  they can live at home while attending college; (3) students want the transfer institution to have a high academic reputation; and (4) low tuition is an important factor. Demographic characteristics, transfer institutions selected, curriculum choices, and opinions of the sample concerning the University of Illinois campuses are reported. Recommendations are made relative to actions that should be taken by the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle and at Urbana-Champaign. An extensive review of pertinent literature is included in the report. The survey instrument, instructions for the interviewers, and a bibliography are appended. (Author/JDS)",

OCC is organized into four learning clusters, each of 30 full-time and 40 part-time faculty, 1,500 students, and headed by a dean. Each cluster is semi-autonomous; authority is decentralized, faculty/student participation is emphasized, and a humanistic learning environment is encouraged. In the fall of 1973, OCC offered its first Natural Science/Social Science tandem course, an integrated learning approach whereby two instructors in separate disciplines were brought together as an alternative to traditional programs. More complex efforts have followed. A course entitled &quot;1984&quot; was inaugurated in the fall of 1974  as an extension of the tandem approach. Social Science, Natural Science, and Geography were combined into a course meeting 11 hours per week, with the goal of examining a number of elements of contemporary society from biological, sociological, and geographical perspectives. The systems approach is used to present a variety of topics. Evaluation of students is accomplished through examinations and a term project integrating the three disciplines. Student evaluation of faculty is an integral part of the evaluative process. Although time and energy demands are increased, the OCC staff believes in the interdisciplinary approach. (Author/JDS)",

Children were tested for generalization immediately after training, and for retention seven to ten days later. Brief observation of a model was effective in creating significant acquisition and retention of conceptual rule judgments and explanations. Corrective feedback improved the child's ability to explain the conceptual rule but did not assist nonverbal performance. The facilitative influence of  corrective feedback was largely confined to the 4-year-old age group. In general, 4-year-old children were more successful than 3-year-olds in learning to provide viable reasons for conceptual judgments. The pedagogical significance of these findings is discussed.

        "description":"This paper reports a research design guided by the hypothesis that adult constraint and peer cooperation exert conflicting forces on the development of racial awareness attitudes of 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds. Subjects were 60 preschoolers from Tennessee, with an equal number of white and black children at each age. Methodology used was a modified form of Porter's (1971) TV-Story Game. The method involved a doll-play interview during which the child, by doll choices, responded to structured questions set within a story-narrative. Opportunities were also made for the child to verbalize spontaneously to open-ended questions. Dependent variables were: racial awareness, racial attitude, and racial self-identification. Independent variables were: race, age, sex, social class, skin color  shade, contact with children from a different race, region of the country, race of interviewer, presence or absence of social norms, and adult constraint vs peer influence. The rationale for the inclusion of peer influence and adult constraint was derived in part from Piaget's (1965) theory and investigation of the child's moral development. Each dependent and independent variable considered in this study is examined in view of past empirical findings. (JH)",

The present system of continuous data recording allows responses in sequence rather than time to be the units of behavior, thus preserving the actual periodic features of individual behavior and temporal characteristics of interactional exchanges. Recorded are frequency, duration, sequence, inter-response times and simultaneous occurrence of specified maternal and infant behavioral variables. As the infant-mother pair is observed, the behaviors of each continuously qualify as one of  a defined set of possible 2- or 3-digit coded behavior patterns, each composed of combinations of basic behavior categories, definitions of which fill one half of the manual. This system uses the Data-Myte or any similar mechanical event recorder, handheld and connected to a cassette recorder worn on the shoulder, giving the observer complete mobility. The observer records (1) the setting, (2) infant arousal state, (3) maternal proximity, (4) maternal behavior and (5) infant behavior. Each session consists of a feeding, a bath and playtime. The manual includes detailed instructions on equipment and general setup. A sample Interview and Rating Scale Form is included for use in writing up developmental and other background data, as well as for recording measurements of subject performance.  (BF)",

Four approaches were used: (1) having caregivers rate the infants regularly on a small number of rating scales (which the caregivers themselves helped to develop), graphing these ratings bi-weekly and using them in regular staff discussions of the infants. Dimensions covered in the scales were affectivity, persistence, level of attention, sensitivity, activity, quieting and consolability, and initiation of exploration; (2) having caregivers develop and keep up-to-date a checklist charting each infant's progress in reaching various typical  developmental landmarks (listed under five general headings: gross motor, manipulative, perceptual-cognitive, language and social); (3) having caregiver present during intermittent developmental testing of infants she cares for followed by discussion with program director; (4) making selected observations of particular infants and their environmental experience and using these as a basis for discussion with the caregiving staff. Appendices include the scales for rating infant characteristics, rating sheets, and checklist of developmental landmarks. (MS)",

Data from the original sample of 52 infants were included in the later study to make a total sample of 140 clinically normal newborns of over 37 weeks' gestational age. The infants' behaviors were scored on the 27-item Brazelton Scale. The principal component factor analysis of the second study yielded three main factors: attention-orientation, arousal and temperament. Results for the attention-orientation factor showed a significant main effect for birthweight, in that the mean score for the full-weight or  normal group was higher than that for either the low or high groups. With low-weight neonates rated as a high-risk group for later developmental problems, it is hypothesized that a similar potential may exist for high-weight infants of normal gestational age. There were also some sex-birthweight interactions for the arousal and temperament factors, but these data are given a cautious interpretation because of certain characteristics of the sample. (BF)",

The effects of extreme isolation on language and psychological development are emphasized. The importance of early socialization is seen in relation to normal development. Ancient and medieval studies in which children were isolated to discover an instinctive language are described in the text and appendix. Reports of two modern children who were isolated from birth are also presented. In the study described in this paper, 51 cases of child abuse and neglect recently reported in the United Kingdom were examined. In the cases selected for review, isolation was not cited as a major factor, so that its role as a  contributing factor in child abuse could be assessed. Results indicate that, although isolation was not seen as worthy of inclusion in legal charges, it appears to be a significant factor in all stages of case histories. The case of a neglected boy is reconstructed, and developmental damage produced by isolation is discussed. (SB)",

A questionnaire dealing with observable differences in children who had/had not attended playgroups was constructed. Investigated were the effects of playgroups on socialization, motivation, language development, playing, intellectual and emotional development, motor skills,  communicative skills, creative skills, pre-reading skills, aggressiveness, organizational ability, discipline, and other characteristics. Factors considered in choosing the sample were location of the schools (inner cities, urban areas, country districts), nature of housing, and estimated social class of the children. Questionnaires were sent to the selected schools, and upon return 92% were followed up by personal interviews. Results are listed for each questionnaire item.

An historical look at the study of racial attitudes reveals three major research techniques. The first type utilizes pictures, line drawings, or actual photos. The chief drawback of this technique is that it relies heavily on the child's linguistic ability and does not allow the use of unstructured play. A second technique involves the use of puzzles, doll assembly, or picture insets. This method is suitable for measuring racial awareness but not attitudes. A third technique involves doll-play and seems to offer the most promise for future investigators of racial awareness attitudes in young  children. The independent variables shown to be significant which must be considered for future studies are age, race, sex, social class, shade of skin color, contact, region of the country, and race of the interviewer.

It was hypothesized that a home-visitor program directed toward the mother would improve her maternal teaching behavior and have effects on the cognitive functioning of her preschool-aged child. Measuring instruments used in a pre-test and post-test situation were the Stanford-Binet, Form L-M; the DARCEE Concept Test; and in a post-test only design, the Maternal Teaching Style Instrument (MTSI). Positive changes in maternal teaching style were achieved by  experimental group mothers, especially in the area of cue labeling. Significant cognitive gains were achieved by the preschool target children on recognition skills on the DARCEE Concept Test while all other differences were in the predicted direction but statistically insignificant. The limited changes in the target children were attributed to the limited duration of the intervention. (MS/Author)",

        "description":"During the last 15 years, Chicano literature has not only repeated some of the topics of Mexican literature, but has added many more. Similar to Mexican literature, Chicano literature deals with: the pains, trials, and common experiences of childhood; the loss of religion, as traditional Catholicism confronts the changing needs and desires of the Chicano's new realities; the agricultural experience; problems of survival in a hostile society; a search for personal and group identity; and rites of passage and loss of innocence. The first three subjects are original to Chicano authors; the final three, although overlapping with other literatures, are always given a unique setting or solution. Although Chicano writing has not developed the varied themes present in Mexican literature,  its basic and most original theme is that &quot;man's dreams and plans are brutally shattered when they conflict with the established order of society.&quot; Despite this elemental theme of broken ideals, much of Chicano prose is theme-less. Although Mexican writing has been regarded as the most &quot;innovative and demanding in the creation of new literary techniques&quot;, Chicano literature has been particularly adept in the creation of the child narrator. Thus, Chicano literature has achieved significant and lasting interpretation of unique human experiences and a laudable originality that will soon florish into first-rate literature. (Author/NQ)",

        "description":"An In-Camp Learning Program focuses on the specific needs of the out-of-school youth and adult migrant farmworker. Although its primary intent is that of education, other areas such as health and social services are addressed. In 1975, New York's In-Camp Learning Program focused on the assessed and expressed educational needs of approximately 400 migrant farmworkers in 15 camps in the counties of Livingston, Steuben, and Wyoming. Its major goal was to help the migrant master those tools of communication, thinking, and self-direction that best help him to make those decisions critical to his daily and future life. A teaching team consisting of a male and female instructor, a tutor, and a migrant aide served each camp. The program director assisted the professional and tutorial  staffs to develop relevant educational materials, supervised the teaching teams in the camps, and met on an individual or team basis to discuss any needs. The staff was educated as to other programs and agencies to which migrants with special needs could be referred. This guidebook presents general guidelines for developing an In-Camp Learning Program; outlines the 1975 In-Camp Learning Program's basic educational needs, objectives, learning experiences, and evaluative procedures; summarizes the activities conducted by the teaching teams in the various camps; and briefly describes various supportive services and programs.

Such programs should strive to: foster a sense of trust in people and in the environment; develop a positive, confident, worthwhile self-concept; and provide a variety of rich experiences delighting every sensory modality. In order to effectively accomplish these goals, early childhood programs for infants and preschoolers should have two equally important components--an in-school, all-day preschool program and a parent education program. In developing these programs- consideration should be given to: the type of program, who pays, when to begin, how long to  continue, and the effects of the experiences on the child and his family. All programs must then address the concerns related to facilities, staffing, materials, and curriculum objectives. Special concern should be given to the areas of health, nutrition, and a system for tracking the families' movements in the migrant stream by all migrant early childhood education programs. (NQ)",

Using data gathered in a 1973 survey of Mexican American high school sophomores residing in the South Texas towns of Asherton, Rio Grande City, Roma, San Isidro, and Zapata, this study's sample consisted of 67 male and 53 female migrant students and 99 male and 139 female non-migrants. The respondents' educational and occupational status projection specifications were initially coded into qualitative attainment types of status and then into more inclusive socioeconomic status type&quot;level&quot; categories. To indicate their valuation of life goals, respondents were asked to rank seven normally desired life ends in terms of their relative importance to him/her. Some findings were: no significant statistical variation was found between migrants and non-migrants (for both sexes) relative to occupational aspirations; the job expectations among female migrants were markedly lower than those for non-migrants; and regardless of migrant status and sex, the majority of youths desired to complete college and to attain high status level jobs.

Groups of concrete and formal operational students were identified as were groups based on sex and grade level. Solutions for each task were ranked according to degree of abstraction represented. Correlations were completed to determine, for each group, the relationship between abstract ability and abstract preferences. Older groups demonstrated greater abstract reasoning ability. No significant differences were found  between grade levels with respect to abstract preference scores. This study supported the assumptions that a student's level of reasoning is often below his capacity and that a student's preference toward a specific solution may, in part, be responsible for his below-capacity functioning.

The early construction of the instrument and the format was based on pilot studies performed by the authors. Validity and reliability measures were determined. Nine findings were noted. The overall results suggest that since non-science majors have a strong value preference for the humanistic aspects of chemistry with regard to environmental problems, then curriculum designers, textbook writers, and course instructors should structure their course  activities toward these strong value preferences.

Each expansion includes: global objectives, instructional objectives and suggested activities for the instructional objective. The model is organized around six major global objectives dealing with energy sources, earth resources, resource reclamation, population dynamics, interdependence and  quality of life. Following each global objective is a series of instructional objectives for use in the development of local programs.

Analytic concepts identify the type or form of systemic concepts found in particular disciplines. In terms of analytic concepts, science processes such as observation, deduction, and prediction can be identified and defined as operations applicable to sets of systemic concepts. Analytic networks, i.e., structurally related sets of analytic concepts, establish an organizational framework for content at the systemic level. Such networks provide a basis for selection of systemic content and processes. Several networks are briefly described which were found to characterize content of selected science programs. The utility of the networks is illustrated by their ability to  organize concent proposed for the kindergarten level of a science program. (LS)",

They were disaggregated in the survey by a number of measures, such as character of work, performer, and field, which are analyzed in detail in the various sections of the report. The aggregates are related in the first section to broader economic indicators. Some of the highlights of the report include: (1) a 15 percent increase in 1976 in federal R&amp;D obligations budget program totals; (2) although the share of the federal budget represented by the R&amp;D has declined  continuously from 1965 to 1975, it is estimated to increase the share to 6.3 percent; (3) federal agencies continue to comprise the major source of national R&amp;D funding; (4) industry sources have provided a great deal; and (5) a slight decline in applied research obligations is shown.

An instrument was designed which contained statements grouped into one of three categories depending upon the particular skill in question. These skills were instructional, interpersonal, and managerial in nature. A Likert-type scale was used to indicate the extent to which an individual's model was teacher-, class-, or student-centered. Data were gathered from Level I interns, student teachers, and cooperating teachers in the competency based teacher education program at the University of Georgia. Pre- and post-data were obtained from Level I interns; a single sampling of responses was collected from student teachers and  cooperating teachers. A correlational analysis was conducted which examined intra- and inter-group agreements. Numerous findings were made that indicate that the instrument was sensitive enough to measure changes. Among these results was that student teachers view the relationship between instructional and interpersonal models of teaching as similar whereas Level I interns see them as unrelated and cooperating teachers were uncertain as to the relationship between the two teaching models.

Each of the Individualized Science Instructional System (ISIS) project staff members, whose job was to revise minicourse drafts produced and field-tested by the ISIS project, participated in an evaluation of the types of feedback that may have influenced their revisions of ISIS minicourses. They rank-ordered a list of types of feedback according to the amount of influence the feedback had on their actual revision of minicourse materials. Verbal (audiotaped) feedback from teachers was rated as the most influential by nearly all of the subjects. Feedback that involved  information obtained from students who used the instructional materials received the lowest ratings. Informal and verbal (i.e., nonquantitative) feedback was rated as being more influential than feedback that was more formal and less verbal (i.e., quantitative). (Author/MLH)",

It is argued that a research agenda involving longitudinal, comparative case-study designs and using field-method techniques is the only method capable of generating a solid base of information on the relationship between structural properties, social relationships, and learning outcomes. Thus, the importance of conceptual formulation and methodological procedures is illustrated. While numerous observational schemes are available for studying classroom environments, their adequacy has been limited by naive and simplistic conceptualizations of the social processes of learning. By focusing on dyadic interactions or only one aspect of social organization (e.g., peer networks  or reward systems), research on schooling has overlooked the complex interrelationships between structural properties and social processes in learning environments. A complete model of the learning setting must detail the social organization and its consequences; that is, how particular structural characteristics of the setting affect the social relationships that develop in it and how different social relationships influence technical and moral socialization within schools.

Answers are sought to these three questions: (1) Who were the college tutors? (2) Who were the students most often in conflict with tutors? (3) Based on questions one and two, are there any significant differences in the characteristics of both groups that tend to confirm or deny Henry Adams' conclusion that social distinctions were the root cause of student discontent? The study is based on an analysis of the published biographical data of the graduates of Harvard and Yale colleges, faculty records, student diaries, and other materials available for the years 1745-1771. The analysis on the pattern and system of the educational enterprise at the two schools  during the years in question indicates that family background counted for much more than other &quot;credentials&quot;; each college held and attempted to impart a distinct sense of mission to all members of its community; and the colleges were perceived as necessary by some and useful by others, although they had not yet assumed their role as significantly important institutions for status or career attainment. These findings lead to the conclusion that the widespread confrontations at both institutions were essentially disputes over &quot;manner&quot; and that the confrontations were strongly linked to basic differences of social status between students and their tutors.

The census data suggest that while substantial migration of blacks into the suburbs occurred in several areas of Michigan during the 1960's, the suburban black population numbers remained proportionally small. Only in suburban Ann Arbor was the black proportion greater than four percent. The evidence suggests that, regardless of the small size of the black population, suburban Michigan is characterized by a high degree of black residential segregation in all but one area under examination. From 1960 to 1970, six of the areas experienced an increase in segregation. Among the reasons for the increase are central city  function and differential black-white suburban migration. For example, four of the five suburban areas that increased in segregation from 1960 to 1970 surround manufacturing central cities. This trend may suggest that suburbs tend to follow a pattern of residential segregation similar to that of other central cities. (Author/DE)",

Two hundred and thirty three (56.6%) were returned for statistical analysis, but the number of responses to questions varied because not all questions were applicable to every institution. The survey substantiates previous findings which indicate that funding for intramural programs comes primarily from student-related resources, that most institutions provide structured intramural and recreation programs, that most institutions sponsor and/or supervise sports clubs, and that the designated recreation hours are allocated after scheduling needs for varsity athletics, physical education, intramurals, and sports clubs  have been met. In addition, many intramural departments employ student activity managers to handle equipment and oversee intramural activities.

It is stated that RBTE is designed to be an adaptive process for professional development in teaching. The RBTE prototype developed and reported in this speech is delineated into a cyclical four-phase process: (1) developing sets of expectations, (2) the role response, (3) status and professional identity, and (4) developing a perspective of the person within the organization. The goals, focuses, and outcomes for each phase are described. Finally, the author discusses two viewpoints concerning the development of competencies and the social order operating to attain these competencies. He examines (1) the differences  between prescribing competencies for the individual and constructing them through the action of the incumbent, and (2) the differences between controlling and prescribing the social order or situational interaction of many incumbents in the environment and allowing the social order to emerge as the incumbent enacts professional behavior in the situational setting.

The expectation that locus of control was not correlated to achievement in a \"traditional\" setting was also supported. Similar results were found in the second study involving community college students who were enrolled in either \"alternative\" or \"traditional\" sections of three different introductory courses.

        "description":"By making virtue of ascesis or self-discipline in their sport, the athlete evangelists (the &quot;athletae-Dei&quot;), unwittingly rob sport of its fundamental theological significance. These proponents of an evangelical brand of protestant theology have shifted drastically from an anti-sport stance of a century ago to a position that not only embraces sport but seeks to harness it for evangelistic purposes. The &quot;athletae-Dei&quot; use the popularity gained through athletics to propogate a theology. They have integrated their theology with their sport, thus resulting in unique motives for competing, for winning, and for training. In spite of the fact that the &quot;athletae-Dei&quot; place a premium on all-out effort, they overtly deemphasize winning. Training the athlete in the &quot;athletae-Dei&quot; manner  requires an ascesis that is ordered to bring about victory on the athletic field; yet within the context of his/her spiritual calling. Athletic training is also a discipline imposed by the will of God for spiritual ends. Emerging almost contemporaneously with the sport evangelism movement has been a fascination by certain theologians in a play theology. It is an attempt to illuminate the meaning of play through an application of theology. In their earnestness, the &quot;athletae-Dei&quot; fail to see sport as a revelation of the joyous nature of an existence secure in God and at the same time, a demonstration of the sediment of insufficiency and the transitory quality of life that comes with a realization of the true boundaries of an earthly existence.

The subjects were 16 male college students. Each subject was tested under four experimental conditions following a five-minute warm-up on a bicycle ergometer at 75 percent of maximum heart rate (HRmax). Rest intervals of one minute, five minutes, 10 minutes, and no rest preceded a progressively increasing eight-minute exercise period on a bicycle ergometer. Ratings of RPE, HR, and state anxiety were obtained at 1000, 1200, 1400, and 1600 kilopond-meters (KPM) per minute during each of the experimental conditions. An analysis of variance, four by four by four factorial design with  repeated measures on both factors were used to determine if significant differences existed in state anxiety levels between the experimental conditions. Intraclass correlation coefficients revealed that the reliability for HR and RPE was extremely high. It was found that no significant difference existed between the four experimental conditions for perceived exertion, heart rate, and state anxiety. RPE was found to be a good predictor of physiological strain as indicated by HR. (Author/SK)",

        "description":"Although various assessments differ in notable ways, they often follow a plan that is thoroughly tested and features four basic steps: (1) selecting learning areas and identifying their objectives; (2) developing achievement test items to determine the degree to which these objectives are accomplished; (3) administering the test items to representative samples of students and gathering background data about them; and (4) analyzing the results and disseminating them to administors, board members, legislators, and the public. The largest, most informative assessment ever designed follows this general plan very closely. It is the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), for which planning began in 1964. It is designed to obtain census-like data on the knowledges, skills,  concepts, understandings, and attitudes possessed by young Americans in a variety of learning areas; and to measure the growth or decline of these achievements that occurs over time. This publication describes the NAEP and some major findings of the first assessments in various areas, and then offers a speculative view of our schools. Surveys like the NAEP serve as excellent vehicles for generating hypotheses about causes of achievement fluctuations, which in turn can be studied more intensively by designing appropriate experiments or conducting thorough case studies.

        "description":"Properly manipulated residuals resulting from \"status predicting status\" regressions constitute a precise and unique measurement of status inconsistency without the definitional and methodological problems and limitations of simple and simultaneous cross-classification techniques associated with the typical \"dummy variable regression\" approach. Residuals entered as independent variables in multiple regression models including usual status variables allow determination of \"inconsistency effects\" separate from main effects of status dimensions without sacrificing variability and predictability and precluding analyses of higher-order interaction terms. Several theoretically-based, nonlinear, and modified dummy-variable transformations of residuals are suggested which avoid linear  determinancy while measuring the relative influence of status and degrees of directional and nondirectional status inconsistency. Several residual regression models are discussed and empirically compared: 2-variable and multivariable status-inconsistent types and full regression models of statuses and residual inconsistents. Results of tests with selected models predicting political attitude empirically demonstrated the practical and theoretical utility of the residual regression method of measuring status inconsistency effects relative to those of status. Implications for future mobility and status inconsistency research are outlined. (Author)",

The method is based on the concept of generalizability theory.

        "description":"A comprehensive look is taken at the rural-urban variation in extended familism among a segment of the population for which extended familism purportedly is especially salient: lower and working class black Americans. The study is guided by the general hypothesis that rurality/urbanism affects extended familism when nonecological variables are held constant. Differences by two dimensions of rurality/urbanism are analyzed--current place of residence and rural-urban experience. Three general dimensions of extended familism are examined: patterns of coresidence, amount of interaction among kin not living in the same households, and relative functionality of interaction with kin to nonkin. Because extant evidence and theoretical bases for predictions of relationships between  rurality/urbanism and extended familism appear contradictory, no attempt is made to hypothesize and test the direction of rural-urban differences. The hypothesis that no rural-urban differences exist is supported with some caution since the statistic used for significance is sensitive to sample size, and because the sampling procedures for this study are not random. Another finding is that both the non-ecological and ecological variable effects are insufficient to explain as much as one-half or more of the variation in extended familism among the blacks. This indicates that all of the important ecological and/or nonecological factors affecting extended familism are not tapped by this study. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"The analysis of this paper is directed primarily to the question of the effect of school desegregation on loss of white children from large central-city school systems. This analysis is taken from James S. Coleman, Sara D. Kelly, and John A. Moore, Trends in School Segregation, 1968-73 (1975). The data are taken from annual reports by all school districts in the country to the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare on the racial composition of each school in the district. Before addressing the primary question, trends in racial segregation in the schools between 1968 and 1973 are briefly examined. The overall analysis concludes that the emerging problem with regard to school desegregation is the problem of segregation between central city and  suburbs; and in addition, that current means by which schools are being desegregated are intensifying that problem, rather than reducing it. The emerging problem of school desegregation in large cities is a problem of metropolitan area residential segregation, brought about by a loss of whites from the central cities. This loss is intensified by extensive school desegregation in those central cities, but in cities with high proportions of blacks and predominantly white suburbs, it proceeds at a relatively rapid rate with or without desegregation.

        "description":"An attempt is made here to trace the development of Coleman's research reports and public statements. Several critical evaluations of this work are then reviewed, including one the authors have carried out. It is suggested the overall research suggests six generalizations: there has been an enormous, long term trend of whites leaving the central cities for the suburbs and blacks coming into the largest central cities. There is little or no effect of desegregation on the white flight of students in medium and smaller sized cities. There is little or no effect of desegregation on the white flight of students in metropolitan wide districts. Desegregation required by federal court orders has not had different effects on white flight from other desegregation of equal magnitude. The  loss of white and black students from large urban school systems is significantly related to the proportion of black students in the systems. Extensive school desegregation in the largest, nonmetropolitan school districts, particularly in the South, may hasten the white flight of students in the first year of the process, but at least part of this effect may be compensated for in later years. Finally, attention is given to several basic issues in the conduct of social science research and the reporting of data. (Author/JM)",

Part Two, The Changed Role of the Suburbs Since World War II, observes that, unlike the central city, the basic function and form of which have changed only in degree, the suburban settlements that have emerged since World War II have little in common with the ecological type called suburb previous to that time. Part III, Motivations of Housing Consumers in Opting for the Suburbs, asserts that knowing why the millions of American households that opted to  live in the suburbs since World War II made that choice can tell us much about the future of our cities. Part IV, The Impact of Race Upon Suburbanization, proposes that because in recent decades that exodus from the central city to the suburbs peaked at the same time that a large number of newcomers to the large metropolitan areas were readily identifiable minorities, there has been much distortion of what has been involved. Some have confused coincidence with causation. (Author/JM)",

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education in 1971. It is a response to the court's approval in that case of busing as a remedy that may in some circumstances be used to alleviate the effects of de jure racial segregation. Opposition to busing appears to command a majority in Congress. This has not yet led to a head-on confrontation with the courts because legislation thus far enacted has been framed to avoid constitutional difficulties. And it now appears that the primary focus of congressional interest is an anti-busing amendment to the Constitution. Analysis of the proposed amendments and statutes requires a review of both  the existing statutes and the case law, which is made here. The constitutionality of past and present anti-busing efforts is then assessed. It is noted that the present session of Congress has seen attempts at the passage of further anti-busing legislation that are significant not so much because of the nature of the proposed legislation as because of the support it has gathered. If a constitutional amendment is to be passed, which is believed unlikely, then more legislation will probably be forthcoming and a clash with the judiciary may be unavoidable. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The coalition of women has roots that reach back through more than a century of American history. In the decades before the Civil War, women spoke out against men on the issue of slavery, and this served a new breed of brilliant and aggressive women who found themselves talking about female as well as black rights and who recognized that white women are part of the same system that exploits black slaves. The anti-slavery movement reached a dramatic schism on the issue of female participation beyond society's accustomed roles. As long as the tales of bondage were confined to the drawing rooms of the committed, women were greeted by friendly faces, but were attacked after the announcement of a public lecture tour. Anti-abolitionist papers focus on this tour suggesting that foes of  slavery intend to bring anarchy to the U.S. and are letting women get out of hand. These incidents relating to women's participation in the anti-slavery movement hurtled women toward developing their own organizations. The modern struggle for women's rights also has important roots in the Southern black freedom drive in the 1960's. In the process of supporting the black drive for equality, women have learned something about their oppression. Today, Afro-Americans and women encounter the same arguments, fight the same enemies, and often make unified counter attacks despite differences in their movements. (Author/AM)",

        "author":["Epps, Edgar G."],
        "description":"Parents and professional educators agree that reading competence is a necessary prerequisite for successful achievement in nearly all other aspects of the elementary and secondary school curriculum. Successful school achievement is also seen as necessary for later occupational and economic achievement. It is commonly believed that reading failure is strongly related to difficulty in overall school adjustment and to social adjustment in the larger community. While this paper does not deal with all of these broad concerns, it focuses on some of the critical issues in reading achievement and suggests some possible areas in which further investigation might yield results that could be of direct benefit to educators who must plan and implement language programs for black children. It  is clear that there is a need for well designed studies which are firmly based on systematic models of language acquisition. There is a need for carefully designed studies of the reading processes within the context of classroom situations where most instruction takes place. The most useful research will be that designed to help teachers utilize the most appropriate strategies in class rooms (or other learning environments) with children who are heterogeneous with regard to experience, motivation, and interest.

        "description":"A group of six feminists undertook this study because they felt it important that people learn about racial and sexual discrimination in textbooks used in Baltimore City and other U.S. schools. The task force chose five series of basal readers widely used in Baltimore. These series are used in most, if not all, Elementary Secondary Education Act Title I schools -- schools in which a majority of students are Third World. A predetermined selection process was used to chose a block of ten stories from each book in the study sample. The examination reveals that females and racial minorities are underrepresented in central roles. Where they do appear, their characterization reinforces traditional sexual and racial stereotypes. The readers fail in general to provide positive  self-images for females and racial minorities, and they reflect and reinforce social injustices. Recommendations are made for ways to use the readers and for the development of teacher, parent, and publisher awareness of the problems of sexual and racial stereotyping. An afterword has been appended reviewing 1975 and 1976 readers. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Surprisingly little research has been done on Little Black Sambo and the meager material is often contradictory. This study examines the origins of the book and traces its history in the United States through its overlapping periods of popularity and controversy. The story of Little Black Sambo, written in 1898 by Helen Bannerman, a white English woman, describes a dark skinned child's adventures with four tigers. This simple story, first published in England is 1899, has been the subject of public controversy for over 30 years. Although it was one of the most popular stories for preschoolers and primary graders during the first half of the twentieth century, many individuals and groups later called for its removal from library shelves. Conscientious professionals involved with  children and books listened carefully to reports of potential harm. In spite of the resistance of some librarians to what they felt was undue censorship, the book was withdrawn from many schools and libraries. However, attitudes toward Sambo are still decidedly mixed, and it is widely available in book stores, public libraries, schools and other areas of the public scene. It is hoped that the view of the facts and theories surrounding the book made here will allow readers to examine the continued use of this story. (Author/JM)",

Economic data on white control cover topics such as wealth, the stock exchange, businesses, banks, union control and membership, and others. Data per training to minority oppression address median income, income and education, poverty and unemployment. Minority oppression in the health field is examined in terms of life expectancy, death rates, birth, health care, and diseases. Findings of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights for 1974, banking realtors, suburbs and jobs, segregation and rents, and ownership and quality issues are examined under housing. The section on education addresses white control over  school boards, professional staffs, and college faculty. Minority oppression information includes a minority profile, suspensions, college, and representation in various professions. White control of the news media addresses newspapers, magazines, publishing, T.V. and radio broadcasting. White control of government discusses the presidency, congress, elected officials, government agencies, federal employees, and others. Facts on minority oppression and government include punishment, sentencing, bail, prisons, and jailers. Judges, attorneys, the military, and punishment are the focus of a section on the courts in government. The census section notes that minorities are undercounted for 1970. (Author/AM)",

It is true that Asian people have much more in common with one another than they have in common with non-Asians. While there are many attitudes and manners which Vietnamese and Cambodians share resulting from similarities of economics and geography, for instance, it is just as true and very important to human relations to recognize that Cambodians have a distinct and proud culture. This paper, composed by Cambodian individuals, is directed to Americans who hope to relate successfully to Cambodians. Quotations opening each section are taken from conversations with Cambodians who have made or are now making the adjustment to American life.  Various sections informally cover topics such as Buddhist ethics and attitudes, similarities and differences between Vietnamese and Cambodians, behavior patterns such as patience and compliance, notions of idealism that Cambodians have about the United States, social standards, the concept of informality, patterns of responding such as tact, diplomacy, and withdrawal, the concept of sharing, manual labor, and adaptability.

        "description":"Income inequality in the United States displays considerable variance since the seventeenth century. There is no eternal constancy to the degree of inequality in total income, in labor earnings, or in income from conventional nonhuman wealth either before or after the effects of government taxes and spending. When all the necessary adjustments to the raw data are made, it appears income and wealth were more evenly distributed just before the Korean War than in 1929. Income inequality has shown little trend since Korea. The entire history of inequality also points to the fact that inequality movements are not the result of mere movements among demographic groups, but follow trends in the basic occupational pay gaps as well as in the level and dispersion in profit rates and rents.  This essay surveys the detailed evidence that reveals these broad patterns. It specifically seeks to clarify American inequality history. The following outline of topics is followed: growth now--equality later; measuring inequality; postwar stability; the levelling era of 1929-1951; the uneven plateau of 1860-1929 (inequality evidence); the uneven plateau of 1860-1929 (pay ratios and factor shares); wealth inequality trends before the Civil War; the antebellum surge in wage inequality; and the agenda for the study of inequality and economic growth based on this survey of American distribution experience.

        "description":"The debate about the black-white price differential in housing is clarified in this paper. The theoretical literature on this differential is reviewed, and it is shown how the various theories can be tested in a regression of house values on housing characteristics. A properly specified house-value regression leads not only to tests of hypotheses about the black-white price differential but also to measures of this differential. The econometric specification derived in this paper is estimated using data for owner-occupied houses in St. Louis in 1967. These estimates provide support for hypotheses about the effects on the price of housing of racial attitudes and of discrimination against blacks. It is also found that a black-white price differential exists both between  neighborhoods and within neighborhoods; the price of equivalent housing is about 25% higher in highly integrated and largely black neighborhoods than in all-white neighborhoods, and, within any given neighborhood, blacks pay about 15% more than white for equivalent housing.

Some of the more important issues raised by other researchers are also explored in this paper. The basic concern of this report is whether the journey to work patterns of residents of nonmetropolitan areas are responsive to the same kinds of forces as those that influence the journey to work patterns of residents of metropolitan areas. An argument is developed that shows that journey to work patterns are influenced heavily by the spatial structure of housing markets in relation to the spatial distribution of activities in urban areas, and that differences in the journey to work patterns of  nonmetropolitan and metropolitan residents are largely a function of differences in the scale of the respective urban spatial systems. Essential to the discussion is the assertion that as urban spatial systems increase in scale, their morphological structure undergoes successive transformations that result in a redistribution of land activities (including residential activities). The same factors that significantly affect the journey to work pattern of metropolitan residents also affect those of nonmetropolitan residents, although effects vary with respect to size and direction.

        "description":"A questionnaire describing 87 environmental characteristics of schools is administered to entering freshmen at a predominantly black university to study the relationships of racial composition to various dimensions of school environment and social climate. Both racial and nonracial aspects of school environments are examined. Correlation of the student responses with a racial composition index generally reveals perceptions of predominantly white schools. Results indicate that black student of both sexes who attend predominantly white schools are more likely to report better care for their school buildings, more clubs and extracurricular activities, and more interracial friendships and interracial dating. These students also seem to be excluded from the extracurricular activities  and programs in the school. There are certain areas in which the racial composition of desegregated schools seems to differentially affect males and females. For example, to comprise a relatively small minority within a predominantly white school seems to present certain problems for black females that it does not present for the black male. The results of the study lend scientific support to efforts to maintain minimal levels of proportional racial balance within schools. It also raises issues and questions concerning the sex-role and social adjustment of black female in the predominantly white school. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"Classroom processes dealing with both cognitive and socioemotional factors are studied to investigate the relationship of teacher threat behaviors to the academic achievement of educationally disadvantaged children. The specific objective is to supply evidence relating academic achievement to a positive socioemotional climate. It is hypothesized that classes with low threat socioemotional climates will achieve more than classes with high threat climates. A systematic observational instrument is developed to identify classroom behaviors on a bidimensional scale; that of threat (teacher aversive stimuli) and content (on-task activities). Initial results indicate no support for the hypothesis that threat is detrimental to learning; however, subsequent testing using a clearer  distinction of high and low threat classroom indicates a significant relationship. A negative relationship between amount of content presentation and quality of teacher threat behavior is found. A teacher threat behavior increases, the quantity of content presentation decreases. Further research to determine the extent of the effect of various levels of threat on educationally disadvantaged minorities is suggested. Implications for the classroom suggests a need for greater awareness on the teacher's part that disadvantaged children can only achieve at a satisfactory academic level if they are provided sufficient opportunity to learn the materials at hand.

        "description":"A nutrition education unit, Rat Pak, developed by Dairy Council, Inc., is an attempt to influence students to make wise food choices. It consists of eleven lessons in an instructional sequence which incorporates the use of white rats as a means of illustrating the effect of improper diet while teaching proper diet. The purpose of this investingation is to determine whether Rat-Pak increases knowledge of nutrition and whether it affects dietary intake. A second intent of the study is to compare the effectiveness of Rat-Pak with other means of teaching nutrition. The study is also planned with the intent of determining an optimal age for utilization of the unit. Results indicate that Rat-Pak increases nutritional knowledge and changes the dietary behavior of students who study the  unit (grades 5-8). It is also found to be more effective than nutrition units commonly taught. Results also indicate that an optimal age for utilization of the unit is seventh grade. The results of the study must be considered with caution as several points could be considered weaknesses. For instance, the validity of the dietary analysis as a measure of dietary behavior is questionable. This study reveals areas for further study. It is suggested that teacher cooperation be emphasized in the future and that teacher attitude and knowledge of nutrition and their relationship to student learning, as well as the affective effects of the unit on students be considered.

        "description":"A summative evaluation of a unique television experience for children is presented in this document. Vegetable Soup, a multi-ethnic television series, is designed to reduce the adverse effects of racial prejudice. A major focus of the program is to assist elementary school children in the development of genuine appreciation of members of all ethnic groups. The purpose of this research is to test the objectives of the program in order to determine the effect on attitudes of those children who viewed the programs compared to children who did not. A posttest-only design is used to examine the differences between the two groups. Sixteen programs are shown only to the experimental group and results are based on information gathered from spontaneous responses made by children while  viewing the program and by responses to the instrument designed to test the objectives of the series. In conducting the evaluation, the focus is on four specific questions which encompass most of the stated objectives of the program. It is generally concluded that the program succeeds in affecting intergroup attitudes of children who view the show, but that this does not apply consistently over all of the racial/ethnic groups on which the study focuses. An interpretation of the results as well as a discussion of reactions to major segments of the shows and recommendations with reference to content and presentation for future T.V. productions for children, are included.

        "description":"Faculty members in various Illinois universities work cooperatively in implementing and refining a program of teacher identification of problems of pupils which limit and handicap their progress in school. The Student Needs Assessment Program (SNAP) requires a high level of professional commitment from both teachers and the principal. Teachers use a survey instrument which lists 48 problems under 7 categories. Teachers study this list and agree on a definition of what is meant by a pupil having a problem to an unusual degree. Teachers are then given an alphabetized list of pupils they teach and/or know well and are to put the number as a problem from the survey instrument opposite a pupil's name if it is believed that the pupil has the problem or need to an unusual degree. The  pupil lists are then collected and tallied. The question teachers then ask is what can be done about these problems and the focus of attention switches from diagnosis and observation of overt behavior to looking for causes of behavior, to developing strategies and intervention procedures designed to find solutions to these problems. The articles and reports in this publication give descriptions and results of various techniques, approaches, and activities undertaken by teams of teachers in four Illinois laboratory schools as they attempt to help pupils resolve their problems.

        "description":"Parental involvement is supplementary to the main line approach of the Special Needs Assessment Program (SNAP) whose main thrust is the diagnosis and remediation and/or partial alleviation of pupil needs by the child's teacher. This Parent Perception Project is an approach which provides for the involvement of parents in the process of identifying needs which they feel their children may have to an unusual degree. It is assumed that a school will have completed the teacher assessment of pupil needs before going this project. Many schools may then wish to involve parents by providing them with the opportunity to identify their children's needs, or to find out if there are discrepancies in perception of a child's needs between parents and teachers. It is for these schools that this  manual of direction is written. The manual includes information on the purpose and procedure of the SNAP program and on the responsibilities of principals, teachers, and parents. Words of caution and advice are offered to those who administer the program. These suggest that members of the teaching staff be fully informed on all aspects of the project, and that the supplementary program be administered after the school has completed the SNAP program. It is also suggested that special attention be given to many parents in the lower socioeconomic category, and that administrators not be discouraged if a small minority of parents voice their objections to the program.

        "description":"The Special Needs Assessment Program (SNAP) is designed to help teachers, parents, and children focus attention on individual pupils as human beings who need help in handling a variety of problems. The project's main intents are to help faculty in identifying critical needs and concerns of pupils and to encourage the building of instructional programs that are responsive to these needs and concerns. The procedures for initiating the program are simple and tend to be effective due to a grass roots approach and high teacher involvement. The assessment program includes four phases: diagnosis, prescription, implementation, and evaluation. Through the use of a survey instrument, the handicapping problems of pupils are first identified, then involved faculty members think through  possible ways of helping pupils who have the most numerous and serious problems. Evaluation consists of assessing individual progress rather than in measuring behavior according to some imaginary norm. One of the appealing features of this program is that features of this program is that teachers develop and devise their own strategies and ideas for alleviating student problems. A series of items that teachers find successful are listed. The point to be stressed about the use of the data collected is that individual teachers can do as little or as much as they desire depending on their energy, their perception of students' needs, and peer encouragement.

These papers represent the work of scholars who have studied the problem of white flight long before the current controversy over urban desegregation plans made it a national issue. Starting from very different assumptions, the participants at the symposium are in agreement on two basic points: (1) most white flight is not caused by school desegregation plans, and (2) metropolitan plans would produce the most stable desegregation. The remaining debate, particularly focusing on the impact, if any, of desegregation plans on increasing white flight is the basic focus of this collection. The contents include the following: school integration 'tipping' in  Mississippi; the importance, perplexities, and possible policy implications of white flight research; and the role of the courts in school desegregation and white flight.

        "description":"One of the issues in bilingual education is whether programs designed to provide immigrant children with special aid in learning English are adequate. To provide factual data this study reports on a survey conducted on all classroom and home teachers in the public schools of New York City. Each teacher is asked to list all pupils in the class who have moderate or severe difficulty speaking English and then to indicate the extent of each pupil's participation in specialized programs designed either to improve English language skills or to provide instruction in the pupil's native language. Although the survey inquires about all pupils in the schools who have difficulty with English, the present report is restricted to those of Spanish heritage. Three issues are considered: (1) How  many Hispanic pupils have difficulty with English? (2) How many of these are receiving specialized remedial services or instruction in Spanish? (3) How many of these are in contact with school personnel fluent in Spanish? The data presented in this report shows both a substantial need for special services for Hispanic pupils with English language difficulty and a substantial effort on the part of the schools to meet that need. Whether these efforts are sufficient remains a central pending issues. (Author/AM)",

Chapter Two presents a description of and statistics on the amount of change in level of birth expectations between 1971-73 for 17 to 27 year old women, which amounted to a decrease of about 300 children per 1,000 women. Analysis of behavior and attitudinal changes is presented with an attempt to relate the decline to both stable and  changing characteristics of women. Chapter Three develops nonrecursive statistical models to investigate the effects of women's labor force participation plans and fertility expectations on each other. Chapter Four shows that there is a large, statistically significant, inverse relationship between women's age and the effect of their labor force participation plans on their fertility expectations. Appended material includes equations used in the statistical model, references, and 15 tables of statistical data. (Author/MS)",

The simulation-based curriculum, Careers and You, takes a clusters approach to career orientation. Designed for a total school year, the curriculum repeats its sequence of phases so that each is emphasized twice. The phases are: (1) self, (2) work mode, (3) occupational clusters, and (4) educational planning. Once students have identified personality characteristics in general which have a bearing upon work selection, and their own in particular, they look intensely at the work modes appropriate to various personalities, guided by Holland's six work environments: realistic, social, creative, enterprising, intellectual, and conventional. The second  and third phases of the course involve youth in simulating each work mode; the third phase uses the 15 USOE occupational clusters as a vehicle and involves youth in discovering the frequency of the various work modes throughout the world of work. Time is given at midyear for educational planning, and during the final weeks of the course, long-term goals and alternate career paths are identified. Base-line and process data have been gathered; the project's third year will be spent in product evaluation. (AJ)",

        "description":"Educators, replacing substance with form in their dialogs, argue over symptoms and fail to consider causes. No coherent analysis links practice to social reality, because low-level sloganeering replaces useful analytic language. Particularly offensive, career education, another energy-draining slogan, has clearly reactionary potential. Two developments must be understood: Social problems have been increasingly defined as school problems, keeping educators on the defensive and narrowing the analysis to school practices instead of analyzing schools in society; and, schools have become social credentialling machines, despite evidence that job performance is not significantly related to education. Translating career entry into a school problem (career education) is a bankrupt idea.  The illusion that extensive prior training is necessary to master bureaucratic occupations is created by labelling jobs professional. Extended schooling postpones adulthood, while old age comes sooner and sooner. This social problem probably cannot be solved within a capitalist system. Educational sociologists arguing that schools should be relieved of many current responsibilities nevertheless propose a conservative doctrine which assumes a capitalist social system, providing a rationale for reactionary policies; career education provides a slogan, a mechanism for strengthening the status quo, in which the docile teach competitive docility ignoring public interest and humanity.

The alarming high failure rate of minority-owned businesses has been attributed primarily to poor management and business skills. The final report covers: needs assessment, participant and observer recruitment, site and instructor selection, classes, technical assistance, and program evaluation. Public service announcements on radio and television stations and newspaper advertisements were used to publicize the program at the University of  San Francisco to potential and established entrepreneurs. Instructors included several San Francisco State staff and professional businessmen from the community, who presented classes in organizing and planning a small business; business management; marketing; financial management; and taxes, law, insurance, and other resources. Forty-four persons, including 11 observers, attended one or more of the classes; certificates were presented to 20 individuals who had attended a minimum of four classes. A participant questionnaire indicated a favorable overall response and good instructor ratings. Approximately half of the document consists of supplementary appendixes. (EA)",

Teacher preparation and certification are discussed in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 presents the local organization, administration, and supervision of driver education programs which led to the  development of State-level policies. The remaining chapters deal with measuring student progress (through knowledge and skill tests, driver attitudes, psychophysical testing, and comparative studies), research, support organizations, and the future outlook (from a 1966 perspective). Appended are a list of high school textbooks, and founding dates of 44 State Driver and/or Safety Education Associations.

It covers, however, all the public and private U.S. universities. The colleges are underrepresented; relatively few of these have established continuing education programs. The report is comprised of 23 tables of statistical data and accompanying brief narrative accounts. Each of the sponsoring associations, the Association for Continuing Higher Education (ACHE) and the National University Extension Association (NUEA), reported increased membership. Slightly fewer than half of the institutions responding reported that 100% of their continuing education programs were  covered by their reports, and most characteristically reported greater centralization of programs. The most commonly reported programs were classes with conferences; second most common was a classes/conferences/independent study combination. The patterning of program categories varied with Association membership. The wide variation in program registrations, from less than 1,000 to more than 150,000, indicates the multiplicity of program organizations. Total registrations covered by the report were 6,420,671, an 18.2% increase from the previous year. Ambiguities related to organizational variations and data recording capacities are believed to limit the information's usefulness. (Author/AJ)",

The author has reviewed the common functional forms employed in empirical labor supply models and has characterized the inherent preference structures in terms of patterns of expansion paths in the plane of leisure and market consumption. The preference maps for the more tractable models are seen to fall within a well-behaved set of alternative structures that range along a continuum from divergent to convergent patterns of expansion paths. A new class of preference structures, having parallel expansion paths, falls within this continuum. A proposed empirical model for the  estimation of the form of the preference structure is adapted from an estimation form developed by Cohen, Rea, and Lerman (1970). This model permits the estimation of sample analogs of expansion paths at different wage rates. The pattern of the estimated path may then be tested against those implied by alternative analytical functions. (Author/EA)",

        "description":"A survey involving all United States correctional institutions for male or female, adult or juvenile offenders was conducted to study three potential vocational preparation activities within the institutions: (1) formal vocational training programs, (2) training in prison industries, and (3) training in maintenance and service assignments. Specific information was sought on training goals, programs, practices, numbers participating, staff, and supportive services. Information was obtained from approximately 70% of all institutions through mail survey questionnaires and site-visit interviews with inmates about to be released or paroled. Results indicated that vocational preparation in correctional institutes is generally inadequate; type and size of institution, length of stay of  residents, age and sex of residents, distance from a city, racial composition, and security level made little difference on most variables studied. Findings include: only 57% of vocational training programs have outside accreditation; only 32% have adequate facilities; only 50% of program directors considered job skill development as the major program goal; and only 21% provided off-the-job related instruction. Research approach, results, and recommendations are discussed. Survey and interview instruments are appended. It is stated that with a new committeeman and resources, the potential for conducting programs within the institutions is great. (LH)",

        "description":"For one important set of data, namely, the data on unemployment and employment collected by the Census Bureau in its monthly Current Population Survey (CPS), some information on nonsampling error is available that can be used to evaluate the regularly reported labor force figures. The paper is concerned with the nonsampling error that relates specifically to measurement, or response bias (the bias resulting from the interview and enumeration process itself). It examines and tabulates the extent of the response bias and its effect on national estimates of unemployment and employment. Unemployment rates corrected for this bias are estimated and compared with official unemployment rates. Cyclical and secular differences between official and bias-adjusted estimates of unemployment  are noted, and the alternative unemployment rates are related to such cyclically sensitive variables as GNP (Gross National Product) gap, wage rates, and labor force participation rates. Census reinterviewing data, up to now unexploited, contain new, potentially valuable economic information. The data indicates that when the official unemployment rate is adjusted, it is consistently and significantly higher, with the gap between the unadjusted and the adjusted rate widening in the most recent quarters. The reinterview data also indicate that the CPS consistently understates total employment. (Author/LH)",

Background information, detailed local project reports, recommendations, and dissemination techniques are discussed. Section 2 examines the development of an instructional system for consumer decision  making which incorporates consumer decision making and problem solving. Included are: background (discussing staff development and site visits), purpose (discussing educational objectives), design and development (including a prototype curriculum and field testing), and discussion of the application of the models to adult basic education situations.

        "description":"Basic to Tiedeman's approach to career development and decision making is the assumption that one is responsible for one's own behavior because one has the capacity for choice and lives in a world which is not deterministic. Tiedeman, a cognitive-developmental theorist, views continuity of development as internal or psychological while discontinuity has a sociological or environmental basis caused by the nature of the structure of society. In Tiedeman's theory, an instrumental cause behind one's behavior is the experience or anticipation of discontinuity and discomfort which precipitates purposeful action and decision making. Effective resolution of life's discontinuities leads to increased control over one's behavior, or a &quot;sense of agency&quot;, and the eventual expression of one's  identity through a personally-determined career. In the process of making a decision, an individual progresses through seven sequential stages: (1) exploration, (2) crystallization, (3) choice, (4) clarification, (5) induction, (6) reformation, and (7) integration. Decision-making styles may be: planning, intuitive, impulsive, agonizing, delaying, paralytic, fatalistic, and compliant. Planning is viewed as the most effective style with intuitive sometimes being effective. Another classification, reflecting various degrees of personal responsibility and individual utilization of rational planning strategies, is: (1) planning, (2) intuitive, and (3) dependent. (EA)",

The survey covers three groups of personnel under the general category of engineering technicians: (1) graduates of two-year college-level programs leading to an associate degree in technology, (2) non-graduates qualified to perform the same kind of work on the basis of equivalent education and experiences, and (3) graduates of four-year bachelor of technology programs. The first two groups are distinguished between in some of the data tables. Bachelor of technology graduates are  called &quot;technologists&quot; and are reported separately. The survey does not attempt to establish salary standards for any industry or employee group; the curves simply show what various sectors of employment were paying as of August 1975. A three-part questionnaire was used (facsimile appended) on which respondents indicated the number of individuals in appropriate boxes of a salary-versus-experience matrix, and the report is based on returns submitted by 630 different establishments employing 61,537 technicians.

Being held responsible for patients is often overwhelming for nursing students, yet nursing educators expect that they take on this dual role of student and professional in the nursing situation. It is important that the students' human (especially emotional) needs are considered as they begin the nursing process of assessing, planning for, and intervening in patient care. How student nurses react in this real life encounter has an influence on them as well as on the patients. How instructors respond to the students' human reaction can make the difference between a successful and unsuccessful initial clinical experience.  The students' fears, their lack of skill and knowledge, their feelings of inadequacy, their identifying with the patients, all set up roadblocks to learning. It is the instructor's role to help students cope with these problems. Instructors should make a concerted effort to get in touch with the feelings of students and to be aware of their dual role as students and as professionals. (Author/LH)",

Regarding four measures of planning comprehensiveness the actors' mean score was 5.479 on a scale of 10. The correlation between area-wideness and comprehensiveness for all actors was strong but not consistent. The study led to a typology of planning actors. Type 1 organizations, with responsibility for decision making or policy implementation but not for planning, scored below the mean on both the comprehensive and area-wide dimensions. Type 2 organizations, with  planning responsibilities carried out largely by professional staff, scored below the mean on the area-wide dimension but above the mean on comprehensiveness. Type 3 organizations, with limited scope of planning activities, scored below the mean on comprehensiveness but above the mean on the area-wide dimension. Type 4 organizations, with professionally trained staff and/or an active commitment to the efficacy of planning, scored above the mean on both measures. (JR)",

        "description":"The study examined 41 students (24 male, 17 female) in a beginning writing course for adults. Data were collected by (1) taping four workshop sessions in which all students participated in small groups, (2) interviewing all the students, and (3) observing four students writing in the classroom. The adult writers composed in two models: the extensive, which focused on conveying a message; and the reflexive, which focused on the writer's thoughts and feelings. They composed in a three-part process: pre-writing, writing, and post-writing. They engaged in very little formal planning, and showed great willingness to rework the pieces they wrote. The writers applied assumed or explicit aesthetic standards to their own writing in selecting a topic and contemplating the product. Writers'  use of language and their selections of problem-solving strategies identified them as two types: narrative writers and lyric writers. Inspecting the appended versions of a student's essay about an important person, thing, or event from her past shows that her characteristic modes of reformulation were reordering of elements and expanding. The case study suggests that any individual engaged in composing is working under the influence of forces that vary with time, place, the phase of the process, and the individual personality. (JR)",

The population consisted of 598 teachers of college credit courses to adults in Utah. On the basis of administrator's evaluations 163 &quot;unsuccessful&quot; and 189 &quot;successful&quot; teachers were identified; of these, 75 were randomly selected from each group. Of the three educational philosophies identified in Kreitlow's Check List (progressive, academic, and community) the respondents as individual groups and as a combined total sample agreed with the community philosophy. On Cattell's questionnaire the &quot;successful&quot; teachers were  more intelligent and abstract-thinking, more venturesome and socially bold, more tender-minded and sensitive, more experimentally-oriented, more emotionally stable, more forthright and unpretentious, more self-sufficient and resourceful, and older and more experienced.

        "description":"In the fall of 1974, I was invited to serve as a consultant to the Indonesian effort to develop a National Strategy for Non-Formal Education. The brunt of my effort concerned action research for developing and testing an empirical &quot;Community Learning System&quot; designed to link local learning needs with the management-resource-learning system. Field investigations quickly determined that resources were being brought to bear in a diffuse, often redundant, fashion and at differential levels of efficiency and effectiveness. An emergent research design incorporated villagers in the municipality of Ujung Pandang articulating their own learning needs and identifying the resources at their disposal. Contact with local governmental officials determined that village organization could not be  carried out without their participation, hence they were included in the resource identification stage of the field effort. The meeting for identifying village resources was a stunning success with the participants themselves being amazed by the breadth of their own resources. Although we were gratified by the group's response to our effort, there was the lingering question of how much of the group's participation was autonomously generated and how much it merely reflected their sensitivity to what we were attempting to have the participants do.

        "description":"The paper examines the methodological issues involved in the relationship of adult education to adult development. The practice of adult education during the past 25 years has been built upon a series of assumptions derived from theoretical fragments regarding lifelong development. Considering the theoretical base of adult development, however, very little has been verified and set within a sound, comprehensive framework of the total life-span. Any comprehensive theory of adult development must take into consideration not only the psychological and social factors of human life, but also the physiological, economic, vocational, religious, and political factors which affect contemporary life. Of the three traditional research methodologies, the cross-sectional, the  cross-sequential, and the longitudinal designs, the longitudinal has proven the most effective technique for studying developmental change. Within the latter methodology, the technique of biography has proven effective because it provides primary data across generations and even epochs. Whichever research design is selected for the study of life-span development, the researcher must effectively manipulate the factors of change and sameness which define the developing individual. In order to do so it is necessary to learn more about the developmental stages through which the individual proceeds. (JR)",

        "description":"In light of the gap in the existing literature regarding the effects of participation in various educational activities on occupational performance, the major concern of the study was to determine how the factors of formal educational attainment, work experience, and nonformal educational participation, as mediated by the social psychological variable of individual modernity and the behavioral variable of business practice adoption, contribute to occupational achievement. In the model design, the primary dependent variable was occupational achievement; the intervening variables were business practice adoption and individual modernity; the adult learning attributes were nonformal educational participation and work experience; and the pre-employment condition was formal educational  attainment. The study was conducted by means of structured interviews of Mexican American businessmen in the three most populous Mexican American enclaves in Chicago. Although the standardized beta coefficients and the coefficients of determination for the hypothesized paths of influence among the variables revealed a marked lack of predictiveness of many aspects of the model, the study was able to provide evidence of the significance of nonformal educational participation to business practice adoption and, via that mediating variable, to occupational achievement.

Scholarship plus workmanship serves to integrate both kinds of knowledge. The document contains three papers which present the following issues central to both adult education and James' statement: (1) where to look, (2) need to know, and (3) what to know in relation to knowledge of and knowledge about adult students. The paper on where to look describes demographic and psychographic analyses and the use of a marketing needs approach to provide information in relation to knowledge of and knowledge about the adult learner. The second paper discusses  knowledge of and knowledge about an adult student's need to know which is seen as concerned with the human as well as economic developmental stages of the adult learner and calls for a flexible learning situation (including experiential learning) to meet those needs. The third issue concerns what to know and its many dimensions including curriculum and appropriate instructional strategies. A task force approach for designing a more flexible learning environment is described. (Author/MS)",

It is maintained that atypical research is appropriate as ancillary and complementary to typical research. Following Guba's explication of &quot;experimental&quot; research, six characteristics of literary analysis (applied to literary life-cycle research) are identified. Literary life-cycle research which is used by the researcher to describe the life cycle in terms of information gathered from literary works; (1) is complementary to conventional empirical research, (2) is comparative, (3) is explicative, (4) is interpretive, (5) is disciplined, and (6) can be viewed as a form of case  history research. A procedural model for literary analysis is presented. The model is illustrated with an example of how analysis of literature discloses knowledge about the nuances of the so-called mid-life crisis. It is concluded that literary analysis has the potential for generating knowledge about human development and the phases of adult development, and that this knowledge is highly valuable for the practitioner of adult education.

Two groups of students, 428 on campus and 516 off campus and 23 faculty members participated in the study. During the 1974-75 academic year, the sample responded to a 93-item instrument which elicited demographic information and an evaluation of the course elements and also contained a measure of intellectual ability (the Quick Word Test partial scale). Findings tended to support earlier research indicating that faculty members generally thought on-campus education was at least of an equal quality with that offered off-campus. Student responses differed significantly with earlier studies which  supported the concept that off-campus education was of equal or greater quality than its on-campus counterpart. Students in this study indicated that on-campus courses were of a far superior quality when compared to similar ones off-campus. Responses were analyzed by using a one-way analysis of variance, a two-way analysis of variance, a dependent-test, and a Scheffe analysis for multiple comparisons.

Eighty-five Rhode Island students, 35 in advanced Adult Basic Education (ABE) classes and 50 in high school equivalency classes, completed cloze passages taken from three sources. Deletions were at the 1:5 ratio. Data analysis was done on exact replacements. Cloze procedure was found acceptable as fewer than 25% of the students rated it uninteresting and only 7% of the 122 items were not attempted by at least 75% of the students. It appears to be useful in matching  students to instructional materials as more advanced groups of students show higher mean scores than less advanced groups; and means scored on passages of similar difficulty levels were significantly correlated. The data proved insufficient to answer the question on substitutability for standardized tests. The paper develops some suggestions for practical applications of cloze procedure in adult literacy programs. A 12-item bibliography is included. (Author/MS)",

Arithmetic and geometric means were computed and plotted for each of the 26 learning activities. Analysis of the results indicates that the magnitudes do constitute a ratio scale. Analysis of covariance revealed age and years of schooling completed to be significant  sources of variance on several scale items and sex was found to have a significant effect on one item. Test re-test reliability coefficients with a one month interval between tests, and a cross-modal matching technique with a one week interval between tests indicated the reliability of the instrument.

The 13 components or concepts cited as inducers of energy are: legitimacy of ignorance, commitment to the best, valuing the person, respect for competency in role, expectation of vital experience, uncertainty of outcome, optimism about outcome, sense of direction, dilemma, disclosure, feedback, risk, and reward from experiencing the experience. Each concept is  carefully examined in regard to the difficulties of operationalizing it within real world settings and measuring the extent of its existence and change. Suggestions are provided for universal operationalization and for instrumentation to measure each concept, as well as for research directions for confirming, disconfirming or modifying the theory. Implications are drawn for teaching behavior and practice which would be consistent with the theory.

Null hypotheses were tested for effects on the criterion variables knowledge and attitudes, their relationship to selected variates, and their  durability over time. The variates county of employment, teaching level, prior educational experience with the institution, sex, race, and degrees were not found to be significantly related to changed attitudes. However, race was significantly related to performance on a test of knowledge. A four-month followup indicated significant losses in knowledge and attitudes from post-testing but both remained significantly more positive than for the control group.

In contrast to more conventional values, making use of available sources of aid elicited a high  proportion of favorable mentions, while status in the eyes of others and conforming personal appearance and conduct were given moderately low position. The results indicate a high degree of realism on the part of the poor and suggest that they might tolerate or respect approaches which do not gloss over that reality with euphemisms. Methodologically, the study demonstrates that it is possible to derive reliable and highly useful data from the analysis of loosely-structured interviews. Appended are sample interview questions.

        "description":"The applicability of the Critical Incidents Technique as a potential research methodology for those in adult and continuing education is demonstrated in the study of 19 selected Kansas junior-community colleges and their respective administrators (totaling 38) at the vice-president, dean, and director levels. The two populations included those with academic (degree oriented) responsibilities and those with adult-continuing education and community service (non-credit) responsibilities. The objective was to identify administrative behavior which might lead to greater accomplishment of the adult-continuing education and community service function. Data were initially collected through a mailed questionnaire with followup information gathered by having each group report four  incidents, two positive and two negative, relative to achievement of their administrative role. Findings are reported according to the questionnaire items which represented general and specific areas including administrative task characteristics, administrative practice, and program planning and development perceptions over both implementation and importance scales. The critical incidents are listed in two categories: positive or successful, and negative or unsuccessful. The paper also discusses the administrator effectiveness model on which the study was based, a definition of the Critical Incident Technique and its development, and recommendations for further research. A three-page bibliography concludes the study. (Author/MS)",

        "description":"Many organizations assign responsibility for planning, administering, and coordinating programs of training for their employees or members to a specialist whose title is usually director of education or training. Not much is known, however, about the process by which that role emerges. By studying the way training evolves in organizations where training directors have been appointed, an evolutionary process which relates to training in organizations generally may be found and brought into focus. The investigation is an attempt at identification of the phases through which training in organizations proceeds as it becomes increasingly formalized. Training is defined as adult socialization offering adaptive and control opportunities to the sponsoring organization. A six stage  developmental model was hypothesized. Utilizing the Blau/Scott organization typology for purposes of differentiation, an industrial firm, a labor union, a hospital, and a police department were selected for study and the developmental path of training in each was analyzed and compared. The hypothesized model was reexamined in the light of the data collected. A revised model is proposed and its utility discussed. The relationship between the evolution of training and that of other control functions in organizations is also examined. (Author)",

The author demonstrates: (1) positive findings related to the feasible use of the computer in data analyses and report writing for administrative purposes, and (2) preliminary, yet encouraging, findings in the area of computer managed instruction for Adult Basic Education (ABE) students. The research findings presented are based on a review of the literature, investigation of computer application models, and a two-year computer application in Massachusetts. The described computer application is a response to seven ABE needs identified on several levels which are delineated and discussed in depth in the paper. The body of the paper is divided into two major sections. The first is  a discussion of administrative uses of the computer in Adult Education and includes a chart of current ABE administrative computer applications in various States. The second section deals with instructional uses (computer managed and computer assisted instruction) and contains a descriptive chart of major computer managed instruction systems in operation. Within these two broad sections substantial references are made to significant contributions in the field and to the Massachusetts application specifically.

        "description":"The five point scale is the most frequently applied scaling used in the current practices for evaluating instructor classroom performance through graduate student observations. Hence, the investigation addressed itself toward determining, through a series of 55 computerized exact randomization tests, at what degree of mean differences would several graduate student reported classroom means produce statistical significance at alpha .05 on a one-tailed test in either direction. Obviously, the primary intent was to sort out nonrandom from random reported observations so when an instructor compared two means on himself from two classes or a comparison between two instructors and their reported means were compared, such evidence was to be nonrandom rather than random as usually  required in behavioral theory and analysis. The results indicated that an instructor would have to have a mean difference between 2.25 and 2.50 to assure himself reasonably that the reported observations on him were nonrandom. The simulated results revealed several severe constraints with the five point scale, making its practical application and interpretation most questionable. Two references are listed. (Author/JR)",

        "description":"The GED occupies a well earned position of strength as an accepted and reliable program of 30 years standing. Nearly 2.2 million civilians have passed the GED and 300,000 people in the United States are earning their high school diplomas each year by passing the GED at State-set levels. Although there will be new national norming and new forms of the examination in the spring of 1977, the basic rationale for the program, formulated mainly by E. F. Lindquist in the early 1940's, will remain unchanged. Research on the GED is sufficient to document that it has its limitations (such as uncontrollable variables) just as every attempt to measure and categorize human endeavor has. The strengths and weaknesses, however, of any approach for evaluating learning and competency (including  the traditional classroom) when added up will probably balance out rather evenly. Three GED issues that relate to its impact on people and the educational process are: its need to reach more non-high school graduates, the need for alternative assessment procedures and programs with proper standards, and the need to consider the discriminatory aspects of educational credentialing and the possibility of another type of useful certification at a lower level.

        "description":"The Shawano County Evaluation Project examines the results of programing efforts by Extension personnel, county and statewide, over a 15-year period. It attempts to deal with results of all 13 Extension program areas, which range from 4-H to programs for doctors, lawyers, and other professionals. The paper describes the four major variables being examined, through interviews with both a random sample of 1,200 households and selected people known to have high contact with Extension. They are: (1) nature and amount of contact, (2) perception of helpfulness of that contact, (3) examples of specific results, (4) overall benefit framework. The variables are designed to fit and relate information about specific programs at a macro level. The paper describes how a telephone interview  schedule was developed for use both with people with little or no contact with Extension and those who had had extensive contact. The paper also discusses certain philosophical assumptions inherent in this approach to macro-level program evaluation: (1) in adult education, few program participants hold the same specific objectives, but most have common broad objectives, (2) perception of help and value is as important as, or more important than, proof of results being attained.

The study employed the Delphi Technique, a method of collecting and organizing data in which a convergence of group consensus is accomplished through a series of four questionnaires. From two lists of adult education professors in North America, a sample of 197 was selected; 141 agreed to participate. From open ended responses regarding knowledges and skills on Questionnaire 1, Questionnaire 2 listed 48 knowledges and 53 skills statements for respondents to rank. On Questionnaire 3 respondents were asked to join the consensus on the priority  rankings of the statements from Questionnaire 2 or to explain their disagreement. These questionnaires helped to identify six general categories of skills and knowledges: adult educators themselves, the field of adult education, the adult learner, the adult education environment, adult education programing, and the adult learning process. Questionnaire 4, which examined appropriate learning experiences for each skill or knowledge, indicated that the most appropriate learning experiences were practical on-the-job situations integrated with university based experiences, such as classes and seminars.

        "description":"The document presents an evaluation of the two year Bachelor of Science Agriculture program for Gramsevaks, or village level workers, initiated by the G. B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology, India in 1961. An employment questionnaire was sent to all agricultural graduates, 1963-71, for whom valid addresses existed. A return rate of 52% for two year degree Gramsevaks and 32% for regular three year degree holders resulted, with data analyzed through cost-benefit analysis. Results indicate that the Gramsevak program demonstrated the effective use of a program of recurrent education both from the standpoint of efficiency and equity. The social rate of return was shown to be equal to or greater than the comparable return for the regular agricultural graduate. The higher  return was dependent on the reduction of the program for Gramsevaks by one year. The one year reduction in the degree program was tantamount to substituting five years of experience in agricultural extension for one year of university course work. The better academic performance of Gramsevaks despite weaker educational background and being out of school for 10 years or more indicated that no deterioration occurred in their ability to perform in an academic environment.

Information was collected through interviews with 2,845 individuals in May and 1,960 individuals in November. The results of the surveys are presented for the following areas: (1) career goals--both surveys revealed that the most important occupational goals were pay and secure/steady employment; (2) global assessment of military service--an improvement in attitudes was revealed in the November survey; (3) image--no substantial changes in the image of the various Services was determined; (4) the active enlisted force--both surveys revealed that younger men were most likely to  plan enlistment; (5) the active officer force--the November survey revealed a willingness among college juniors and seniors to volunteer as officers; (6) the Reserves/National Guard--a favorable reaction to join was evidenced in both surveys; (7) alternative concepts in military service--both surveys supported an all-volunteer military service; and (8) exposure to the military--both surveys revealed substantial exposure to the military service by respondents.

Norton Grubb of Berkeley and Martin Lazerson of the University of British Columbia--fired a thunderous broadside at career education and vocational education. The editor's summary puts the matter succinctly. \"Grubb and Lazerson concluded that the ills career education proposes to solve...are intrinsic to our economic system.\" But what is most remarkable about the article is the confusion it created in the ranks of both career and vocational educators. Many felt abused and defenseless. The attack exposed a serious vulnerability. We have no systematic rationale. We have no solid sense of identity and purpose. We do not always have a sure sense of our relationship to the other  necessary aspects of education. We need a new outreach to the nation's thought leaders. We need a new rationale, solidly rooted in sound scholarship. We need a coherent national policy. And I think we should, at least in private, thank God for scholars like Grubb and Lazerson who take vocational education seriously enough to criticize it extensively. We can only profit from such attention. (Author/LH)",

As in other kinds of issues, there are four major ways to influence policy: legislative, administrative, judicial, or electoral. Students and instructors in the wide range of institutions and settings of the learning society can organize themselves into groups called Learning Societies to promote the advancement of lifelong learning. Not only could Learning Societies organize themselves around political issues but they can also serve as umbrella organizations for a variety of learning activities which may be desired though unavailable in the local community. A Learning Society can be attached to a free  university, learning exchange, adult education center, or some other similar group. A more powerful alternative or supplement to the private Learning Society is the selection of a Community Learning Opportunities Council (CLOC) by the Mayor, City Manager, County Executive, or other executive officer or responsible body. The goal then is to establish as local, State, and Federal policy that every individual has the right to learn. (A lifelong learning platform presents 20 goals.) (Author/LH)",

Seven major concepts about supervision were identified and a guiding principle for each concept was developed. The concepts relate to: research, innovation, design, dissemination, demonstration, trial, and implementation. After screening and field testing two questionnaires, asking for ranking of basic principles and concepts related to the seven concepts, were sent to administrators, supervisors, teacher educators, supervising teachers, and general supervisors from colleges and secondary  schools. Out of a sample of 174 individuals, 125 responded to the first questionnaire; of these 125 participants, 106 responded to the second questionnaire. Responses showed: (1) that all seven basic principles received consensus ratings of important or essential from 90% or more of the respondents, and (2) identified 74 of the 140 competencies related to the major concepts as important or essential. Several questions raised by the study are presented. A seven-page bibliography and a glossary are included.

Explicit, sequential learning modules are presented for grade level groupings and include a wide range of activities for various sub-groups of students in the following broad areas: self, education, careers, decision-making, and economics. Each area contains 4-12 units within each of the categories: vocabulary, knowledge, attitudes, and skills. Individual units contain a unit goal, developmental objectives, and activities, behavioral evaluations, preparations, and resources for each objective. The developmental  sequence followed by the guide focuses on: developing insights about self and environments (K-3); developing awareness, with emphasis upon the effect of specific psychological factors (4-6); examining social and academic exploration and decision-making (7-9); dealing with specifics in terms of interests, abilities, and values and linking school and the student's immediate future (10-12). Suggested basic strategy for using the guide includes introducing concepts and activities at the point judged appropriate for student sub-groups based upon sample needs data, and then, at a later level, repeating similar experiences of emphasis and refinement.

From the descriptions of practice in the six professions, a general model portraying the program development process was developed and used for comparative analysis. The study was conducted in two phases. Phase 1 was based on the research methods of grounded theory. The observations made in Phase 1 were used to design an instrument to test the strengths of those observations and modify the general planning model. The model developed was also compared to several portrayals presented in the literature of continuing education. Results indicate planners: attend to at least six clusters of activities in their  program development processes in a fairly consistent sequence, make limited use of knowledge resources available in the literature, and use a wide variety of resources available inside the university and outside the university. The model resulting from the study portrays the various resource systems planners link to the program development process. Differences in strategies of program development in various professional fields do exist. These differences are usually a matter of ordering and emphasis given to specific activities in the program development clusters. (Author/MS)",

No matter how hard one tries to make distinctions among the terms \"continuing or lifelong education,\"\"education permanente,\" and \"recurrent education,\" they have become the catch-words of competitive bureaucracies, each seeking leadership in what appears to all of them to be Europe's new growth industry in education--adult education in behalf of economic and material prosperity. European adult educators, in general, would  appear to be accepting the trend as inevitable although some are quite reluctant about it. When one hears all these good words and the promises of progress through innovation in adult education, I think it would be wise for Europeans and North Americans alike to ponder longer and harder than they have as yet done. For, make no mistake, the issues confronting Europe are confronting us today in North America. (Author)",

The main study objectives were to obtain qualitative and quantitative measurements of attainment and use of literacy skills, the impact of the program on the individual with particular emphasis on changes in agricultural production, and teaching/learning situation. Experimental groups of 240 randomly selected respondents from 12 villages who had attended functional literacy classes were matched with 80 control group respondents from four villages without functional literacy programs and assessed for: (1) literacy attainment (reading  ability level, writing ability level, arithmetic performance level, degree of comprehension, degree of application of reading/writing ability, and number of drop-outs); (2) living standard; (3) professional competence; (4) relation toward means of mass communication and personal sources; (5) attitude toward education; and (6) social participation. The data, which is presented in tabular form, positively related high literacy achievement to knowledge regarding High Yield Variety package practices, more adoption of farm technology, and more favorable attitudes toward adult literacy programs. An evaluation form is appended. (EA)",

        "description":"The primary intent of the study of 42 adults in West Central Minnesota was to discover what adult learners perceived as barriers to continuing education. Twelve of the adults interviewed were enrolled in a baccalaureate degree and 30 expressed an interest in postsecondary education but currently were not enrolled (20 future degree seekers and 10 non-degree seekers). All but two had obtained a high school diploma and all but four had completed some post-high school study. Ages ranged from early twenties to the late fifties, with most individuals married and assuming family responsibilities. Five barriers identified were: (1) access to educational facilities, (2) family responsibilities, (3) finances, (4) time, and (5) motivation. Most barriers involved both situational and  value-related elements. Eleven of the current degree seekers were able to overcome the situational barrier of access to educational facilities by pursuing the University Without Walls degree at the University of Minnesota, Morris. The study sample population, with access to educational facilities and family responsibilities as the greatest barriers, differed from a national sample by Cross and Valley indicating time and finances to be the greatest barriers. Various implications for adult educators are drawn. (EA)",

Sixty extension workers in the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program in New York State comprised the population for tests between major variables. The number was reduced to 47 for tests of the contingency theory. Three intervening variables describing the leader's operating situation were: leader-member relations, task structure, and position power. Eight situations are described by the three variables ranging from very favorable to very unfavorable for the leader. Two quantitative measures of group performance  were employed: a Single Factor Score and an Exposure Index. The first hypothesis, which postulated a negative relationship between LPC and self-concept, was rejected. The second hypothesis, which considered the response variability of each respondent in low, intermediate, and high LPC groups advanced the notion that a curvilinear relationship existed between LPC score and response variability. The third hypothesis, which viewed response variability with regard only to each person's average LPC score, demonstrated a negative relationship between self-concept and response variability. (JR)",

An historical overview discusses the origins of the current Federal role in adult education through a brief chronological narrative focusing on three program categories which serve adults with less than a high school education: (1) education for civilian and government employees, (2) manpower development programs, and (3) programs to develop literacy and basic skills. The Economic Opportunity Act, 1964, and the Adult Education Act, 1966, with its 1968, 1970, 1972, and 1974 amendments, are examined separately in terms of: legislative history, purpose,  definitions, grants to States, State plans and allotments, and other descriptive areas, where necessary. A summary of major revisions for the Adult Education Act reports revisions under the headings used in the legislation. Selected statistics for adult education State grant programs, aggregate United States, fiscal years 1965-1974, are tabulated. Topics for further inquiry regarding historical perspectives are suggested and an outline of selected events in the history of the Federal role in adult education traces activities from 1777 through 1969.

The second chapter focuses on setting measurable objectives and enumerates some of the recurring roadblocks to successful MBO implementation. Chapter 3 explains 16 guidelines for writing objectives while procedures for evaluating and revising the objectives are discussed in chapter 4. Chapter 5 deals with objective setting in areas considered difficult  to manage by objectives (public relations, educational programs, financial areas, and personnel departments). Implementation and assessment of an MBO program are described in chapters 6 and 7. The final chapter briefly discusses some frequent pitfalls encountered in MBO application. Appended are: checklists for applicability of MBO to non-profit organizations and for writing objectives in MBO, a diagram showing how to set objectives, and bibliographic references on overcoming resistance to change.

A combination of tutorial-inquiry teaching strategy permitted the student nurses in the study to gather data, perform simulated experiments, and respond to questions as they interacted with the computer. The PLATO system and procedures used in the study (the 140 subjects, instructional content, lesson preparation, content evaluation, the instructional method, the teaching logic, and record keeping) are described. The results presented showed that, by objective measurement,  students learned the same material presented in a classroom on PLATO as well or better in one-third to one-half the time. Student and instructor attitudes toward PLATO were found to be generally favorable. Also included is a 15-item reference list and the following appended material: comparison and evaluation data for lesson forms, learning for specific lessons, and student performance; forms for student and teacher evaluation of PLATO; lesson objectives and sample materials; and a materials evaluation form.

The study was based on the following objectives: (1) improvement of instruction in the elementary accounting sequence, and (2) help for transfer students from two-year institutions. The materials under development are part of the Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operation IV system (PLATO IV). One feature of the system which is extensively used in the accounting materials is provision for the student to enter arithmetic or algebraic expressions as a response to a question. The expression can then be evaluated and the result compared to the correct answer. This feature allows the student to concentrate on the method of solution.  The advantages and potential disadvantages of the CAI system are discussed. Twenty-six lessons were developed for the first semester and seventeen for the second semester of a course in financial accounting, and their testing and implementation are described. Examination results and an analysis of student time and completion of homework revealed significant differences in favor of the PLATO IV instruction. (Author/EC)",

The report opens with a discussion of the theoretical question: What makes a successful two-year college president? Survey questionnaires were sent to 326 present presidents (235 responded) and 222 former presidents (148 responded). Information was collected for the following areas: (1) demographic considerations, (2) roles of two-year college presidents, (3) influence of presidents on selected college factors, (4) college orientation perceptions of presidents, (5) decision making activities of presidents, (6) work schedules of presidents, and (7) status of former presidents. The responses of present and past presidents to each question are  tabulated and discussed at length. The author notes a tendency for former presidents to perceive themselves as having more influence on matters than do present presidents. They were also more likely to assign first ranking to vocational studies, which was ranked second by present presidents. A list of references is included. The questionnaires and letters sent to present and former presidents and State directors of two-year colleges are appended. (EC)",

        "description":"The Rand paper on programs facilitating the mid-life career redirection of unemployed aerospace professionals is 1 of 20 policy-related research reports commissioned by the Division of Social Systems and Human Resources in the Research Applied to National Needs Program of the National Science Foundation. It is based on the evaluation of some 300 items of literature on the topic of mid-life career redirection. Evaluation criteria were internal and external validity and policy relevance. The paper evaluates those items which assess the effectiveness of the private and public sectors of our economy to mount schemes to deal with the problem of the involuntary career change of aerospace engineers and scientists. It assesses employment programs ranging from those based on the  assumption that comparable jobs are available somewhere in the economy to others which assume that retraining and skills conversion are required in order to get professionals reemployed. The review of the literature revealed that unsuccessful retraining programs failed because of inadequate program design, retraining costs, trainees' age, and the nature of labor market information systems. It was concluded that, if retraining programs were to be successful, counseling and job information services should be a prominent feature of such programs. (Author/BP)",

(The programs were representative of the three major types of nursing education: (1) diploma (hospital connected), (2) associate degree, and (3) baccalaureate.) The discrepancies were examined through content analysis of stated program goals, utilizing written summaries of faculty interviews and four testing instruments (Personal Orientation Inventory, 16PF, a Humanitarianism Scale, and a Rokeach Dogmatism Scale). Comparison of stated curriculum objectives with instructor-supervisor-environmental program components indicated that  educational strategies of many instructional/supervisory personnel were a probable source of many of the discrepancies. Altering strategies in a direction more congruent to the affective behavior predicted in the curriculum goals, and/or adopting those strategies recommended by a panel of educational experts, improved the observational/measurement indicators of attained affect and, often, instructor-supervisor's interest in monitoring for congruence. The document concludes with 11 pages of testing result data and a two-page bibliography. (Author/BP)",

Each course requires four hours per week. Contents for each course are organized as follows: introduction, general course objectives, general student behavioral objectives, methodology, references, teacher preparation, student activities (lecture and laboratory), and student evaluation (including testing, counseling, and grading policies). A topic outline and instructional objectives for each semester are also included. The topic outline is organized into units, with each unit  terminating in a laboratory experience called the activity. An approximate hour allocation for each unit and activity are given, based upon 50 minutes as one contact hour. Specific instructional objectives are stated for each unit and activity of the topic outline. Suggested guidelines for preparing handout sheets to accompany the laboratory investigations and a sample handout sheet are included. (Author/RG)",

Licensed practical nurses, nurses aides, and operating room technicians employed in hospitals or nursing homes were the groups selected as a target population. Learning needs of these groups were identified through a questionnaire survey. Perceptions of learning needs were also obtained from instructional and supervisory personnel. Based on the findings of the survey, it was determined that the extreme diversity of learning needs of these occupational groups required the establishment of a learning center with a flexible  approach to programing, rather than the more narrowly defined continuing education center. Guidelines were developed for the planning, implementation, and evaluation of such a center. Contents of the report include: a study of the related literature, basic assumptions about the selected occupational groups, methods and procedures, data analysis, summary, conclusions and recommendations (including the guidelines developed), and a bibliography. Appended are background information of the survey sample and suggested forms for use in the proposed learning center. (Author/RG)",

The training program is based on a specific task analysis of the position of developing and operating an ORC. A behavior checklist is given to each paraprofessional. Three levels of proficiency as a paraprofessional are possible. Most paraprofessionals attain Level I skills during the three-week training program. Training includes clerical, graphics, audiovisual, human relations, and occupational resource center skills. A training schedule by topic and hour is included in the report. Prerequisites for entry into the program include ability to read and write,  desire to work with people, and commitment from professional educator to employ the paraprofessional after training is completed. The format of the training program is varied and changes frequently to avoid too much lecture, too much discussion, or too much skill practice. Evaluation and followup data indicate the value of a skill oriented training program as well as the necessity to involve the professional supervisor or counselor in the training program. A team concept of paraprofessional and professional working together is considered essential. Evaluation data is included in the report. (Author)",

The interrelated concepts of task(s), social structure, culture, and social process help explicate the overwhelming emphasis on direct clinical service at the cost of indirect service. The historical evolution of the task-mandate and the professional and organizational structures of the CMHCs to their legislative origins is traced. Nonrational aspects of the social process during the 1960's contributed to an illusion of radical social change, despite the actual ongoing predominance of the clinical approach. Considering possible future directions of the community mental health center, the authors describe the advantages of a sociopsychological approach in providing  a conceptual base for the integration of direct and indirect services.

Personality Q sorts at four ages--early and late teens, ages 40 and 50--were used to assess personality change and overall psychological health. Q sorts were based on extensive data and applied independently at each age level. Among \"healthy\" men and women at age 50, two patterns of development were identified: (1) A stable pattern consisting of 7 men and 7 women whose health had remained high and stable from ages 40 to 50; (2) An improved pattern consisting of 14 men and 17 women whose health was poor at 40 but improved significantly by 50. Sex differences within each pattern were analyzed in terms of the fit between  personality and sex role conformity. Personalities of stable men and women fit traditional sex roles. Traditional men and women moved smoothly into middle age with little change in life style. Personalities of male and female improvers were less congurent with traditional sex roles. Nontraditional men and women supressed cross-sex characteristics in early adulthood but revived these characteristics by age 50 with upsurge in psychological health. (Author)",

The paper was written and presented at the Austin conference and reflects the author's efforts as a participant-conceptualizer who spent a good deal of time visiting and listening to as many task groups as possible. He dropped his own notions of needed conceptual directions in community psychology and concentrated on obtaining the essential generated at the conference itself. The procedure was enhanced by audio taping, and a good deal of the paper consists of the thoughts and complete statements made by a variety of participants at the conference. These were extracted from the tapes and woven into an organized form. In an important sense, then, this is not a  singularly authored paper, but one that reflects, at least in part, the issues and concerns of many people at the conference. Narrative was minimally edited in an effort to preserve the spontaneity of the presentation. (Author/CJ)",

        "description":"The hypothesis of a negative relationship between level of self-actualization and fear of death was based on the assumption that people are not afraid of death per se but of the incompleteness of their lives. Fear of death was furthermore assumed to inhibit orientation toward the future, thereby restricting movement toward achievement and self-fulfillment. In contrast, acceptance of death and acknowledgement of one's finitude is thought to act as a galvanizing force, impelling one toward creativity and accomplishment. If one succeeds in it, the fear of the incompleteness of one's life and with it the fear of death should be conquered. An interview schedule and a semantic differential scale were devised to tap attitudes toward death on conscious and fantasy levels. Interviews were  conducted with two groups of highly self-actualized individuals, 10 artists and 10 scientists, ranked as outstanding in their field, and with two control groups of respondents. The artists and scientists did not differ significantly in their attitudes toward death, though distinctive tendencies of intragroup homogeneities emerged in each of the groups. Significant differences were found in the hypothesized direction between the two high actualized groups and the control groups. (Author)",

The career information system is three basic services: A needle-sort (manual) delivery of occupational information; a computerized delivery of this information; and career education inservice activities for school districts. Each of the 252 job briefs specifies qualifications, work descriptions, earnings and benefits, advantages and disadvantages, employment and advancement opportunities, preparation required and training available, and additional sources of information. Notice of training  opportunities in Iowa for the various occupations is also readily accessible. The report describes activities in the area of evaluation of the system to date.

        "author":["Scheff, Thomas J."],
        "description":"This paper proposes and tests a theory of catharsis of repressed emotion. The key concept in this theory is the balance of attention, a concept that is shown to be equivalent to aesthetic distance. Laughter and other emotional releases occur when one's attention is equally divided between a distressful past event and the safe present. In the audience for a drama, this situation occurs most frequently when the audience knows something that one or more of the characters don't know. To test this theory, a tape was obtained of the audience response to a play (Twelfth Night). There were 281 instances of audience laughter. To predict these instances, the script was independently coded for discrepant awareness. For example, the audience knows that the heroine, Viola, is disguised as a  man. Every line in the script in which she is referred to as a man by a character who thinks she is a man is rated as an instance of discrepant awareness. Then the instances of laughter and of discrepant awareness are tabulated jointly. A moderately strong correlation is found, providing support for the theory of catharsis. The thesis of this article is that a theory of catharsis will help to predict the occurrence of several kinds of emotional response of which one is laughter. (Author/CJ)",

        "description":"Recent studies on racial self-esteem show a reversal in the tendency for black children to have negative self-concepts. This research explored the causal explanations for such a reversal by investigating the process by which social status, parental attitudes, and socialization practices influence the development of black children's racial preferences and stereotypes. Data were obtained from interviews with 60 black mothers of five or six year old children, and from a race awareness test of the children in the home. The theoretical model predicted that the SES variables (mother's occupation, mother's education, and family income) affects two family relationship variables (mother's racial attitudes, and mother's socialization practices such as presence of black cultural objects and  teaching of blacks' treatment in society) which in turn affects the child's racial self-esteem (measures of child's own race preference and racial stereotypes). It was further hypothesized that the socialization variables would be the most effective predictors of children's racial self-esteem and act as mediators of the socioeconomic and attitudinal variables. The underlying theoretical model was supported. It was also found that the socialization variables were the most effective predictors of children's racial self-esteem. It was found, however, that not all of the effects on the child's racial self-esteem were mediated through socialization. (Author/NG)",

Eigthteen counselors received Form A as a pretest and Form B as a posttest and 16 counselors received Form B as a pretest and Form A as a posttest. Twenty-one subjects returned the follow-up questionnaire (same as posttest) sent to them one month later. The results showed that counselors' attitudes became significantly more liberalized after the workshop and that these changes were retained at the time of  follow-up, regardless of which form was administered.

All school personnel undergo training in those skills which are necessary to create a positive emotional climate at the school, as well as those skills which are necessary to screen out adolescents who are at high risk for acting out behavior. Specific differential responses are taught to the trainees which they are encouraged to implement in their work with troubled adolescents at school. Continuous on-site consultation at the school is provided to the trainees. Neuropsychological consultations are provided to  schools' pupil services committees in which youngsters with learning and behavior disorders are evaluated. Training and consultation efforts are all geared toward promoting effective direct helping responses by trainees, and to familiarizing trainees with other existing community diagnostic and treatment resources. Tertiary prevention efforts are focused upon refining the skills of the county's juvenile probation workers in their work with adolescents whose behavior has already brought them into contact with the courts. There is a strong emphasis on the need to evaluate clients' strengths and weaknesses, and appropriate methodologies for doing so. (Author/NG)",

        "description":"This paper explores Q-Factor Analysis as a method of organizing data on a large array of variables to describe a group of aged Ss. Forty-seven males, specially selected for their good health (Mean Age: 71.5; SD: 4.8) were measured on 550 biological and behavioral variables. A Q-Factor Analysis was calculated, using a S by variable matrix, which is the transpose of the common R-Factor Analysis. Sixteen Q-Factors resulted which were then correlated with the original variables so as to give content meaning to each factor. Seven of the 16 derived O's were associated with verbal intelligence performance. The content of the factors offered a means of describing each S's characteristic functioning. Since the results are extensive, only results on the first Q-Factor were reported. An  analysis showed the Ss to be distributed between \"haves\" and \"have nots\" in relation to physical and mental well-being. Thus, the\"haves\" were more intelligent, better adjusted, younger, happier, faster reacting, with better hearing, and healthier. The \"have nots\" showed evidence of early CNS deterioration. It was concluded that Q-Factor Analysis provides factors through which the individual in a group of aged Ss can be described, thus condensing a large body of data. Analysis of the first factor showed how the Ss can be grouped with specific differentiating characteristics. (Author)",

The author notes that unlike most work with older adults which is based largely on the principles of behavior modification, \"competent coping\" therapy takes a psychodynamic approach. The older person's adaptive style is seen as composed of both trait and dynamic components. Based on the assumption that awareness of a wide variety of coping strategies may facilitate the individual's own coping behavior, the therapy utilizes a group approach and focuses on sharing problem solving strategies and experiences.

        "description":"The paper focuses on the relationship between changing societal norms and actual, emotional acceptance of them for oneself, with regard to changing norms toward women's roles as they relate to the areas of abortion and sexual behavior. Elective abortion still is regarded by many as a \"deviant\" activity. Such a view has sprung from an uncritical acceptance of the traditional role of women. The implications are that women who have abortions accept traditional norms for sexual behavior, in spite of their own sexual activity, and have a generally traditional view of women's roles. They are considered to behave stereotypically and to have failed. Traditional norms for women's roles have been challenged in recent years, however, especially by the feminist movement. The authors  hypothesized that women who sought early abortions tend to have feminist orientations. The paper is based on a pilot study of 71 patients at an abortion clinic, done during summer, 1974. The women studied showed little lag in emotional acceptance of changing norms about women's roles. They indicated an overt feminist orientation, and saw themselves as competent, self-directed, and legitimately sexual persons, with extra-maternal and self-acutalizing goals. They appeared to make the decision to have an abortion primarily on a rational basis, and most did not have any great conflict over that decision. The findings by and large substantiated the authors' hypotheses. (Author)",

In order that it be accepted by the local board of education, a copy was placed on file with the board clerk, each local administrator, and counselor. The Policy Statement establishes rationale, responsibilities, and identity; what would and would not be expected of the counselor in  the delivery of his professional services. The policy statement would be approved by State Department of Education and be part of the 15 accrediting standards for each secondary building. This process has been piloted, orientation and implementation seminars have been held for schools involved in the process and is being phased in across the state by groups in about 100 schools.

To date, the best controlled of these studies have consistently reported the two procedures to be equally effective. However, the effects of the token contingencies have been confounded with those of instructions. The present study compared these two procedures when no instructions were given regarding the token contingencies. Token delivery was not effective in decreasing disruptive behavior in any of the children, while a combination of token delivery and removal was effective for three of four children. The results suggest that the combined  procedure may be effective with certain populations that are not readily controlled by instruction. (Author)",

Pre-experimental expectations have been used to explain the effects of status in small groups. In the present research, expectations are measured on two levels. As predicted, ability has an effect in same-sex dyads. Also relevancy of the task has an effect in cross-sex dyads. In mixed sex,  mixed ability dyads, males given high ability feedback have more influence than females given low ability feedback. However, in the cross-sex, equal ability, neutral task condition, males do not have greater influence as predicted. Expectations are not a very satisfactory explanation for influence during dyadic interaction. Explanations for the unexpected findings are suggested as males' reaction to status threat and females' compliance to a \"norm of responsibility.\" Suggestions are made of theoretical reformulations, practical implications, and further research.

Questionnaire data from 278 women aged 18 to 50 were used to examine the relative importance of early socialization, present life situation, future aspirations, values, social support, and sex role ideology for career orientation. On the basis of preferred life style, the three groups of women were designed as Career-Primary, Career-Secondary and Homemaker-Primary. A Discriminant Analysis indicated that all of the six categories of variables were significant in discriminating the three groups of women. Furthermore, it was found that Sex Role Ideology was more powerful in  discriminating between groups than either of the previously researched variables of early socialization or present life situation. The results indicated that the sex role ideology of the Career-Primary group was more egalitarian or non-traditional than the other two groups, using Lipman-Blumen's (1971) Sex Role Ideology Scale. Results also yielded specific variables as possible precursors of the egalitarian Sex Role Ideology of the Career-Primary women. (Author/SE)",

The author first notes the distinction between punishment and corporal punishment. She views the latter as both unnecessary and harmful since it teaches the child to be an aggressor. Some of the acceptable forms of punishment described are negative practice, overcorrection, loss of privileges, extinction and time-out. The parent training program is based on the realization that corporal punishment is often the result of parental frustration; thus, it is only raised as an issue when the parents have been taught and can successfully use other techniques in modifying their child's behaviors. In the program  with child care personnel, the issue of corporal punishment is raised earlier since that program is shorter and less experiential. Such training programs are important and could usefully be provided by children's centers. (NG)",

Although the material was prepared especially for State and area agencies on aging, it can be used by local directors of projects, programs, or information and referral services. It has always been a cardinal principle in the United States that the public has the right to know what its money is being spent for and how well it is being used. The citizen must be well-informed about the workings of his government if he is to effectively carry out his citizenship responsibilities. Furthermore, if the public is to benefit from the  services you are helping to develop, people must know that they exist and how to reach them. When a new service is initiated you should mount a major public information campaign to inform people of its existence. There also needs to be periodical followup about the service. (Author/NG)",

        "description":"Since at least 4.5 million arrests per year involve people who may have alcohol problems, it is obvious that close cooperation between the courts and the alcoholism treatment progression would be productive. Since judges cannot themselves be expected either to identify or treat people with drinking problems, they need help in the form of a referral system. By using court support personnel to provide pre-sentence reports or screening and categorization techniques, judges can refer defendents to appropriate treatment. Judges can also ensure that treatment agencies get the time to help the defendents. They need support, however, to start, operate and monitor such a system. This report addresses itself to both judges and the alcohol treatment agencies--groups that heretofore have had  too little contact with each other. It presents some practical strategies for the implementation of alcohol referral systems. (Author/NG)",

        "description":"While a number of studies have documented a variety of attitudinal correlates of the subjective dimension of age, some writers have suggested that, especially at the older end of the life cycle, subjective age is but a surrogate for measures of disadvantaged social status. Specifically, this alternative view is that only the poor or retired or widowed or lower social class individuals are likely to identify themselves (and, hence, their problems) in terms of age. This paper, directly tests the proposition that variation in subjective identification is mainly a statistical function of measures of socioeconomic factors. The study is based on the 725 respondents over the age of 50 sampled in a national survey of the American adult population taken in 1972; the study included  measures of subjective age identification, as well as a number of social and economic indicators. The results indicated that subjective age is substantially related to chronological age, but that within groupings of chronological age (50-64, 64-75, 75+), the following factors do not measurably influence variations in subjective age: income, education, occupational status, subjective social class, sex, widowhood, retirement. A multiple regression analysis including all of these variables plus chronological age combined to explain only 8.6% of the variance in subjective age identification among the over-50 respondents. It is therefore concluded that subjective age is not simply a reflection of socioeconomic variables. (Author)",

Respondents 18-24 and 25-35 years of age were categorized as those having a subjective young identification, and those not expressing an age identification. A number of multi-item attitude scales in such areas as political alienation, fiscal optimism, and political protest were included; analysis focused on impact which subjective age identification made on the attitudes and on the organization of those attitudes. Three general  conclusions were documented: (1) A substantial proportion of the youngest age group exhibits a subjective young age identification, with the proportion being about half that in the 25-35 age group. (2) Subjective age identification does make a difference in both attitude-holding and attitudinal organization. Depending on the particular attitude examined, the subjectively young/and those with no subjective age identification exhibited different attitudinal patterns. (3) The influence of subjective age on sociopolitical attitudes is independent of variations in the socioeconomic status of the respondents. (Author)",

Each person responded to 72 agree-disagree statements constituting 24 attitude scales about economic well-being, self-image, morale, community life, family relationships, and general outlook. In both urban and rural samples the young-old reported more favorable socioeconomic conditions than the old-old. In the rural area slight differences were found between the attitudes of the young-old by a ration of 5.5 to one.

The fifteen subjects in the experimental group were told that the tests covered the lives of famous characters while the fifteen control group subjects were told that the passages were about fictitious characters. Analysis of results showed that, in comparison to control groups, subjects receiving initial passages labeled with fictitious names experienced significant retroactive interference, while subjects receiving famous name initial passages did not.

First, a number of studies reporting development of reading attitude measures are reviewed. Second, general criteria recommended for consideration in attitude scale development are presented. Third, some general comments about measuring reading attitude are made. Finally, a special reference section presents additional sources related to measurement and the affective domain, attitudinal measurement in education,  and attitudinal measurement in reading. Reading attitude measures are noted as representing three categories: self report instruments, direct observation, and projective techniques. Criteria for reading attitude test development are item development, response set contamination, and statistical procedures. It is noted that adequate conceptualization and definition of reading attitude constructs is still a major problem in research in the field. (MKM)",

The policy guidelines suggest that no projects involving risk for human subjects will be funded by DHEW unless the applicant (investigator) has established a peer review team, the results of which must be received by DHEW for further evaluation by the Secretary. It is argued that educational researchers, as part of the larger body of behavioral scientists, must take immediate steps to confront the issues involving the use of human subjects. There must be a  concerted effort to establish free-flowing lines of communication, not only within the educational research community, but throughout the public sector as well.

The instructional materials of the Chicago mastery reading package consist of four elements: skills units, comprehension units, enrichment activities and basal readers. Teacher training, classroom management, and record keeping procedures were developed during the first year of program implementation. Although all data has not yet been collected, it has become increasingly apparent  that reading instruction can be adapted to the mastery learning framework and utilized in a large city school system.

A logical step-by-step procedure for teaching the main idea is outlined for elementary teachers, including teaching main idea skills and teaching main ideas of paragraphs. The four step procedure includes writing  a brief statement identifying what each sentence says, identifying the one idea that all of the sentences discuss, writing the main idea in a complete sentence, and locating the sentence that states the main idea. Once the procedure has been mastered, the four steps can be applied equally to sentences, paragraphs, and longer selections. (TS)",

In the freshman English classes, best sellers were included in the list of books to be used as a basis for the research paper in an attempt to determine whether high interest level, low readability level books motivated students toward fuller research and better writing. Furthermore, the instructor tested the readability level of the books using Rudolph Flesch's \"Reading Ease\" Formula and the Fry Test of Readability. Table 1  lists the books used in the freshman English course and provides grade level equivalents for each using the Flesch formula. Table 2 contains Fry's graph for estimating reading levels and Table 3 demonstrates an analysis of a 100 word text using the Flesch Readability scale. (LL)",

Subjects, all the students enrolled at an open door community college in Tampa (Florida), took the Nelson-Denny Reading test. Readability levels of thirteen textbooks used in courses at the college were analyzed by the Dale-Chall formula (1948). Results showed that the students' mean vocabulary score was 12.9 and the mean comprehension score was 11.1; that five of the textbooks have a readability level of 16+, four have a readability level of 13-15, three have a readability level of 11-12, and one has a readability level of 7-8; and that, when comparing reading levels and readability  levels and employing a one-year differential, only one text--the literature anthology--would be a functional instructional tool.

Stages of reading include prereading skills (requiring an adequate spoken vocabulary), the ability to name letters and pictures, good memory for spoken sentences, and manual dexterity in copying patterns. Learning to read involves the ability to link the separate phonemes in a word with printed material. For most children, an auditory method is better than a visual one for teaching reading. Skilled reading depends on knowledge of word probabilities in speech and is characterized by the ability to transfer visual input into comprehension without the intervention of the speech system. The collaboration of the two sides of the brain is required for skilled reading. Poor  readers may reflect right brain superiority and be more adapt at visuo-spatially oriented disciplines.

The Phoneme Shifting Test was used to evaluate the phoneme shifting skill, specifically the shifting of the first and the last letters of words. Individual testing was done during October 1974. Phoneme shifting skills were found to be a variable that can discriminate among reading groups. Results indicated a difference existed between the good and the remedial groups and the adult group and the good group in the way they responded to the phoneme shifting measure. The remedial group and the nonreading adult group did not seem to differ in the way they responded. The discrepancy between the good readers' responses and those of the illiterate  adults provides some evidence that the adult would not profit from a traditional developmental program. (Author/JM)",

The implications of the model for the quality and characteristics of subjects' memory for stories were tested in a series of experiments using undergraduate college students. The study revealed that: (1) recall of a story was a function of the amount of inherent plot structure in the story; (2) story summarizations from memory tended to emphasize general structural characteristics rather than specific content; (3) structure and content manipulations  significantly influenced recall; and (4) false recognition rates for implicit inferences from a story were a function of the plausibility of the inferences and their roles as organizing and integrating devices for other information in the story.

The second step for a content analyst is to recognize and judge setting. There are six key words which may help the reader recognize setting: social, economic, religious, physical, political and psychological. The third step for the content analyst might be to recognize and judge the plot. The next steps  are to compare and contrast the personality characteristics of the main characters at the beginning and at the end of the selection and to recognize and judge the theme in realistic fiction. Teachers are warned that content analysis procedures should be used as guides and encouraged to allow the adolescent reader to be creative in attaining the general spirit of these procedures. (LL)",

A clear-cut determination of grade levels for reading materials has, however, not been defined. Grade and age equivalent scores on silent reading tests, readability scores attached to children's reading matter, and reading grade expectancy scores are investigated in light of their usefulness. The history of the grade equivalent scores used in standardized tests and in readability scores can be perceived as reflecting a circular, or skyhook relationship between these scores and curricular material. A testing procedure consisting of items beginning at a basal level, where a  student was convinced of his or her mastery, and continuing until a ceiling of error is reached can eliminate the inattention factor and the guess factor. In addition, such a system can preserve the efficiency of the group format and make test results more interpretable to the specialist, as well as more understandable to the child. (KS)",

Each student then read orally twelve sentences, of which four were normal sentences with transitive verbs, four contained a semantic violation, and four contained both semantic and syntactic violations. Insertions, omissions, substitutions, and repetitions were scored as errors. Analysis of data reveals that high comprehenders showed greater sensitivity to semantic and syntactic violations than did low comprehenders. Four implications from the present study are apparent: (1) that reading comprehension is not  merely a function of word recognition, (2) that good and poor comprehenders of equal word recognition ability differ in their use of syntactic and semantic cues, (3) that reading comprehension should be viewed as a process involving the integration of work meanings through the use of these cues, and (4) that poor readers need instruction emphasizing the use of language cues in comprehension.

Herbert Simon's &quot;Deep Structure Recovery Test&quot; (DSRT) was also used. Generally, it was noted that tests depending on nonsense vocabulary correlated less highly than those utilizing conventional vocabulary with reading comprehension tests.

It is argued that the reading teacher working with secondary remedial students must help students acquire the requisite skills for successful learning through reading and meet the personal needs of students as well. The first step toward effective remediation lies in accurate and specific diagnosis of the particular reading difficulties students are experiencing. Once the difficulties have been diagnosed, treatment must be prescribed in direct relationship to the diagnosis. The skills the student is unable to perform during diagnosis, whether basic or applied, are the skills the student needs to be taught. The reading teacher must  provide strict attention to diagnosis and treatment and must also seek to create a learning environment which answers the personal as well as the educational needs of the students.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the construction of mental images on eight year old's ability to recall progressively lengthening prose passages. Eighty-six third graders enrolled in suburban Minneapolis schools were divided into experimental and control groups. Experimental subjects were given practice constructing mental images and were shown examples of useful images. Controls were exposed to the prose materials, but did not practice constructing mental images. Both groups read seventeen segments of a short story; children in the experimental group were  directed to construct an image for each segment, while control subjects were instructed to \"do whatever you can or have to\" in order to remember the story. Results indicate that experimental subjects were able to answer significantly more short answer questions about the story than were control subjects. (Author/KS)",

Secondary objectives of the study were to explore the relationship between behaviors observed during the attention span tasks and to ascertain if a relationship existed between teachers' judgment of attention span and reading performances. Two conditions, a simple attention span task and a complex attention span task, were administered to one hundred randomly selected subjects.  Both tasks involved correct and false detections of a signal word or signal word series among a list of nine signals appearing at regular intervals for ten minutes. Significant differences as measured by the complex attention span task and teachers' judgment of attention span have been obtained between these two variables and reading performances of the Mexican-American children at the third grade level.

These centers are evaluated according to student progress in relation to objectives set by the state in reading, mathematics, technical writing, and oral and written communications. The reading specialists in the centers are important for helping remedial students learn to read materials in their technical areas. Answers to questionnaires provided the information in this study concerning materials and equipment, physical plants, location of center, instructional procedures (basal, individualized, language experience, related skill approach, tutorial, and lecture), scheduling, and testing. Included in the paper are  diagrams of centers, lists of equipment and teaching materials, and a proposed evaluation sheet of existing communication skills. (JM)",

The sample consisted of 32 first grade (second semester) children, divided into two equal groups, for the first replication of the study and 32 children, divided into two equal groups, for the second replication. Children, run individually, heard four stories. Illustration subjects were asked to illustrate the story immediately after hearing it and then to tell all they could recall about it. (In the second replication, literal questions were added.) Control subjects spent the poststory time coloring in a  coloring book before recalling the stories they heard. Results showed that the illustration condition produced better recall for long and short passages, and for simple and complex passages. (JM)",

An approach in reading instruction which utilizes both verbal and nonverbal communication for assessing comprehension contains several unique features that provide for the integration of all levels and skills of comprehension, the fusion of affect and cognition, the appeal to shy or language deficient children, and the active participation of students rather than passive acceptance. A number of activities which use two types of nonverbal assessment--pictures and pantomime--demonstrate the efficacy of a nonverbal approach to assessing reading comprehension. (JM)",

The &quot;Tutor-Student System in Beginning Reading,&quot; the basic instructional material for the model program, was developed to train tutors to say and do what the reading specialist normally says and does when teaching reading in a one-to-one situation. For one hour a day, five days a week for ten weeks, eighteen students in grades ten and eleven in an inner-city public high school who were reading below a fourth-grade level received intensive tutoring in place of English or reading classes. A control group received instruction in English or reading classes. This paper describes the details of the tutor-student system and concludes from the results of the study that the program  produced statistically significant gains in reading achievement for high school students reading below a 4.0 level.

A total of 46 students in a predominately white middle class suburban school district who were reading at least two years below grade placement were divided into two groups: 24 students were given syntactic training and 22 students received remedial reading instruction. Pretests and posttests using both the Metropolitan Achievement Test and A Test of Sentence Meaning were administered to all students. Results showed that syntactic training increased reading performance to the same extent as remedial techniques, that both instructional approaches increased scores on the word knowledge subtest to a greater extent than on the  reading subtest, and that training students in syntactic structures does not improve understanding of these structures.

The use of the black dialect can help expand black students' intellectual potential by de-stigmatizing non-standard forms. In addition, white students will achieve the opportunity to understand the linguistic validity of an unfamiliar form. The evaluation of Black English and some white Southern dialects from West African dialects can be traced and attributed to a normal process of cultural transmission. The dispersement of verbal deprivation myths through the study of these linguistic origins can change negative attitudes held by  educators and students concerning Black English. The \"Black American English Code-Switching Technique,\" in addition to other methods described, can assist both black and white students in shifting from one linguistic system to another. (KS)",

        "description":"This paper outlines a methodology for teaching writing which is based on the following assumptions: that the controlling idea is the most important feature of the reflective essay; that the idea sentence embodying the controlling idea has a semantic and rhetorical anatomy that is present in oral patterns; and that teachers can instruct students in the concept of controlling ideas by linking the students' everyday speech to the needs of written discourse. The author argues that recognition of the relationship between selected speech patterns and the controlling idea of written discourse will facilitate student growth in writing competence. It is concluded from the results of the author's project using the conceptual approach that because it links oral and written patterns, the  approach appears to provide an accessible bridge to the written word; the analogic assertion appears to be a generative structure; the analogic assertion appears to stimulate clarity and to force coherence links that student writing often lacks; and structural competence in writing appears to accelerate the entire writing process.

A World War II unit used by a heterogeneously grouped seventh and eighth grade class with reading ability ranging from about third grade to adult level is described in depth. It was concluded that the unit was successful in a number of ways. The children learned how to gather information from many kinds of books. They used drama sessions to explore feelings and read for  detail. They read stories critically, comparing and questioning story line, character development, and the reliability of the information they had read. Moreover, the children were enthusiastic throughout the unit. A bibliography of books related to the World War II theme is given. (TS)",

This process of heightening involves two devices for communicating \"felt life\": concretization and dramatization. In teaching these devices, prewrigting exercises of observation and perception are important for sharpening sensory responses. Next, students should practice writing external descriptions of a character, then present the character's emotions, and later put the character into interaction with another character. This is done by integrating voices, physical detail, and thought passages of concretized emotion to convey the experience of an encounter between two flesh-and-blood  people. (JM)",

Recognition of student compositions can take the form of modified public debates by students or student prepared information brochures on community services.

The author's investigations include the study of the effects of training adults, adolescents, and children to produce more original images and analogies; developmental patterns in the production of verbal images; the effects of experimental arrangements of fixed  and variable time intervals in the production of images in relation to creativity levels; and creative imagination imagery and the function of sense modalities. New directions for research should include the construction of better testing instruments, the analysis of imagery in relation to mental functioning and personality, and the investigation of the value of practical applications of research for productive performance and problems solving.

Individualized instruction, using in-class tutors and writing notebooks, allows for a variety of activities that make better use of the scheduled class hours by giving students time to write, to discuss their writing with others, and to work in groups on such things as literature research. A firm understanding of American dialects, including edited American English, is important for all students and can be achieved in a number of ways, using aspects of linguistics and applied linguistics.

Conflict, however, or the discrepancy between the demands of the environment and the demands of a living system, is common to individuals, groups, organizations and societies, and is part of the communication process by which living things interact with their environment. Assessments of the nature of conflict are subject to the variation in evaluative criteria selected and the time frame considered. By definition, however, conflict is functional and necessary to the adaptation of life. The communications system perspective can provide an alternative unit of analysis, \"system+ environment,\" which attempts to synthesize a cross-contextual, cross-level, communication-conflict paradigm and has  implications for interactions from the international to the personal level.

A review of the literature suggests that one purpose of inherency is to demonstrate that the cause of the problem that the affirmative position isolates is accurately described. A second justification assumes that there is a presumption in favor of the current system, and if the problem can be solved with existing programs, those programs should be used, instead of creating new programs. The justification of permanence argues that inherency is needed to demonstrate that the problem isolated by the affirmative is likely to continue in the future. In addition, inherency allows debaters to determine which parts of a given  plan are unique to the resolution and which aspects are non-topical, and it provides a balancing comparison between the negative position and the affirmative plan. Finally, one school thought argues that inherency has developed into an abstraction, and that its main value is as a psychological tool utilizing ambiguity. (KS)",

A large reliability-validity study involving ten attitude traits, four different methods, and over one hundred subjects at three different times was undertaken. Results from the study indicated that the reliabilities of both the salience and positivity scores of the attitude pies behave acceptably as compared to Semantic Differentials, Likerts, and Rank Importance procedures. Similarly the validity of the positivity scores is roughly comparable to that of the Semantic Differentials and Likert scales for evaluation. On the basis of the evidence from this study it was concluded that  the attitude pie is at least as useful a tool in assessing group positivity and group indifference as either Semantic Differential or Likert methods.

The effect of a National Data Center (NDC) and computerized dossiers about people and their past is also considered. It is determined that a computerized information system would present at least four distinct problems to individual identity or self-image. First, a person's self-identity may either be reinforced if the information agrees with the individual's perception, or it may conflict if the information is not in agreement or inaccurate. The second problem involves the extent an individual may rely on his files in constructing his self-identity. The third problem inherent within the schemata to develop a NDC is the depersonalizing effect associated with the use of computers. The  fourth crises to personal identity would be presented by the capability of computers to perform inferential relational retrieval and interpretation. Reasons which have been cited as justification of the need and benefit of constructing a NDC are also considered, including McLuhan's attitude toward privacy as presented in his theory of the &quot;Global Village.&quot; (LL)",

A videotape of two simulated employment interview scenes was prepared. In the first interview scene, the actor, a black male, used direct eye contact, and in the second, the same actor used indirect eye contact. The subjects, twenty black male and twenty white male employment interviewers from government agencies in the Washington Metropolitan area were shown the videotapes and asked to respond to a questionnaire. It was found that for blacks, their interpretations of direct eye  contact were different from their interpretations of indirect eye contact, whereas for whites their interpretations did not differ. Furthermore, it was determined that because of race black and white interpretations of direct eye contact did differ significantly as related to videotaped scenes of employment interview situations. It was suggested, therefore, that in some situations a black male job applicant interviewed by a black male may be considered unacceptable for employment because of his use of indirect eye contact.

Although planning and prepared work should be discouraged as much as possible, because of the time limitations for the performance, it is good for the performers to know where they are going. In other words, they should know before performing what point &quot;A&quot; (the conflict), point &quot;B&quot; (the climax), and point &quot;C&quot; (the resolution) will be. Pre-determination of the elements of the dramatic action can work very effectively in the improvised duet. Scene dynamics require that actors stick to the point, and the integrity of a scene is its adherence to its own internal logic. Scene dynamics and scene integrity should  be the principal considerations in evaluating the performance. However, the more subtle aspects of the performance should also be considered: the development of information, the pantomime skills, and the balance between performers.

Although theatre, as reflected in the degree of support by the national budget, is not considered a high priority item, it can provide a valuable social function. With the increasing use of ad hoc organizations to deal with the problems of accelerating change, individuals must learn to function within changing systems in both their individual lives and in organizations. By its very nature, the theatre production is an ad hoc organization which demands new socializations, a state of continuous learning, and synergenic problem solving skills. As such, it can provide an experience capable of increasing individual  flexibility. An experimental design involving the testing of students before and after involvement in directing and theatre productions on K.W. Schaie's Test of Behavioral Rigidity reveals increased personal flexibility after theatre experiences. The social utility of theatre can be demonstrated, therefore, in an objective manner. (KS)",

Findings showed that the child initiated the interaction in two-thirds of the cases, usually by demanding rather than requesting the cereal, with highest levels of child-initiated interaction occurring for children who were younger, white, and middle class; that parents were twice as likely to approve as refuse proposed purchases, with success in obtaining the desired cereal  increasing with age; that one-fourth of all interaction sequences resulted in parent-child conflict with the middle age group scoring highest on these sequences and most problems arising when parents responded negatively; and that the premium was explicitly mentioned as the primary purchase motivation by one-tenth of the children (highest for older, minority, and working class subgroups).

In the interests of protecting the public interest, the development of a new communications policy is necessary. In aiding the initiation of a socially conscious communications policy, two system proposals are particularly worthy of consideration. The Consumer Association of Canada (CAC) conceives the idea of the Community Information Network with the goal of creating non-profit public  information systems that give primary attention to the user's needs. EDUCOM's System-3 proposal stresses the need for a two-way interactive system which calls for a collaborative effort between the public and private sectors and a synthesis of information gathering and communication. In order to provide access to information for individuals, the bulk of our attention should be focused on the reconsideration of cable television rules to be made by the FCC in 1977. (KS)",

Any documentary has the primary job of reacting a virtual reality and maintaining an impression of immediate experience. While this has remained a constant requirement, the formal conventions which filmmakers use to create the virtual reality have evolved and changed, so that devices that might have been accepted as realistic thirty years ago seem suspect when compared to the norms of realism Americans have absorbed from today's films. At least two distinct categories of documentary style are distinguishable today: analytic cinema and direct cinema. Analytic cinema includes all documentaries that obtain their effects through the conjunctive use of image, a spoken narration or  commentary, and usually music. Direct cinema creates a virtual reality with conventions seemingly unmediated by film technique and opposite to those of analytic cinema. Some of the films discussed include \"Why We Fight,\"\"The River,\"\"Black Natchez,\"\"Don't Look Back,\"\"Titicut Follies,\"\"High School,\"\"Chronicle of a Summer,\"\"And So They Live,\"\"Jaguar,\"\"Eddie,\"\"On the Pole,\" and \"Primate.\" (TS)",

Interest in and knowledge about two topics (impeachment and the National Football League strike) were determined from a 1974 survey of 253 adults. Knowledge was measured in terms of two components (factual and structural) and interest was studied in terms of salience to self and salience to social milieu. Social interest, especially when combined with anticipated interpersonal communication, proved to be a better predictor of knowledge overall. Further, greater interest was found to correlate with use of more than one mass medium and a resulting higher level of knowledge. Some sex differences are noted.  (Author/KS)",

Stubblefield of Murray (Calloway County), Kentucky, to the field of broadcast history and ascribes to him the invention of wireless voice communication. In 1888, Stubblefield was granted a patent on a mechanical or &quot;knocking&quot; telephone which was subsequently installed in towns in several states including Kentucky, Indiana, Mississippi, and North Carolina, However, by 1889, the Bell telephone, an electrical device far superior in sound quality and distance, had worked its way westward into Stubblefield's home territory, and soon resulted in reducing the Stubblefield phone to intercom use. In 1908, Stubblefield patented a second kind of wireless telephone--a system based on induction--and one that is used by many to credit him with  the invention of modern radio broadcasting. However, Stubblefield's attempts to market his wireless telephone were unsuccessful and soon other devices surpassed his inventions. Biographic information about Stubblefield is included. (LL)",

A total of 141 respondents were interviewed by telephone from September 14 to September 21 and from October 26 to November 4. Results, gained from an analysis of answers to four questions, show that early in the campaign the decided voter constructs a decisional agenda composed of likes and dislikes about the candidate, while the undecided voter is just beginning to construct lists; and that over a period of time the decided voter accumulates more of  the same kind of information, while the undecided voter samples a variety of issues, not accumulating much additional decisional information.

Eighteen college classes from Kearney State College participated in testing of perceptual organization and social insight. Experimental groups of five were then assigned to one factual and one social problem solving task. Results indicate that groups high in cognitive abstractness and interpersonal perception appear to perform in a more adequate manner in both factual and social problem solving; those groups high in cognitive abstractness alone perform better in factual problem solving situations. Conversely, groups high in  interpersonal perception alone exhibit better performance in social problem solving.

Ninety-four participants in the Bicentennial Youth Debates (BYD) Midwest Sectional Tournaments provided the subject population. Speech communication course background and general forensics and debate experience were assessed by questionnaire, and delivery, organization, and analysis were rated by judges on a five point interval scale. Despite limited generalizability of the study due to the failure of the BYD to utilize lay judges and the inability of researchers to determine  interaction relationship between independent variables, results indicated that students with debate experience achieve high ratings in activities far removed from competitive school debate format.

Emphasizing diversity, compromise, and reasoned argument, members defined their role as a combination of judge, juror, and average common-sense citizen. Reflecting the varied interests of their constituencies, committee participants became the voice of logic in a morass of deception. Rhetorically and politically, the debates sought to educate the public about evidence and issues, express all possible points of view, and encourage national unity. Media coverage of the discussion reflected a minimum of adaptation to the mass audience, sometimes presenting evidence more quickly than  it could be absorbed. High approval ratings given Congress by the public after the debates may indicate the desire for evidence to be presented in all its complexity, however, as well as reflect an appreciation for the committee's starightforward style.

The creation of new schools can be viewed as \"social architecture\" involving the design and building of educational social systems. The three-year project on Social Architecture in Education is documenting the planning, staffing, start-up, and implementing of five new innovative schools. This paper is one of five presented at a symposium consisting of papers drawn from first-year cross-site data analyses focusing several disciplines on core issues that arise when new educational social systems are created. The question examined is, How do alternative views of educational goals relate to planning and starting new  schools? Data from planners, administrators, and faculty help in examining agreement or disagreement on goals and the traditional phenomena of goal succession and goal displacement that occur as new schools move from planning through implementation.

The process of decision-making is placed in a conceptual framework, and from selected criteria for judging leadership styles, leadership is defined, research findings cited, and the transactional style proposed as an appropriate leadership style for the administrator interacting effectively with individuals in group processes. Those in the field of education should reconceptualize the total educational enterprise as a  cooperative, social venture, with a view toward increased organizational effectiveness and improvement of current decision-making practices.

Chiefs' salaries, ranging from $20,000 to $75,600 did not often bear a direct relationship to state economies, salary levels, or per-pupil expenditure. Selected conditions affecting salaries seem to be limited to geographical location and the method of selection--elected chiefs tended to have lower average salaries than appointed chiefs, and appointed chiefs with contracts had the highest average salaries. Job security for the chiefs is limited. Few of them are evaluated with any consistency or by any specific criteria.  required qualifications and competencies vary from state to state. generally, the surveyed chiefs had more extensive documented expertise than is required by state law or policy.

In many states, state departments of education have been actively involved in supporting, proposing, amending, or resisting collective bargaining legislation. State departments ought to come up with answers for streamlining laws and advancing the maturation level of the bargaining process. School board associations, administrators, and state agencies should consider options in streamlining legislation through the art of compromise to seek resolutions without giving up first principles. State agencies must be information brokers. The midst of a teachers' strike is no time for the state department to discover new laws or new interpretations of laws. Such interpretations must be  identified in advance, so that everyone knows what role the agency will play. There is growing nationwide support among teacher unions for statewide bargaining. State agencies should oppose this trend and protect the public interest by supporting the resolution of critical issues at the local level. (Author/JG)",

Also discussed is the &quot;elite vs. arena&quot; model that distinguishes between &quot;elite&quot; politicians who consider themselves guardians of the public and typically make policy decisions in private, based on their personal views, and &quot;arena&quot; politicians, who consider themselves representatives of the public and typically make policy decisions in public, based on public debate. The  author argues that most American boards are sacred and elite and that they express normlessness and anxiety when forced to behave in secular-arena fashion.

Neither voluntary negotiation nor fact-finding has been successful when the bargaining parties are far apart and the issues are numerous. The prohibition against striking has not worked either. The best solution to the collective bargaining issue is a combination of limited right to strike with binding &quot;last-best-offer&quot; arbitration.

The theoretical framework specified could be applied equally well to any number of local public social service agencies.

Section 2 is a presentation of the empirical results of estimating these sets of equations on a sample of California public school districts. Some of the issues investigated in the empirical analysis include the price and income elasticity of the demand for teachers, the effects of tenure on the demand for certain teacher quality  characteristics, the determinants of the equilibrium salaries of teachers and public school administrators, the differences between the effects of changes in community income and federal and state grants-in-aid on local school spending, and the compensatory effects of grants-in-aid on school spending, the demand for school inputs, and salaries of school personnel in high and low income school districts.

The author first points out that for many reasons declining enrollment may not decrease operating costs in a school district. This fact, plus the additional impact of inflation and new government-mandated requirements for schools, ensures that additional financial resources will be needed to support education even as enrollment declines. Declining enrollment, however, will make it increasingly difficult to win more money for education in the political arena. In the long run, the author argues, the federal government is the best source for  additional funds, but in the short run most school support money will have to come from the state and local level. This will probably require new taxes, but the time to convince legislators of the need for increased educational funding is before a new tax is enacted; by the time a new tax is enacted, it is usually already committed. Long continuous education of legislators will not guarantee success, but lack of it will guarantee failure. (JG)",

This requires active board involvement in so-called administrative matters; otherwise, the board is limited to simply ratifying decisions of the district's administrators. In conclusion, the author discusses the process of needs assessment and suggests that needs assessment should be an important part of the school board's duties. Included as an appendix is a copy of a \"Community  Survey of Educational Goals\" that was part of a needs assessment effort in a New York school district. (JG)",

        "description":"In the area of textbook selection, a school board should (1) establish a policy based on the feelings of the community, the law, and the board's views; (2) determine whether administrative guidelines reflect board policy; (3) check whether textbook choices are based on those guidelines; and (4) consider appeals in book complaint cases. Everyone agrees that school boards should establish a written policy on textbook selection. This policy should stipulate community involvement, and provision should be made for a written complaint form. When writing a policy, the board should consider its legal authority and recent decisions in relevant court cases. It is wise to have the board's textbook policy checked by an attorney. Another requirement for establishing a textbook policy is that  board members should clarify their own thinking and be prepared to counter some of the arguments against board involvement in textbook selection. It is difficult for a board to adopt any regulations that inhibit teacher choice for fear of being labeled a \"book burner.\" Nevertheless, it is the board's obligation to ascertain its constituents' wishes and to represent those wishes in a fair and legal manner.

The primary role of the school board is not to make the school system more efficient, but rather to make it more effective. To successfully fill this role, board members must ask themselves difficult questions about the educational objectives of their district. For example, how are the schools affecting the minds and spirits of their students? Few educators have dealt with the complex issues raised in the analysis of purpose and objectives. The implications of the recent emphasis on return to basics (the Three R's), for example, have not been thoroughly analyzed. Unless a child enjoys reading and  actually engages in this activity, his ability to do so means little by itself. More openness and humanity, as well as more concern for individual growth and development, should characterize education. (Author/DS)",

In 1971, the state board of education proposed a new three-year experimental program with the following elements: a direct measure of basic skills in reading and mathematics as the measure of eligibility, assurance of three-year funding, provision of funding adjustments to be determined by program success, provision for an annual evaluation of each pupil's progress to determine his level of attainment, extension of program discretion to the local school district, and  provision for district funding as a means of providing flexibility to serve all pupils. Although the district accountability was never fully operational, it has been determined that school districts can be held accountable for educating the lowest achieving pupils and that additional money for educational programs in basic skills can result in higher attainment. Regardless of the conceptual framework of future programs, Michigan is likely to continue to use actual student achievement as the indicator of need and success. (Author/IRT)",

The change plan emphasized staff development at the administrative level as a means of decreasing the focus in the district that were opposed to change. The plan included retreats, workshops, attendance at conferences, and meetings with national authorities, but emphasized the reorganization of the district to reduce the effects of provincialism and to develop a solid management team relationship at the higher levels of management. The school board was left out of the management team. Eventually the district was reorganized into two  distinct divisions-instruction and support services. One major provision of the reorganization was the establishment and staffing of a department to facilitate long-range planning and staff development. The rationale of the reorganization was to arrange the school system's management team so as to focus more directly on the clients of the system--the students. (Author/IRT)",

Focus of the discussion is the Intercultural Development Research Association's (IDRA) effort to analyze bilingual education using the weighted-pupil technique. IDRA found that the typical weighted-pupil approach was inadequate because it requires identification of &quot;best practice&quot; school districts. Since bilingual education is an evolving area, identification of such lighthouse districts proved to be impossible. Therefore IDRA instead developed a hypothetical model of bilingual education that could serve both as a curriculum  development model for bilingual education programs and as a basis for later cost analysis studies. Much of the paper describes and discusses IDRA's &quot;exemplary model&quot; for bilingual education. (JG)",

Equal educational opportunity requires a particularized educational response to the characteristics of the individual. An educational finance plan that provides equality of educational opportunity should take into account the factors of district wealth, local tax effort, pupil need, cost differentials, and municipal overburden. The most common method of equalizing the wealth and effort factors is through the commitment of state funds for equalization purposes; the ideal school finance plan guarantees identical yields for identical effort. A school finance plan must also incorporate a \"pupil need\" criterion. The concept of equal educational expenditures for  all children is further invalidated by differences in school costs in different localities. Therefore, a state equalization formula must include some form of cost-of-living index. In addition, an allowance for municipal overburden must be made in the distribution of school funds; such adjustments can be made by use of a weighted formula that relates average total taxes for the state to total taxes in a school district.

There seems to be an almost irresistible urge among authors of educational bargaining statutes to adopt the basic tenets of private-sector labor law. However, employment and collective bargaining are different in the public sector than in the private sector, and one should analyze the unique constraints present in public employment prior to wholesale adoption of the tenets of private-sector bargaining. An element that should be recognized in modern American labor relations is the accelerating rate of change in education, in educational administration, and in the psychology of organizations and individuals. The public sector is fundamentally different from the private sector in its organization,  mission, purpose, operations, and reporting requirements. Yet many private-sector terms are being used in educational negotiations without questioning their validity. The basic question is whether collective bargaining will change to accommodate government or government will change to accommodate collective bargaining. (Author/JG)",

        "description":"Critics of the National Education Association (NEA) have often charged that it has been dominated by school and college administrators and, therefore, has failed to reflect adequately the views of teachers, who constitute the vast majority of its membership. However, the growing militance of the NEA during the 1960's would make paradoxical the continuance of administrators in influential leadership positions. Consequently, several major constituent bodies of the association were investigated from 1959 to 1970. The study has sought to discover whether--and if so, when, why, and to what extent--the composition of these bodies reflected a change in the number of administrators, in the number of nonadministrative professional school personnel, and in the number of teachers alone. The  study reports the exact number of school administrators and classroom teachers in positions of authority in the NEA during the period of the organization's major ideological transformation. It clearly shows the decline of administrators' dominance and the attitudes of the majority of members toward such dominance. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"Two models may be used to describe school board governance. The democratic model defines effectiveness in terms of democratic criteria. It is characterized by vigorous competition for school board positions; board members are responsive to their constituencies; the superintendent acts as policy implementor rather than policy originator, and a chain of direct accountability is maintained among the public, the board, and the superintendent. The professional model dictates that board members should defer to the superintendent, who is the expert capable of making policy decisions most advantageous to the clientele (students). Selection of board members should not be characterized by controversy over the issues, as in the democratic model. Each board member must decide for himself  which model (and concept of effectiveness) is most desirable. The research on which these remarks are based indicates that school boards and superintendents often fail to ascertain what their communities want. There is little citizen participation in board policy-setting. In most cases, the board follows the lead of the superintendent in policy-making. One conclusion to be drawn from this data is that the professional model is the dominant one. (DS)",

Through heightened awareness of their typical leadership styles, principals can become more skillful decision-makers.

Unobtrusive but obvious \"other\" expectations play a large part in determining the appropriateness of both role and induction in organizations. This paper discusses the unconventional expectations associated with the label, \"feminine,\" as it affects role referrents of professorship within higher education. It is hypothesized that the present lack of consistent expectations for female faculty has created role confusion that cannot be alleviated by some manipulation of traditional bureaucratic, male, or induction role expectations. Specifically, cross-referencing the conventional classifications of  university professional, male induction, and female sexuality, reveals two types of role inappropriateness for the female professor: (1) that in direct conflict with the traditional male induction model, and/or (2) a professor role that has no \"correct\" sexuality referrent.

Curriculum revision, K-12, was the principal thrust of the ESY (Extended School Year) project, but administrators also hoped to relieve overcrowding in the schools and to effect more efficient use of professional staff and physical facilities. During the first two years of the program substantial progress was made toward standardizing curriculum goals and objectives and providing teachers with current instructional resources. However, with summer quinmester attendance on a voluntary basis, 13% of the students attended during the 1974 summer quinmester, and only 11% during the 1975 summer quinmester. Thus, overcrowding during the remaining  quinmesters was not substantially reduced, and the additional expense of operating a summer program was not offset by economies effected during the regular school year. Reacting almost exclusively to financial considerations, the local board voted to cut short the extended school year experiment. (Author/MLF)",

Emphasis is placed on hiring only highly skilled teachers who would team together under one leader for each family. Learning aides would be used to reduce the number of teachers needed. The facilities for the school would be minimal to keep from taking money from instruction. Resource allocation would emphasize instruction--few teachers would  be hired but they would be paid top salaries, tenure would be avoided but student success would be rewarded with sizable merit salary increases for the teachers, little would be spent on facilities, and all funds available would be spent on instructional resources. The alternative financial plans considered would result in tuition estimated to be between $900 and $1,000 a year. The plan would be implemented in stages. (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"The school board's negotiating team is all-important in the collective bargaining process, especially in light of the unity and organization of teacher association teams. Upper echelon administrative personnel, not the board members themselves, should compose the board's negotiating team. A board inexperienced in collective bargaining can hire a professional consultant/negotiator. Middle management administrators, such as principals, should not be on the negotiating team, though they should be consulted on a regular basis during negotiations. The same holds true for the superintendent. Even though its members are not directly involved in the process, the board can maintain control over negotiations by formulating a list of administrative demands, establishing priorities,  carefully defining its team's authority and limitations, and setting limits on length of negotiating sessions. The negotiations process consists of three phases: planning (including measuring teacher demands in terms of cost, value to the educational process, administrative feasibility, and legality), probing (ascertaining the position of the teachers' team), and persuasion (reaching tentative agreements that will eventually be formalized in the contract).

A representative list of printed materials might include books, periodicals, catalogs, and printed programmed materials. Audiovisual materials include films and filmstrips, recordings, slides, graphic materials, transparencies, videotapes, and dial access programs. Media programs are growing in importance because of the role of media in human communication and of the pivotal role of media in individualized instructional programs. The computer is one form of media that offers the greatest promise for facilitating all types of individualized instruction and, as such, is representative of the range of roles that instructional media can play. The use of  computers, like all media, is determined by its cost and other problems such as the state of technology and institutional rigidity. As its function changes, the school library is increasingly referred to as the instructional media (or materials) center (IMC). An effective IMC must be designed properly, run by a media specialist, and supported by trained teachers and knowledgeable principals. It must also have its rightful place in the school budget.

However, the special approach used to reduce absenteeism did work for two of the groups of student subjects. One of these groups (each consisted of 18 male and 14 female students) was enrolled in the academic phase of the PREP program, which included individualized instruction in reading, math, and English. The other experimental group participated in the social skills component of PREP. And the third group, the control group, participated in no PREP activities. Attendance data for these junior high  students from the year before indicated which ones had been absent the most. Instead of contacting parents only when students were absent, this approach entailed calling them or sending them letters when students had been present for a certain number of days. This positive approach increased attendance for the two groups involved in the PREP program components, though not for the control group. (DS)",

Twenty-nine elementary schools, 16 of which utilized team teaching and 13 of which employed conventional instruction, composed the sample in this study. The control structure interview was used as one of the key data collection methods. The findings indicate that more than half of the instructional decisions were made by individual classroom teachers. In the schools utilizing team teaching, a substantial proportion of decisions were made by the teacher work group. In the schools without teams, a substantial number of instructional decisions were made by persons outside the school. It was found that elementary principals rarely collaborated with individual teachers  in deciding on instructional activities. Instead, principals participated more frequently with other nonteachers and teacher groups and made unilateral decisions. Supervision of instruction by administrators seems, for all practical purposes, to be minimal. These findings challenge current concepts of school supervision. (Author/DS)",

The intervention was invited by the new superintendent of the BOCES. The first intervention focused on skill development and goal clarification. Because of a crisis in the BOCES that occurred after the first intervention, the OD team was invited back. The second intervention emphasized renewing the skills learned in the first and then focused on interpersonal issues. Eventually, after the second intervention, the superintendent of the BOCES resigned. This consequence raises questions about the success of the interventions. Two implications are explored. The first has to do with evaluation-related issues  and focuses on the relationships between OD efforts and organizational change. The second deals with the way OD projects, by their very nature, tend to shift in emphasis over time and in directions that are less process skill-oriented and more intergroup-, interperson-, and intrapersonal-oriented.

The system aids proposal development by requiring principal investigators to identify products that will result from an activity and the processes required for that activity. It aids project management by generating monthly or bimonthly budget reports for the principal investigator. By providing detailed accounting and staffing information, the system makes preparation of project progress reports relatively simple. The system is equally useful to the CCL  management for program planning as it is for principal investigators. Because the system can provide fiscal reports at nearly any desired level of detail, it also aids program management at the centerwide level. Likewise, the variety of detailed information provided on each project makes it fairly easy for the CCL management to prepare quarterly progress reports for funding agencies on any or all of the center's programs.

What is true in the external environment of professional education is also true in the internal environment of the chief administrator of such programs. The different roles and functions of the administrator create competing pressures and demands that force the administrator to divide his or her time, talents, and energy. This is an intrinsically political process. Orderly politics is impossible without recognized structures and ground rules. This is equally true of the external and internal environments of the chief administrator. The term &quot;constitution&quot; refers to the basic purposes that guide a political entity and the  fundamental structures in which those purposes will be sought. In this sense, any major social enterprise can be said to have a constitution, but so can any individual. Unless the administrator has a sense of consciousness about purpose and structure (i.e., a &quot;constitution&quot;), which is parallel to that which organizations require, the administrator will sooner or later encounter serious difficulties.

School administrators should make sure to gather the facts, to be careful to uncover the true source of irritation, to analyze the merit of possible  solutions, and then to make sure that the selected solution is immediately and thoroughly implemented. A good grievance procedure can provide a better understanding of policies that affect employees, as well as provide a check on how policies are carried out.

Therefore, this article reviews the differences between this kind of research and the techniques more familiar to educational researchers by explaining the rationale behind its use and by discussing some of the processes by which this research is conducted. The underlying principle guiding ethnographic research is the assumption that individuals have meaning structures that determine much of their behavior. The  research seeks to discover what these meaning structures are, how they develop, and how they influence behavior, in as comprehensive and objective fashion as possible. The ethnographic research process is described and examples given according to (1) entry and establishment of researcher role, (2) data collection procedures, (3) objectivity, and (4) analysis of data.

Political influencing is a long-range strategy. Suggestions are made of ways that school administrators, educators, and school board members can  increase political effectiveness in gaining needed legislation. (Author/MLF)",

A set of models being developed for indicator research is described and some of their implications explored. Suggestions are made for assessing performance from both an institutional perspective and a social perspective. The first section considers sources of variability in welfare generation that can be traced to the processes of transforming resources into welfare outcomes through production or consumption activities. Section 2 discusses extending the models to include sources of variability  arising from the institutional settings in which these activities occur. The third section illustrates implications of these models for identifying the information requirements of the client and service providers of a prototypical public school system. (Author/MLF)",

Data were gathered through questionnaires mailed to all superintendents of school districts with more than 10,000 students in eight Rocky Mountain states. Respondents were asked to rank in order of preference 11 administrative selection criteria that had been gleaned from the literature. These rankings were (1) professional competence, (2) progressional leadership, (3) human relations, (4) personal motivational characteristics, (5) intelligence, (6) professional training and experience, (7) recommendations, (8) philosophy of education, (9) physical characteristics, (10)  social-economic characteristics, and (11) personal data. The author concludes that professional attributes are considered more important in the selection process than personal characteristics, and he suggests that the study findings be used to develop an operational model for the selection of district office administrative personnel.

Three periods may be distinguished in the growth of a settlement: (1) the wild period of first settling, (2) the consolidation period, and (3) the stabilized society. The number of school-aged children per population is greater in the wild and the consolidation periods than in the stabilized society. Therefore, the basic need for schools in the future fully developed society must be discussed while the school building program is still on paper. School planning authorities should base their decisions on (1) integrated statistics and forecasts, (2) educational output requirements, and (3) long-term economic feasibility assessments. In  connection with the programming of actual schools to be built, planners must know: (1) program of requirements, (2) economic plan, and (3) plan of action. School building depends on the supply possibilities of building materials and the manufacturing of suitable components from indigenous raw materials. (Author/MLF)",

Chapter 1 summarizes legal provisions prohibiting sex discrimination in education and discusses possible alternatives for persuading or compelling a school district to comply with legal requirements. Chapter 2 discusses from both practical and legal points of view how to obtain various school materials and data necessary for monitoring compliance. Chapters 3 and 4 consist of checklists and  other documents for use in determining whether a school district is meeting its obligations under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and related state regulations.

The suburbs have replaced the cities as educational leaders, not because the cities have stopped trying to educate students, but because of many sociological and economic reasons. There are many ways to provide urban areas with the dollars necessary to buy the services their pupils need, but there are many practical and political problems to overcome. Many indicators point to a decline in the educational influence and political power of urban districts. In order to achieve financial equity for urban schools, educators must (1) furnish political decision-makers with hard facts rather than romanticized notions,  (2) realize that cities can no longer depend on their political power to get necessary dollars, and (3) realize that political reaction against social welfare programs for minorities and the poor can hamper the development of quality educational programs in urban areas.

A second pool, a &quot;ready reserve&quot; of administrators, is made up of persons who have been trained in administration but do not hold administrative positions. This pool is approached through an examination of the output of Minnesota's administrator preparation institutions. There was no way of obtaining data on a third pool, administrators from states other than Minnesota. The data for the discussion of demand was obtained from  430 school superintendents who returned a questionnaire that asked them to predict changes in their districts that will affect the demand for administrators during the next five years.

In general, results suggest that districts' allocative behavior at the margin is quite different from their average allocative behavior. In particular, relatively small proportions of budget increases (occasioned, perhaps, by reforms in school finance) would be allocated to employing additional teachers. (Author)",

        "description":"The constraints and contingencies posed for school district governance by the existence and activities of a teachers' association affect district policy in subtle ways, according to this study of the Tacoma, Washington, school system. This research was conducted in conjunction with the Experimental Schools Program (ESP) over a five-year (1971-1975) period. It indicates a generally stable relationship between the teachers' association and the school district. Acute polarization and hostile adversary relationships did not arise in the negotiations process or in other areas of interaction between these two parties. The agreements generated between teachers and the district most strictly defined issues of teacher welfare such as salary, working conditions, and job security. Issues of  professional practice, including instructional personnel selection and program determination, were not covered in the negotiation agreements; the district administration retains control over these areas. As the negotiations process increasingly leads to contractual and legalistic definition of such matters as working conditions and professional practices, it would be expected that the school district's ability to respond to change would be curtailed. However, long-term transformations in school system characteristics may result from the power equalization between teachers and administration. (Author/DS)",

The research process that incorporates these variables involves (1) careful ethnographic descriptions of important educational problems; (2) the development of explanatory models based on ethnographic research; (3) the formulation of testable hypotheses based on the explanatory model; (4) verification through statistical research to test the hypotheses; and (5) reform of the model based on new empirical findings. This process is intended to bridge the gap between social science research and practice. The process was applied to data collected in school districts in  which school board members were elected on nonpartisan tickets. Verification studies of the explanatory model uncovered statistically significant relationships between selected social, economic, and political variables and school board incumbent defeat, and between school board incumbent defeat and superintendent involuntary turnover.

        "description":"Thirty-eight teachers and 96 low achieving students from 10 elementary schools were involved in a study designed to evaluate the effects of an inservice training course, \"Tutoring in Mathematics\", on teachers in mainstreaming settings. Course effects were defined in terms of specific tutoring skills and teacher attitudes about working with mainstreamed students. Changes in student math achievement and attitudes toward math were also examined. Experimental teachers took the 6-week course while control teachers received no training. A videotape of a tutoring session was taken before and after training. Three of the nine tutoring skills (specific verbal praise, negative comments, and teacher declarations) reached statistical significance at posttest for the experimental teachers;  control teachers did not exhibit significant gains in tutoring skills. Significant gains were also achieved on the total attitude scale and two attitude subscales for experimental teachers only. Pre-post math attitude and math achievement scores were collected for the students. Students of experimental teachers showed significant gains in total math achievement particularly in addition, subtraction, and multiplication subscales, whereas students of control teachers did not exhibit similar gains. Data on student attitude toward math indicated no significant increase or decrease for both student samples. (Author/SB)",

Analyzed were three rounds of questionnaires which were given to Ss in the following professional groupings: medical and technical, assessment practitioners, academicians/trainier/theoreticians, and lawyers and legislators. Ss were first asked to predict future events which would influence pupil appraisal, then asked to predict the date of the events, and then allowed to change their date estimates after receiving the total group estimates. Results were determined for eight areas: societal values and public opinion; litigation and legislation; new medical procedures and drug  applications; computer technology, inventions, and technical breakthroughs; placement and classification; curriculum and educational programing changes; assessment technology; and university training. The following are among predicted trends: increasing efforts in locating unserved hnadicapped students, continuing litigation on the education and employment of the handicapped, the use of drugs to improve behavior and learning, reduction of institutionalization of the mentally retarded due to extensive use of behavioral modification techniques, increasing use of criterion referenced tests by classroom teachers, and the requirement of courses in the exceptional child in most educational preparatory programs.

Results indicated that while younger Ss and retarded Ss remembered a comparable number of words under instructions to remember and to listen, older nonretarded Ss retained significantly more words in the remember than the listen condition.

The present study investigates this notion in data collected from 15 observational studies of 40 L2 learners who acquired the L2 naturally, that is, they were not taught the language in any formal ways. Interpretation of both input data and production data (e.g., L2 auxiliary development, auxiliary development with negation, auxiliary inversion in question formation, and input frequency and question production) suggests that communication is the principal goal of such learners, and that consequently those parts of the language system which are not important to communication are learned slowly. However, if a structure is extremely frequent in the  input data, the learner will produce it. Effects of frequency are modified in a number of ways. If a form has low semantic power, or if it requires changes in word order, it will be learned late, as will structures having a variety of forms. Variations in strategies and speed of L2 acquisition reflect psychological differences, and must be understood before a definitive model of universals in L2 learning can be developed. (DB)",

The presence or absence of some grammatical morphemes in linguistic or nonlinguistic obligatory context was scored; using Brown's (1973) criterion for morpheme acquisition, a rank order of these morphemes was determined. The order obtained was different from those of native English-speaking children. Possible determinants for this rank order are hypothesized in terms of (1) presence/nonpresence of that semantic notion expressed by those individual English morphemes in Japanese, (2) a principle of simplicity, and (3) phonological interference.

Elicited translation involves giving subjects a sentence in one language, and asking them to say the same thing, but in another language; elicited translation may work from native language to second language or vice versa. This study finds both methods useful as indicators of second language competence. Imitation taps both comprehension and production; data obtained through imitation may be interpreted to determine the stage of acquisition of a given structure. Translation also taps aspects of second language competence, although additional investigation is needed into the translation process  itself and into other variations of the translation task.

The hypotheses are interference, interlanguage and L1=L2, which states that acquisition of a language by second language learners will parallel acquisiton of the same language by first language learners. The results of the study are as follows: (A) In the copula construction, utterances such as &quot;Is a book&quot; probably represent interlingual identifications of the English &quot;it's&quot; and the Spanish &quot;es.&quot; They do not appear to be produced by interference from the Spanish syntactic device of subject omission. (B) The acquisition sequence of the English negative by the subjects does not correspond to the &quot;stages&quot; described by Klima and Bellugi for children acquiring  English as a native language. This result tends to disconfirm a strong version of the L2 = L1 hypothesis which would claim that the acquisition order in both the first and second language should be the same. (C) It is difficult to say whether acquisition of the negative by the subjects is systematic and developmental because these concepts are not clearly defined in any versions of the interlanguage hypothesis. (D) Two of the subjects evince different strategies in acquiring the negative. (Author/DB)",

Six French-English interpreters (2 professionals, 2 students and 2 amateurs) translated tape-recorded passages representing different types of materials from their weaker into their dominant language or vice-versa. As analyzed by computer, the translator's (T's) utterance generally shows the same pattern of temporal relationships as natural speech (by speaker S) but is less rhythmical. T speaks for a greater proportion of time than S and his speech rate vis-a-vis S's is greater in relation to prepared than to spontaneous texts. The synchronization of the 2 speech patterns suggests that T makes good use of S's pauses to deliver his  version. Characteristically, T lags behind S by 2 to 3 seconds. Various types of translation departures occur (examples are given), and extent of omission is related to input factors such as S speech rate. A number of other observations are noted. (Author)",

Forming the basis of the &quot;creative construction process&quot; in L2 learning, these strategies have heretofore remained unspecified. This paper offers new perspectives on the specific nature of the creative construction process: first, by an attempt to use Brown's notions of semantic and linguistic complexity to account for differences between first and second language acquisition; second, by a clarification of the notions of &quot;learning complexity&quot; and &quot;learning strategy&quot;; and finally, by presenting a new analytical procedure and framework which may be useful in research on children's strategies in  acquiring L2 syntax. This new procedure involves an adaptation of Bart and Krus'&quot;Ordering- Theoretic Method,&quot; which assumes that there is a logical relationship among items in a group, and which is designed to determine those relationships. The ultimate value of this type of analysis lies in its potential to uncover the sorts of empirical facts needed before one can begin to specify with any confidence the nature of language acquisition strategies.

Its goals include improving the students' understanding of lectures and lecture-like materials and taking into account the knowledge that the student brings with him to the listening situation. The materials used in this approach consist of a set of lectures dealing with an imaginary subject. The amount of information available to the student is maximized so that he can achieve understanding as soon as possible. The approach is designed to begin with complete information at the students' disposal and to end with a complete withdrawal of all props. The process beings with reading preparation of the materials: the student reads and studies the lecture in question. A  dictation follows and three learning aids known as auding prompts A, B, and C are used. With the first, the entire lecture is displayed in print and words redundant in the language are masked. With B and C, the amount of printed information is gradually reduced. The students then listen to the lecture and take notes, and a quiz completes the process. The materials can be used in individualized instruction as well as in regular classroom teaching. (CLK)",

        "description":"Fieldwork with a Hydaburg resident yielded this descriptive paper, which focuses on Haida syntax, and especially predication. The verbal word in Haida is of three distinct types--active, stative, and neutral--the first two of which may occur in either SOV or OSV word order. Neutral verbal words are relatively rare and take active pronouns plus a particle prefixed to the predicate root. Three types of roots may head predication: verbal or active, adjectival, and adverbial. Tense and aspectual suffixes may be attached directly to either a simple or derived predicate root. Three primary tenses (present, distant past, and distant future tenses) are described, along with three suffixes (timeless aspectual, compound perfective, and compound priximate future suffixes). As primary tenses  are marked distinctively in the interrogative, it would appear that the indicative and interrogative are separate moods in Haida. Negation is seen as a relatively straightforward process involving the infixing of a particle before the tense/aspect suffix(es). For all tenses and aspects, the third person plural is inflectionally marked. (DB)",

        "description":"The last decade has witnessed considerable advances in the development of hardware for foreign language teaching; yet advances in the production of software, which demands tremendous outlays of time, imagination, and energy, have not kept pace. In order to tap the potential of instructional machines, educators must attempt to obviate the economic obstacles, as well as the inflexible pedagogical approaches, characteristic of past experiences with machine aids. In the future, teachers will need proper training (and credit for their training), simple-to-operate and readily-available equipment and materials, and a personal conviction as to the usefulness and efficacy of machine-assisted instruction. Other practical suggestions include making equipment available to the community,  training media technicians in the needs of foreign languages, profiting from grass-roots teacher suggestions, continually sharing information within the profession, and demonstrating that the cost of the equipment can be justified by the resultant improved learning. As the expectations of the 1960's were for the most part unrealized, expectations for the 1970's must, in the words of Wilkins, \"be specified, rather than hoped-for, concrete rather than speculative.\" (DB)",

        "description":"Testing in foreign language classrooms is characterized by excessive preoccupation with students' ability to manipulate small grammatical features, while testing of communication is conspicuously absent. Furthermore, current testing is often done for the purpose of generating labels for students or for their post-instructional performance. This paper suggests that evaluators add another purpose: to discover what they know already and what they don't know yet. Testing of communication of meaningful content, with focus on all four language skills, should also be added. In this paper test items exemplifying these concepts are contrasted with traditional test questions. Although the incorporation of these concepts in foreign language testing will not radically change the status quo,  perhaps it will promote the development of students who are more capable of communicating with other human beings, and help them to become more knowledgeable, sensitive, self-actualizing and fully functioning individuals.

        "description":"The academic and administrative problems involved in the quest to integrate the language sciences are reviewed. It is claimed that the explanatory power of a truly interdisciplinary approach to language can only be achieved on a meta-paradigmatic level. This failure to consider the disparities in theoretical persuasions, it is noted, is a major factor in the demise of the task force approach to problem solving. Two meta-paradigmatic models are introduced and it is argued that the phenomenological approach to language research provides a basis for greater insights about the nature of language than the traditional positivistic model. What is significant about this investigation is that it not only advocates a more sophisticated analysis of the various schools of thought within the  language sciences, but it also demonstrates the fact that discrepancies in language theory and practice can only come about if the various scholars of the language sciences are willing to make a concerted effort to transcend the traditional boundaries of their academic training by resolving language-related issues and sharing powerful insights within the broad dimension of interdisciplinary linguistics.

The purposes of the Ability Development Programs are to identify the child with existing and/or potentially handicapping conditions, to develop and test supplementary materials, and to determine the efficacy of supplementary instruction within the regular bilingual classroom. In the first project for Four-Year-Olds, completed in 1975, 40 out of 99 children enrolled had some type of problem, 29 severe enough to interfere with learning. Following five months of supplementary instruction, the experimental group out-performed the comparison group not receiving supplementary instruction and were learning at the level of non-handicapped peers. In the second project  for Five-Year-Olds, scheduled for completion in 1977, materials for continuous observation and supplementary instruction on a lesson-by lesson basis are in initial developmental stages. Materials developed for these projects include \"Supplementary Activities for Four-Year-Olds,\"\"Observation-Action-Activity Cards for Five-Yearolds,\" two teacher manuals, \"Working with Parents of Handicapped Children,\" and \"How to Fill Your Toy Shelves without Emptying Your Pocketbook\"; and two assessment instruments, the \"Spanish/English Language Performance Screening\" (S/ELPS) and the \"Observational Checklists for Referral\" (OCR).

        "description":"In addition to the communicative end served by language learning, there is another objective: the discovery, by the student, of the system and the workings of his native language. The values of this objective include: (1) formative value: the possibility of achieving a better understanding of the fundamental and uniquely human phenomenon which is language; (2) instrumental value: the possibility of the student's thus developing communicative competence in his native language; (3) auxiliary value: the contribution that this approach can make to the comprehension and acquisition of the structure and functioning of a second language. These values inform a fundamental pedagogical tenet: Teaching the native language in primary school should not consist of teaching children to use or  transcribe correctly a code that they already know, nor of teaching them a \"correct\" language to replace a \"non-standard\" one, but rather of promoting a mastery of a richer, more diversified verbal repertoire. This goal in turn demands that three pedagogical principles be observed: (1) start from the existing verbal repertoire of the child; (2) develop in the child heuristic instruments to help facilitate his intuitive discovery of the structure and workings of his own variety of the native language, as well as other socio-culturally dependent varieties of the language; and (3) provide the child with linguistic givens rich enough to aid in the broadening of his verbal repertoire.

The sample population was composed of 164 students of Mexican descent enrolled at the University of Texas, Austin. Generally speaking, attitudinal language loyalty among the respondents was high, with negative attitudes based exclusively on pragmatic considerations. Attitudinal language loyalty does not, however, necessarily correlate with behavioral commitment to it, as behavioral commitment to language  loyalty appears to be primarily a function of linguistic ability, rather than of overt attitudinal orientation, whether the latter be sustained by instrumental, ideological, or affective considerations. While Mexican-American college students favor Spanish language maintenance, they do not belittle the functional needs for English, and they are highly conscious of the potential or actual difficulties that ensue not only from limited English proficiency but from accented English as well.

Interesting &quot;non-&quot; scholarship emerges in journalism, in arguments for scholastic curricula, and in many conversations regarding Chicano linguistics.

        "description":"This paper introduces the reader to a brief history of the focus of linguistic method from prehistoric times, through the Classical era, the Middle Ages, to the present. The scientific orientation of linguistic method is exploited; a set of specific principles is found to unify most of today's diverse methods. The success of linguistics is attributed on the one hand to the fact that the discipline serves as an analogue to other sciences, the most recent and exciting case being genetics, viz., the DNA code. On the other hand, the subject matter of linguistics, language, is known to be the human act per se. Accordingly, it is considered that human communication remains distinct from animal communication. In an effort to uncover how language is the hallmark of mankind, linguistic  method is turning to the laboratory sciences for insights into the composition and linguistic functions of the hemispheres of the brain, and to philosophy, of which certain schools claim language as their proper object. In particular, the recent rediscovery of semantics leads the linguist to semiotics. Linguistic method today has progressed to the status of a well-established, independent discipline which can now enjoy the advantages of the integration of cross-disciplinary discoveries, humanistic as well as scientific.

        "description":"&quot;Verbal&quot; and &quot;nonverbal&quot; are confused and confusing terms. Gestural phenomena in semiotic use--gSigns--are called nonverbal but work in three major ways, only the first of which is unrelated to the highly encoded (verbal) activity called language. A gSign may: (1) have a general meaning: &quot;yes,&quot;&quot;no,&quot;&quot;who cares&quot;; (2) be a code substitute for a language element; (3) be part of the direct expression of an inner language structure. The first of these is generally understood as &quot;gesture&quot;. The second operates on three levels: (a) A gSign stands for an alphabetic symbol in a fingerspelling code; (b) gSigns encode content words of a language or languages; and (c) gSigns encode content words, function words, and inflectional and derivational affixes of some languages. But language  structure itself is nonverbal, if it consists of relationships of units to features, of syntactic domination, and of semantic hierarchies, and if &quot;verbal&quot; refers to the expression of these vocally. Language and its expression are not identical; 999 express it in speech but one in 1,000 in gSigns. &quot;Gesticulation and speech are two outputs of one utterance&quot; (Kendon 1975). Deaf signers use gSigns as speakers use language sounds. Thus gSigns are not &quot;nonverbal&quot; but prelinguistic or fully linguistic behavior. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"It is important that we reflect on the conceptual framework from which our study of language has emerged, since the problems, methods, and aims of what has been called modern linguistics are rapidly being replaced by the concerns of another framework or paradigm. Such new paradigms, to be viable, must not be distorted by starting points that unduly restrict analysis and research. Therefore, since the transformational (and neo-transformational) model is able to probe more deeply into the reality of language, often compensating for the inadequacies of the structural approach to account for the data, it is to be preferred. These richer theories illustrate advance through their demonstration, though incomplete and provisional, of the laws of language on a global scale. However, the  charge of onesidedness as applied to the now-dominant perspective(s) is not easily answered. To the extent that it cannot be answered, the current &quot;rationalist&quot; efforts must be viewed as too limiting to account satisfactorily for the phenomena (language) they are attempting to explain. In the future, the mode of abstraction and directive for research must be critically appraised for the way they inform theory, fact, research, and application. The ultimate criterion for evaluation cannot incontrovertibly be an appeal to the concept &quot;science&quot;; the critic must be aware of his pre-scientific grounds for judgment. (Author/DB)",

Each expression was classified in one of the following categories: (1) Literary English; (2) Colloquial English; (3) Popular or Illiterate Speech. Results of the survey lead to the conclusions that Indian English is based on written English style, and that there are considerable similarities between Indian English and its sister languages in England, America, and  elsewhere. It further appears that not only have Indian languages Indianized the English language, but English has contributed substantially to the Indian languages as well. Indian English can justifiably be viewed as the result of the union of British English and Indian cultural-linguistic context. (DB)",

It involves four narrow semantic domains, a sample of elementary school-children and their teachers, and two native language groups, English and Spanish. Semantic development is studied through the process of equivalence formation, the ability to group discriminably different things and to treat them as alike in some way. The results show significant developmental differences across age levels, with few differences between language groups. The salient features of the meanings of noun items are primarily Perceptible (size, shape, color, etc.) for younger subjects, but become increasingly and predominantly Nominal (a label used to name the group of words,  e.g., food) among older subjects. The primary features of verb items remain predominantly Perceptible at all age levels. The results of this investigation differ significantly from two similar equivalence formation studies conducted among different populations. The meaning of a word and its subsequent development appear to be tied to an indivual's perception of the phenomenon represented by the lexical item and to his level of cognitive development. The results of this and other studies imply a broadening of the traditional concept of vocabulary development. (Author)",

The study shows that frequency of rule application depends not only on phonological environments, but also on frequency of occurrence of specific words. That is, some rules are highly word-dependent, others are more phonologically governed. This relationship between rule application and word frequency suggests that different kinds of phonological variation should be represented in different ways in the lexicon and phonological rule components of a speech understanding system.

(2) Low middle income students ($6,000-$9,000) receive less aid than students from all other income categories. (3) Students in public colleges are more likely to receive Guaranteed Student Loans and Basic Grants while private college students receive more Supplemental Grants and Direct  Student Loans. The second part of the study was the development of a linear programming model that can simulate the distribution of student aid under different legislation and appropriation levels. (Author)",

Semantic problems were overcome and &quot;administration by objectives&quot; was implemented as a process by which institutional goals and objectives and those of each administrator are made explicit and agreed upon, the detailed steps and the sources needed to carry out these objectives identified, and the progress towards their implementation monitored. Refinements in objectives were made at Roosevelt, and a greater continuity or level of integration between one year's annual report and the next were sought. An appropriate structure and sequence of meetings, interactions, and relationships were also developed to make the MBO system effective. The importance of cooperative participation by faculty and  administrators was stressed. The implementation process of MBO is still underway: preparing forms to facilitate the writing of objectives, establishing dates for the setting and subsequent review of objectives, and learning how to establish measurable objectives of appropriate difficulty. Not all questions have been resolved, but benefits are visible in terms of attainment of new levels of achievement, facilitation of communication, and providing greater administrative structure and control for the university.

        "description":"An accurate forecast of the student demand by level on the academic departments of an institution is vital for budget and financial planning decisions, for faculty workload scheduling, and for physical facility planning. Many methods have been used to forecast this demand, ranging from &quot;seat of your pants&quot; guessing to highly complex computer models. This research project studied six basic models for forecasting student demand at various levels of sophistication and complexity. The models studied included judgment only, a ratio model, a Markov model and a combination model. In addition, the dimension of expert judgment was combined to one model to determine the value of the additional input. The model with the expert judgment added was the best model based on the criterion of  least-error using several error analysis indices. The simple models gave as good or better forecasts than the more complex models using the same least-error criterion. Also, using a cost-effectiveness criterion, the simple models were again superior to the costly, sophisticated models. (Author)",

In place of a required number of courses from several separate departments, Core involves a 6-credit interdisciplinary course in all but the last of the eight semesters usually taken by the student. The move to Core demanded radical changes in schedules, in departmental offerings, in course assignments, and in many other long-held policies and ideas. The institutional commitment to Core expressed the judgment of the entire Saint Joseph's College community that general education is at least as important as the student's major. The structural reminder of this  commitment is the central role which the Core Program fills in the College's course offerings throughout all four years of the normal bachelor's program. (Author)",

Their analysis leads to a number of general propositions about faculty support for collective bargaining and for unionism, some involving properties of higher education settings and faculty status characteristics. Data available from a school-of-education study in a large, private university, permitted examination of some of Ladd and Lipset's conclusions. The objectives were to determine: (1) to what extent the faculty as a body was receptive to the idea of collective bargaining; (2) to what extent there was support for unionism; (3) what relationship, if any, there was between faculty and support for  collective bargaining and desire for unionization; and (4) to what extent support for unionism was related to faculty rank, tenure, and research orientation. It appears that a contradictory picture of forces behind the push for unionism (tenure) and away from unionism (research priority) exists within this faculty. A discussion of this conclusion includes: (1) changes during the 1960's; (2) the faculty generation gap; and (3) exacerbating conditions in the early 1970's. (Author/KE)",

It also presents four analyses of specific federal student aid program modifications and the likely change that would result in the distribution of aid across states and institutional  and family income categories.

The principal of the loan is provided by commercial lending institutions or state lending agencies. An increasing number of issues have surfaced regarding the program as a whole and certain specific aspects of it: (1) federal costs have increased steadily; (2) the extent of future federal liability implicit in new or issues loans is not precisely known; (3) default rates have increased to a level far beyond those that had been expected; (4) because lenders are reducing or eliminating their financial participation, it is not clear that GSLP can fulfill its objective of providing a major part of the  financial assistance to college students; and (5) the program's social efficiency and equity are questioned by the high default rate for certain demographic groups and types of schools. Two questionnaires were developed, one concerning individual borrowers and one concerning lenders. Data collected add considerably to the limited base of knowledge about the student/lender process.

        "description":"The purpose of any inservice workshop program is threefold: the educational enrichment of teachers, supervisors, curriculum specialists, and administrators; recertification credit; and direct teacher involvement in the decision-making process of the school system. In 1973 the National Institute of Education (NIE) funded an Experimental Schools Program (ESP) project in northern New Hampshire that developed an inservice program for teachers providing direct teacher involvement in program development. Three distinct but interrelated instructional formats were developed and employed; workshops, minishops, and skillshops. During the 1975-76 school year the ESP project staff devised both a teacher/staff and administrator/supervisor questionnaire for obtaining evaluative feedback  regarding the character and value of inservice training workshops. Data analysis reveals that workshops are perceived by classroom teachers as an effective inservice training vehicle with the most crucial characteristic being the organization of subject matter and content. Another crucial element was found to be the applicability of learned techniques in the classroom. Later during the school term those classroom teachers enrolled in an eight-session, inservice &quot;Underachievers Workshop&quot; were surveyed to determine the crucial factors to the success of the activity as: (1) the instructor's understanding of the character, capabilities and needs of students; (2) subject matter and content; (3) workshop methods; (4) relevance of content to daily teaching tasks; and (5) skills, methods, or  techniques taught.

Participants in the first study were 207 undergraduate and graduate students who were enrolled in general studies sections, while participants in the second study were 213 students enrolled in 12 sections of an undergraduate psychology course. The four types of faculty lectures were: (1) high information-high enthusiasm; (2) high information-low enthusiasm; (3) low information-high enthusiasm; (4) low  information-low enthusiasm. In the first study, sections of the same class were randomly divided, while in the second study intact sections of the same class constituted the study group. Lecturers were randomly assigned to student groups. Students in all groups viewed one lecture presentation, rated the presentation using an 18-item questionnaire, and were tested on the material. The use of discrimination analysis to develop student-rating scales that are valid with respect to faculty enthusiasm is supported by this study. This study also indicated that empirically based selection and weighting of items does not improve the validity of student rating scores in detecting real differences in information giving. Current practices in the evaluation of teaching effectiveness are limited almost  entirely to proxy measures, namely, student ratings. (SK)",

One approach to implementing this framework is to utilize a grid with the purposes represented across the top and processes represented along the side. Assume that a staff of physical education teachers has decided to use the PPCF. The first task would be to select combinations of purposes and processes that are to receive emphasis in the physical education program. By marking the appropriate cells of the grid the purposes-processes can be viewed. When all combinations of interest have been recorded on the grid, the overall framwork of the physical education curriculum has been identified. To  evaluate the merit of the curriculum, the staff should set forth a written rationale for the choices made with the PPCF. This provides the outside observer with the philosophical orientation of the staff and helps to ensure that choices are made on a logical basis. Once the purpose-process combinations have been selected, the activities that will contribute to these combinations must be identified. Regardless of the selection approach, these activities must be justified as bona fide contributors to the designated combinations. To justify the selections, review the literature to obtain supporting evidence, contact sports specialists, or make the best possible logical judgment. Next, the combinations and activities should be stated as behavioral objectives including the way in which they  will be evaluated. Concomitant concerns may also be identified and evaluated such as the side effects of a particular activity. (MM)",

        "description":"The ability to attain and maintain a body position or balance is considered important in learning and performing motor skills. Static balance is defined as balance in which the body maintains equilibrium for one position; dynamic balance is described as maintaining equilibrium while the body is in motion or changing from one balanced position to another. A sample of 379 boys and 329 girls enrolled in the public schools of Nacogdoches, Texas, were selected as subjects for an investigation of static balance relative to sex and grade differences for primary grade children and the possible relationship of selected anthropometric measures to static balance performance. The assumption was made that students tested were representative of the various social, economic, and ethnic groups  of children within the community since the entire population of the first three grades was tested. The measure of static balance used in this investigation was the Bass lengthwise stick test, which was constructed by means of factor analysis as a measure of static balance. The testing apparatus was a 12-inch by 12-inch board with a stick 1 inch wide and 12 inches long positioned in the center. After an extensive practice session, each subject was allowed three trials to attempt to remain balanced for one minute on the 1-inch rail with the preferred foot. The test was taken in tennis shoes and with the eyes open. In addition, the standing height, body weight, sitting height, and leg length of the subjects were recorded. The data were statistically analyzed by application of a 2 X 3  factorial design. It was concluded that static balance performance is relatively independent of body weight and height measurements.

        "description":"The emerging middle school movement throughout the United States today is in part an effort to rediscover, redefine, revamp, and reintroduce the basic pedagogical principles of adolescent learning upon which the junior high school was established almost seventy years ago. Proponents of the middle school support the rationale that children 10 to 14 years old constitute a distinct stage of development involving similar physical, emotional, social, and mental characteristics. Since there are no specific or mandated middle school polices, many middle schools or transformed junior highs have the opportunity to become unique institutions. Individualized instruction and team teaching are two techniques that are successfully utilized. The uniqueness of the middle school is reflected in  the various duties of the classroom teacher which may include serving as a teacher-advisor, resource person, tutor, curriculum planner, seminar director, and teacher of large and small group sessions. Middle schools have both the responsibility and the opportunity to develop career education for student investigation and exploration. When advance planning is possible, most school districts develop a step-by-step procedure or master plan for the construction of a new middle school building and the implementation of a middle school program within the facility. A preliminary planning questionnaire for a middle school action workshop and a general planning outline for a school district are provided in the appendixes. Also given is a list of selected research references. (SK)",

        "description":"Theory and practice in education are interrelated and interdependent. The credibility of any set of postulates depends upon how well the position holds up in practice. There are three ways we can utilize theory in practice: (1) to reexamine our traditional approaches; (2) to give some direction to our future practices; and (3) to generate research. Consistent analysis of standard methods gives rise to new and improved methods, or theory about new methods, which must be researched. However, theory may be misused as well. Theories may be accepted without critical analysis; people may categorically reject theories without critical analysis; or they may inappropriately apply the theory. The acceptance or rejection of a theory without proper analysis may result in problems when  pursuing conclusions in research situations. It could hinder analysis of the research data. Misapplication of theory could have just as serious an effect. If a theory is applied to an inappropriate situation and the results fail to reach statistical significance, the theory is discarded in many cases when in fact the theory is not at fault--it is the situation that is not correct. It is, then, important that both practitioners and researchers are aware of the relationship of theory and practice, its use and misuse. (DMT)",

        "description":"Simulation is the duplication of the essential characteristics of a task or situation. It represents three elements of the teaching-learning process: (1) stimulus situation; (2) response; and (3) feedback. The uses of simulation may fall into one of three general categories: research--the generation of information about an operational or proposed system, process, or environment; development--the generation of new systems, processes, or components; and instruction--the development of knowledge or skills. Simulation is used as an instructional technique in education and in nonacademic atmospheres--the military, business, and industry. The military have used simulation effectively to train individuals as well as teams. Simulation training devices can range from simple trainer type  devices to sophisticated facilities and aircraft used for crew training under simulated environmental and operational conditions. Simulations have been used in business and industry training programs as a means for stimulating discussions of management principles and concepts, providing practice and experience in extracting information crucial to decision-making and competitive interaction and also to aid in the integration of theory and practice. Simulation has important implications for formal education as well. It allows teaching problems to be realistically represented, permits teaching behavior to be modified, and relates theory to practice. Simulated problem-solving is an effective mode of learning because it is realistic and allows the student to test and apply his own knowledge of  skills and ideas by actively engaging in a situation that is realistic but controlled.

        "description":"Many physical educators, administrators, and parents argue that it makes little sense to spend time and money building athletic programs for young women when they are not interested in pursuing sports activities. Such an attitude is explored in this Task Force report questioning what roles, if any, physical education teachers have predetermined for their students (and vice versa) and what social and psychological benefits are gained in physical education classes. Five different questionnaires were devised and distributed to elementary school students in grades 1-3, upper elementary students in grades 4-6, junior and senior high school students, parents of the Kalamazoo Public School pupils, and physical education teachers. The questionnaire responses indicated that: (1) even  during childhood years boys are beginning to place girls outside the world of sports and the girls are reluctant to make a definite commitment to the conventional image of the young lady; (2) later elementary years present the ripest opportunity to explode the myth that girls have no place in sport; (3) young men and women in high school have greatly different perspectives of the role of women in sport; (4) parents in most cases are aware of the importance of a total physical education program; (5) teachers feel that girls are interested in sports if suitable situations exist, although they admit that in most instances the suitable situations do not exist. The Task Force offered 22 recommendations for improving the quality of physical education programs in the elementary and secondary  schools. (MM)",

        "description":"This paper attempts to identify the inferential logic used by first-grade teachers in forming expectations about student achievement. Data for this study was obtained from an earlier study in which 74 first-grade teachers were divided into two groups to investigate factors that are related to the formation of first-grade teachers' expectations of their students' academic performance. Forty-six teachers responded to questionnaires, and the remaining 28 were interviewed using the free response format. The free response interviews were coded for types of inferences. The two types of causality in events as distinguished by Heider are personal and impersonal causality. It was concluded from this study that in terms of personal and environmental forces, teachers tend to make inferences  reflecting personal causality for students perceived to be doing well or average. Causal inferences for for students perceived to ge doing poorly in school also reflect personal causality; however, as the year progressed, causality was increasingly attributed to environmental forces. The first-grade teachers in this study preferred attributing failure to environmental forces. The pattern of causal inferences indicated that first-grade teachers' expectations differentially reflect personal and environmental forces. If a teacher expects a student to do well or average in first-grade, these expectations will be based on characteristics that the teacher believes the student can control. (SK)",

        "description":"Variables that schools can not directly control are predictors of a significant portion of the achievement differences of children, yet some schools seem to be operating significantly better or worse than predicted in regard to pupil achievement. This observation study represents an effort to look more closely at schools in which actual pupil achievement was higher (high outlier) or lower (low outlier) than predicted. Seven instruments were developed for this observation study: (1) classroom observation form; (2) observation of a reading group form; (3) teacher reinforcement scale; (4) characteristics of open education form; (5) teacher questionnaire; (6) principal interview form; and (7) reading teacher form. Names of 14 principals in upstate New York were obtained--seven were  located at high outlier schools, seven were at low outlier schools. In each case, the principal arranged access to nine elementary school classrooms (k-6). Two observers visited each school. Each observed four different classrooms, and the pair observed one classroom together. In addition, an interview was held with the principal and with a reading teacher in the school. Some of the major ways in which low and high outlier schools differ according to the data are: teachers in high outlier schools were warmer and more responsive, showed more emphasis on cognitive development, were more effective in maintaining the desired level of control in the classroom, expected more children to graduate from high school, perceived the children as more intelligent and more pleasant to teach; higher  outlier schools appeared more open and principals in high outlier schools saw their personnel as more competent and themselves as having better rapport with teachers, parents, and pupils.

        "description":"In a variety of ways many universities and colleges are experimenting with new approaches to improve teacher education, most designed to further the individualization of instruction. Attention has been called to the following new developments: (1) forms of self-directed inquiry; (2) individualized skill and affective development; (3) self-analysis through videotape and interaction analysis; and (4) other attempts to facilitate the transition from the role of the student to that of self- and other-actualizing teacher. A number of research centers and individuals are developing models of teacher education which incorporate the elements described above and which place a new emphasis on the personalization and individualization of education. Research by these centers indicates that  individualized instruction creates more effective teachers and more effective students. Influenced by such reports, many teacher education programs are providing more opportunities for the pursuit of individual goals and interests in learning situations and are making increasingly greater use of various individualized instruction methods including: independent and tutorial study; laboratory experiences; audio or videotape tutorials; programmed instruction; adjunct programming; personalized systems of instruction; contract teaching; simulation games; minicourse units; and student teaching and internships. Use of all these methods in teacher education seems likely to grow. The emphasis today is shifting towards teaching students how to learn for themselves so that upon graduation they will  be prepared for lifelong self-education. (MM)",

        "description":"Individually Guided Motivation (IGM) is designed to attain certain motivational objectives set by the school by accommodating instruction to individual differences in skill and motivational level and rate and style of learning. The development of IGM was undertaken to meet these specific educational needs: (1) to assure a high level of motivation to learn on the part of each individual child; and (2) to promote the acquisition by each child of such prosocial behaviors as self-control and self-reliance. As described in Chapter I, operationally IGM consists of four motivational instructional procedures that are organized ways of working with a child or group of children to attain motivational objectives. The motivational-instructional procedures are: (1) adult-child conferences to  encourage independent reading; (2) teacher-child conferences for goal setting; (3) guiding children toward self-directed prosocial behavior; and (4) guiding older children in tutoring younger children. Each of these procedures was the focus of a controlled experiment in which its effectiveness was tested under various conditions. The results of these experiments, reported in Chapters III through VI, indicate that each of the procedures has positive effects upon one or more indicators: measures of motivation; measures of achievement; and measures of attitudes toward the subject matter. Also, each experiment provides information concerning the conditions for optimal success of a given procedure. The results of these experiments with respect to the effectiveness of the IGM procedures with  children are favorable. Based on the results, multimedia materials have been developed to help school staff implement the procedures. (MM)",

        "description":"This study investigates the relationships that exist between the amount of formal athletic experience of recreation administrators and (1) their scores on interpersonal relations questionnaires and (2) their propensity towards risk-taking. The subjects are 545 practicing professional public recreation administrators located throughout the United States who responded to three questionnaires sent by mail. The three questionnaires used to gather the data are: (1) the Personal Data and Athletic Experience Questionnaire; (2) the Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation Questionnaire; and (3) the Kogan-Wallach Dilemma-of-Choice Questionnaire. An analysis of the data reveals a significant but low positive relationship between recreation administrators' amount of athletic  experience and their interpersonal relations affection scores. However, no general evidence was found to support the hypothesis that recreation administrators who have had extensive athletic experience will exhibit a greater propensity for risk-taking than those who have had little or no such experience. Also, no general evidence supports the idea that recreation administrators with only team sports experience will differ from recreation administrators with only individual sports experience in risk-taking propensity. Recreation administrators who tend to score high on risk-taking propensity (low scores) appear to seek control over other persons and appear to be somewhat unconcerned about other persons liking them. Finally, it is evident that recreation administrators have a rich  background of formal athletic participation. (MM)",

        "description":"This report describes the results of preliminary work by the Human Resources Research Organization to develop a comprehensive theory for structuring subject matter. The report focuses on the first three of five components that any comprehensive model of instruction should include: (1) a representation of the subject matter to be taught; (2) a representation of the educational goal; (3) a representation of the initial or starting state of the student entering the system; (4) a representation of the current state of the student; and (5) a representation of the teaching system including teaching strategies. The instructional theory presented is axiomatic in nature--the primary concepts, axioms, definitions, and theorems are presented in order to clearly delineate the assumptions and  the starting points of the theory itself. Within the axiomatically based structure, subject content and task components are distinguished. In order to specify tasks, the behavioral objectives of the instruction must be known. These objectives include terminal behavior, the specification of which has been referred to as the beginning of any design of programmed instruction. The notion of dependency between the content and task components is defined and its properties investigated. This relation is shown to be important because it restricts the order in which content components can be introduced during instruction. A comprehensive detailed example serves to illustrate the theoretical concepts, results, and procedures of this model for instruction. It is expected that this work will  culminate in a comprehensive axiomatically based structure for individualized instruction. (MM)",

        "description":"A series of studies of elementary schools in the San Francisco Bay area revealed a number of the causes and consequences of collaborative instruction (teaming). The most recent study, a two-year panel analysis, found that complexity of instructional methods and the physical structure of open space schools are the significant predictors of collaborative teaching over time. There is a wide variation in the work relationships called teaming, and teachers defined themselves as team members by at least one of four criteria: (1) team planning of instruction; (2) team evaluation of students; (3) team coordination of discipline; and (4) joint teaching. As a team becomes more interdependent it is able to sustain complex and sophisticated methods of instruction which require nonroutine  decision-making. Teaming also results in improvements in the informal collegial evaluation system, an increased sense of influence and autonomy, and finally, when an entire school is mostly teamed there are changes in the patterns of governance. Principals share decision-making with teachers but feel more, rather than less, influential. Team interaction for some groups is a source of dissatisfaction and troubled work relationships. Large teams break up into smaller ones; highly interdependent teams become less interdependent; and many teams disappear only to have new teams spring up. Unless teams solve the problem of maintaining active participation of all members over time, many of the desirable results of teaming cannot be obtained. (DMT)",

Educational policy is formed mainly by tradition and the political pressure of interest groups, while educational researchers study questions determined by the scientific community. Educational research has not noticeably influenced policy because trained researchers have been too few, resources too limited, and efforts too fragmented. The need for illuminating educational policy by research is great, and the situation is becoming serious. The California Beginning Teacher Evaluation Study, which illustrates cooperation between educational policy makers and researchers includes these aspects: (1) the study is a genuine cooperative venture between the policy makers and researchers; (2) it has had  sufficient funding from the several million dollars available to develop new programs; (3) the research and its eventual application requires time, which is available; (4) the study has been flexible in its planning and implementation stages; (5) the policy makers and the researchers meet together continuously, and each teaches the other; (6) the project has had continued advice, to which it has listened, from a broad spectrum of persons on a research advisory board; (7) the research and policy effort has been continuous; and (8) the project is taking advantage of spinoffs.

        "description":"This report examines the relationship between school type and the participation and influence of teachers in school management, and between school type and the principal's influence in certain issues and professional interaction with teachers in elementary schools. The principals were the chief source of information. An introduction explains the purpose of the report. Chapter 2 explains the method in which responses were gathered from the participants of the study and measured. Chapter 3 discusses the relationship between teacher collaboration and teacher participation and influence in school decision-making. The relationship between teacher collaboration and the influence of the principal are examined in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 looks at school characteristics and environmental  factors affecting participation and influence. Policy implications of the results of this study are examined in Chapter 6. It was concluded that collaboration leads to greater interaction between principals and teachers. Teachers involved in team teaching and joint teaching demonstrated considerably more influence in school decisions on personnel, administration, pupil management, curricula, and teaching methods than did teachers in schools where there was no collaboration. In schools where there were many teams, much joint teaching, and shared decision-making, principals as well as teachers felt more, rather than less, influential. The appendixes include the sampling procedure, research instruments, and comparative data from teachers. (SK)",

        "description":"Continuing education for teachers was the theme for the University of British Columbia Conference on Teacher Education, chosen because of growing concern with the question of what forms continuing education should take once all teachers hold degrees. The conference did not attempt to provide definitive answers to the questions: Is graduate study the only appropriate path to professional improvement? What new structures must be built, and what older structures altered to accommodate needed changes in continuing education for teachers? It did, however, open for discussion the issues and problems in continuing education and the strategies and delivery systems that are currently being tested. Conference topics included: continuing education for teachers--an unromantic view; the  teacher association view; strategies for improving continuing education for teachers; readiness for teachers' centers; program development by teachers as a strategy for continuing education; recommendations for facilitating teacher learning; research, scholarship, and the continuing education of teachers; the open access study plan; developing short courses for teachers; continuing education diplomas; continuing education for teachers in rural settings; getting resources to teachers; and the who, what, and how of continuing education.

        "description":"As a contribution to the philosophical enquiry into the nature and forms of human activity, the hypothesis is ventured that \"knowledge\" relative to human movement and physical activities encapsulates and presents modes of perception, reflection, experience, and communication that are at least as important in human development as other generally more prized forms of knowledge. A person subsumes both intellectual and physical elements in his development; both of these are centrally involved in his experience and awareness of the world. Without experience of and instruction in the various modes of being and cognizing, no knowledge is possible in any extended sense. On this basis, human movement studies-physical education-must have a place in the curricula of educational  institutions. Physical education, it seems, requires knowledge of mathematics, science, interpersonal relationships, history, politics, aesthetics, and ethics with all the peculiar sets of propositions, modes of procedure, and tests for truth, relevance, and appropriateness that are associated with each of these ways of knowing. In other words, physical education seems to be a field of knowledge which draws upon the insights available from a wide range of discrete disciplines in order to formulate answers to problems both of a theoretical and practical kind arising from the one central feature that draws its concerns together--the way in which the human person can develop his understanding of his life through the medium by which his existence is objectified, his body.

        "description":"Project Positive Attitude Toward Learning (PATL) grew out of an identified need by the Bethalto Community Unit No. 8 schools to improve student self-concept and attitudes toward school. The basic approach used in project PATL is to change teacher behavior which, in turn, causes change to take place in student behavior. The mechanism for affecting teacher change is the use of four kits that are multimedia, individualized, self-paced, performance based learning packages. Kits are designed to teach specific skills in four complementary areas. Each of the four kits follows the same general format. Teachers are presented with a list of performance based objectives. For each objective numerous multimedia learning activities are provided followed by an assessment in the form of a  paper-pencil task, classroom observation, or microteaching on video tape. The kits are bound books containing all materials except films and commercially available books. The Improved Self Concept Kit is designed to help teachers learn how self-concept develops, how to handle inappropriate behaviors so that the focus is on the behavior and the child's self-concept is enhanced rather than damaged. The Individualized Teaching Kit is designed to enable the teacher to quickly evaluate the appropriateness of reading materials for any student, to write instructional objectives, and to plan and implement an individualized learning program. In the Active Involvement Kit, teachers learn to use interaction patterns to facilitate classroom activities that actively involve the student in the learning  process. Finally, the Processes of Learning Kit enhances questioning skills for the teacher to aid students with thinking and problem solving. (DMT)",

        "description":"This article examines why teachers should be evaluated, how teacher evaluation is perceived, and how teacher evaluation can be approached, focusing on the improvement of teacher competency rather than defining a teacher as \"good\" or \"bad.\" Since the primary professional activity of a teacher is teaching, the major concern of teacher evaluation is the effectiveness of student learning experiences and the promotion of the professional growth of teachers. The first step in an evaluation scheme is the establishment of objectives that are congruent with the educational goals of the society and the school district; the final step is the determination of the degree to which the objectives have been met. Evaluation, however, is a process, and between the initial and final steps it is  necessary to: (1) establish objectives; (2) design activities; (3) determine criteria for validation; (4) implement activities; (5) collect proper data; (6) analyze data; and (7) examine the reasonability, effectiveness, and significance of steps one through four. If the stated objectives have not been met, an overall examination should be done starting with the design of activities. If a teacher is working in conjunction with an evaluator it is important that: (1) the teacher be an active participant throughout the evaluation process; (2) the teacher and evaluator decide together what is evaluated, what criteria should be used, and how information is collected; and (3) they should meet at least three times a year.

Scale one (School Based Staff) contains items that are descriptive of the personality and leadership styles of principals, teachers, and counselors. Scale two (Communication) describes communication activities throughout the entire school system. The third scale (Central Administration) focuses on relations between the central offices, school, and school board.  Scale four (Innovative Experience) describes a school's experience with innovations and attitudes toward innovation. School/Community Relations, scale five, attempts to tap information on such variables as the amount and sources of funding, the degree of interest and involvement of community groups in the school system, and attitudes of the community towards the school. Scale six (Organizational Climate) describes the work climate and organizational structure of both the school and the district, and scale seven describes student behavior, attitudes, and demographic characteristics. Each item is rated on a five point scale ranging from \"very typical\" to \"very atypical.\" The instrument provides seven scale scores in addition to a total score.

The discussion of interpersonal interaction centers in the relationship between the perception of self and other, overt and covert communication, and social choice and modes of eliciting responses from others. The first chapter is a discussion of the dimensions of interpersonal interaction postulated by five major approaches. The second chapter is a consideration of the dimensions of classroom  interaction. The final chapter concerns sources of influence on classroom interaction. This chapter also includes discussion of the empirical variables related to these dimensions, including personality, social and communication research, as well as some suggestions about ways in which the material could be applied directly to the classroom or to further research into the dynamics of classroom situations.

        "description":"Form D of the Psychosocial Maturity (PSM) Inventory and the Rokeach Dogmatism Scale were administered to 325 10th grade students to test a predicted correlation between the Dogmatism Scale and the Change and Tolerance subscales of the PSM battery, and to examine the pattern of covariation between psychosocial maturity and dogmatism. A substantial negative correlation between Tolerance and Dogmatism was obtained, but the predicted relation between Dogmatism and Openness to Change was weak. The authors posit a peculiarity in the wording of the Change items to explain the lack of a more substantial correlation. The implications of differential male and female patterns of correlation are discussed. (Author)",

The formula is extended to allow two scores, knowledge and speed, to be extracted from each examinees test score. Using a sample of 82 first quarter freshmen it was found that, compared to the simple total score, the two extracted scores gave better prediction of grade-point-average (gpa) in guantitative areas and was equally effective in predicting gpa in nonquantitative areas.

In addition, the structure of measured interests, as indicated by the intercorrelations of the six ACT Interest Inventory scales, was compared across the white and minoirty samples.

The third section deals with the prediction of creative or high level accomplishment. The fourth section reviews the increase in the understanding of students' educational backgrounds that biographical information provides. In the fifth section, the power of biographical information to predict vocational choices and vocational success is reviewed. The  sixth section is a review of the technical and theoretical requirements of effective biographical and self-report information systems. In the last section, the general functions of biographical data are considered. Throughout the review, emphasis is placed on predictive validity of the measures in educational settings because the power of a variable to predict later performance or choices is necessary before the variable can be used for guidance or sectioning. However, wherever warranted, other aspects of the use of self-report information are also discussed. (RC)",

Teachers often feel that evaluation is hasty, arbitrary, and threatening; more important, it gives them little practical help in improving their performance. This paper describes a pilot test of a new collegial evaluation program that emphasizes the improvement of classroom teaching. Working in pairs, teachers select their own criteria, observe each other in the classroom, give each other feedback, and develop plans for improvement. The program also provides for self-assessment and assessment by students to be incorporated into the overall evaluation. Thirty teachers and teacher trainees drawn from a variety of teaching situations participated in the  pilot test. On the whole, the results were promising: teachers reacted favorable to collegial evaluation; they were able to adapt the program to their own needs when necessary; and they gained new ideas for improvement from it.

Specifically, the tests measured vocabulary, English, reading comprehension, creativity, mechanical reasoning, visualization, abstract reasoning, quantitative reasoning, mathematics, and computation. Between 1960 and 1975, performance on all language tests--vocabulary, English, and reading comprehension--dropped significantly. Reading comprehension mean scores dropped one or two percentile points. Scores in computation  and quantitative reasoning also showed substantial declines.

The BA model is supported by a multifaceted evaluation strategy, predicated on four systematic process and outcome evaluation techniques. Each serves a unique function, is used on a continuous and regular basis, and is designed to complement the others. The first strategy, continuous progress assessment, is a computer-based system for monitoring the weekly academic progress of each child and classroom toward prescribed year-end curriclulm goals. The  second evaluation technique is the annual testing of BA children and a comparable sample of non-BA children on a standardized achievement test. The third strategy calls for regular formal and informal observations of the classroom which allows the determination of possbile needs for additional and/or specialized training of the classroom staff. The fourth evaluation measure is a survey of consumer satisfaction of the program and its effects which provides a measure of the social validity of the program. (Author)",

        "author":["Green, Donald Ross"],
        "description":"During the past few years the problem of bias in testing has become an increasingly important issue. In most research, bias refers to the fair use of tests and has thus been defined in terms of an outside criterion measure of the performance being predicted by the test. Recently however, there has been growing interest in assessing bias when such criteria are not available. In test construction in particular, where criterion measures are usually not collected until after the test is completed, assessment of bias, in the absence of criteria has become a vital issue. If unbiased tests are to be built, it is important to identify potentially biased items during the construction process when test content is still flexible and items may still be modified or eliminated. Presented here  are the author's research efforts over the past six years on bias in the construction of achievement tests. A general overview of the problem and some of the difficulties involved in studying it are also presented. (Author/DEP)",

This norm helps preserve the separation of teaching from organizational and collegial purviews. As part of a larger study which looks for conditions that affect and are influenced by variations in task interdependence among teachers, an effort was made to develop a questionnaire technique for measuring the norm simultaneously in a number of elementary schools. Questions were constructed on the conceptual and operational framework proposed by Jackson as a means to portray and measure norms. This largely methodological paper gives the essential underlying concepts and describes the instrument, its capabilities and scoring procedures. In addition, certain analyses are reported in  which characteristics of the norm are shown in relation to other organizational features. The regulatory potential of the autonomy and equality norm seems rather stable over time but fluctuates with changes in membership stability and task interdependence. (Author)",

It also offers suggestions for correcting those results when certain measurement  or analysis principles have been violated.

The film program had an impact on the teacher in terms of his behavior in the discussion and his immediate reaction to the films to some extent for most teachers. As to the extent to which teacher attitudes changed  in a more humanistic direction, only 25 percent of the teachers showed any appreciable post- over-pretest gain in attitude test scores. Most teachers showed no change; 18 percent showed a lower score. Very few positive shifts occurred in the students' attitude toward the teacher. Very little evidence was found that students were influenced in any positive way by the exposure their teachers had to the film series. The authors feel that the series represents a potentially useful departure from much of the more traditional teacher training materials and should be supported. It is recommended that the series be made easily available to all school systems. (RC)",

The films were conceived of as being a catalyst for discussions relating to teacher/student interactions with the goal being to stimulate all teachers, at whatever grade level or school setting, to be more humanistic in their relationships with students, and thus create a mentally healthier climate in their classrooms. The theoretical base of the films is the causal approach to understanding and dealing with student behavior, developed by Dr. Ralph Ojemann. The films could be characterized as being nondidactic, nonexhortative, and only at a low key level, as offering a model for teacher behavior. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the film  series' impact on teachers and students. All participating schools provided a volunteer discussion leader and teachers. The study used a combination of hard data obtained from the administration of three tests to teachers and students in a pre-post/experimental-control paradigm, and soft data obtained from two interview schedules administered to teachers and postfilm discussion leaders.

        "description":"The relationship between grades that students expected to receive and their evaluations of instructional quality was investigated. Correlations between expected grades and 10 evaluation scores--eight evaluation factors and two overall summary items--were based on the average responses in 591 undergraduate classes offered one term at the University of California, Los Angeles. Average responses to the overall instructor and overall course items, items most often used to obtain a summary impression, showed statistically significant correlations with average expected grades even though factors most closely associated with teaching (Instructor Enthusiasm, Breadth of Coverage, Interaction, and Organization) showed much smaller relationships with expected grades. This suggests that the  overall summary items are probably more subject to response biases than factor scores that are weighted averages of responses to more specific items. The magnitude of correlation between expected grades and evaluations reported in this study is similar to that reported in other studies, but is higher than is generally reported in literature reviews advocating the use of students' evaluations. It was concluded that even if grading leniency does produce a bias in students' evaluations--and this is only one possible explanation--the biases are relatively small and will not cause a poor instructor to be evaluated highly or a superior instructor to be evaluated poorly.

It is concluded that such programs, defined as efforts to determine the status of student achievement on a school, district, state, or national basis, are not serving the informational needs of the decision-making bodies for whom they are designed. Three schools of thought are discussed concerning reasons why large-scale testing programs are not adequately responsive. These included those who believe that policymakers do not wish to make data-based decisions; those who believe the fault lies with ineffective dissemination and utilization subsystems; and those who challenge the suitability of large-scale testing programs, as  currently operated, for serving the realities of educational policymaking. After discussing the nature of educational policymaking, the paper suggests three reasons why testing and assessment programs have failed to make the desired impact. These include: (1) such programs have not adequately defined the level at which their target audiences are most likely to make policy; (2) such programs seldom have the capacity to produce information which is \"issue\" oriented at a time when it is most needed by policymakers; and (3) few programs take into account that the policymaking process is characterized by \"uncertainty\" and by \"competing value systems.\" (Author/RC)",

The document concentrates on a user-oriented description of the content, validation, and use of the final version of the assessment system. DD&amp;E is a competence-based professional development program providing a flexible array of training resources concentrating on entry level skills and knowledge required in DD&amp;E. Chapter 1 describes the system, its design concepts, content, assessment methods, and overall use. Chapter 2 provides a detailed description of program planning assessment, including establishment of the student record file and the use  of the DD&amp;E Diagnostic Instrument. The development and validation data on this instrument is also summarized. Chapter 3 describes program progress assessment methods, discusses general guidelines for developing product ratings, and illustrates a student progress record matrix. Chapter 4 is concerned with existing competence certification. It describes and summarizes the field validation of a model Competence Assessment Battery that may be used to certify skills in &quot;instructional product development&quot;. Three assessment methods are employed: ratings, knowledge tests, and job sample tests. Field test data indicate that the tests are valid in terms of content validity and in terms of ability to discriminate between subjects with and without actual product development/evaluation experience.

When n's are unequal, previously reported suggestions for selecting subsample sizes for the Box test are shown to be inappropriate, producing a permissive test. The problem of heterogeneous within cell variance and unequal n's is discussed. Two procedures which alleviate this problem are presented for the Box test. Use of the jackknife test with a reduced alpha is shown to provide power and control of Type I error  at approximately the same level as the Box test. (Author)",

The report addresses the need for federal evaluation of programs concerning the well-being of children, for research directed toward problems identified through such evaluation, and  for greater dissemination of research knowledge. GAO devised a method for measuring the progress of children accepted for protective services by welfare agencies. This method focuses on the well-being of children rather than on the number and types of services provided or available. HEW's reactions to the recommendations of GAO are given. (RC)",

Ethnography promises to make a significant contribution to evaluation of educational innovations. Before this promise can be realized, however, there are many practical and theoretical problems to be solved. An attempt is made to aid this process by candidly sharing and analyzing some experiences in this area of applied anthropology. The use of the methodology and findings using ethnography in evaluating an innovative program of the New School in Cleveland Heights, Ohio is discussed. The evaluation model used to clarify the context in which ethnography is used is described first. The experience of using  ethnography is also discussed from two focuses: (1) problems that arose from inherent mismatches between the fundamental assumptions and processes of ethnography and those of evaluation; and (2) problems that arose from the particular ways the evaluation plans were put into practice.

While most explanations look to the cognitive or cultural deficiencies of lower class and minority students, this volume considers an alternative explanation. Prevailing definitions of academic achievement undoubtedly contribute to unequal results, but probably do not entirely explain differential school achievement. The educational concepts, structures, and interactions operating in schools powerfully shape outcomes as well. While many examples could be considered, three are scrutinized here in depth, namely IQ testing, the structural arrangement of tracking, and teachers expectations and behaviors. The review of literature focuses on how these ideas and  processes may depress the academic achievement of lower class or minority students and enhance the achievement of middle class or white children. Thus, this review has two purposes: to identify relationships between testing, tracking, teacher expectations, and unequal educational outcomes; and to try to specify the conditions under which those relationships occur. The evidence reviewed supports the assertion that schools substantially help to create and legitimize inequalities between children. (Author/DEP)",

A major goal is the development of a model for the identification and measurement of teacher competency areas; and the assessment of the extent to which these teacher behaviors (competencies) affect student outcomes, and the extent to which they relate to school goals and objectives. The certification process involves several stages including a screening procedure, classroom observations by trained observers in natural settings, and a study of certain relationships outside the classroom. Collection of student outcome data is used during the developmental stages, not as a basis for individual  teacher certification. The overall plan involves several steps including (a) establishment of a competency list and related teacher behaviors and student outcomes, (b) selection of appropriate classroom behavior and student growth measures, (c) data collection in on-going classrooms, (d) reduction of observation data to competency-related scores, and (e) examining relationships between observed competencies and student growth. Replication of these steps successfully in additional classrooms will provide a validation of the findings and confirmation that some competencies were measurable and resulted in student growth. This in turn would provide a set of measurable teacher competencies that could be used as part of the certification process. (RC)",

        "description":"PETC-III is one of several instructional systems currently under development in the Improving Teaching Competencies Program of the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory. The PECT-III materials include training strategies and procedures plus participant instructional materials for use with a select group of educators in a workshop setting. PETC-III carries with it a change support process termed organizational development. This document presents the evaluation report for the pilot stage of the PETC-III system's development. This evaluation was conducted to facilitate judgments about the efficacy of materials, strategies, and the accompanying change support process that comprise the PETC-III instructional system. The first chapter describes the system's history and objectives.  The second chapter describes the pilot test workshop study, including methods of obtaining information, and presents the empirical evidence collected from the workshops. The next chapter describes the process of the expert external review conducted on the PECT series and presents a summary of the review critiques. This is followed by a description of the search for alternative training programs on the market and a comparative analysis of the search results. The final chapter contains a summary of the findings. Appendices include the Improving Teaching Competencies Program's product development model, questionnaires used in the pilot test workshops and documents pertaining to the implementation and results of the external review and alternatives search.

The successful performance of certain competencies ordinarily is viewed as an important adjunct of course work. They are not seen by most schools as a replacement for course work, but rather as one significant step toward giving the diploma. The monograph addresses the dual question of assisting students while at the same time insisting that the diploma regain meaning. It provides a background to the competency test movement, and reports on the initiatives taken nationwide to use applied performance tests as a requirement for graduation. Items are presented for several competency tests in current use in the areas of mathematics,  reading, writing, democratic process, art, music, and money management. Appendices contain lists of states and schools using competency tests and legislation and State Board rulings concerning competency tests. (RC)",

        "description":"Comparative data on the perceptions of objectives and the performance of schools in meeting these objectives among the various status groups involved in secondary education that extends previous research efforts by offering a combined measure of dissatisfaction is reported in this paper. The proposed measure of satisfaction with the school system involves a combination of the perception of appropriate goals or objectives and of the perception of the performance of the system with regard to these goals. The findings are based on data gathered from secondary school students, the parents of students, and teachers of Pontiac, Michigan. When the total respondents in each of three status groups provide the basis for analysis, parents of secondary school students expect the school  system to address a more pervasive set of goals than do teachers. Among the conclusions are the following: on the average, substantial majorities of teachers and parents and a substantial minority of students are dissatisfied with the extent to which school performance corresponds to objectives, racial differences on the average are small compared to the differences between status levels in the school system, and in terms of distributive justice, there do seem to be differential perceptions of the extent to which the educational system is meeting client needs.

        "description":"The complex interactions which led to the implementation of the court-ordered desegregation plans for two cities in Massachusetts involve not only the courts but many levels of government. The school departments, the school committees, the mayors, the State Board of Education, the legislature, the governor, and the citizens of Massachusetts, all have varying perspectives, all exert different degrees of influence. This study is an attempt to sort out these persepctives and measure their influences. An examination of the forces leading to desegregation in Boston and Springfield go beyond local activities. It places Massachusetts events in the context of the legal and social developments in school desegregation which have occupied national attention for at least the last 20 years. A  survey of constitutional doctrine, federal legislation, civil rights activities, the movement toward community control of schools, and the antibusing backlash, gives new significance to Boston and Springfield desegregation plans and the controversies from which they have emerged. The lesson that can be learned from the study of the progress toward racial balance in Boston and Springfield is clear; regardless of the inherent difficulties or the strength of the opposing forces, an ideal as powerful as that of equal educational opportunity cannot be thwarted indefinitely. What is not clear is whether the ideal will have an impact on the real world. (Author/AM)",

Each segment is composed of three parts. The purpose of each segment is given to state the intent as perceived by the series designers and television writers, the synopsis is a brief overview of each segment containing details of the major events of each episode within the  segment and the names of the main characters, and the ideas for discussion following each segment contains questions designed with the hope of promoting classroom discussion and thinking. Among the segments presented are the following: outerscope, real people, make a new friend, people's jobs, heroes, the superlative horse, story telling time, children's poetry and art, holidays, children's questions and activities. Vegetable Soup uses an interdisciplinary approach to entertain and educate elementary age children in the value of human diversity. The show offers teachers a unique opportunity to further develop children's skills in the areas of language arts, social studies, and career education. (Author/AM)",

Information and data are obtained from ten English speaking elementary schools within the Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal. Findings indicate that school board data on class size is discrepant with actual class size; that the personnel in inner city schools seem to be less experienced than noninner city schools; that both black and immigrant groups perform equally poorly on standardized reading tests; and that black children have  more difficulty than immigrant children on standardized math tests. The results do not seem discrepant from other studies of lower SES schools. Once again, the problem in the skill areas is reaffirmed. The issues that remain are the following: (1) whether communities are going to make the necessary commitments of time, energy, and money to make successful intervention in schools; (2) whether this intervention will try to match the child, his culture, and instructional task; and, (3) whether learning will take place from past mistakes, or whether mistakes will be made again.

        "description":"Several questions are posed by this study which seeks to provide an indepth view of both the teacher's and the child's perspective of the inner city and environment. Among the questions are the following: whether the teacher's perception of the inner city child's environment would match the child's own perception; also given that a mismatch exists, would the teacher be able to alter his/her perceptions by discarding the myths in which he/she believes. An analysis of the data gathered from 78 children from elementary and secondary inner city schools in Montreal indicates that student teachers with minimal exposure to the inner city environment and those having few personal interactions with inner city children tend to view life in the inner city in terms of extreme poverty,  deprivation, and degradation. A detailed analysis comparing the responses of those student teachers having no university training in inner city education reveals a marked misperception of the environment as compared with the perceptions of inner city children. In contrast, those student teachers with university training which includes a course on the urban child, tend to have perceptions which more closely approximate that of the inner city child.

        "description":"The effects of participation as a salaried professional in a reform oriented organization on the participants' subsequent career is considered in this paper and studied in the context of the OEO sponsored Legal Services Program. Because of the paucity of literature on the consequences of participation in reform organizations, a related literature, that of the consequences of participation in the student movement of the sixties, is drawn on for insight and is also critically examined. A comparison of the subsequent careers of 228 lawyers involved in the program in 1967 to those of 981 other lawyers who were practicing law in 1967 indicates that program participation has an important effect on both the distribution of professional services and the rendering of reform oriented free  or reduced fee work. The explanations offered stress the importance of job market factors, in contrast to previous work which has suggested that the socialization is the sole or primary means through which such effects occur. A further difference from previous work is the consideration of the effects of variation in experience in the organization-a topic which is briefly discussed. (Author/AM)",

Among the categories listed under the first section are: linguistics, linguistic development at various ages, diagnostic intelligence tests, perceptual development, memory skills, and verbal problem solving. Standard English, English as a second  language, language development curriculum, language and reading achievement, writing and spelling, and involvement of other in language growth are among the categories subsumed by the second section. Nine references are included under historical review intended to help to view the present developments in perspective. The conclusion provides a summary of the major points.

An article on new curricula for multiethnic schools notes that most of the urban and suburban schools are racially and ethnically isolated--not multiethnic or multiracial. Consequently, curricula need to be provided for a culturally diverse population which may or may not be in culturally and ethnically diverse schools. A second article explores classroom use of multiethnic material. Here, it is suggested that the teacher's responsibility is to find a means by which he/she can elicit from all youngsters something about themselves and their lives and in this way  develop the classroom lesson as a meaningful experience. The development of criteria for evaluating materials dealing with the heritage, culture, and traditions of nonwhite minority groups for racism and sexism is stressed in a third article focusing on racism and stereotyping in textbooks. A final article concludes that a racist and sexist society will reflect these influences in its products. Here, ten quick ways to analyze children's books for racism and sexism are given.

The district devised the program when it became apparent--as evidenced by test scores--that the existing system was not providing Hempstead children with the best of all possible education. The Directed Learning Program is an exemplary project because the children have made tremendous academic progress and acquired very positive attitudes toward  themselves, their ability, and their school experiences. Teachers are also very enthusiastic about the program. The Directed Learning Program could be replicated by other school systems where a traditional approach had been ineffective.

These programs are the Development Skills Center, which is based on individualized programs of learning, and a Remedial Physical Education Program, which seeks to improve the health and general physical functioning of its students as a basis for facilitating their educational development. For the first few years, the center provided mainly enrichment experiences. Although center activities now focus on developing more specifically academic  skills, the basic philosophy still remains the same; that is, it is assumed that a child is not succeeding in school because, for any number of reasons, he or she is not as happy there as he could be. Proceeding on this assumption, the school provides the facilities of the center so that such children can be offered several hours each week in which adults concentrate special attention on them to deal with their needs and help them meet with success.

The program features an extensive, continuous medical and dental program, with part or all of the total cost borne by the schools; daily school meal program--breakfast, lunch, and dinner (one, two, or three meals provided free of charge if necessary); extended school program (longer days, summer program, preschool); and, bilingual Follow Through programs at primary school level (kindergarten to grade three). The San Diago program has resulted in: improved nutrition and  health among school children (indicated by research results in National Nutrition Survey and subsequent testimony before U.S. Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs); decreased absenteeism; increased pupil attentiveness; enthusiasm and classroom participation; increased number of high school graduates; higher college attendance, greater post-graduation job stability; and greater parent participation.

        "description":"The first attempt believed to be ever made by drug prevention researchers to investigate the long term effects of a school based curriculum that may have affected student's decisions on the use of drugs is reported here. This final report contains a short section in nontechnical language describing the study and its results, and a longer section providing the detail and language characteristic of a research report. The evidence from this study indicates that a curriculum that taught students to recognize when it is warranted to be uncertain has a desirable effect three years later on those student's beliefs and behavior concerning drugs. The curriculum was not developed for the purpose of drug abuse prevention and contained no examples or exercises dealing with drug abuse  prevention. The most interesting finding, from the standpoint of drug abuse prevention, is the pattern of correlations indicating that students who can recognize when it is warranted to be uncertain about drugs report less hard drug use and more soft drug use. Another important outcome of the study is the finding that warranted uncertainty is a reliable construct which, irrespective of training, affects self-reported drug use. The discovery that drug use may be significantly affected by a relatively brief classroom-based training exercise that does not contain information about drugs has interesting implications for the development of prevention strategies.

        "description":"Developed to identify how low socioeconomic black students perceive the world about them in relation to social and academic characteristics identified by various research findings, this study employs the research technique of using a visual multiple choice questionnaire. The establishment of characteristic statement photographs as being either positive or negative to the statement and/or directions provided assures a high degree of questionnaire validity. The use of pilot field testing of the questionnaire establishes reliability. The photograph series include 10 social characteristics and 8 academic characteristics. Among the former are: living environment, adult models, emotional reactions, resentful of authority, and materialistic concerns. The latter category includes  successful experiences, abstract ideas, vocational objectives, interacting relationships, and others. Findings for each photograph series are presented in a systematic fashion including such items as a discussion of findings, the advisory committee's projected opinions, and the implications for teachers. A summary of some basic teaching principles is provided in the conclusion. The 20 principles presented are as applicable to vocational education as they are to all areas of secondary education. The results of the study are intended to assist inner city high school vocational teachers in the use of the basic principles of teaching. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"Some of the tasks undertaken by the Pittsburgh Public Schools over the past 10 years in the continuing effort to make desegregation work include the construction of new buildings and the renovation of old, restructuring of school attendance patterns, development of innovative programs, utilization of community resources and support, and the willingness to devote a lot time and effort to a frequently unpopular cause. This paper addresses itself to the efforts involving the first four activities listed above. The basic goals guiding the construction of new buildings are the improvement of racial balance, movement toward a system wide 5-3-4 grade organization, relief of overcrowding, and replacement of inefficient and obsolete building. The staff's latest proposal to restructure the  attendance patterns of the school district in an effort to achieve the school district's goals for quality education is the system wide school feeder plan involving 12 middle schools. One of the most beneficial programs, for both educational and sociological purposes is the Exploratory Occupational, Vocational and Technical Education Program which introduces students to several areas of study. A program that exemplifies cooperation and support from community organizations is a mental health and intergroup relations project. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"The relationships between use of specific tutorial skills and pupil outcomes is the domain of the present paper, the third of three studies of mathematics tutoring designed and conducted using three populations of tutors--teachers, paraprofessionals, and students. The other two studies individually address the effects of tutoring on the achievement and attitudes of fourth and/or fifth grade pupils, and the effects of training in tutorial skills on the achievement and attitudes of fourth and/or fifth grade pupils. Minicourse 5, Individualizing Instruction in Mathematics, is used as the training vehicle for each of the three studies, although the materials are adapted for use with the student tutors. Regression analysis procedures are proposed in order to investigate the  relationship of the tutoring skills and interpersonal behaviors to pupil outcomes. The data which forms the basis of the regression analyses consists of frequency counts indicating the number of times that a particular skill is used in the tutorial setting. A more appropriate question in these analyses might have concerned itself not with the quantity of skill usage, but with the quality or appropriateness of a particular skill being used. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"The care or neglect which people bestow on the appearance and cleanliness of the public places in which they live and work is the central focus of this paper. Basically the phenomenon that is studied is that encountered when people who are usually law abiding, orderly, and responsible citizens deviate from the prescribed and insituttionalized norms by littering, trampling, defacing, and otherwise neglecting or damaging the environment in public and semipublic places. Antecedent variables such as community size, density, and heterogeneity as well as residential stability, age distirubiton, and housing types are posited. The general hypothesis implied by this choice of variables is that, with increasing urbanism, more patterned evasion from the relevant prevailing norms will be  found. This phenomenon is studied in a sample of 24 kibbutzim, since in these settings values tend to be clearly articulated in the formal and informal normative systems and are more readily observable. The general hypothesis receives some empirical support. However, it is not urbanism as conventionally defined that is related to the patterned evasion, but rather different elements of the urbanism syndrome are associated with different aspects of environmental care.

The main goal is to consider how schools may respond to the problem, and attention is restricted to changes in schools that may help, even though more fundamental reforms in society would have much greater impact. The presentation has three parts: definitions and classifications of the problem of crime in the schools are offered; a brief review of five major theories of the causes of juvenile offenses and implications of those theories for reforms in the larger society are presented; and an analysis of whether schools play a distinct role in the problem and a brief review of evaluations of specific school changes to address the  problem are given. Two broad generalizations are highlighted in the conclusion. The first underscores the need for additional serious studies on what schols can do about the violence problem. The best that can be said is that the present knowledge is indirect, dealing mostly with forces deeply embedded in American instit utions and the social structure outside of the school. The second is the belief that schools presently play a direct or unique role in the violence problem, independent of the underlying conditions of employment, family, and juvenile law enforcement institutions.

The paper further contends that the lack of an external and internal legitimacy is due to the lack of an objectively identifiable unique methodology to undergrid Black Studies. Section I addresses the need for a methodology of Black Studies and focuses on the problem, method, perspective, and methodology (value-bias and value-orientation), and also discusses the \"Death of White Sociology.\" Section II addresses issues concerning the development of a substantive structure for a Black Studies methodology. Here, the problem is discussed along with a Black Studies perspective, the substantive structure, the dominance-subjugation  threat-submission (DS/TS) system, conditions for the identification of the DS/TS system, implication of the DS/TS system, and some implications of the DS/TS system for empirical research (identifying oppression, the homogeneity of black people, and race and class). Ideology and methodology are the focus of the concluding section. The search for a methodology of Black Studies in the Black Studies crisis is the primary aim of actualizing a long run internal and external legitimacy. (Author/AM)",

The model on which this analysis is based assumes that student effort in school is the product of several factors relating to parental influences, classroom structure, teacher behavior and peer norms and characteristics. In assessing the possibility of a linkage between school desegregation and achievement a set of student attitudes which reflect commitment to learning are measured and analyzed. The methodology through which the data here are developed and organized was developed as part of a larger study of how children acquire attitudes and values that might have political consequences. The methodology has six components: a procedure for categorical observation of teacher-student interaction,  a sociogram-type map of the classroom and student teacher relationships, a checklist type assessment by observers of various aspects of classroom structure or climate, an extensive student questionnaire, a teacher questionnaire, and content analysis of relevant learning materials. This paper relies most heavily on the questionnaire data. Seventy-nine North Carolina fifth grade classrooms participated in the study. (Author/JM)",

During the 1974-75 school year, the Stamford Public Schools contracted with the Educational Resources and Development Center to perform an evaluation of the project. The basic questions for evaluation were: What effect has the Bank Street program had on the achievement levels of Ryle students? What are the attitudes of Ryle students toward school? What is their level of self-concept? What kind of classroom interaction occurs in the Ryle school? What are the attitudes of teachers toward the program? It was found that the implementation of the Bank Street Approach at Ryle School has been  beneficial. There is evidence that students are achieving a year's academic growth in a year. The attitudes of all groups referent to Ryle School are very positive. Teachers and parents express very favorable attitudes toward the program and its continuation. Student self-concept and positive attitudes toward school are at least as high as a Connecticut state-wide sample. (Author/JM)",

The education provided these community people would hopefully benefit both them and the students with whom they came in contact. The project was due to expire at the end of August 1975. In November 1974, the Educational Resources and Development Center of the University of Connecticut was contacted and later contracted by the Connecticut State Department of Education, to conduct an evaluation of the Hartford Career Opportunities Program. On the basis of the data  gathered and analyses performed, this evaluation concludes that the Hartford Career Opportunities Program has substantially achieved its goals.

The University of Hartford should consider institutionalizing some of the aspects of the COP teacher training. (Author/JM)",

The goals included: the improvement of the students' self-image, the increase of the students' motivation to learn, the development in pupils and parents of positive attitude toward school, and the improvement of the students' academic achievement level. Evaluation procedures included such activities as designing and distributing evaluation questionnaires for education project personnel, referral and  support personnel, students, parents and teachers; pre-and postadministrations of the Stanford Diagnostic Test, California Achievement Tests, and a Youth Inventory; direct observations; and interviews.

Responses to a detailed questionnaire were elicited through personal interviews. Respondents were questioned in two broad areas: their basic functional characteristics (e.g., work context, education, professional orientation) and their school social work practices (e.g., types of tasks performed, frequency). Among the major findings of this study, briefly stated, are: the vast majority of the respondents were female, had earned Master of Social Work degrees,  and were highly experienced. Few of the respondents had undertaken field placements in school settings during their graduate studies, and most had to learn the expectations of their jobs on their own after being hired. Most respondents reported having a high degree of autonomy in their jobs, and two-thirds expressed a high level of satisfaction with their work. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"A summary and highlight of the significant developments, major accomplishments and important research findings of the three years of operation of the Honolulu Buddy System Project is contained in this document. In addition, the implications that the research data have generated, along with further directions to be explored are included. Most importantly, the report specifies the exact ways in which the Family Court can incorporate the concept and techniques demonstrated by the Buddy System into the existing Family Court structure and how they may effectively be utilized by the present staff. Significant achievements that are identified include the following: (1) participation in the program does not in and of itself increase school attendance; (2) the utilization of the  principles and techniques of behavior modification is effective in the treatment of youth participating in the project; and (3) nonprofessionals can be trained to become effective change agents when working with youth. Among the problem areas that are listed are the following: the administrative delays in processing contracts and hiring personnel, the inadequacies of the Youth Referral System, parental refusal to participate in projects due to labeling, the training of parents, and data collection by buddies and behavior analysts. A major consistent findings is that the Buddy System is most effective in reducing offenses than in preventing them. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"The hypothesis that participation in a Palama Settlement House after-school, academic-athletic program leads to an increase in academic performance in the targeted subject (math) in school is examined in this document. It is also of interest to know whether or not the program is reaching its target group of low academic achievers. A sample of youngsters who completed at least one academic athletic season in the program is matched for sex, grade in school, and school attended with a nonparticipating control group. For both groups, school grades in math, verbal and math scores on standardized tests (STEP and SCAT), and attendance in school are compared for the year prior to and following the program. These scores are obtained from school records. There is no difference between the  two groups on preprogram school math grades and verbal or math achievement tests. The post program scores show that academic gains made in the program result in improved post program STEP and SCAT math scores but do not show up in postprogram school math grades. The findings underscore both a success in the Palama Program for improving math ability and a failure for this to be reflected in school math grades. This implies the need for closer cooperation between youngsters school teachers and the Palama academic coaches to ensure the generalization of program results to school performance. (Author/AM)",

This project is an exploratory behavioral intervention program for educationally deprived students and focuses its efforts on the improvement of academic and school oriented behaviors. The tutor component of the project consists of the delivery of academic remedial services through the use of the peer tutoring strategy adopted from the Operation Tutor Project. The buddy component consists of the mediation and advocacy efforts of the project buddies to support and maintain student academic progress. The efforts involve buddy contacts with parents and teachers to  create supportive conditions for learning, and the use of positive, nonacademic activities to motivate student learning. The project is successful in reaching its goals and attaining its objectives, and effective in helping the pupils to acquire social and academic behaviors which are essential for success in schools and the community. Academic improvement is shown most clearly in reading and mathematics skills, the tutored subjects. Improvement in attitudes toward the environment is also indicated. It is recommended that the project be continued with at least thirty weeks of consistent and well organized implementations. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"The recommendations resulting from the Community Conference are contained in this document. The conference focuses on the concept of community schools and its applicability to New York City. The concept involves expanding the use of schools as locations for voluntary activities and community service programs which serve not only the student population but every segment of the community. Four general assumptions which form the philosophical basis of the recommendations to implement community schools in New York City are discussed in the summary of conference proceedings. Foremost here is a recognition that the public school is a natural and logical focus for community activities. The recommendations listed are arranged in the following order: mayoral action, Board of Education  action, legislative action (congressional, state legislature, and city council), community action, and union action (United Federation of Teachers and International Union of Operating Engineers). Inherent in all the recommendations is one common ingredient--cooperation. Cooperation requires no expenditure of funds. If all interested groups work cooperatively toward implementing these recommendations, all will benefit from their achievement. The failure to cooperate by any one group will seriously impede the effort. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"The basic problem in designing change efforts and in assessing them is determining which processes or consequences count and by how much. Whether it is teaching or learning that needs to be changed has to be determined. So it is with class size. What is to be changed as well as how that change is to be measured needs to be determined. The key question in considering class size is whether it is the nature of the school as an organization--in which the smaller classes exist--that accounts for the larger share of any observed increase in student learning, or whether increased learning can be brought directly, simply by increasing the number of small classes, regardless of other aspects of the school organization. It is suggested that discussions and research of class size would be  more useful if they dealt with some of the significant relationships that exist between a resource allocation plan and the social processes that constitute the environment of these smaller classes. In attempting to point out the significance of the school context in looking at the question of class size, the question of criteria of success is also dealt with. However, it is suggested that student learning is not the criterion of success. It is suggested that the social slogan \"smaller classes equals better learning\" is a useful aphorism whose utility has been demonstrated. Its current validity or future validity, without redefinition of terms is in doubt. (Author/AM)",

It is noted that to date children, their families, and their subcultures have been studied and that advice has been given to parents and to teachers about the child's development. Yet it is suggested that the findings concerning the kind of relationship a family needs with institutions and the society in order to be able to rear a child to become a competent and humane adult have been ignored. Because little attention is paid to the relationships between families and society, there is no preparation to look carefully at the kind of institutional and societal changes needed to keep up with changing technology. It is noted that  children continue to be reared for the nineteenth century rather than the twentieth, and the impact of technological change has been ignored. One problem has been the fact that the response to change and challenge is to collect new knowledge rather than to apply tried and true knowledge; to be concerned about the intellect rather than the effect and the resultant quality of human relationships. Although some movement towards the implementation of policies that favorably affect the lives of children is noted, there remains a long way to go in developing the kind of interest, knowledge, and organization necessary to affect social policy.

Other purposes include the provision of assistance to voluntary desegregation efforts and the establishment of a national community and education committee to provide assistance to encourage and facilitate constructive and comprehensive community involvement and planning in the desegregation of schools. The bill would establish for federal courts specific guidelines concerning the use of busing in school desegregation cases. It would require the court to determine the extent to which acts of unlawful discrimination by governmental officials have caused a greater degree of  racial concentration in a school or school system than would have existed in the absence of such acts. The bill would prohibit a court from ordering busing throughout an entire school system simply for the purpose of achieving racial balance. The bill recognizes that the busing remedy is transitional by its very nature and that when a community makes good faith efforts to comply, busing ought to be limited in duration. As such the bill provides that three years after busing remedy has been imposed, a court be required to determine whether to continue the remedy. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"The racial attitudes of 83 children who live in a community which is approximately half black and half white are examined in this study. Income and education are similar for both races. The purpose of the study is twofold: to test a hypothesis about the effect of equal status interracial contact and to investigate parents' perception of their children's adaptation to interracial living. Two populations are examined; white children in grades three through six in the public school which is 81% black during the year studied (1974-75) and white children who live in the same community and attend the same grades in a variety of secular and religious private schools. The public school system is over 96% black at the elementary level during the year studied. The white children studied  tend to perceive blacks as hard working, honest, intelligent, good neighbors, worthwhile companions and teachers who deserve a college education and to aspire to the Presidency of the United States. Perhaps the most startling and unexpected finding of this study is that the white children in the community are not clear who is black and who is white. There is evidence that indicates that race is less important in this community than elsewhere in the U.S. It may be that homogeneity in social class for blacks and whites is important in predicting the success of interracial communities.

The program additionally provides for preschool children who are presently enrolled in noneducational day care and other such agencies. SEN is also the only state funded program which can provide supplemental funding for public school districts wishing to establish programs for prekindergarten students who are potentially low achievers with  economic and social deprivation. During the past year, 1975-76, the SEN program funded 29 projects, serving a total of 2376 children. This report has identified the financial and statistical information relative to enrollment expenditures and grant awards issued to all participating agencies.

It generates opportunities for blacks to perform in occupations which for many years were closed to them. For hundreds of years blacks have been despised and often looked down upon on account of the fact that in the main they possess no property; most of them are poor amidst plenty. It is argued here that through black capitalism, all these anomalous treatments could be combated and alleviated. Since the rebirth of black business enterprises, black racial has reappeared because now some better opportunities exist for blacks. Blacks of the modern era are seen in high government offices, mercantile industries, institutions of higher  learning, and private endeavors. The pace of black capitalism has been slow in realizing its goal of a total economic upgrading of the black community which requires the ownership and control of new capital and business opportunity by people within the black ghetto, but it has made some significant achievements. It is concluded that black capitalism is gradually generating new vitality in the black-ghetto inner cities. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The rural Negro population has been of public concern since the slave status was defined and an ideological defense of that status began to take shape. When slavery ended, a definition of the Negro status in custom and in law was undertaken wherever Negro people were concentrated. Controls were devised to &quot;keep the Negro in his place.&quot; That place for decades was to be in the rural South and largely in the agricultural enterprises until the impact of World War I was felt in the United states. In order to place a discussion of the rural Negro at a conference identified with W.E.B. DuBois several references are mentioned and discussed. By 1970, 80 percent of the black population is in urban places and nearly 74 percent are in metropolitan areas. No more than half (53 percent) of the  black population is southern, and in no state is the black population much more than a third. The black farmers who remain are highly concentrated, specialize in cash crops, and operate small units with little monetary return. Current trends do not encourage hopes for a resurgence of blacks in agriculture in the South. Despite what appears to be a high rate of reproduction the black farm population is diminishing. There is a high rate of out-migration from rural populations, and the number of children is diminishing relative to the total population. A high proportion of the black children in rural farm areas are those of people who are dead, who are living elsewhere, or who are members of subfamilies whose heads are not household heads.

        "description":"Various issues involved in the redefinition of black people, especially as it concerns their education, are addressed in this paper. The cultural context is especially pertinent, as it forces black educators to be explicit about the issue of a distinctive black subculture. Other issues addressed include the following: the society's and in particular, the public school's failure to prepare the majority of black people for the complex, technological society of the present or future, the concept of culture and the problems involved in its definition, factors that set blacks apart from other immigrants in America, slavery, black self-concept, federal funding for the education of the disadvantaged, the dual culturalization processes, language and communication systems and the  preservation of culture, the role of the church in the development of the personality of black folks and the role of music -- especially jazz and the blues. Various policy implications derived from the discussion are suggested. Among these are that there should be opposition to the philosophy and value system of this county based on the definition of black people which proclaimed as the supreme law of the land the status of black people as property. The importance of research on the concept of dual, simultaneous culturalization is also stressed. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"The diverse effects of racial discrimination in urban housing markets are discussed in this paper. It also outlines a number of programs and policies that would ameliorate these effects in the short run and would help eradicate racial discrimination and segregation in the long run. The paper's emphasis reflects the opinion that housing market discrimination is the linch pin that holds together the web discriminatory practices that limit the opportunities and achievement of black Americans. The paper begins with a review of the findings of economists and other social scientists on the extent of racial segregation, on its causes, and on its impact on the welfare of black and white Americans. The survey reveals that housing market discrimination imposes more numerous and larger  costs on black Americans than is popularly understood and strongly supports the conclusion that the commitment to equal opportunity in housing ought to be reviewed. The second half of the paper considers a number of policies that would ameliorate the effects of racial discrimination in urban housing markets and foster its eventual eradication. In conclusion, it is noted that at the same time that there are encouraging signs that the barriers to blacks seeking housing outside the ghetto are somewhat less, many black leaders and intellectuals appear to have lost their zest for integration as a goal.

The comparisons are presented in the full belief that racial variations are fundamentally socioeconomic variations. Efforts are also made to identify areas of mortality and/or morbidity where available data suggest an interaction between environment and black identification. These are accompained by descriptions of the types of information needed to interpret these phenomena and of actions necessary to reduce the added disease burden among blacks. In general, death rates within socioeconomic groups become more alike and those between groups more variable as infectious diseases are  brought under control. Variations between socioeconomic groups are the compound result of a number of factors. Some of the most important are: exposure to the causes of chronic diseases, access to and use of medical services, personal health behavior, and individual resistance. The last is a physiological state that itself is the consequence of an interplay of environmental experiences, genetic endowment, and health behavior. Some effort is made to interpret the mortality statics presented in terms of these contributing factors. A useful overall perspective is gained from summaries of the pattern of changes in major causes of death across all ages. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"The urbanization of the black population is a relatively recent phenomenon. Historically, migration has been the major source of the growth of the black population in the large cities of the North, yet the migration from nonmetropolitan to metropolitan areas has been going long enough to have established a substantial black population in the cities--blacks now account for about 21 percent of the total for central cities, and substantially higher fractions in some of them. The migrant population is a relatively young one, as is normal for rural-urban migration, and population growth resulting from an excess of births over deaths is an increasingly important element in the growth of this population group. The indications are that the black population of the central cities is  increasing though at a rate less than that during the late 1960's and that it will continue to increase. The migration from nonmetropolitan areas to the central cities is greater than that from the central cities to nonmetropolitan areas. The volume of movement between suburban areas and nonmetropolitan areas is relatively small, and the moves in one direction virtually offset the moves in the other. The prospects are that the population will become even more a metropolitan area population, and for the near future, it is likely to remain primarily a population in the central cities of the larger metropolitan areas.

Two questions are investigated: first, whether the conclusion of the Civil War marks the beginning of a new educational era for the nineteenth century blacks; and second, whether there have in fact been real educational gains that go beyond normal expectations. The historical review in the first section indicates that it is not until the early twentieth century that the chains of the industrial education concept even began to be removed; and that any serious attempt to equalize expenditures for schools in the South does not occur until the 1954 court decision. A second section examines the demographic aspects of education. It focuses first on  illiteracy, then on school enrollment, and finally an educational attainment. In the comparison of black-white education, however measured, a basic difficulty in making statistical comparisons arises: that of percentage increases. It is much easier for the oppressed groups to exhibit significant percentage gains than it is for the advantaged groups. Quantitative, if not qualitative, progress in Negro education has occurred at least in recent years despite a system that did everything in its power to block it until recently. (Author/AM)",

The problems of not being able to find employment are also important, and unemployment is also examamined. Findings indicate that there are declining proportions of males in the labor force with greater decline among black males than among white males. There is some evidence of increasing labor force participation among younger black males. Both black and white females show increasing rates of labor force participation, with white females having lower rates but increasing more rapidly. Blacks have approximately twice the unemployment rates of whites. While whites still show generally lower rates than blacks, the differences are not as great within age by  education by sex categories. The cohort analysis of occupational trends indicates that black females are making more rapid occupational gains than are black males. When the ration of black to white median earnings is taken as a measure of income differential and this ratio is examined by years of education, it is found that based on males who worked 50-52 weeks out of the year in 1969, the ratio of black to white earnings declines with increasing education all the way up through sixteen years of education.

Section I of the paper presents an introduction. Section II addresses recent migration to metropolitan areas, focusing on the origins of recent migrants, characteristics of recent migrants (age, education, activity, status, and occupation), and a summary. This section of the paper notes that black migrants to metropolitan areas now come predominantly from other metropolitan areas and that the major stream of black migration is now from one metropolitan area to another. It is also noted that the description of the average black migrant to the city as an ill-trained person of rural background and low socioeconomic status to whom the  social problems of the large metropolitan areas can be largely attributed will not hold. He or she is in fact well educated by current standards and, judging from the occupational position of those employed, relatively successful at utilizing this education. Section III discusses interstate migration and multiple movers. It seems clear from the evidence of the 1970 census, that the black population of the United States is now in a third stage--when the rural to urban shift has proceeded to the point where in fact it is a relatively small part of total migration and when perhaps the differences in educational opportunities between city and country have diminished.

First, it relates the research and writings of DuBois, a social scientist and humanist in the best intellectual tradition of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, to the sociology of the black family in the United States; and second, it presents selected data having to do with the structure and functioning of contemporary black families. Probably even more than being descriptive, the presentation has to do with issues of knowledge, theory, methodology, and social policy raised by the study of family life among blacks. Since DuBois' time, and before, a popular profile of the black family stresses family composition and makes extensive and important inferences about behavior and achievement. The data, based on census figures, is not  satisfactory for explaninig how and why a family functions. The discussion of the several intellectual hats and dimensions DuBois brings to the study of the family and experiences of blacks suggests that research and writing on the black family, aside from considerable datedness, much unevenness, and many gaps reflects as many approaches as there are traditions or modes of intellectual activity. It also serves to underscore several issues, among them the fact that more studies in the field and in some depth are needed of various types or expressions of family activity and among blacks in many settings. Any sociological profile of the black family demands a balance between objectivity and caring about human values. (Author/AM)",

Findings did  not show a simple age-related curve.

A categorical analysis of the data indicated no significant differences between the range group and the \"30 and 6\" group in terms of accident involvement but the traditional groups had somewhat fewer accidents and violations, although the difference was not significant. Inconclusive differences were noted when the results were analyzed by race and sex. A cost effectiveness analysis revealed that the cost per student was higher in the range program.

        "description":"Motorcycle safety education will become a necessity in the near future due to the growing demands of secondary students for education in this area. The Motorcycle Safety Foundation is sponsored by major motorcycle industries and is involved with developing programs and materials to promote motorcycle safety education. The high rate of motorcycle accidents during the first few months of motorcycle driving supports the need for motorcycle safety education in secondary schools. A program of this sort should be voluntary and come after the student has completed driver education instruction. Motorcycles can be obtained by schools with the cooperation of motorcycle dealers. Finally, local support is necessary to guarantee the initiation, continuation, and success of motorcycle safety  education programs. (Author/EC)",

The extent of knowledge was measured through a comparative test of experimental and control groups of Grades 3, 6, and 9 students. A filming system was developed to record actual pedestrian and bicyclist behavior of students from experimental and control schools. Finally, questionnaires were developed to determine the attitude of teachers towards the curriculum materials. The findings of the study revealed  the following: (1) Grades 3 and 6 students exposed to the curriculum showed significant increases in knowledge compared to students in control schools, but no significant differences were found at the Grade 9 level, (2) the behavior observed did not show the type of effects expected, and (3) the results of the questionnaire (90.5% return) indicate that traffic safety curriculum was generally accepted and used by teachers.

Its major purpose was to gather baseline data for a driver license, road testing program. Forty volunteer subjects (10 men and 10 women over 30, 10 men and 10 women under 30) drove a specially instrumented car over an interstate highway course and a heavily traveled urban course. The following variables were measured: total trip time, miles traveled, speed changes, lane changes, fine steering reversals, accelerator reversals, brake applications, and average speed. Several differences were found between vehicle control patterns of the men and women. Several smaller differences appeared between age groups. Finally, a comparison of interstate data with that of a previous study  revealed consistency between groups, but a significant difference with respect to lane changes. As expected, the type of roadway had a profound effect on the control patterns of all subjects. (Author/BP)",

It evaluated the performance of 3,049 applicants (all aged 16 and 17) based on the driver license examination with emphasis on the road test portion. Road test data were collected between December 1974 and May 1975 and included: age, sex, race, driver license number, performance on maneuvers, number of items missed on signs and rules tests, driving test score, school where driver education was taken, whether student had a learner's permit, and driver education certification number. Three basic types  of analyses were conducted: (1) comparison of failure rates, (2) comparison of mean scores, and (3) analysis of variance calculations. The analyses conducted indicated very little difference between the range and \"30 and 6\" groups with the \"30 and 6\" group showing slightly higher road test scores. The results pointed out a need for continued improvement in the range curriculum. (Author/BP)",

        "description":"To use the school curriculum to achieve the goal of producing more knowledgeable citizens who have an appreciation for highway safety would require extensive preparation of attractive, innovative teaching materials. However, it would not be difficult to incorporate knowledge and skills relevant to safe driving in other courses and to ensure its carry over to driver education. Examples of such information are cited from the science, government, social studies, biology, sociology, psychology, and health curricula. A procedure is suggested that may provide relatively high payoff per dollar spent when compared with possible alternatives, e.g., elaborate expansion of driver education programs to provide increased behind-the-wheel training. A program of graduated licensing involving  parental participation and official endorsement at several levels of proficiency would require convincing parents, license administrators, enforcement personnel, and driver education personnel of its value. As to the question, \"Have the Schools Failed?\" the answer depends very much on what the schools were expected to do. Given the resources available and the state of the art in driver education, the schools do not appear to have done badly. Yet even limited resources can always be used more effectively. (Author/LH)",

More than three-fourths of the document consists of individual chapters which discuss  each occupation and describe significant and distinctive model features, progress in developing the model, and future steps. Similar features of the five models include: promotional systems based on performance-based criteria, collaboration of recognized institutions to develop alternative routes to more relevant credentials, academic credit toward advancement and transferable credentials, work sites used as learning sites for in-service training, and year-round operation. All are directed toward low-level, human service employees largely representing minority groups. (Author/EA)",

Three principal project goals were: (1) to develop a model regional information system for vocational technical education, (2) to test that model, and (3) to determine the feasibility of regional research and development efforts for information systems in terms of sharing information across political and geographic boundaries, range and scope of information requests, and problems in tracking manpower. Phases of operation included development of information files, user inservice  training, system operation, and system evaluation. Results of a 57-item needs assessment questionnaire given to 40 administrators (with 36 responding) are discussed, while a data collection section reports on the sources used and variables considered. Twenty-five administrators, participants in a two-day workshop, evaluated the model, concluding that the Regional Information System offers great potential as a planning tool for vocational-technical education.

Data, summarized in narrative and tabular form, show that two-thirds of the one and one-half million students age 35 and over in the United States were enrolled in college (including 285,000 in graduate school), and about 400,000 were attending trade or vocational school. The remainder (80,000) were enrolled in high school. About 14% of the adults in school were black. Women students in the group generally had higher labor force participation rates, age for age, than women in the population as a whole. Younger male students in the group had rates similar to those of their nonstudent contemporaries.  The rate for male students 45 and over was substantially higher than for nonstudents. This finding suggests that older persons in school had a very strong attachment to the work force, and their school enrollment was therefore ancillary to career development. A four-page explanatory note briefly describes the basic labor force concepts, sample design, estimating methods, and reliability of the data. (Author/MS)",

Procedures for identifying factors, priorities, and information needs included (1) use of simulation and content analysis, (2) developing simulation exercises and an information base, (3) developing data collection and analysis techniques, and (4) pilot testing of procedures. Participants of the study (educational planners from local and State educational agencies involved in vocational education, persons outside vocational education, and persons not involved in education) underwent eight simulation exercises in two days. A  content analysis of the written individual position papers and the tape recorded group sessions for each of the exercises was conducted. There were 173 factors cited which were categorized under satisfaction, satisfactoriness, efficiency, alternative sources, quality, equal opportunity, legal, and mutual satisfaction. A discussion of the results and implications of the study are presented. A list of five recommendations is included.

Data were collected from a 12-section questionnaire sent to 164 institute participants and from interviews with those playing key leadership roles at the institutes. Information derived from the personal interviews, results of responses to the questionnaire, and treatment of the questionnaire data (item and section analyses) are  presented. An annotated list of tables provides orientation to the tables which contain the data in their entirety. A summary analysis is given along with a prioritized list of six recommendations. The study suggests that considerable articulation exists within and between the two systems and that effective measures which will facilitate articulation are currently being pursued by teachers and administrators. Appended are the articulation questionnaire and a variety of reports and institutional correspondence dealing with program articulation. (Author/MS)",

The study involved 1,368 disadvantaged youth through 12 years of age in Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Vermont. Two experimental groups, one in an extension setting and one in a formal school setting, and a control group were established to assess changes that might be due to environmental factors and maturation of youth. The study indicated that lessons 1-6 effected significant nutrition behavior change  in both the extension and school setting groups; however, nutrition behavior, as reflected by pretest/posttest questionnaires, was consistently greater in the extension group. Moreover, nutrition knowledge appeared greater than the change in nutrition attitudes. The selected sociocultural characteristics of the youth and their families appeared to have little effect upon the degree of nutritional behavior change that occurred. The lesson series did not alter the food intake patterns of the youth. Questionnaires are appended. (Author/EA)",

In the CBTE approach the teacher educator's role is that of a learning manager, guide, and resource person, while the conventional approach utilizes the instructor as a disseminator of information. Another major distinction is the criterion-referenced mode evaluation approach in CBTE versus traditional normative-referenced measures. The research and development project at the Center for Vocational and Technical Education at Ohio State University has identified and validated 384 professional competencies needed by vocational/technical teachers in all the traditional vocational service areas at all levels and has developed over 100  modules for group or individual instruction to facilitate mastery of these competencies. Florida State University (FSU) has participated in the advanced testing of the modules. Also, various Florida vocational service areas are formulating State objectives. Project ACTIVE (Attaining Competencies for Teaching in Vocational Education) is being conducted at FSU for use at preservice/inservice levels; the Trade and Industrial CBTE is a pilot program within the project.

The occupational task survey report for the occupation of business data programer is a product resulting from this effort. The task inventory data summarized were collected in eight States (Mississippi, Wisconsin, New Jersey, Washington, Ohio, Oklahoma, New Hampshire, and California). More than 700 workers and supervisors responded to extensive Task Inventory Questionnaires. Data concerning worker performance, judgments about the criticalness of performance and training, and supervisor expectations were obtained through a set of 12 experimental questions for each identified task. Survey responses are  presented in highly summarized and abbreviated tables. Table 1 (32 pages) contains data summaries pertaining to varying degrees of job relevance for 313 tasks of business data programers. The summary task data are reported through the use of percentages, averages (means), and category labels. Additional tables of task data on specific items are appended. Implications from the survey about worker-supervisor differences, training needs, problem areas, and supervisor suggestions for improving performance are discussed.

        "description":"The paper describes the American immigrant experience, discusses the process of acculturation, and recounts the evolution to a value of cultural pluralism from the melting pot concept, as background to a consideration of the problem of educating the adult immigrant in the U.S., focused specifically on the current U.S. immigration experience with Indochinese refugees. Distinctions are drawn between immigrants and refugees, the latter being defined as immigrants with special needs which are recognized by special allocation of national resources and special initial transition programs. The special allocation on behalf of the Indochinese refugees is briefly delineated, and the Indochinese experience is considered as an application of the acculturation model presented earlier in the  paper. The Indochinese resettlement system, based upon (1) a philosophy of avoiding dependency and making Indochinese active community members and (2) a policy of national dispersion of refugees, is outlined and described as working quite well. Beneath the debate which continues over the rate of immigration is a national commitment to the immigrant experience and to the element of discovery, an important aspect of immigration which, when supported by the value of cultural pluralism, is essential to the socialization of a nation.

The study was based on: (1) a review of current literature (presented in Volume 2, which is not available for copyright reasons); (2) data collected from industrial arts, trade and industrial education, and secondary technical education teachers in Colorado as well as information about school programs and industrial arts programs in other States; and (3) nine area communication sessions throughout the State conducted by the Colorado Industrial Arts Association. A 22-page discussion of the collected data is presented with supporting tables. A three-day conference was held to interpret the data and to propose recommendations. Participants  included 25 teachers, supervisors, teacher educators, local vocational education directors, State department personnel, and career education specialists. They concluded that industrial arts in Colorado should be designed to serve roles in career education, general education, and pre-vocational education. Appended materials, comprising half the document, include copies of the teacher, school, supervisor, and State industrial arts association survey instruments; forms used in the communication session; and the conference agenda, lists of participants and discussion group members, and summarized speeches and comments by conference guests.

The Delphi technique was used to formulate the opinionnaire from responses of 320 randomly selected participants. The statements were ranked by the participants' mean ratings of importance. Differences among the groups' ratings of the statements were determined by analysis of variance. It was found that the statements concerned with skill training and work values generally received the highest ranking of importance; the statements regarding specific curriculums received the lowest overall rankings. For 12 of the 65 statements, a significant difference was found among the groups' ratings, with the  greatest difference being among the administrators' and counselors' mean ratings versus the school board members' and teachers'. The data from parents and students were insufficient to include in the statistical analysis. It was concluded that the people directly involved in education at the secondary level do not understand the goals, roles, and objectives of vocational and technical education. Tables represent the number and percentages of returns, the overall and groups' rankings, and the location of variance among the groups where a significant difference was found at the .05 level.

Information on the status and quality of the vocational programs was provided through instructors' responses to a program evaluation form. The sample consisted of 405 male and 23 female offenders and 59 instructors. Although offenders generally held positive views about the importance of vocational courses to future jobs, findings  indicate that many were enrolled in programs with little or no relationship to their career plans or assistance in obtaining employment. Instructors generally agreed with offenders' overall belief that they possessed average skill in their course work. Most instructors rated program quality as average.

        "description":"One area wherein administrative commitment to innovation can be developed is in the field of career education. Career education is a useful concept that can unite the private, public, and work lives of individuals in a meaningful manner. In order to develop the concept of career education and its meaning, new ideas and procedures as well as changes in the thinking of policy makers and administrators is necessary. Some of the ideas that have to be understood are: infusion, policy, change, authority, and history. The role of the administrator, commitment, involvement, plan development, implementation, evaluation, and redesign are all components necessary to effect change in the educational unit and to make career education successful. Strategies for securing administrative  commitment to innovation include: organization constituency approach, organization methodology, and authority-reality-problem approach. Securing administrative commitment also involves other considerations which could be improved through an in-service program for line administrators. (Author/EC)",

The late date of contract approval for the evaluation meant that the evaluation team was not involved in the project until it was almost completed, and personal visitation at the staff training workshops was limited. Principal data collection instruments were a participant questionnaire developed from the training objectives, interviews with project  staff, and review of all available documents and materials relating to the project and training workshops. Results of the questionnaire survey are detailed in both narrative and tabular form. Based upon analysis of evaluation findings, main conclusions were that the major objectives of the RCA consulting team in workshop training were met, but that the overall program plan and stated objectives were too extensive to be accomplished in the time period allowed. More planning and project development should be implemented. (RG)",

The program is described in terms of selection and assignment, duties and limitations, training, salary, and characteristics of the selected aides. The methodology employed data from attitude questionnaires, interviews, field observations, attitude surveys of inmates and parolees, and recidivism rates. The attitudinal questionnaire indicated that, in general, the aides' attitudes and orientations are very similar to those related to success as a social worker. Indepth interviews with the aides revealed  satisfaction with their work. Responses to interviews or questionnaires by parole supervisors, prison inmates, and parolees indicated general agreement that the program was worthwhile. Inmates consistently indicated a preference for parole officer aides, and parolees supervised by aides consistently ranked them higher on all questions than did those clients supervised by parole officers. In terms of recidivism, the parole officer aides were significantly more effective than parole officers. Evaluation of the 23 aides employed during the first two years indicated that their performance was equally as effective as a control group of parole officers. (NJ)",

These responsibilities are often unfulfilled because of the failure to teach basic reading, writing, and communication skills at the elementary level and the ignoring of moral judgments at the post secondary level. A solid grasp of fundamental skills and an appreciation of the moral underpinnings of society are two basic needs education should meet which have a considerable effect on the relationship between education and work. Preparing students to function effectively in productive jobs is a fundamental responsibility of education. This view is shared by Congress and is manifested by the  increasing financial support for vocational education from the Federal government. Congress also seeks to improve its data-gathering techniques in labor market information and tries to help educators experiment with models for effective career education programs. It places a high priority upon vocational education being closely related to the actual employment market. The need for career education programs can be met by utilizing trained counseling and guidance personnel and a closer cooperation between school and community. (Author/EC)",

Recent studies have determined that Maslow's hierarchy of needs has particular application to the work situation and to an examination of sex differences in intrinsic job satisfaction. A questionnaire based on Maslow's hierarchy was sent to all of the 378 persons who received their post-baccalaureate degrees in adult education from North Carolina State University from 1966 to 1974; 309 (82%) responded producing 292 usable questionnaires. Several characteristics of the population were: one-fourth were females, more than one-half the men and less than one-fourth of the women had their doctorates, almost all were employed full-time with 6.7% of the women and 35.0% of the men receiving incomes  over $21,000. Female adult educators found less gratification of higher level needs than males in the performance of job related tasks. The difference was significant not only with the total need deficiency scores but also with each of the sub-scores that dealt with esteem, autonomy, and self-actualization. The results indicate that higher level need satisfaction in the performance of job-related tasks is meaningful to both female and male adult educators. (JR)",

The overall objectives were to provide instruction in livestock production and horticulture, leadership training, participatory experience on a real farm, and tours to provide orientation relating to agricultural experiences. The project was subdivided into six operations that functioned concurrently: curriculum development, student recruitment, resource development, public relations, solicitation of funds, and evaluation. The report includes a breakdown and description of the procedures for each of these areas of operation. In evaluation, a brief statement is made to indicate the  accomplishment of the objectives. The problems encountered are mentioned and suggestions for continued development are offered. Over one-half of the document consists of appended publicity materials and project correspondence.

In the described home-based experimental CAI program for gifted junior high school students, 28 students were able to receive courses in elementary and college logic, computer programing, and foreign  languages via teletypewriters placed in their homes and linked by the home telephone line to the computer. The bibliography, covering the home-based instructional uses of computers, television, and other media, has three subsections. The first is the annotated bibliography which contains references divided into five groups: computers in education, television and videotape, multimedia, nontraditional study, and reference materials. The second subsection assigns to each reference a list of descriptors appropriate to it. The third subsection assigns to each descriptor the appropriate references. (Author/MS)",

        "description":"Although the roots of university extension activities at the University of British Columbia (UBC) go back further, the extension department was put on a firm basis in 1936, when the Board of Governors appointed Robert England as the first Director of Extension. University extension at UBC has been succeeded by a Center for Continuing Education, and to mark the event, the reminiscences by the four former extension directors has been published. In addition to England's, reminiscences by Gordon M. Shrum, John K. Friesen, and Gordon R. Selman, and a brief foreword and concluding remarks by the director of the new center, Jindra Kulich, comprise the document. The former directors recount how the extension department served the university as its major interface with the British  Columbia community, venturing into new areas of service and pioneering activities, some of which were later incorporated by the university as new academic departments. Born in the midst of the Depression with the help of an outside grant, the department has always had to face financial difficulties and marginality, and varied administrative priorities, but it has always enjoyed support and cooperation among many faculty members and the community it served.

Each of the six sections covers a different level of concept exploration. All five general concepts are presented at each level with appropriate supporting material for the grade level. Each concept is followed by more specific subconcepts, behavioral objectives for the child in terms of concept investigation, and suggestions for learning activities to relate the behavioral objectives and concepts to the areas of language arts,  mathematics, science, social studies, art, music, physical education, and tool technology. Also listed for each concept at all six grade levels are bulletin board suggestions and resources (references, field trips, resource persons, and audiovisual aids). (Author/MS)",

        "description":"The Federally sponsored regional training workshops for adult education personnel in cultural/ethnic understanding were designed to increase the level of awareness of cultural/ethnic differences. A training design was developed following an analysis of the Culturally Oriented Teacher Education Materials developed by the Phelps-Stokes Fund, a review of literature and projects related to ethnic/cultural training, and site visits to six regional areas. Some issues identified in regional meetings were: part-time status of adult education positions, recruitment of target minorities, different socioeconomic factors within minority groups, poor whites as a minority group, lack of information about diverse cultures, and bi-cultural education versus acculturation. Workshops were held in  Lansing, Michigan; San Antonio, Texas; Kansas City, Missouri; Denver, Colorado; San Francisco, California; and Seattle, Washington. A major part of the training design focused on the use of telecommunication as a training tool for raising cultural awareness. The training experience clearly indicated that a serious gap exists in cultural awareness for adult education personnel. Followup activities and ongoing programing were viewed as particularly important due to the large numbers of part-time adult education staff and the high turnover. (EA)",

The occupational task survey report for the occupation of general secretaries is a product resulting from this effort. The task inventory data summarized were collected in eight States (Mississippi, Wisconsin, New Jersey, Washington, Ohio, Oklahoma, New Hampshire, and California). More than 700 secretaries and their supervisors responded to extensive Task Inventory Questionnaires. Data concerning worker performance, judgments about the criticalness of performance and training, and supervisor expectations were obtained through a set of 12 experimental questions for each identified task. Survey responses are  presented in highly summarized and abbreviated tables. Table 1 (27 pages) contains data summaries pertaining to varying degrees of job relevance for 297 tasks of general secretaries. The summary task data are reported through the use of percentages, averages (means), and category labels. Additional tables of task data on specific items are appended. Implications from the survey about worker-supervisor differences, training needs, problem areas, and supervisor suggestions for improving performance are discussed.

In its present form the course can be used for fire service administrators and planning officers, police patrol administrators and planning officers, ambulance agency personnel, city officials, operations research analysts, and mixtures of these groups. It is suggested that the instructor's manual may be used for self study, since it contains all necessary references, but the student manual should only be  used in a class setting, since the reference section in each lesson is left blank so that the student may keep a permanent record of his own notes. Each lesson outline is oriented specifically for a fire service, police service, or general audience, and contains a series of activities together with references and other suggestions which will enable lecturers to prepare a course, appropriate to the audience, from the lecture notes.

Survey questionnaires were administered to basic trainees in FY 1971 (8,007) and FY 1972 (9,331). Respondents were asked to indicate their prior State of residence and whether they would enlist in the absence of the draft. They were also asked to rate a list of 15 job attributes related to the nature of work, work environment, and compensation according to their perceived importance and obtainability. By tabulating and cross- tabulating ratings on both dimensions, it was possible to characterize the career needs of the respondents and their perceptions of the Air Force as a  means of fulfilling them. Regional variations in perceptions of the service were also analyzed. The results reveal differences in the way various reward outcomes were viewed by incoming recruits in terms of perceived importance and obtainability. In general, ratings of obtainability on a given attribute were much higher for volunteer enlistees than for the non-volunteers. The analysis is supplemented with tables. A list of references is included and a tabulation of regional variations is appended. (Author/EC)",

        "description":"The study was conducted to determine if the Air Force has been able to sustain the quality of its force during 1973-74 as compared to 1972, the last year of the Selective Service Draft Lottery System. Data were collected on male and female non-prior service basic trainees who enlisted in the Air Force in 1972 (4,688 females and 81,563 males), 1973 (7,691 females and 71,762 males), and 1974 (8,952 females and 64,405 males). Data were collected on the following: year of birth; aptitude scores (Airman Qualifying Examination, Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, and Armed Forces Qualification Test); years of education completed; geographic area of enlistment; and racial subgroup membership. An analysis of the data is presented with supporting tables. Discussion of the findings  cover: (1) the Air Force is an equal opportunity employer, (2) the Air Force is enlisting young individuals who are less talented than older enlistees, (3) a moderate gain in the distribution of educational level existed during 1973-74, (4) the removal of draft pressure has not adversely affected the quality of enlistees, and (5) a deviation from the 1972 geographic pattern of aptitude levels appeared. A list of references is included. (Author/EC)",

An examination of the results of several studies concerning the effects of periods of inactivity on pilot skill retention and subsequent retraining requirements indicate that a more efficient and cost-effective method for maintaining a pool of near combat-ready pilots may be possible. Adoption of an annual massed retraining program (as opposed to the present method of conducting continuation training over a full year) could achieve a reduction of more than 50% in required aircraft flying hours. Data from these studies suggest that if USAF pilot requirements permit, recurrent training could be delayed for an  indefinite number of years with no significant increase in the average number of aircraft hours required per pilot when such recurrent training is conducted. The data also suggest that the use of high fidelity instrument and procedures simulators, during non-aircraft flying periods, would foster overlearning of system operation and voice procedures and the maintenance of limited motor skills. Integration of training in these devices into the aircraft recurrent training course would enhance the effectiveness of the total program. (Author/EC)",

The research was to determine: the degree to which distributive education (DE) teachers were using the IDECC LAPs, the attitudes of DE students in regard to the LAPs, and why some DE teachers were using the LAPs while others were not (measured by the Russell Scale to determine change orientation for vocational teachers). Of the 11 Consortium States, North Carolina was selected to be surveyed. Approximately 15% of North Carolina's DE teachers (38 subjects) were randomly selected, as well as a representative sample of their students, and asked to complete questionnaires. The teacher  questionnaire resulted in a 73.68% response with 42.85% of the responding DE teachers reporting use of the LAPs and 57.15% reporting no use. There were 95 respondents to the student questionnaire. Usable return on the change orientation scale totaled 19. Findings and conclusions are reported according to three categories: the teacher questionnaire, the student questionnaire, and the change orientation scale. Four recommendations are presented and copies of the questionnaires are appended. (Author/MS)",

A special vocational needs program is defined as a program designed for those in need of vocational training who cannot succeed in a regular vocational program due to a handicapping condition (mental, physical, or emotional) or the effects of disadvantagement (academic or socioeconomic). A teacher competency list, offered as a guide for pre- and inservice teacher education programs, presents competencies developed under seven major headings: program planning, curriculum development, method of instruction, evaluation, guidance, human relations, and management of learning and behavior. The first reading discusses five components of a model  (identification of program goals, specification of competencies, defining indicators of success, developing modalities of instruction, and program evaluation) and their utilization in a systematic approach to designing career education programs for the special needs student. A sequential procedure for curriculum modification to meet all student needs is described in the second reading. It includes status assessment, progressive instructional unit change, learning style analysis of a unit, readability measurement of printed classroom materials, and exploration of possible unit weaknesses.

Questionnaires were followed up with telephone calls from interviewers who recorded the questionnaire responses of the participants. All respondents indicated an interest in studying or learning one or more subjects or areas of study. Approximately one-third of the respondents indicated interest in business skills, crafts, gardening, physical fitness,  and sports and games. The most common reason indicated for choosing a major area of interest was for personal interest or enjoyment. Over one-third of the respondents preferred to study at a four-year college or university, and one-half wanted to attend classes or training sessions about once or twice a week. The most frequently indicated barriers were not enough time and home responsibilities.

The younger and middle-aged employees wanted to get into higher education; the older employees wanted an opportunity to finish high school. There were few blacks in positions other than housekeeper.

Although the implementation of vocational education may change, basic principles continue to stand. Four points of view, randomly selected from the past 200 years, which seem to be present in vocational education programs today are the concepts of: (1) an educated worker, (2) \"who\" in vocational education, (3) what constitutes vocational education, and (4) professional association. The impact of the concept of the educated worker was reflected in the support of general/vocational education by labor unions during the 1800's, the elements of general/vocational instruction of the Smith-Hughes Act, and the broad educational goals stated by the  National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education (NSPIE) in 1907. Likewise, the concept of \"who\" in vocational education was inclusively pronounced in 1908: \"Race, creed, color, sex, or national origin shall not debar anyone from vocational education.\" In regard to what constitutes vocational education, the principle of social concern and relationship of vocational education to social well-being has not changed. Moreover, the American Vocational Association is based upon the earlier foundations of the NSPIE and the National Society for Vocational Education. (EA)",

These services are placed in two main categories (1) recruitment and (2) retention and followup practices. The techniques utilized in recruitment by means of media, personal contact, and interagency cooperation are explored. The need for supportive services emphasizing student retention and attempts to meet nonacademic needs through orientation programs, student  assessment, guidance and counseling, and referral services are discussed. Section 3 reviews three programs providing supportive services of an exemplary nature: (1) an aural-visual recruitment model; (2) recruitment, retention, and followup services provided by counselor-aides; and (3) the White Plains ABE supportive service system.

Based on an indepth investigation of sources of information relevant to ABE student needs and their assessment, a 96-item questionnaire was developed which sought primarily to identify student needs related to nine need areas: psychological, interpersonal, occupational, financial, family, health, legal, educational, and programatic. Results were based on 236 returned questionnaires (of 310 sent to be administered to LCCC students). Data presented in 14 tables are analyzed in detail. Fourteen research highlights are  listed and concluding remarks summarize the data. Two important findings were: (1) the appearance of no large differences in the way in which the various groups responded to the questionnaire items related to expressed needs and (2) the fact that all groups of students consistently perceived the educational, occupational, and psychological need areas as being of highest priority to them.

A key recommendation is that performance standards be used in an Integrated Management System context in conjunction with planning, budgeting, evaluation, and diagnostic tools to improve overall performance. The volume presents findings from an intensive analysis of the internal structure of the Balanced Payment Formula (BPF), the ES performance-based budgeting tool; findings from an analysis of the effects of external economic, policy, and law factors on ES  performance; and findings from field tests of data collection and analysis methods to be used for establishing ES input standards. Appended materials include: BPF Formula Tables for fiscal years 1975 and 1976; 1976 BPF Arithmetic Statement; BPF Simulation Results; and other tables. (Author/SA)",

The Skaalen Sunset Home for the Aging, a 273-bed nursing home located in Stoughton, Wisconsin, was selected as the research site. Initially, a group interview was conducted with members of the Skaalen residents' council of 13 elderly to discuss the study. Twelve persons were randomly selected from each section of the home (infirmary, resident section, and suites) for individual interviews. Interview questions focused on previous knowledge of Skaalen prior to entry, the decision to enter, helpful staff/resident responses during the crisis of entry, and attitude changes. The study indicated that a suffering of losses appeared greatest for those uninformed about the institution.  Those persons occupying the suites were overall more independent and satisfied. Residents showed concern about newcomers, either actively or passively, and staff was mentioned as a positive resource. Recommendations for facilitation of the educational process included the use of resident teams to publicize and educate, personal sharing of resident life stories, mutual staff/resident support, intermingling of community members and residents in recreation classes, and increased staff/resident involvement in institutional planning.

        "description":"The thesis, which presents an analysis of three Wisconsin citizen participation programs relating to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (Public Law 92-500), has identified the adult education role in teaching and applying skills, promoting growth in governmental understanding, assisting in public planning and decision-making processes, and contributing to community betterment. A public participation program is designed by each governmental agency as a part of its work plan; public participation is needed to determine costs and benefits and to assure acceptability of water quality planning decisions. The three case studies, which are presented to demonstrate the process and problems of public participation programs include the programs of Washington County,  Wisconsin under Section 108, Pollution Control in the Great Lakes, dealing with nonpoint source pollution, and the State of Wisconsin and Dane County, Wisconsin 208 programs, which are Areawide Waste Treatment Management Programs concerned with point/nonpoint source pollution problems. With the assistance of a model, each of the case study public participation programs is examined in terms of identification of publics to be involved, level of involvement, and design of program.

Five chapters discuss the following topics: (1) the pressure for re-evaluation of the philosophy of vocational education programs and of program accountability in relation to Federal funding; (2) the historical search for a philosophical base, touching on: the Land-Grant College movement of Jonathan Baldwin Turner, the manual training philosophy of Calvin M. Woodward, the trade school movement, the 1963 Vocational Education Act, and the philosophies and opinions of John Dewey, Charles W. Eliot, Charles A.  Prosser, Melvin L.

Holland; \"Career Development of Adults: Why, When, Where, How,\" Elinor Waters; and \"A Philogynous Proposal: Up With Women,\" Mary Lou Randour. Dr. Schlossberg discusses the causes of mid-life career changes emphasizing that they do not necessarily relate to job loss or the downgrading of opportunity. A framework is presented for understanding adult career development and planning career development programs. John L. Holland's paper summarizes his developmental and structural theories on vocations. Several  suggestions are presented for the practice of vocational guidance in mid-life career development. Professor Waters describes a six session career development program for adults. The clientele, format, and course content are described. The final paper by Dr. Randour discusses sex discrimination problems and the needs of women in the world of work. A solution suggested in Dr. Randour's paper is the creation of a child service educational reward system based on the concept of the Veterans Administration educational benefits. (Author/BP)",

In a systematic sample of 45 societies, we examine the participation of old men and women in ritual performances, as well as the reverberations of these performances. Aging members of these societies seem to provide other members of these communities with traditional models for living and working, expressed cyclically at celebrated stages of the life cycle and the work cycle to which all community members adhere. We briefly describe broad  discernible trends, especially as they relate to the current fortunes of the aged. The results of the survey suggest that if a decline in ritual participation among old people exists, it may not be a permanent one, but may be linked to the condition of rapid social change, a characteristic of the secular quality of Western society.

It is also shown that the following assumption regarding understanding is inadequate: that knowing that one understands is tied solely to descriptions about that person, that certain general semihypothetical statements are true, allowing successful prediction and explanation of the behavior of that person where this behavior exhibits understanding. Particular attention is paid to exhibitions of learner understanding and it is argued that an adequate analysis of learner understanding necessitates an explication of understanding  in terms of qualitative knowing, knowing the unique which is nonclassificatory.

Three large sources of data that were analyzed failed to reveal the interaction. Since Jensen's own work suggested that the interaction was negligible and appeared inconsistently, it was concluded that the phenomenon does not exist. Though there are differences between blacks and whites on sex differences in college attendance and occupational status, this investigation determined that, counter to what Jensen had proposed, the ability interaction does not cause the race x sex differences in these settings. More appropriate explanations would be  environmental determinants as prejudice and a differential emphasis on the role of the female in the white and black culture. (Author)",

A second finding was that regardless of grade or sex, and with appropriate comparison with reported norm group data, Ss expressed a similar ordering of work values. It was concluded that this  study was a viable first step in establishing the modified form of the WVI as a tenable instrument for use by practitioners and researchers.

Two 16-item instruments, one for each operation, were administered individually to 112 children, eight females and eight males at seven age levels, 7 through 13. In contrast to Piaget's and Inhelder's writings, the data revealed that some of the components of an RD operation seem to be among the major prerequisites to the development of the CV operation. Further analysis indicated that the capacity  for CV and RD operational functioning appear to be greater in older children than in younger children and greater in males than in females. (Author)",

        "description":"This study used a self-instructional geography unit in 20 seventh-grade classes to assess the effects of a mastery learning procedure and aptitude upon learning, retention and time spent on studying the unit. It was found that differences between aptitude levels were increased rather than diminished when self-instructional materials were used. While self-instructional materials facilitate retention for students of high and middle aptitude, the mastery procedures did not facilitate learning and retention for low-aptitude students. Greater learning was achieved by the middle aptitude students under the mastery treatment. The lack of differences between the low aptitude mastery and non-mastery students is attributed to the lack of verbal facility that low aptitude students brought  to instruction. Mastery students were found to use considerably more time in learning the material than did non-mastery students. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to previous research and practical application. (SJL)",

Adolescents, young adults, and senior citizens were selected and trained for a period of 200 hours. Training combined didactics and experiential learning and emphasized high synergy; positive, healthy self-development, and project development as the most important training outcome. After training, the youth and senior paracounselors were paired with one or two fifth and sixth grade children who had volunteered to join the program. Most of these children had  demonstrated problem behavior in school and home. Through one-to-one and group sharing, the use of complementary alternatives such as crafts and sports, and emphasis on mental health and development of positive potential, a program uniting all ages (generations) was created. As a result, significant increases were noted in the children's self-concept, positive behavior at home and school, in teacher and parent sentiment toward the children, positive attitude of the child toward family; as well as in many factors measured by the children's personality questionnaire such as intellignece, enthusiasm, conscientiousness, self-reliance, confidence, extroversion, and factors predicting better academic performance.

The materials have been divided into three major categories dealing with the disciplinary setting of the school, racial, cultural and other factors which affect that setting, and students' rights within the educational system. This categorization is intended to facilitate usage by grouping similar types of materials together but it is hoped that users will keep in mind the close interrelationships that exist among all these factors. The materials cited here cover a time period from 1968 to the present, thus including developments resulting  from the landmark Tinker case, the early stages of recognition of students' constitutional rights within the educational setting. Users should evaluate materials with the awareness that statements made in earlier materials may be affected or outdated by recent court decisions and legal developments. Understanding of two recent significant cases (Goss v. Lopez; Wood v. Strickland -- Section III.A.1 &amp; 2) may prove helpful in evaluating materials. (Author)",

The I-E scale measured external attitudes. The Object Sorting Test measured categorizing style and cognitive structure by having subjects divide 50 word representations into groups. A significant intercorrelation for all subjects was found between Mach IV and I-E; no significant intercorrelation was found between Mach IV and Object Sorting, or between I-E and Object Sorting. In separating males and females on the intercorrelations, there was no significant difference.

A behavioral coding system permitted rapid sequential recording of behaviors. Results were significant in two cross validation groups. The findings were: (1) In all cases the immediately preceding stimulus predicted the type of ensuing response better than single stimuli two or three steps removed. (2) Simple and complex stimuli were both predictive of children's deviant responses. (3) Complex stimuli were often better predictors of  children's nondeviant behavior than were simple stimuli. (4) Little more than four percent of the possible complex stimulus combinations accounted for more than 80% of the total stimulus behaviors. (Author)",

In particular, through the utilization of multiple regression analysis, the authors explore the relative impact of stressful life events and sociodemographic factors upon high psychological disorder for various groups. Further, the authors suggest that in addition to recognizing SES as one of the best predictors to date of psychological disorder,  the inclusion of a stressful life events inventory in epidemiologic screening efforts increases significantly the power of screening instruments to predict rates of psychological disorder.

Triadic supervision involves three students who, on a rotating basis, assume the roles of the supervisee, the commentator, and the facilitator. The author explains the function of each person in the triad, giving particular attention to the  functions of the facilitator and the role of the counselor-educator.

Process supervision's first goal is the counselor's internalization of a contemplative attitude toward his/her work. The supervisor should parallel this contemplative attitude toward the counseling process and should create a colleagial rather than hierarchical relationship with his/her supervisee. The supervision process is based upon utilizing the resources of the supervisee in order to enable him to activate or restore his relationships with his clients. Supervision as a time-sequence process is oriented in both the present and the future. Hence, the process of supervision is designed to help the supervisee function more effectively in the future. The use of the\"now\" indicates what the supervisee hopes and believes will make the difference in the future. This monograph also provides models for supervision in various settings and counseling formats, as well as in the staff development/program development process. (Author/KRP)",

It examines the concept of this specific relationship in personal growth groups. Groups are discussed in terms of the following issues which typically surface in the member/leader relationship: dependency, competence/trust, hostility, sexuality and separation. Particular consideration is given to the role of the leader and to the current status of training group leaders regarding these issues. Also included is a description of author-created simulation materials. A discussion of the field trial of these materials shows that  simulations can be a valuable training tool for group leaders. Finally, suggestions for further study are made. (Author/KRP)",

Selected approaches to communicating with older persons are described briefly. While television is the dominant medium among older persons generally, printed media play an important role also, especially among those with higher levels of education. On topics considered especially important, older persons appear to seek information across several channels of mass communication. Socialization into a \"communication skills process\" seems to affect channel use. Creation of new channels for communication with and among older persons has proved useful in some instances in the past, and holds promise for the future. (Author)",

It delineates the issues and concerns that will dictate the choice of each of these aspects of the counseling service. The choice of location can be determined only after considering the issues of privacy, accessibility and confidentiality. Thus, for example, the placement of guidance services in the administration building is ruled out. The student health service building is the most suitable locale if a separate facility cannot be provided, and this paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of such a placement. The physical decor of the counselor's office is considered very important in creating a warm, supportive emotional space. Ways of achieving this effect are discussed.  Careful record-keeping is potentially helpful in supporting the overall philosophy and practice of the counseling center, and the paper discusses means by which this potential can be realized. (NG)",

The anxious freshman is seen as expressing his panic and confusion by noting the differences between himself and his peers, and by questioning the correctness of his college related decisions. His anxieties are aggravated by homesickness and the fact that he is at this stage both adolescent and adult in terms of feelings, expectations and demands. In those first few weeks the freshman needs immediate feedback or response, and that is not always possible. Intervention by the Counseling Center should be provided by counselor availability, provision of advisory services, outreach to the new students, anticipation and preparation, and  helping the student express as many of his feelings and concerns as possible.

In addition to being comprehensive, local programs should be physically accessible, ensure continuity of care, and pursue nondiscriminatory admissions and treatment policies. It also is vital that the services basic to a community mental health program function as components of the larger human services system meeting clients' other needs. No mental health service is fully effective or even relevant unless it is linked to the total caregiving system. The eight basic services discussed at length in the report are: consultation  and education, emergency services, ambulatory services, day and evening treatment services, vocational rehabilitation, social rehabilitation, community residences, and hospital care and treatment. Effective administration requires that the area be responsible for planning, developing, monitoring, evaluating, and managing its own activities and resources. Area offices, therefore, must be established with the capacity to manage their own affairs. The functions can be grouped into six major categories: (1) executive, (2) clinical services administration, (3) business, (4) community participation, (5) evaluation and data systems, and (6) resource development.

Students are selected for this program by counselor, teacher, principal, or self-referral. Volunteers are recruited from the community at large and receive pre-service and in-service training from mental health professionals and school volunteer specialists. Pre-and post-testing has shown, through peer, self and observer instruments that a significant number of students in the Volunteer Listener  Porgram moved away from self-defeating behaviors, while similar students who were left on their own continued to exhibit those same behaviors.

The project sought changes in the following areas: (1) attitude change, (2) information transfer, (3) increase in effectiveness, and (4) a more open admission policy. After two training periods, a similar amount of positive attitude change was generated in each of the training groups. The pattern of change on a number of measures seemed directly related to the practice of the two groups of trainees. Results also indicate that positive attitude change occurred among staff members who did not participate in the program. However, this change was reflected in their practice measures only in a few instances. Individual, group and agency  characteristics may be useful in explaining certain differences in direction and magnitude of change; however, the major outcome--an intervention was introduced and a desired change occurred after this intervention--continues to stand. There are indications that over time the change on some significant variables begins to taper off and the trainees' awareness of the gains they made in training increases. It is suggested that additional input is required to maintain change and sustain momentum created by the project. (Author)",

        "description":"WOVEN (Women's Ohio Volunteer Employment Network), is directed at changing the low representation of women in decision making positions in public service. Women comprise more than a third of the work force in the State of Ohio; yet they have typically held the low level, low paying jobs. A 1973 status report on women in State government revealed that women comprised 7.3% of the 1300 employees in pay ranges 33 and above ($16,000 per year or above). The percentage dropped quickly to .3% in the pay ranges 35 and above. Representation on boards and commissions was equally low. Yet, there is a reservoir of talented women in Ohio who are able and willing to enter public service. WOVEN is forming a network of individuals and organizations to facilitate recruitment of women for career  positions in government and for appointments to boards and commissions. While providing Ohio government access to qualified women, WOVEN keeps women informed of available opportunities. Another thrust is aimed at the lack of recognition given volunteer work. While volunteer activity can provide development of skills in many fields, its value is rarely recognized by employers. WOVEN is examining how this experience can be translated into job-related credit. This program, directed toward the State of Ohio, could be a precedent for other major institutional employers.

The project's purposes were to define a role for school social workers in school-community-pupil relations and the concomitant tasks and responsibilities in such a role; to identify the theory and knowledge base necessary for such social work practice; to develop a training program for a school social work specialist in school-community-pupil relations; and to evaluate the process and outcomes of the project. The model of school social work practice developed by this project differs substantially from traditional models because of the following reasons: (1) school conditions  and practices that bear adversely on low income and minority students; (2) community conditions that increase the alienation of students and parents from existing schools and social institutions; (3) lack of role clarity among professional pupil personnel workers; and (4) failure to update pupil personnel services to be responsible to the current needs of students. The articles review: (1) the history of school social work; (2) the development of a new model for school social work; (3) the use of change in existing school-community-student relationships; and (4) future directions for school social work.

These preparations teach people how to systematically seek out job sources and prospects and to consistently and properly follow up on job leads. For many, the factual problems of seeking work pose obstacles and cause discouragement. These are directly related to lack of knowledge of the labor market, lack of knowledge of job search skills, lack of self-confidence, competition, community biases, being unprepared, and being unskilled. In order to help people to overcome difficulties and gain self-confidence in job seeking, this workshop program gives  exposure to labor market information, job sources, abilities, and potentials, human relations, job interviews and approaches, the mechanics of resumes, abstracts, and self-assessment, the importance of persistence, and factors which create barriers to employment. Through discussions, tapes and active participation, people learn to recognize their weaknesses, bring out their strengths, and organize and apply themselves in job searches. In short, it is designed to help people to stand on their own two feet and to apply themselves systematically and positively when they look for jobs. (Author)",

Obvious advantages of this approach include placing student development courses in tne hands of staff who know students best, insuring the courses' continued existence, and communicating to students their importance. Some approaches to initiating such a program in an academic unit include: (1) simply approaching a college or department and asking about interest in a course dealing with some aspect of student development; (2) seeking a faculty member who shares one or more interests with student development staff; (3) getting to know faculty socially; (4) taking advantage of fortunate accidents; and (5)  organizing a network of persons interested in student development. Some ideas for transferring responsibility for the program once it is initiated are: (1) beginning from the first day of planning to think about abandoning the new program; (2) insuring that at least one faculty member identifies with the course; (3) getting faculty in the cooperating unit to visit the course and discuss it; (4) arranging discussion of the course in a relaxed setting; (5) earning some recognition for the course; (6) obtaining even a small amount of money to support the course; and (7) gaining administrative support.

Analysis of posttests using the same measures indicated a significant improvement in reading ability and an increase in proficiencies associated with the teaching of reading for members of the teacher aide training program as compared to a control group. In addition, kindergarten and grade-one students receiving paraprofessional assistance reflected a greater increase in language ability as measured by the Tests of Basic Experience than did students of the same  grade level who were instructed by untrained aides. Similarly, grade-two students receiving paraprofessional assistance showed a substantial gain in language and reading ability as measured by the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills, as opposed to grade-two students receiving help from untrained aides.

The authors of this critique argue that Davis and Personke misinterpreted their data and that the result has been a continued misuse of standardized tests for Spanish speaking pupils. One of the objections was that insufficient attention was given to language dominance factors and to the identification of pupil characteristics other than language. Another problem was that the nature of the population distributions  contributing to the correlations between predictor and criterion measures had not been carefully analyzed. (MKM)",

An instrument was produced in which skills thought to be essential to reading instruction were described by 34 competencies. Teachers were asked to rate themselves in the teaching of reading according to their current levels of competency and their desired levels of attainment. Each of the 34 competencies was measured on four dimensions: the ability to know, to use, to diagnose, and to prescribe for both current and desired levels. Based on the responses of approximately 2000 inservice elementary school teachers, four categories of skill attainment were delineated: reading skills, basal reading skills, organizational and assessment  skills, and peripheral reading skills. A scoring key then was generated by which may be assessed teachers' needs and receptivity to the teaching of various reading competencies. (Author/KS)",

The presentation was followed by a 90-second free recall period for the 18 words and then by a retrieval cue for each word. There were three main findings: semantic was superior to nonsemantic encoding in both free and cued recall; a congruous relationship between the target word and the orienting question yielded better free recall for third and fifth  graders and better cued recall at all three grades; and congruity between the retrieval cue and the target word was more important as a determinant of a cue's mnemonic value than experimental contiguity.

A modification of the Digit Span task used in the Binet and Wechsler intelligence scales provided the basic memory task administered to 56 male school children in grades kindergarten, second, fourth, and sixth. The specific design required children to verbally recall serial strings of digits presented at various rates of interdigit intervals. It was assumed that effective recall would be a function of general maturation and of the development of cognitive strategies. Age, delay, and age x delay were all significantly related to the number of digits correctly recalled. Results indicated that the traditional interpretation of the primacy effect as reflecting long-term memory  store may not be valid. Rather, primacy effects may reflect differential encoding of material as a time-dependent process. (Author)",

Poor communication between researchers and teachers can be attributed to the underlying purposes for research and the methods through which it is disseminated. The undertaking of research projects is frequently motivated by a desire to satisfy requirements for graduation, promotion, or tenure, rather than a desire to contribute to the body of knowledge. In addition, researchers caring little for other views keep themselves and their students within the confines of their own disciplines, disregarding ideas from other schools of thought. Several things contribute to the problem--research writing is often unintelligible, students  are encouraged to keep silent rather than express conflicting views, and teachers are seldom afforded contact with researchers through conferences. Improvement of reading research and instruction is dependent on respect for individual differences, the development of research centers for teachers and administrators, a focus on general as well as specific knowledge, and concern for community needs.

Probably the most successful formula has been the Dale-Chall method, which measures readability by determining the percentage of words which are not included on a basic word list. One criticism of this technique is that the readability index of a book and the assessed reading level of a child may not be analogous. A new readability formula, subtested by Wilson Taylor, utilizes the concept of the cloze procedure. Students demonstrate comprehension by filling in every deleted fifth word in a given passage. Although the use of the cloze test bypasses the need for  standardized testing, the danger of choosing a passage which is not reflective of the whole work must be noted. The question still remains whether any one readability formula may be applied to the various genres of literature. (KS)",

One purpose of reading is objectification, in which the reader is an interpreter and verifier of an author's symbolic representation of reality. In defining objectification operationally, the basic linguistic units were described as propositions comprising arguments and predicates. Drawing implications from this operationalization, an experiment was designed to compare response latencies in a sentence verification task, in which sentences of the form \"The dots are/are not red\" were compared with visual displays. Sixty undergraduates participated in a study comparing reading  aloud, reading silently, and listening, under four conditions of match or mismatch between sentences and pictures. The results indicated that reading aloud gives access to linguistic competence in a manner different from silent reading and listening. Comparisons of response latencies for the four information conditions supported the proposed model of reading comprehension. (AA)",

The subjects were 15 Title I reading teachers working in small groups with 183 second-grade children. The questions of interest were whether the READ materials, more effectively than games of traditional phonics, could teach students to decode short vowel trigrams and increase students' word recognition and reading comprehension skills. Results suggest that both the READ and the games programs were more effective than traditional phonics in developing students' ability to decode the meanings of written sentences and that the READ materials were more  effective in developing the ability to decode unknown words in isolation for children in the lowest achievement subgroup. Revisions in the program prior to dissemination, followed by repeated validation study, are recommended. Tables illustrating the text are included. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine competencies which teacher trainees should master. The following five competencies were hypothesized as important influences on learning disabled (LD) students' learning of word-attack skills: stating behavioral objectives, matching instruction to objectives, teaching rather than dispensing instruction, positive verbal reinforcing, and overlearning--extended practice on a newly introduced skill. Ten supervising teachers in ten elementary classrooms and 31 student teachers engaged in a year-long study comparing three methods of teaching reading to LD students. A total of 194 observations were made in these classrooms, with one supervisor and as many as five student teachers involved in each class. Measurement and analysis of LD student reading  achievement showed that all five competencies were present in the classrooms providing the most effective instruction and that the following three competencies were frequently absent in the least effective classrooms: matching instruction to objectives, positive reinforcing, and overlearning.

The subjects were 56 female university students. Intensity of arousal was manipulated by using two levels of white noise--75 decibels and 90 decibels sound pressure level--and a condition without white noise. Noise was delivered at three temporal intervals following the learning trial: under three minutes, three to six minutes, and six to nine minutes. The results were analyzed using six linear contrasts. The main effect of level of arousal was not significant. Neither was there any significant interaction between intensity and timing of noise. Effect of temporal variation was examined via two  contrasts. It was found that stimulation between three and six minutes after learning was detrimental to retention as compared to stimulation within three minutes and between six and nine minutes. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"In order to understand better the elemental processes involved in beginning reading (specifically, how cognitive skills are acquired and whether a relationship exists among basic skills), Robert Calfee and colleagues conducted a first-grade reading diary study. Forty target children in 1973-1974 and 50 children in 1974-1975 were observed as they were being taught to read and were given systematic and continual tests designed according to the development of their reading skills. This paper describes the construction of the network of tests which were used for the study and which were designed to identify the specific skills directly related to reading acquisition and to control for those general abilities which influence a student's performance on virtually any task. Although data  from the study have not been completely analyzed, it is apparent both that the elemental processes being measured did provide the basis of beginning reading achievement and that this method of assessment offers teachers precise diagnostic information about the instructional needs of beginning students.

Tests measuring reading readiness factors in kindergarten and reading achievement at the end of first grade were used as predictor variables, while a test of reading achievement at the end of the seventh year of school was used as the criterion variable. The three dependent variables considered during the seventh year of school were scores on the Metropolitan Achievement Test (MAT) in word knowledge, reading comprehension, and total reading. Analysis of data showed the following best predictors of success in the seventh year of school: for word knowledge, the simple correlation of the score in word discrimination on  the MAT at the end of first grade; for reading comprehension, scores in word knowledge on the first-grade MAT; and for total reading, the score in word discrimination on the MAT in first grade.

Means and standard deviations were similar for the four forms, and obtained intercorrelations were high enough to allow mean scores to be used in further analyses. Significant correlations were found between these means and the subscores for both vocabulary and comprehension but not for grade level or sex of the student.

        "description":"Although English teachers have been blamed for the decreasing verbal ability of the nation's children, recent declines may be more accurately attributed to the general instructional climate of the day. The post-Sputnik era viewed education as a function of active intervention, where the teacher assumed a dominant role in shaping the students' experiences. More recent trends view teaching as nonintervention, where the teacher provides a neutral environment in which the students' latent abilities can flourish. English instructors must realize that both positions significantly affect student response. Teachers must accept the responsibility for developing cognitive and affective skills through curriculum planning and direct instruction. While interaction in group experiences remains  a worthy teaching technique, the creation of opportunities for individual study is equally important. (KS)",

Fifty-five freshman composition students were asked to elaborate on a subject of choice in a 500-word essay and in a private office interview with the teacher. Data revealed that consistency of expression was independent of such factors as college entrance examination scores, previous grades in English courses, high school grade-point average, and sex of subject. Factors related to consistency of expression, which separated students strong in English from students weak in English, were performance in basic English, performance on the essay used in this experiment, and semester course grade. Generally, the ideas expressed orally by  students were more clear and convincing than were the same ideas expressed in their written essays. (KS)",

In conjunction with the daily classes, a public lecture held one evening a week was provided for class members, other students, faculty, and other interested community members. Although enrollment in the workshop was small, evaluation of the program was generally favorable.

The question was raised whether the stories, collected over a two-year period, would reflect the children's transition from home to school by a shift from a private to a public character. Structural analyses of plot, derived from the theories of Claude Levi-Strauss, Vladimir Propp, and Jean Piaget, were shown to have value in detecting developmental shifts in the children's narration. Subjecting the stories to the type of analysis used in the evaluation of mythology and folk tales revealed the children's initiation into public legend. Thus, the content of the children's fantasies was shown to reflect the basis of cultural mythology and to provide an  index of the level of socialization into that mythology. (KS)",

In this study, the coefficient of balance between depth and scope was correlated with measures of the popularity of a group of magazines published in Austin, Texas. A regression formula was used to obtain scope/depth coefficients for the magazines, which were ranked by those values and by the indices of popularity. Hypotheses concerning the relationship of scope/depth balance to popularity were tested by correlations between the two rank-orders. Conclusions were that magazines with higher absolute circulation are characterized by depth-emphasis as defined in the study; magazines showing the most rapid circulation growth tend to  emphasize scope; and the most successful magazines of the group are those whose quantitative editing patterns are most different from those of the rest.

Approximately 200 samples of writing in the modes of argumentation, exposition, narration, and description were collected from 50 third graders in the Atlanta school district. Syntactic complexity, as measured by length of writing sample, number of clauses per sample, and number of words per clause, was revealed to be highest in the argumentative mode. Although the differences in complexity between exposition and narration seem to depend upon the analytic tool used, the descriptive mode was shown to evoke the least syntactic complexity regardless of the type of analytic instrument. The development of children's formal cognitive and linguistic processes  may be stimulated by writing activities which parallel these processes in level of difficulty. (KS)",

While the institutional setting of the classroom may demand certain types of communicative and learning behaviors--aggressive, competitive, and verbally outspoken--many nonwhite students view this style of communication as being &quot;haolified,&quot; a pejorative term indicating behavior typical of Caucasians. Consequently, the environment of the student outside of the classroom reinforces behaviors incompatible with the culture of the school, thus causing academic failure which has a parellel in the larger social and economic concerns of adulthood. Aggressive competition as cultural imperative has been  institutionalized, effectively impeding the social mobility and well being of groups such as the native Hawaiian. Solutions to this problem must involve both personal and institutional change. (MKM)",

The third section reviews two procedures for measuring interpersonal confirmation.

Men's vocabularies were considered more extensive due to the inclusion of numerous novel, technical, and infrequently used words. The purpose of this study was to test the validity of Jespersen's hypothesis. Twenty university students, ten females and ten males, were matched on the basis of chronological age, socioeconomic status, and variables shown to influence fluency levels and vocabulary. Each subject then described \"a memorable life experience,\" which was recorded on a three-minute tape. Data reported do not support the notion that women are more verbally  fluent than men. In addition, no significant difference in the nature of men and women's vocabulary was revealed. While findings tend to refute Jespersen's hypothesis, it may be possible that a dramatic change in women's language patterns has occurred since the theory was posited, or that a statistical error due to the small sample population may have contaminated the results.

Specifically, the task force was to establish criteria for identifying facilities where changes should be considered; identify and prioritize alternatives for use of excess classroom space; and determine a process for involving the community in the development of awareness and understanding and for providing input prior to making changes in schools because of enrollment decline. The categories used in evaluating buildings were educational adequacy, operational costs, enrollment, percent of enrollment decline, airport noise impact, alternate use factor, modernization potential, building capacity, and traffic and safety  considerations. The process for community involvement consists of four stages--orientation to declining enrollment and its ramifications, input/output, school board's decision and postdecision information dissemination, and implementation. It was determined that, as far as use of facilities is concerned, educational needs should be considered first, community needs second, private or commercial needs third, and redevelopment fourth. The specific recommendations of the task force are included. (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"Because today's schools consume large amounts of energy and, consequently, pay high energy bills, the term \"energy cirsis\" is no exaggeration to describe the situation facing educators and school administrators. Schools everywhere are under pressure to use less electricity, natural gas, heating oil, and gasoline. While energy conservation techniques may not be the total solution to the energy crisis, they are certainly part of the answer and they are a large part of the answer to the energy cost crisis. The articles and documents abstracted here show how schools can save significant amounts of energy in a surprising number of ways. Some of these ways have to do with maintaining, servicing, and setting equipment properly. Some depend on changing the wasteful habits that are  products of a time when both energy and money were more plentiful. Some (and these are perhaps the best hope for the future) can only be put into effect by those designing future facilities. Some of the best energy saving design ideas are neither new nor complex. Builders and architects are returning to natural rather than mechanical answers to the energy crisis. (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"This paper examines the two conflicting definitions of local control inherent in the majority and minority opinions in the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision, San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez. The author agrees with the minority decision that lack of adequate funds, regardless of the number of legal constraints set down by the state, weakens, if not effectively eliminates, local decision-making and control. What research there is on the relationship between school funding and school district autonomy indicates (contrary to the assumption of the Court's majority) that increased state funding to local districts does not decrease local decision-making power. However, property-poor districts that receive insufficient state equalization funds are restricted in ways  in which richer districts are not. Not only does local control suffer in poor districts, but the quality of education (at least in part dependent on money) also drops. (DS)",

The author first asserts that although most people support the concept of examining and assessing educational products and programs, there is much disagreement over pertinent criteria. Although it is possible to develop a matrix of criteria for the evaluation of each product, the author suggests, the question of which criteria should be applied to all products should be based on the free enterprise model. That is, criteria should be applied that assure the harmlessness of a product, but beyond that point the market place should be allowed to work its will free of further  requirements. Specifically, the only criteria that should be applied to the assessment of any new educational product before its release, the author argues, are the criteria of \"social balance and fairness\" and \"user effects.\" (Author/JG)",

        "description":"Two basic reasons for including Oral Language Development in the instructional program are (1) to prepare students for reading instruction, and (2) to teach students how to communicate effectively in real-life situations. A child is expected to have had five or six years oral practice in a language before learning to read. When children have developed their linguistic skills in Spanish, they should first learn to read in that language. Proponents of Title I Migrant and ESAA programs have emphasized oral language development in programmatic guidelines. However, guidelines for various state and federal programs differ, and they should be examined carefully in light of each school district's goals. An oral language program must identify students who will benefit most from the  program and also select its administrator and teachers with care. Effective implementation of an oral language program calls for a sensitive teacher, thorough planning, support of administrators and fellow teachers, adequate materials and resources, an assistant (if possible), and staff development based on teacher requests.

Elements of Lipham's model of the decision-making process and Dale's definition of decentralized decision-making were incorporated into the instrument. The study consisted of three phases, including (1) the definition phase, (2) the instrument construction phase, and (3) the instrument testing phase. In the testing phase, the final instrument was administered to teachers in 77 randomly selected IGE elementary schools. Analysis of the survey data showed that IGE teachers desired greater involvement in decision-making at the  schoolwide and extraschool levels, but they felt they already had moderately high involvement in decision-making at the unit-subunit level within their schools. The testing phase proved the final instrument to be a valid and reliable means of measuring teacher perceptions of real and ideal decision-making in IGE elementary schools. (Author/JG)",

The district's newly developed tests are called goal-referenced tests, a version of criterion-referenced tests, that meet the district's purposes because they reflect what well-qualified teachers in the district believe should be taught and measured. In constructing the tests, curriculum personnel select goals they believe the test should measure; teachers develop items that measure those goals; the tests are given a trial administration and items are analyzed; the items, formats, and directions are revised; and the tests are administered for their intended use. The Rasch test scaling procedure that involves the identification of an equal-interval scale of  difficulty for a given set of items based on information about item difficulty and total test performance for the group tested is used. The procedure yields information on item difficulty and an estimate of the ability of individuals and groups tested. This permits establishment of a scale that is independent of the norming population and allows for the creation of item pools. (Author/IRT)",

Focusing their attention on the National Institute of Education (NIE), the authors examine the origins of NIE's initial image, the utility of that image in securing congressional approval for its creation, and the relationship of the image to NIE's subsequent political and organizational difficulties. The quality of a new agency's environment largely determines the stability of its initial image, the authors argue. Agencies established in benevolent environments will retain their initial image longer than agencies established in harsh environments. However, revising an agency's initial image in response to the agency's &quot;failure&quot; will not necessarily lead to  future &quot;success.&quot; If the harsh environment is independent of the agency's actions, changing the agency's image will not produce a more benign environment.

        "description":"In response to a request from the Southeast Council, the Southeast Alternatives (SEA) Internal Evaluation Team undertook a study to provide information about sex-role stereotyping in Southeast Alternatives schools. The questionnaire had ten questions that asked such things as if stereotyping occurred, where it occurred, what would be the best means of handling it, how important was the issue, what were the most important influences of stereotyping, and what school activities should be divided according to sex. The report is in three sections. Section 1 reports the results; section 2 analyzes the instrument; and section 3 presents an analysis of the data. The results indicate that the great majority of the staff of the SEA do not think that the school has as much influence over  the development of children's sex-role identity as the home. The most likely place to find sex-role stereotyping in the schools is in instructional materials. Workshops and the purchase of new materials headed the list of ways for dealing with sex-role stereotyping. With the exception of two areas--physical activities and sexual matters--the staffs clearly believed that classes and activities should not be divided according to sex. (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"This report is complementary to one on student choice-making. Both were done because of an interest in the recent growth in the number of secondary alternatives in the Southeast Alternatives project. There were two principal reasons for investigating parent opinions about the school programs: to find out how parents felt about the choices available at the secondary level and to find out if these opinions differed from students' opinions. The report has three sections. The first deals with the background of the parents, the second with parents' reactions to the alternative chosen by their child, and the last with parents' attitudes toward school and learning in general. The data are very similar to that collected in the student interviews; however parents seem to be more  dissatisfied with the amount students are learning than the students are. Also, the parents of female children express more positive feelings toward competition. The data from the parent questionnaire are biased in the direction of parents with professional jobs. Further, the sample size is quite small in some instances and this makes the data somewhat unreliable. Credibility is given to these data because they so closely resemble the student responses.

Several methods were used to gather data. Questionnaires were sent to former students who had graduated early; and interviews  were conducted with students who were planning to graduate early during the current year, with students who had accumulated enough credits to graduate early but who nevertheless elected to stay in school, and with four teachers who were familiar with many of the present and past early graduates. The data is compared and the major findings are summarized. Appendices contain the interview and survey instruments. (Author/IRT)",

Two categories of services emerge from this definition. First are special services designed for the high need student. Second are special services that, although they may indirectly serve high need students, are designed primarily to fill curricular or programmatic needs. A high need student is one who, because he lacks necessities basic to functioning and growth in the physical, social/emotional, or academic areas, requires additional attention and support from personnel external to the classroom. This report is based on interviews of randomly selected special services personnel. The first section describes  services designed for high need students in the areas of physical needs, social/emotional needs, and academic needs. The second section describes the special services designed to fill curricular or programmatic needs in math, science, media, art, industrial arts, and community resources. The third section summarizes interviews conducted with administrators. The fourth section presents results of a teacher survey about referral situations. (Author/IRT)",

These changes can best be realized, he argues, through a curriculum that is organized around a system of required educational competencies rather than around required courses. Instituting a statewide system of competency-based education will require a difficult political struggle, but this struggle can be made easier if reliable research findings are available on the cost and impact of competency-based curricula. Researchers can greatly aid the progress of educational reform, the author suggests, if they address the information needs of state educational officials and legislators and if they take care to present their  findings in plain English that is readily understandable by laymen.

Teaching is a 'female occupation', and the low status of teaching is inextricably linked to the sex-typing of occupations in general. However, even though the majority of all teachers are female, the majority of educational administrators are male. Women in education are discriminated against in salary matters, in maternity leaves of absence, and in other job-related benefit areas. Stereotypic social attitudes toward married women workers and toward women as administrators serve to prevent women from filling administrative jobs and restrict the advancement of the few who do hold such positions. Even though the research  indicates no difference between men's and women's leadership abilities, many women feel incapable of administration or believe that they will be unhappy in an administrative job. Women are not recruited for such jobs, and they are less well prepared educationally than men to fill them. The schools must work in conjunction with all other social institutions to eradicate inequality in education. (Author/DS)",

The discriminatory attitudes held by individuals (both male and female) are frequently reinforced by professional and societal structures, thus  resulting in perpetuation of the status quo in educational administration.

This new approach conceives of the function of supervisors as interpersonal intervention and the role of the supervisor as that of interpersonal interventionist--a person whose job requires that he intrude in particular ways into a teacher's personal and technical realm to achieve certain ends or products. To the most typical end of supervision--improved quality of instruction--are added the personal and professional growth of teachers and the personal and professional growth of supervisors. Three primary tasks derive from the concept of the intervener role. The first is the generation of valid  information associated with problems. The second is to maintain the client's system's discreteness and autonomy, which emphasizes the need for the teacher to make free, informed choices. The third is concerned with the development of the client's internal commitment to the choices made; if commitment is low, the chances of lasting learning and change resulting from the intervention are minimal.

        "description":"This paper considers those factors that have been at work shaping educational policy at the state level in New Jersey. For simplicity and to permit a degree of comparison among the states, five questions are addressed: (1) What have been the effects of court intervention, (2) Are &quot;new&quot; political coalitions being formed and how effective are they, (3) What are the effects of the &quot;new technologies&quot; of school finance analysis, (4) What is the relationship of the school finance issue to other statewide issues, and (5) From the perspective of better serving the educational needs of pupils, are the changes that are attainable worth attaining? New Jersey has attained a modest, &quot;simple,&quot; yet potentially profound, change in public education. It is a change in the education process,  however, not in the way in which education is financed; New Jersey has failed at school finance reform. What New Jersey has is the goal of providing to all children regardless of socio-economic status or geographic location, the educational opportunity that will prepare them to function politically, economically, and socially in a democratic society.

Barbara Jordan, U.S. Representative from Texas, stresses the need for cooperation between educators and legislators in achieving the goal of equal opportunity. R. Freeman Butts, educational historian, points out that education has had at least seven distinct purposes--academic discipline, social efficiency, individual development, vocational competence, freedom, equality, and a just community. James S. Coleman, professor of sociology at the University of Chicago, discusses the problem of creating public policy that is responsive at once to two opposing principles--equality of opportunity and  individual liberty. David Mathews, U.S. Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, concentrates on the work of the College Board. Maurice B. Mitchell, chancellor of the University of Denver, discusses the difficulties of educational managers in four main areas: economic problems, society's changing values and goals, educational standards, and educational planning. Ralph P. Davidson, publisher of \"Time,\" calls education the cornerstone of democracy and urges the continued support of education at all levels. (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"For years the Bureau of School Programs Evaluation of the New York State Education Department has studied relationships between school processes and student achievement. The primary strategy has been (1) to use multiple regression analysis to obtain relationships, (2) to use school district average scores as the data for analysis, and (3) to eliminate, to the extent possible, differences between districts that may be attributed to socioeconomic conditions and that are not controllable by the schools. This paper briefly describes a series of analyses carried out to study relationships between a number of school processes and student achievement on third- and sixth-grade mathematics and reading tests. Process variables fell under the general headings of teacher, financial, and  student. Several teacher variables were found to relate to achievement, but no consistent pattern of relationships was found between expenditure variables and achievement. The positive results for several teacher variables support logic and conventional wisdom. The higher the salary and the higher the percent of certified teachers and teachers with graduate credit, the higher district achievement is likely to be. These analyses do not reveal whether cause and effect are inherent in these relationships. (Author/IRT)",

More specifically, Eisner (1971) contends that with the exception of four studies, no attempt to systematically study curriculum has been made. Further conceptualizations and empirical investigations in this area are needed. It's apparent that while some conceptual ideas advanced by Tyler, Goodlad and others are necessary, without further conceptualization and empirical tests the development of curriculum as an area of scholarly and artful practice is limited (Eisner, 1971). Thus, the purpose of this essay is to address (1) the theoretical framework and its implications for curriculum theory, (2) the empirical framework and its implications for curriculum theory, (3) the present  status of curriculum theory in relation to these two frameworks, and (4) further theoretical and/or empirical investigations to advance curriculum theory.

This review traces the history of Texas public education from the seventeenth century through 1949 when three major school reorganization laws were enacted by the state legislature. The earliest schools in Texas were associated with the Spanish missions and were intended to educate (and control) the Indians. Education suffered under the Mexican regime, which failed to provide funds for schools. The Republic of Texas set up a public school system based on land grants to counties. This funding approach was later employed when Texas entered the Union and continued until the Civil War brought havoc to public education. However, after Reconstruction, the 1875 state  constitution provided for a perpetual school fund based on property and poll taxes as well as for a state board of education. Independent school districts emerged. Finally in 1949, the state legislature mandated that 12 years of schooling for all children are mandatory and gave the state board of education more power.

The reorganization plan was implemented at the beginning of the 1975-76 school year and evaluated both internally and externally throughout the year. After a study of evaluation results by the faculty  and staff, it was unanimously decided to continue the \"house plan\" for 1976-77.

Interviews were conducted with persons involved in curriculum decision-making in 34 school districts in order to ascertain how they determined whether or not to make elementary-level curriculum changes. The rational and political aspects of this process were analyzed, as well as patterns of participation by teachers and laymen. The study revealed that a variety of curriculum change processes exist in these different districts. Both teacher and citizen participation has increased across the past few years, although citizens participate less frequently in curriculum decisions than teachers. The participation of both groups, however, has generally been superficial,  and the major decisions are still usually made by higher authorities. The study also revealed that conflict tends to increase participation, to enhance rationality, and to democratize political aspects of curriculum change. Because both teachers and laymen have certain restrictions on the time and energy they can devote to decision-making, they should be provided with better mechanisms and forums for their involvement.

According to Spady's definition, educational reform must include (1) changes in instructional content, (2) changes in educational governance, (3) changes in the functions of schooling, (4) changes in the structure and allocation of educational resources, and (5) changes in access to and the outcomes of schooling. The authors conclude that the RISE report and bill meet many of these reform  criteria, but that their ultimate success will depend on the creation of strong regulations and guidelines for implementation, the availability of a great deal of new money to finance implementation, and the support of the citizens of California.

        "description":"Windowless school buildings are currently being proposed as a design solution to the problems of vandalism, energy conservation, and building costs. However, little consideration is being given to the effects of windowless classrooms on the students and teachers inside. This thesis describes the effect of windowless classrooms on three specific areas of cognitive behavior: rote learning, concept formation, and perceptual ability. In addition, a description of student and teacher affective behavior, based on formal observations, is included. Two identical sixth-grade classes were selected for the study. The experimental period was divided into two three-week phases. Each classroom had all existing windows covered during one phase. Students were randomly divided into three test  groups for the testing phases of the study. No consistent trends emerged to allow definitive judgment that windowless classrooms are detrimental to student cognition and learning. The only definitive trend is in the realm of affective behavior, indicating that student aggression increases in windowless environment. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"In Serrano v. Priest, the California Supreme Court in 1971 initiated a modern era of elementary and secondary school finance reform. This paper first examines the present problems of urban school finance to ascertain why urban adjustments are necessary today in the new school finance formulas. All urban school finance adjustments in use at the time of Serrano and since Serrano are described and policy problems related to these adjustments are discussed. The final section analyzes school finance reform in ten states concerning fiscal impact on key urban school districts. Tables and text demonstrate that urban school districts have had state aid redistributed in their favor as often as it has been shifted the other way. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"A statistical power analysis of research studies in special education reported in volumes 39 and 40 of Exceptional Children (1972-73 and 1973-74) was conducted. The basic concepts of a power analysis (Type I and Type II errors, and conventional effect sizes) were reviewed, and the studies evaluated for statistical power. Using the .05 level of significance, the average power to detect small effects was .11 (5% having a better than 50-50 chance to declare significant findings), for medium effects the average power was .49 (43% having a better than 50-50 chance), and for large effects the average power was .82 (76% having a better than 50-50 chance). There are several approaches to increasing power, including increasing the number of Ss, increasing the level of alpha, altering the  research design, using directional tests, and using highly reliable measures. Statistical power analysis should become a part of research training and one of the criteria for the evaluation of research reports. (Author/IM)",

        "description":"The final report on Preparing Regular Educators for Mainstreaming mildly handicapped children (Project PREM) focuses on the first year's activities and outlines proposed objectives for the project's second and third years. Covered in an introductory section are Project PREM's main objective of developing and implementing a competency-based program for both preservice and inservice teachers, the background of educational programing for the handicapped, the history of special education in Texas, and Project PREM's purposes and goals. Project activities are noted to be divided into four major cluster areas (sample activities are in parentheses): planning (selection of educators to serve on the planning and development team); identification of competencies and management systems (a  survey of state and national planning and training procedures in relation to the mainstreaming concept); major programing activities and evaluation (the pilot testing of the modules and delivery systems with 107 preservice and inservice teachers); and administration and organization. Listed among second year objectives in each of the major cluster areas is the identification of instruments and procedures for evaluating the field experience component. Plans (also listed for each cluster area) for year 3 of the project are noted to involve the integration of the competency-guided modules and field components into existing preparation programs. In a final section on evaluation results, modifications are suggested which include the development of short, objective pre- and post-assessment  instruments. Appended is an outline of the goals and objectives of 10 instructional modules covering such topics as handicapping conditions and individualized instruction. (SB)",

Modern music represents an idiom familiar to a broad span of young people, and has an important place in the life of students ranging in age from ten to thirty-five years of age. It also tends to follow and comment on the important trends of modern society. Songs can be used as presentation contexts, as reinforcement material, and for cultural education. A specific outline of how to use songs in teaching English as a second language is presented. Songs with regional or ethnic varieties of English, and songs with internal sound changes are useful in the teaching of phonological patterns. The grammatical aspect can be looked at with songs having repetition, substitution, or internal pattern  rearrangement. Story or narrative songs, performative songs, show and film songs, and songs that focus on ideas or cultural themes, such as flight from the cities, drug experiences, ecology, the generation gap, and ethnic America, are useful in teaching the semantic aspects of the language.

        "author":["Otani, Yasuteru"],
        "description":"It is commonly held that numbers and number expressions constitute the first universal language independent of any natural language. No doubt has been cast on the notion that mother tongue differences make no difference in learning mathematics. Because of its \"universal\" character, mathematics was chosen as the subject to be investigated in the IEA International Study of Educational Achievement. A defect in this study, however, is the failure to take into account the cultural background of the participating countries. For example, the mathematical expression \"2 x 3,\" is believed by IEA examiners to express an identical concept universally. However, it does not. In English, it generally means \"2 times 3,\" namely \"3 + 3.\" In Japan, it means \"2 no 3 bai,\" or \"2 + 2 + 2.\" That is,  the positions of the multiplier and the multiplicand are reversed, because there is no equivalent way of expressing \"A times B\" in Japanese. When the number system, multiplication tables and mathematical expressions are thus considered, mathematics remains an artificial language not fully independent of natural languages, rather than the ideal medium modern science is searching for. The results of the IEA test will reflect not only the degree of achievement in mathematics, but also features of the examinee's own language and culture as a background. (Author/CLK)",

        "description":"In summer 1974, an intensive English language program on the Lubumbashi campus of the National University of Zaire was organized, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation which is committed to supporting higher education in Zaire. The need for such a program arises from the determination of newly independent countries to achieve wider multilateral economic and political relationships. These require English, the major language of international communication. Because of their linguistic fragmentation, countries outside of the anglophone regions are forced to acquire English as a third or even fourth language within their educational systems. This additional linguistic demand imposes learning difficulties that can only be resolved by efficient methods based upon a knowledge of the  particular social and linguistic system. To examine this problem, selected faculty members from within the university system, as they learned English, were subjected to a series of tests to determine the effectiveness of various approaches with students of different competences and backgrounds. The report describes the planning rationale and the teaching methodology. It includes substantial statistical analysis which, if necessarily limited in its general applicability by the small numbers under study, does offer some potentially valid information concerning such programs and their potential.

The Civil Rights Act prohibited discrimination in any federally funded program and an HEW directive reinforced this. HEW instructed school districts with more than 5 per cent national origin-minority students with English difficulties to take affirmative steps to rectify the language deficiency. In the case of Lau v. Nichols the Supreme Court affirmed Title VI, and HEW's Office of Civil Rights appointed a Task Force to develop an outline of educational approaches constituting \"affirmative steps.\" School districts had either to include these strategies or prove their own methods as effective as the Task Force findings, most of  which rely on bilingual-bicultural programs. The Equal Educational Opportunities Act makes it illegal to deny educational opportunity through failure to take appropriate action to overcome language barriers. It is possible that federal courts will equate \"appropriate action\" with Title VI \"affirmative steps.\" Under the 14th Amendment, in the face of \"de jure\" and \"de facto\" segregation of ethnic minorities, federal district courts have been willing to order construction of bilingual-bicultural programs.

        "description":"An experimental first-year German program at the University of Texas is described. The course builds on and extends psychologist James Asher's Total Physical Response strategy and is based on five principles: (1) presenting language as communication in context; (2) teaching recognition before production; (3) postponing demands for error-free production until a high level of comprehension is reached; (4) presenting grammar as an aspect of meaningful communication; and (5) using German as the language of instruction. Reading is taught by emphasizing skills of prediction and inference and familiarity with vocabulary and structure to enable students to sight-read German effectively. Vocabulary and structures are retained better if used in classroom games and activities that help fix  the words in the mind. Students show recognition of language before they are able to produce it by acting out instructions, illustrating vocabulary or identifying parts of speech. Production of error-free sentences is not stressed initially, but homework and lab exercises are designed to lead to this. Grammar is learned primarily by inferring principles from actual usage. A survey favorable compares the performance of program students after one semester with regular program students completing a year of German. (CHK)",

        "description":"&quot;Linguistic ability&quot; is a widely misused term in foreign language literature. This confusion prompted an investigation into language aptitude testing, the specific goals of which included determining: the distribution of language aptitude across ability range; the validity of Pimsleur's suggestions of combined verbal and auditory scores; and whether students are generally consistent in their pattern of scoring. On the first day of the investigation, 160 students at a high school in the Sydney suburbs completed a questionnaire requesting information about language background and interests. On the second day 151 of the students (9 were absent) took the Pimsleur Language Aptitude Battery. The data yielded the following findings, among others: (1) interest is more important than I.Q.  or any other component of language aptitude in FL election and perceived difficulty; (2) evidence does not support use of a combined &quot;verbal&quot; and &quot;auditory&quot; score; and (3) students are not consistently &quot;above average,&quot;&quot;average,&quot; or &quot;below average&quot; in language potential. These and other findings reveal the importance of individualized instruction and the dangers of overgeneralization in FL instruction. This in turn assumes a commitment to the principle of equal opportunity for students in New South Wales. (Author/AM)",

        "author":["Shuy, Roger"],
        "description":"Current medical practice expects the minority patient to bend his linguistic and cultural background to that of the physician, a situation which interferes with effective doctor/patient communication. This study examines the problems in doctor/patient communication in the cross-cultural medical interview, with a special focus on the black, inner-city patient. Three types of investigation were followed. Evaluative questionnaires were administered to patients and doctors to determine subjective evidence for or against communication breakdown in the medical history interview; actual verbal exchanges between doctor and patient were observed, recorded, and typescripted; and extant automated routines for eliciting medical histories by means of a computerized console were examined. On a  continuum with doctors speaking doctor language on one end, and patients speaking patient language on the other, the breakdown appears at either end. Communication appears to take place successfully at the center of the continuum. Since the burden for communication has traditionally been placed on the patient, it is suggested that the medical profession assume a more responsible attitude to this problem. One suggestion entails exposing medical sutdents to minority languages and cultures. Two sample questionnaires are appended. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"The purpose of this essay is to expand the conceptual content of folkloric performance as a communicative phenomenon, as spoken art. Performance is seen as representing an interpretive frame, whose nature may vary. This framing is accomplished through the use of culturally conventionalized metacommunication (communication about communication), which will vary from community to community; the task of ethnography of performance is to uncover these means. The metalanguage employed in the evaluation of performance, and the esthetic standards expressed therein, constitute another essential consideration in the ethnography of performance. The association of performance with particular genres is a significant aspect of the patterning of performance within communities. Another key aspect  of performance systems is the manipulation of conventional systems to fashion novel ones. The emergent quality of performance resides in the interplay between communicative resources, individual competence, and the goals of the participants, within the context of particular situations. The three kinds of structure emergent in performance are text, event, and social structure. Finally, performance by its very nature has implications for the creation of social structure in performance. This final consideration opens the way to additional considerations concerning the role of the performer in society. (Author/AM)",

The example is given of a Cuna curing chant named &quot;the way of the pepper,&quot; in which 53 names for pepper (&quot;kapur&quot;) are used in a projection of a paradigmatic axis (the lexical taxonomy) onto a syntagmatic axis. A corollary of the principle of viewing discourse from this perspective is that uses of speech or discourse structures actually serve to define or elaborate certain linguistic sub-systems. This is termed &quot;ecology of language.&quot; This and other examples suggest other areas for future research, namely the full range of principles by which paradigmatic systems are projected onto syntagmatic discourse structures, the relation of this principle to other basic principles, and the kinds of linguistic  variation (phonological, or lexical, for example) manipulated in the process of discourse organization.

A correction sheet is then prepared by the student. The instructor compares the correction sheet with the original assignment and then prepares and administers individualized tests based on the correction sheets. Although additional work is required of the teacher in the preparation of individualized tests, the advantages of this method are that: (1) each student is motivated in an individualized way to overcome  particular composition problems; and (2) a positive approach is taken in that strong emphasis is placed on correct forms rather than on mistakes.

The main hypothesis to be tested was that there was no significant difference in the development of Spanish syntactic structures between those children schooled bilingually and those children schooled monolingually in English. If such a difference existed, the children in the bilingual program should demonstrate greater syntactic development in their speech. The study was conducted using ninety-six Mexican-American children in two elementary schools in the San Francisco Bay Area. All of the children were Spanish-dominant and spoke Spanish at home, but also spoke some English. One school had a bilingual program and half of the children attended  it. They were matched with forty-eight children who attended the second school which was located nearby and taught the standard curriculum in English. The children viewed a silent movie and discussed it individually with an interviewer. The interview was recorded and transcripts were made of the children's oral language production. One of the most interesting findings of this investigation was that the children in the monolingual school produced more language and more structurally complex language than did the children in the bilingual program. The bilingually schooled children did not perform significantly better than their counterparts on any of the eleven dependent measures. (Author/CLK)",

        "description":"This paper deals with the vocabulary problems encountered by advanced ESL students. While beginning and intermediate texts tend to control vocabulary and adapt reading selections to the learner, advanced students are usually forced to confront unabridged texts. Reading is a way to increase vocabulary, but a lack of vocabulary makes the reading task difficult. Continual reliance on a dictionary slows the process down and diverts from the over-all meaning of a given passage. It is suggested that strategies should be developed for guessing the meaning of words from the context. Guessing is a natural process in language behavior which the student probably uses in speaking his own language, and can be used in language instruction by means of the cloze procedure. A text in which words  have been systematically deleted is presented, requiring the student to use lexical, syntactic, stylistic or contextual clues to replace them. Such exercises are easy to construct. They also provide variety, encourage the student to take risks, and counteract the tendency to deal with words or sentences in isolation. (CLK)",

While in Vietnamese, tones are predictable in the sense that tones and words go together, English tones vary and have more than a lexical function. It is thus quite difficult to teach the placement of tones in English. A method of taking the Vietnamese tone markers from Vietnamese words and applying them to words in the target language is outlined, as a means of teaching tone in English.

        "description":"This is a study of tense variation in &quot;si&quot;-clauses in Buenos Aires Spanish which basically consists of the substitution of the conditional for the imperfect subjunctive. The highest frequency of imperfect subjunctive shows up in +Contrary examples, while the conditional substitutes much more often in -Contrary examples. When the conditional replaces the imperfect subjunctive in +Contrary examples, the variation relates to other linguistic facts. Two examples of these are examined: (a) when the &quot;si&quot;-clause is negated, and (b) when the verb is the second of two conjoined verbs. The analysis shows that the use of the imperfect subjunctive in negated &quot;si&quot;-clauses involves a decodification process which conflicts with the routines for negation in Spanish, and that the second position  for a verb in a &quot;si&quot;-clause is an environment where the difference between protasis and apodosis (and therefore between condition and consequence) is sometimes neutralized. That is, both factors are shown to constitute linguistic environments for which the conditional is better suited than the imperfect subjunctive to express what the speaker means, and to guarantee a more accurate reception by the hearer.

        "description":"This paper attempts to dispel a number of misconceptions about the nature of meaning, namely that: (1) synonyms are words that have the same meanings, (2) antonyms are words that have opposite meanings, (3) homonyms are words that sound the same but have different spellings and meanings, (4) converses are antonyms rather than synonyms, (5) ambiguity is bad, (6) standard formal English is more logical or more grammatical than are its nonstandard counterparts, and (6) a piece of writing can be evaluated regardless of audience or situation. Synonymy and paraphrase may have the same truth value, but not the same distribution of old and new information, nor the same emotional effect. Antonyms are basically the same but polar opposites on one semantic dimension only. Homonyms are  divided into two classes, homographs and homophones. Converses, such as \"buy\" and \"sell\" are exactly alike in meaning and are used to describe the same situation, but with a different point of view and with a different treatment of syntactic information. Ambiguity is the basis for metaphor, satire, humor, and advertising. Non-standard English is typically more logical and internally consistent than is standard English. Appropriateness to the situation is a primary factor in the evaluation of any language corpus. (Author/CLK)",

        "description":"This study investigates the extent to which nonstandard forms of written English create for readers stereotypes of the writer's personality. To determine the extent to which nonstandard writing is apparent to speakers of standard and nonstandard English, and to what extent such writing represents a socioeconomic liability for the writer, two questionnaires were devised. Respondents were first asked to rate a series of short passages on a common theme against a checklist of traits designed to reveal their idea of each writer's personality, family background, educational level, ability to use language, and potential for success. The second questionnaire used the same checklist, but the texts were not controlled for theme. The stereotypical profiles resulting from the analysis of  responses show that language standardization does not necessarily correlate with favorable ratings. Passages rated best in terms of standard composition categories are not necessarily rated well in traits indicating their personal appeal to the audience. The presence of syntactic or dictional complexity seems to suggest to many respondents the presence of standard forms, although such complexities are often nonstandard. Problems in mastering the conventions of the written standard code and the resulting breakdowns in communication between author and reader were examined. (Author/CLK)",

A brief history of language planning is provided. Following the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949, a shift took place from interest in the alphabetic writing of Chinese, including a separate writing of the main dialects, to the simplification of characters and the promotion of a standard language. The newly devised pinyin system of transcription was relegated to a secondary role. Important events that made for this shift are reviewed, including the establishment of the Bureau for the Promotion of Standard Language, and the government Committee for  Research in Chinese Writing Reform. The history of the promotion of the standard language is examined, along with information concerning language planning, including publications, that was once available. Current available information concerning the implementation of various aspects of the language reforms is mentioned. The article concludes with remarks on the contact of foreign linguists, particularly Americans, with Chinese linguists and language planners. (CLK)",

Sweden also has a National Language Committee, one of a network of such committees existing in the Scandinavian countries. They are the result of the political, economic, cultural, and social connections between the Nordic countries, and they cooperate with each other in matters of language planning and cultivation. The principal field of activity is general usage, but the language of the sciences and of special professions is also handled. To this end, Sweden has the Center for Technical Terminology. The Swedish Language Committee has members  representing five universities, the Swedish Academy and various royal academies, the public schools, the broadcasting companies and the press, writers, and theatres. The Committee follows the development of spoken and written Swedish, and carries out language planning and cultivation activities. Its main scientific interest is in the changes in modern Swedish. The publications of the Committee cover a wide field of linguistic and language planning topics, and include dictionaries, and a quarterly. Other private language associations described concern themselves with language cultivation. (CLK)",

The chief language planning goals include alphabetizing and standardizing the national languages, developing technical terminology, writing and publishing textbooks, training teachers, and training scientific manpower for further research in these languages and for recording their disappearing dialects. The language planners are native speakers of the languages who work in the departments of speech cultivation and in the language institutes of the  universities and republic academies of sciences. The relationship between the national languages and Russian is considered, as well as the degree of interference from Russian. The public use of the languages, particularly in signs and broadcasting is described, as well as the importance and nature of language instruction in the schools.

The paper shows that: (1) workers socially stratify their work environment with the labels they use for other workers and jobs; (2) there is a correlation between the social stratification the workers recognize and the social and linguistic behavior they exhibit; and (3) the preferred linguistic forms for careful and casual speech of workers may be correlated with the social categories they represent. The  results discussed in this paper illustrate that studying language in a work setting provides an opportunity to examine the relationship between socio-economic factors and communicative behavior because different generational, occupational and social groups may be observed within a common environment.

Through manipulation of the data, use of computers, etc., he succeeds in &quot;proving&quot; this. He also &quot;proves&quot; that this conditioning is contextual; that the rule which exhibits it is essentially probabilistic; and that hyperbolic tan functions are a feature of the competence underlying the human language faculty. An alternative, much simpler hypothesis is presented, but rejected on the grounds that, although it is compatible with the data, it is not &quot;empirical&quot; enough. Assumptions implicit in variable rule descriptions (VRD's) are examined, with the conclusion that the VRD approach has unfortunate methodological comsequences for linguistic  theory. It is further concluded that probabilistic grammar is not a theory. (Author/AM)",

It is argued that most language problems derive not from difficulties with language form, but from covert differences in value which are characteristically associated with those forms. Examples are given of conflicts in the lexicon due to cultural values, and it is noted that the traditional approach to cognate forms is inadequate. As a consequence, a phenomenological interpretation of the lexicon is suggested as a viable alternative for coping with conflicts of value in language. This paper provides a model for resolving lexical conflicts due to discrepancies in value, and recognizes the theoretical frameworks of existential sociology and cognitive  psychology. (Author)",

The program as originally conceived is described, and funding, participation, and recent legislative developments affecting bilingual education are discussed. It is stated that the program has progressed little towards its goals of (1) identifying bilingual education approaches, (2) adequately training bilingual education teachers, and (3) developing suitable instructional materials. The impact of the 1974 Education Amendments on this progress is discussed. The effect of the program on participating students, including an examination of the appropriateness of standardized tests is then outlined. Two main  factors contributing to the poor performance of the target population are isolated: (1) the language of limited English-speaking children may not have been used enough in classroom instruction, and (2) there may be too many English-speaking children in project classrooms, diluting project effectiveness for target children. Inadequate monitoring and difficulty in assessing English language proficiency also constitute problems. Each section of the report is followed by GAO recommendations and by HEW comments. The appendices include a review of the characteristics of 1973-74 bilingual education projects and of parent and HEW stands on bilingual education. (CLK)",

Various types of analysis are presented: (1) Correlations between L-1 and L-2 scores; (2) Correlations between Comprehension and Production scores; (3) Significant rank order of difficulty of the 14 contrasts in L-1 and L-2; (4) Determination of (a) significant differences between Comprehension and Production  scores, (b) significant gains made in L-2 during the year, (c) significant differences between L-1 scores at the two schools, (d) significant difference between L-2 scores at the two schools. The main conclusions advanced are that (1) in spite of an overall similarity between factors accounting for difficulty in first and second language acquisition interference from L-1 cannot be ruled out as playing a role in early childhood L-2 acquisition. (2) Comparative studies of second language acquisition can furnish an empirical basis for psycholinguistic and perhaps also linguistic theory. (Author)",

        "description":"This study focuses on the consequences of immersion experience as a means of developing second language skills. The students involved are 13 to 14 years of age, finishing grade 7 in the public school system. Two forms of immersion are compared, &quot;early&quot; and &quot;late.&quot; Early immersion means that students had followed an immersion program from kindergarten on, while late immersion means that students had followed a French-as-a-second language program during elementary school, and taken a one-year French immersion program at grade 7. An analysis of the comparative abilities of the two groups leads to the general conclusions that there were differences in second language proficiency between early and late immersion students. These differences appeared on tests of reading, writing,  speaking and listening where the early immersion students generally performed better than the later immersion students. However, neither group of students performed at the same level as the francophone students. (Author)",

        "description":"The relationship between sociolinguistics and educational concerns is examined, the focus of the paper being to discover how current developments in sociolinguistics are contributing to the field of bilingual education. Following a brief discussion of related legislation, basic questions concerning bilingual program implementation are raised, regarding resources, goals and objectives and the meaning of bilingual education. The success or failure of bilingual education is seen to depend upon the extent to which sociolinguistic knowledge is called upon or developed in response to five basic issues: needs assessment, goals and objectives, materials and resources, teacher education, and evaluation. Broad indications as to what has been done in these areas are given. A discussion of  functional language, functional language competence, and of the usefulness of sociolinguistic research in determining language attitudes and functional language use for bilingual education contexts precedes a description of what a sociolinguistic framework for bilingual education would entail. Materials, resources, teacher education, and evaluation are discussed in this context. The American Institute of Research and the Center for Applied Linguistics models for evaluating Title VII programs are outlined. (CLK)",

Three teacher mediation patterns were identified. Data collected by RELAB, an instrument derived from Bernstein's coding categories, recorded 4,135 child statements, eight classroom contexts and eight child variables. Correlational tests, factorial analysis of variance and contrast vector tests indicated that: (1) teacher mediation scores were strongly associated with child code use (.01); (2) teacher mediation patterns were significantly different from each other (.01). Findings support Bernstein but differ from Gahagans' conclusion of no-difference in teacher verbal mediation. The discovery that SES was the child characteristic most  strongly associated with children's coding shift strongly supports Bernstein's identification of the mediating role of the adult in transmission of speech codes.

The kinds of students served, guidelines within which they develop their degree programs, the learning activities, evaluation methods, advising procedures, and the implications for higher education in general are examined. The six approaches are: the Inter-College Program, the Bachelor of Elected  Studies program, Option II (through which liberal arts students develop individualized curricula leading to a BA or BS at the Morris campus), Experimental College, the General College's Bachelor of Applied Studies and Bachelor of General Studies programs (combining vocational and general education), and University Without Walls.

Declining test scores are attributed to an effort of high schools to &quot;cool off&quot; prospective enrollees from enrolling in college by discouraging them from taking academically demanding programs, and impacts, especially on prestige schools, which will tend to attract an increasingly socially homogeneous and intellectually heterogeneous group of students. A status report on collective bargaining indicates that collective bargaining will be more common in the public than the private sector; will affect the ability of public institutions to recruit and promote research; and will ultimately make it more difficult for state legislatures to divert aid to private schools.

This paper highlights some of the major aspects of the study, draws implications that have special significance to the black colleges, and suggests areas for further research that would appear to be of particular importance to decisionmaking in the historically black institutions. The study finds that the most important areas affecting attrition are: financial aid; residence and campus environment; employment; and characteristics of the college. (JMF)",

It is shown that the rate of full-time college attendance has declined precipitously, especially among students from low- and middle-income families. The percentage of high school graduates going to college is especially low in states with high tuition, as is the percentage of Vietnam veterans going to college in those states. Studies are reported which suggest that: lowering tuition increases the number of students going to college; (2) low-income students would be extremely responsive to  reduced tuition rates; (3) many families are hard hit when more than one dependent attends college at the same time; and (4) very few families have adequate funds to meet college costs. Current student aid programs are not adequate to meet the needs of most students, particularly working-class and middle-income students, as well as older and part-time students. (LBH)",

The identified conflicts come from the experiences of a university that was one of the first in the United States to bargain collectively with its faculty (1969) and has been doing so while operating a program planning and resource allocation system. The conflict areas that are identified together with the reasons for the conflict are: (1) job security (collective barg.) vs. staffing flexibility (planning/resource allocation); (2) mandatory late retirement (collective barg.) vs. early retirement (planning/resource allocation); (3) level  of faculty compensation (collective barg.) vs. allocation of resources (planning/resource allocation); (4) academic program stability (collective barg.) vs. academic program change (planning/resource allocation); (5) scope of collective bargaining agreements (collective barg.) vs. institutional mission, goals and objectives (planning/resource allocation); (6) faculty-interest-driven model (collective barg.) vs. student-interest-driven model (planning/resource allocation). Institutional research and planning staff of the university developed various strategies and responses to these conflict areas that resulted in some conflict resolution.

High and moderate interactors were characterized by more positive ratings of their academic program on both dimensions and by more positive ratings of their nonacademic life on Interest Value than were low interactors. Academic achievement, as measured by cumulative freshman grade-point average, contributed little to discrimination among the three groups. Analysis of supplementary  data also indicated that high interactors ranked faculty members significantly higher as a source of positive influence on both their intellectual and personal development than did low interactors. Moreover, in a follow-up analysis of the same subjects conducted during the subsequent academic year, amount of informal contact with faculty was found to be significantly associated with persistence at the institution. No statistically reliable differences were noted between high, moderate, and low interactors with respect to academic aptitude, personality, dimensions, or initial expectations of the college climate.

However, the changing characteristics of our population indicate the need for a new and somewhat more complex model for projecting enrollments than heretofore has been required, one which recognizes a variety of demographically-differentiated population sectors and their uniquely characterized patterns of participation in various types of organized educational experience. Presented is an example of such an endeavor. It was precipitated by the needs of a task force appointed by a state-level governing board to make appraisals of the impacts upon  future enrollment prospects resulting from the application of a variety of policy assumptions designed to achieve explicitly defined goals. The development of a model to which a variety of \"what if\" type of questions could be addressed was a direct outgrowth of this experience. (Author)",

        "description":"The vocationalists are highly critical of the liberal arts preparation propounded by the generalists. This criticism is based on the view that students today are primarily concerned with gaining usable skills for entrance to the work force rather than gaining a broad intellectual background. The generalists upbraid the vocationalists for promoting mere \"training\" for work that may quickly become obsolete rather than \"education\" for a career with a future. What does seem to be agreed to is that changing expectations, technology, composition of student bodies, and manpower needs of society require that our postsecondary educational system be carefully reviewed and improved in response to current and future needs. This outline of the arguments of the vocationalists and the  generalists suggests some possible ways in which higher education can accommodate the objectives of both. (Author)",

The model utilizes a desk-top programmable calculator (in this case, a Burroughs Model C 3660). The model allows the executive officers to meet together and test inputs to the budget and receive immediate feedback on the size and nature of the resulting institutional budget. The outputs allow the decisionmakers to discuss immediately the effects of their decisions on inputs as they relate to outputs. The use of a calculator has certain advantages in terms of expense, ease of programming, and portability. (Author)",

Groups of 15 age-grouped children were placed in a viewing room with a television monitor and with a distractor unit which flashed slides every eight seconds. Children's reactions were video-taped and coded into indices of distraction for each program segment. Data were then analyzed according to overall attention patterns and attention as a function of program structure, age of subjects, and viewing week. This report describes in detail the  methodology employed and results obtained. (EMH)",

Requiring the subject to push a button to maintain the broadcast and then comparing the button pushing frequency of different programs; using physiological measures of excitement or arousal; and allowing children in day care centers to voluntarily select television viewing amidst a multitude of controlled distractions are also suggested. The final suggestions include sequential photographs of subjects in natural settings, profile analysis,  infra-red photography of subjects viewing television in a dark room, and binocular testing which places a different image in front of each of the subjects' eyes and records which image is most captivating.

Results showed that good readers systematically attacked each frame regardless of format or content; however, poor readers displayed irratic eye movement and were quickly discouraged by large blocks of print.

There were 20 children in each of three groups: good readers, slow readers, and non-readers. The children were shown printed material on a screen accompanied by action sequences and voice recordings similar to what they might see on television. Experimental findings showed that good readers looked quickly at and accurately processed reading material presented on a screen. They were not negatively affected by action or distraction. Slow readers were often distracted and frequently failed to read past the first two or three letters. They looked more often at the speaker and needed more time to fixate on the material. Non-readers displayed random looking behavior at printed  material, and they were strongly drawn by action on the screen. Orienting to new stimuli was slower for non-readers, particularly if the message of the words was not carried in the action. The results of this research were incorporated into eight suggestions for children's television programing. (CH)",

The children's visual attention was monitored and recorded. Bits from the shows were then ranked according to percentage of attention they received, and the highest and lowest scoring bits were studied to determine general attributes which had particularly high or low appeal to children. After attributes were identified and defined, a list of all the bits in the shows was examined to find those denoted by the definition and to reassess the general appeal by studying the attention span scores. Finally the attribute definitions were refined or modified. Nine major attributes appear to control children's  visual attention. High appeal attributes were functionally relevant actions, electronic bridges, involvement of children, onstage correcting of verbal performance, and &quot;Do It One Better&quot; themes. Low appeal attributes were comprehensible spoken scripts, message monologues, and starting and ending bits. (CH)",

The first step was to identify those groups which had common problems but were without formal organization or spokesmen. The study identified three groups relative to mainstream society: (1) &quot;past-in, future-out&quot;--the elderly, deaf, and mental patients; (2) &quot;past-in, future-in&quot;--runaways, unwed mothers, prisoners, and victims of venereal diseases; (3) &quot;past-out, future-out&quot;--racial minorities, the disabled, and contemporary nuns. The first group had the greatest needs: ways of coping with new or reduced  circumstances, sign language programs, and entertainment intended for the elderly. The second group saw a need for programs that would inform the public about their particular problems. The third group wanted television used to combat misconceptions and prejudices about their people. A common theme was the need for television portrayal of successful models of people in all three categories. Appendixes contain group interview outlines and highlights. (LS)",

To determine the information needs for the study of nontraditional programs, 70 policymakers in postsecondary education were interviewed.

The first is that, as educational television becomes more public, it becomes less educational. This accusation is mollified by the high educational impact of recent public television broadcasts. Secondly, high initial expectations for educational television have led to disillusionment, but, fortunately, a new generation of more realistic expectations has been formulated. A third paradox is that, just at a time when educational television is demonstrating tremendous potential, it has become vulnerable to state and local budget cuts. Fourth, public television resources are being used to produce well-researched, sophisticated programs at a time when spontaneity and amateurism in  television production are considered to be of educational value.

Compulsory licensing of recordings, television programs, and other media productions, with concomitant government regulation and intervention, is becoming more popular as well as more ominous in its infringements on individuals' control of rights to their creative output. In addition, the author's one-to-one relationship with the reader is being invaded by increasing numbers of middlemen who control access to the media, to the point that authors may need collective organizations to protect their rights to fair  remuneration. The role of the federal government is expanding to encompass regulatory standards, royality rates, disputes over distribution of statutory royalties, and the means by which authors organize for payment of royalties.

Thirty interdisciplinary concepts were introduced as guidelines for learning efficiency, and three principle requirements for learning efficiency were derived: (1) educational materials should be matched with the sensory input/data-processing characteristics of the learner; (2) students should determine their own pace; and (3) adequate motivation should be ensured. The simulations were introduced at regional medical meetings, and the reactions of 846 physicians were solicited. The resulting recommendations to improve training programs included the use of more on-the-job-training, the use of more simulations and games, and  more student control over the pace of learning.

The first, &quot;What Is Mediated Instruction?,&quot; discusses programs of media services--their goals, how they operate, and their functions, and describes the Learning Resources Center at Los Angeles City College (LACC), which emphasizes self-paced individualized instruction and which utilizes a new computerized media delivery system. The second report, &quot;Media Production,&quot; discusses the benefits of using instructional media, describes how LACC instructors can get involved in media production, lists typical funding sources for such involvement, and describes in detail effective procedures to be used in producing and evaluating various kinds of instructional media. The final report, &quot;Cognitive Style Mapping,&quot; describes the systems approach to  education developed by Joseph E. Hill of Oakland Community College (Michigan). Cognitive style mapping is a tool designed to assist the student, instructor, and administrator in determining what method of learning will mean success to both student and instructor. (DC)",

A 15-item questionnaire was sent to a random sample of 1,000 local adults. The 381 respondents were typical of mail survey respondents in that they overrepresented upper socioeconomic groups; however, in other respects they were generally characteristic of residents in the TNCC service area. Results indicated a high degree of familiarity with the mission and operations of TNCC and a positive attitude toward the college. They also showed that the chief obstacles to enrolling at TNCC were lack of time and/or interest. Most  respondents indicated that their primary goal in attending TNCC would be to satisfy a personal interest or to meet some specific job-related need; interest in degree programs was clearly secondary. Many indicated an interest in self-paced instruction and in televised educational programs. The questionnaire is appended, as are general comments from the respondents. (DC)",

Eighty entering students were given a battery of tests designed to measure (1) personality, (2) attitudes, perceptions, and motivations as they relate to ability to obtain and maintain a job, and (3) socioeconomic status. Complete task and job analyses were conducted to define the occupational requirements for three kinds of human services technicians, and videotapes of persons actually performing those jobs were produced. Staff members and students viewed the tapes and developed a list of behaviors which constituted competencies in the tasks of interviewing and counseling. A  checklist was developed to record teacher evaluations of each listed competency. Those students who could not master the required skills were directed to an individualized competency-based program designed to provide them with a prescription based on individual learning style and other diagnostic factors. The authors conclude that any competency-based curriculum at a comprehensive community college must stress the affective, as well as the cognitive and psychomotor, domains of human behavior. (DC)",

This study reviews state regulation of community colleges in Illinois and explores the question of whether or not greater statewide control and coordination is desirable. It discusses the beginnings of the Illinois Board of Higher Education (IBHE) and the Illinois Community College Board (ICCB), both of which oversee the community colleges. It presents the objectives of these two boards as set forth by the legislature and reviews the methods by which board objectives are related to board  activities and policy decisions. It also reviews the control and coordinating functions of these boards, notes how many of the recurring community college issues (financing, local college autonomy, program duplication, system fragmentation, and articulation) have become political issues, and examines what these boards spend most of their time doing. Results indicate that the IBHE and the ICCB spend much more time in coordinating than in controlling the community college system, and that the state legislature still has the most power to determine the fate of Illinois education.

The task of each team was to develop a plan of staff development for its institution, and, on return to the home campus, to refine the plan and begin implementation or expansion of a staff development program. Three months after the workshop, each of the 12 colleges was visited by an SREB staff person to assist the teams with their work and to identify problem areas in staff development program implementation. This discussion of issues in planning staff development programs is drawn from the experiences and concerns of the teams during the workshop, from the visits to the 12  participating colleges and to other institutions with existing programs, and from extensive conversations with persons working in staff development. The issues reviewed include administrative organization, determination of needs, appropriate program content, program promotion, funding, and steps in planning. A discussion of the workshop design is also included. (Author/DC)",

This paper summarizes the characteristics of 104 art instructors included in the total sample of 1,493 full- and part-time faculty. Findings of the survey include: (1) one-fourth indicated that they had been students in community/junior colleges; (2) 89% held their highest degree in art while 20% held their highest degree in education; (3) 60% of the art instructors were males as compared to 67% of the total sample; (4) more male and female art instructors proportionately were older than the total group; (5) 16% claimed to be working toward the master's degree while 11% claimed to be working toward the doctorate; (6) 62% were full-time instructors and  30% were employed in jobs in addition to their teaching positions; (7) over half felt that five years in the future they would desire a faculty position in a four-year college or university, ranking their present position second. Findings concerning attitudes toward students and the humanities, reference group identification, job satisfaction, and preference for further preparation are also reported.

        "description":"The humanities are not emphasized in two-year colleges, although junior/community colleges enroll over 30% of all students in post-secondary education. The Center for the Study of Community Colleges is engaged in a multi-phased research project designed to provide information for the National Endowment for the Humanities, which wishes to strengthen the humanities in two-year colleges. Two project phases, including a literature review and a national survey of humanities faculty, have been completed. The survey yielded a great deal of information about humanities faculty. About one-fourth had been students in two-year colleges. Fourteen percent now hold the Ph.D. or the Ed.D. The male/female ratio is 2:1 with affirmative action slowly taking hold. This group has broken almost  completely with the secondary schools. It is believed that humanities faculty are becoming very insular while being relatively well satisfied with their present job situations. Recommendations for strengthening the humanities in two-year colleges have developed as a result of seminars held to discuss the survey data. These include: in-service training of faculty, dissemination of information through numerous media, advisory task forces, and conferences. Educators do not yet realize the dire situation of the humanities but must take action to insure the humanities' survival without repeating past mistakes. (JDS)",

        "description":"Historically, the community college has been viewed as an institution which should be as indigenous as possible. However, the role of the state is becoming increasingly crucial to the daily operations of the community college. This monograph reports the conduct and results of a nationwide study of state agencies responsible for community college coordination or control to ascertain whether criteria and procedures have been developed to evaluate or suspend extant community college programs, and to evaluate \"the state of the art.\" Respondents to the survey included 51 agencies from 38 states. Analysis of responses reveals that, increasingly, states use one or more criteria at either the state or institutional level for evaluation of community college programs. Agency evaluation  procedures range from review based upon institutional recommendations, to statewide accreditation, to development of a special program evaluation body. Most state agencies have developed and formalized a supportive means for program evaluation although local institutions appear to have the final word on suspension or termination of extant programs. Six case studies demonstrating agencies' program evaluation criteria and procedures are included. Appended are program evaluation criteria and procedures utilized by those state agencies which responded in this study. (JDS)",

Because of changing student characteristics and needs, requirements mandated by the state and federal governments, and financial constraints, it is felt that the district should seek district-wide comprehensiveness rather than individual college comprehensiveness. With limited resources, the alternative is permanent inequality of educational services among the colleges' service areas. The report addresses itself to the need for change and the new management plan, expanding on the process, features, cost, and implementation of reorganization. An estimated $50,000 per year will be saved in salaries alone; other savings will result from decreased administrative costs.  Section I of the report discusses the recommended plan for administrative reorganization, its rationale, and ramifications of restructuring. Section II defines the primary job functions of 33 district and college administrative positions affected by the proposed changes. Section III details the qualification standards for these administrative positions, including brief descriptions of necessary credentials, professional experience, education, and key administrative responsibilities.

Candidates' Fair '72 (CF '72) was an outgrowth of the philosophy of North Seattle Community College's Center for the Study of Practical Politics, a philosophy advocating that politics is meaningful for those who understand it. The purpose of CF '72 was to provide voters with an opportunity to meet local and state candidates and spokesmen for ballot issues upon which they would decide in the 1972 general election. The report details the organization, strategy, finance, media relations, advertising and publicity, and physical staging of CF '72. A steering committee was responsible for staging and promoting the fair. Financing the  CF '72 campaign and event were the responsibility of the fair organization, not of North Seattle Community College. Media relations were also designed and executed by the fair organization. Although the report may be of value to others who attempt similar public service efforts, it should not be construed as a how-to-do-it manual. However, recommendations for future political forums, including timing and staffing considerations, and an appraisal of the educational value of such events, comprise the concluding chapter of the report.

Demographic data, including age, sex, residence, highest degree held, and most recent professional experience of new faculty were collected from all public and private community colleges in California. Selected Deans of Instruction were subsequently asked to give their interpretations of the implications of these characteristics. Results of the survey indicated an increase in the number of new faculty holding doctoral degrees, although fewer new faculty were coming directly from graduate school, and an increase in the number of new faculty with less than master's degrees, due to changing  student demands for instructors drawn from the real world of work. An increase in the number of women being selected for employment indicates the growing success of affirmative action programs. The average age of new faculty showed a decrease. This study produced evidence of needs for increased funding for pre-service and staff development programs, higher faculty salaries, and increased funding for facilities in order to meet changing student demands for curricula and availability of classes. Survey instruments and a bibliography are appended. (JDS)",

Being in a non-compliance situation with the state agency jeopardized the college's ability to offer approved programs to veterans. To change the policy would mean submission to external governmental intervention in the academic affairs of the college, and would have the effect of altering the policy for all students to satisfy the needs of the 7% of the student body comprised of  veterans. Although the faculty traditionally exercised control over academic policy matters, time considerations necessitated a decision by the college president. A study was submitted to the president detailing student and faculty views on the matter of compliance, and economic and public relations considerations. The president decided that the college should defend its policies from governmental intrusion, and that any policy changes dictated by the state would affect veterans only; non-veterans were not to be penalized by any such policy alterations.

The training section follows a workbook format, and the assessment section provides specific guidelines for evaluating observations made in the preschool classroom. The first module focuses on the physical environment, emphasizing developing a maintainable arrangement for furniture, equipment, and  materials. Room space is divided into functional areas that the children can recognize, and organized so that the children can take on some responsibility for care and maintenance of equipment. The second module is concerned with daily scheduling techniques, focusing on the arrangement of planned sequences of active and quiet, indoor and outdoor activities within a setting that is flexible enough to adjust to special circumstances and needs. The third module deals with developing techniques for observing children as they grow and progress in the areas of group behavior and verbal ability. The chapter on curriculum planning deals briefly with establishing goals, selecting themes, planning activities, and writing lesson plans.

        "description":"This report briefly describes the Interagency Vietnam Adoption Committee (IVAC) project and provides data on the children, families, and adoption agencies involved in the project. The IVAC project set out to place black Vietnamese and black American children in black adoptive homes in the United States. As a result of that effort, it was concluded that (1) there is an untapped reservoir of potential black adopters in the United States, (2) placement of children takes too long both for the orphans and the prospective adoptive parents, (3) fees are a deterrent to finding black adoptive families, and (4) because of the lack of black representation in adoption agencies, there is prejudice against black adoptive parents even in the placing of black children. More funding and regional  adoption planning are among the recommendations made. Extensive supporting information is presented in three parts: Part I describes the two phases of the project, intercountry adoptions and domestic adoptions; Part II presents statistical data and comments on the source and characteristics of adoption registrants and the children placed; Part III describes the work of adoption agencies that served IVAC registrants. In addition there are 24 tables of data as well as descriptive and supportive documents in the appendices. (MS)",

        "description":"Twenty normal newborns, approximately 36 hours old, were tested using an auditory temporal conditioning paradigm which consisted of a slow rise, 75 db tone played for five seconds every 25 seconds, ten times. Responses to the tones were measured by instantaneous, beat-to-beat heartrate; and the test trial was designated as the 2 1/2-second period following the last stimulus when a tone would have been expected. Two learning groups were defined: those subjects who gave significant responses on the test trial, regardless of direction, and those who did not respond. A 2 x 11 x 3 x 3 analysis of variance was run on the heartrate data with the 2 learning groups, 11 trials, 3 conditions (anticipatory response, response to onset of tone, and response to offset of tone) x 3 heartbeats  (the slope of the three heartbeats associated with the responses to the tone, summed across the three conditions). Although the groups main effect only approaches significance (p&lt;.08), the trial x beats interaction (p&lt;.04) shows that the first trial startle pattern is followed by decreases in trials 2-4 and habituation in trial 5. Findings show that it is possible to obtain HR decelerations in newborn babies to a temporal conditioning paradigm and that the HR curves for newborn learning behavior are similar to those found in older subjects.

The locus of the crossmodal stimulation (auditory stimulation) was discriminable to the subject. Infants in three age groups were tested on three occasions each separated by 30 days. No substantial differences were found between the age groups. All infants underwent visual trials utilizing slides and visual auditory trials that included slides and music presented on one of two visible speakers. It was shown that novel auditory stimulation reliably elicited orienting to both auditory and visual stimulation and both of these orienting responses appeared to habituate with repeated stimulation.

Reference is made to the conservative vs. liberal debate over the role of government in providing family services. For child advocates, it is proposed that the most critical part of the controversy centers on the question of the effectiveness of human services programs and particularly child services programs. Agencies must convince Congress and the general American public that their programs are having a positive effect. The social and political impotence of children is considered, as is the question of who should dominate childrearing practices: the family or the government. The importance of parent and community involvement in  decision-making is stressed, and the development of different programs for the needs of different communities is recommended. The importance of working for a particular community and gaining its support is seen as the way of achieving an effectiveness that is recognizable by both those providing funds and those being served.

A second purpose was to develop a category system for recording the productive and disruptive behavior of young children in a free play situation. The subjects were 21 4- and 5-year-olds from middle and upper middle class families, attending private nursery school. The effects of two room arrangements were compared: (1) maximum organization, with open paths and one-third to one-half of the available space being an open area, and (2) minimum organization with blocked paths and less than one-third of the available space being an open area. An adapted instrument was developed utilizing  categories based on Walters and others and the recording method developed and reported by Caldwell and others. Observations were made over a period of six weeks. Results of the study indicate that during the course of the day children are most often engaged in productive behavior. With maximum organization, children are more verbal than physical, and physical behavior is more productive than disruptive. When the two classroom organizations were compared, significant differences in behavior favoring the maximum organization were found. Sex of the subject was not related to observed behavior. (MS)",

Naturalistic observational studies were described as heuristic, highly realistic, relevant to important social problems and oriented toward significant theoretical issues. Fifteen journals encompassing child development, clinical and educational areas of research were reviewed to determine trends in naturalistic observation of children without observer manipulation. Each of the 126 studies analyzed was coded on a variety of dimensions. Among the conclusions reached were that (1) the children observed were primarily 3- to 5-year-old, middle class children in nursery school settings interacting with the environment, other children or teachers; (2) the reciprocal nature of human  interaction was infrequently considered; (3) peer interaction was the most popular behavior observed; and (4) reporting reliability or more stringent assessments of reliability did not improve over the 16-year period. It was observed that naturalistic observational child study has been underutilized for examining developmental processes, and that diversity in the ages, populations and settings in which children are observed is needed to expand the generalizability of naturalistic findings.

Monthly assessments of about 10 minutes each, on two successive days, were made of the infant's recognition of and attachment to their primary caregivers. Examined were infant responses to the approach of the caregiver as compared to the approach of a stranger, responses to the mother's departure when the infant was left with the caregiver as compared to being left with a stranger, and the infant's response to being left with a stranger by the caregiver as compared to being left with a stranger by the mother. Results indicate that:  (1) as the child grows, the response to a stranger becomes increasingly less positive when compared to response to the caregiver, which remains neutral; (2) infants' response to their mothers leaving them with a stranger show increasing evidence of distress, starting at 7 months and increasing, while infants continue to remain generally comfortable when left with the caregiver; (3) around 6 to 7 months of age, infants show equivalent negative reactions when being left with a stranger by either the mother or the caregiver.

The Philadelphia Follow Through program began in 1968 with 1343 kindergarten pupils in 16 Philadelphia schools. Seven early childhood education models were used. Changes or modifications brought about by the program (in teacher aide hiring practices, curriculum, administrative support areas,  professional roles and use of community agencies and resources) are discussed. Parent participation and community involvement were found to play a major role in all aspects of the program. Limitations of the project are discussed, and it is concluded that while Follow Through has had many positive effects, there are still areas in need of improvement. (MS)",

        "description":"This study attempted to determine if 3-year-old low socioeconomic status children possessed a generalizable concept of circle/round, and examined two methods of teaching to those children who did not already possess it. Twenty 3-year-old children were first presented with training sets consisting of 12 pairs of stimuli: six pairs of objects emphasizing the sphere (three-dimensional) and six pairs of color photographs of the same objects emphasizing the circle or round (two-dimensional). Following each of these training sets, 10 test trials were administered. One errorless set of responses defined the criterion for all training series. Results indicate that among disadvantaged 3-year-old children there exists a fairly strong and generalizable concept of round/circle/sphere. Data  also show that most of the errors on the test trials occurred on the two-dimensional series, suggesting that the strength of the learning on the two-dimensional series was not the same as that for the three-dimensional series. In the second study, the six children who did not possess the concept by the above criteria were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. The first (standard) group emphasized the use of two-dimensional materials; the second (experimental) group emphasized the child's active involvement with spheres and other three-dimensional objects in addition to some procedures employed with the first group. Results indicate an effect slightly in favor of the experimental group, though it is suggested that more definitive conclusions will require more children and a  more complex design. A 20-page appendix consists of the instructional materials used in the second study. (SB)",

The hypotheses tested were: (1) that no age differences exist in general search strategies regardless of stimuli position, (2) that age differences could be expected with respect to the number and duration of visual fixations, and (3) that older children, because they presumably have more experience with the properties of two-dimensional representations, will evidence fewer fixations and shorter fixation duration. Subjects were 18 middle class children, nine in the young group (mean age 3 years 7 months) and nine in the old group (mean age 4 years 10 months). Stimuli were a triangle and a keyhole shape. The corneal reflection and the stimulus were  simultaneously recorded on film. The stimuli were presented twice to each child in each orientation (focal point up and focal point down), with order of stimuli randomly determined. Data were recorded and translated into a computer program, and two components of the data were examined: fixation densities and duration of fixations. In general, these analyses seem to suggest that older children make somewhat more fixations on the focal point and discriminative features of the stimuli and that they, like the younger children, find the focal point more compelling when it appears at the bottom. The study is discussed in relation to similar experiments conducted by Ghent-Braine and others. (SB)",

The goal of the research design is to develop in the preschool disadvantaged child the aptitudes and attitudes which past research has shown to be correlated with academic achievement. The skill development program is concerned with teaching children how to: (1) experience stimuli more fully (perceiving, decoding and encoding sensory stimuli); (2) organize their experiences  systematically (association, classification, and sequencing); and (3) express their experiences more precisely (verbal communication). The primary focus of the curriculum is not on the learning of specific information, but on skill development. It is assumed that a unit approach is the most effective in teaching content. (MS)",

Availability of telephone and radio were also surveyed. Results were presented in detailed data tables. Since  results indicated that a large percentage of families owned a television set with good reception quality or had access to one, the practicality of the use of television as one of the components of the MPE Program was established.

The study was used in the development of parent materials for the Appalachia Educational Laboratory's Marketable Preschool Education (MPE) Program, an extension of the Home-Oriented Preschool Education Program (HOPE). The sample comprised 699 Appalachian families with preschool children. The sample was subdivided and parents in each group were presented with an activity sheet representing a particular combination of reading level and illustrative style. Parents were requested to read the sheet and to complete the activity  with the home visitor, who played the role of their child. Comparisons were made to see which combination of reading level and illustrative style produced the largest number of successful completions. Results indicated that (1) even the materials at the second grade reading level, approximately one-fourth of the parents were unable to carry out activities described on the sheets; (2) instructional illustrations negatively affected the number of completions; (3) activities written at the second grade level and utilizing decorative illustrations produced the most completions; and (4) parents' ability to complete the activities was related to their educational attainment. Appendices include parent activity sheets, representing all six combinations of reading level and illustrative style.  (MS)",

The children's commercial television industry's research and development model usually consists of the following phases: research (market analysis); preliminary development; marketing; product development; production; dissemination; and evaluation. The research phase is basically non-empirical, and generally represents an assessment of market demands and network programming needs. Experts on children are sometimes, but not always, consulted. It is suggested that: (1) there is a need to research the substance of moral and social messages (overt and covert), and to define the attributes of the  product which capture and hold the attention of children; (2) educational development might benefit from the style of management found in the children's commercial television industry, in which an executive producer, with both technical and managerial competence, oversees all phases of development, marketing and production; and (3) more emphasis should be placed on assessment of market, consumer and interest group wants and needs when determining the substance and type of educational products to be developed.

Videotapes of 6-minute laboratory mother-infant play sessions were segmented into maternal games which were categorized according to the type and complexity of stimulation that the mother's motor patterns provided the infant. Categories and brief descriptions of the games are presented in tabular form. Measures of maternal game behavior reflecting low complexity level decreased with an increase in the age of the infant, while measures of maternal game behavior reflecting high complexity level increased. Results suggest that the sensorimotor level of the infant exerts an influence upon  maternal motor activity during gameplaying, and that mother-infant gameplaying is a dynamic interactive process which enables the infant to acquire and refine motor skills.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of verbal experience on children's creative expression and to develop more precise means for interpreting and evaluating children's art. Two questions were of interest: (1) Does the experimental approach described here enable children to resist forces tending to cause stereotyped artistic expression? and (2) Does verbal stimulation help children express artistically concepts of greater complexity? Subjects were eighty-five 5- and 6-year-olds who were divided into an experimental and a control group. Each group had art instruction once a week for a year; the control group was provided with a humanistic discussion-based art program and the experimental group was exposed to an intense verbal experience specifically designed to  encourage the child to state his egocentric thought as verbal symbols. Results suggested that children could learn to resist forces tending toward stereotyped art expression. Other results, relative to expression of concepts, were not statistically significant. Included with the study is a detailed discussion relating creative expression to the levels of child development. An appendix describes the program used with the control group, titled the Humanistic Approach to Art Education in the Elementary School. (MS)",

        "description":"This study investigates the developmental changes that occur in the attending behavior of children engaged in a relatively simple classification task, and attempts to reaffirm the existence of developmental changes in stimulus preferences and in the ability to employ double classification systems. Subjects were 24 preschool and 24 first grade children from a middle class suburban school district. The children were presented with 18 geometric forms arranged in a 5 x 5 matrix and asked to collect all the stimuli that went together and then to state how the stimuli were the same. After the child had completed the first trial, the stimuli were rearranged and the child was reminded of the basis of his first collection and asked to put the stimuli together in another way. A scoring  scale was constructed based on the use of the horizontal plane and the use of a single stimulus attribute at a time. In general, data tend to reaffirm the existence of developmental changes in stimulus preference, and indicate a significant age effect in scanning behavior. Findings also support the expected hierarchy of dimensional preferences: form, color, size. Relatively few children generated double classifications. All of the older children were able to classify on the basis of form and color and 75% classified on the basis of size. The younger children were unable to classify on the basis of size and, as expected, showed a less clear preference for form as a stimulus dimension. (SB)",

A battery of tests (Tennessee Self-Concept Scale, SRA Achievement Series, and/or the Illinois Test of Educational Development) were administered to 41 students at AIS on a pre- and post-test basis. Employing the reversal technique, behavioral data taken from the dormitories and classrooms were gathered on drinking, absenteeism without leave, tardiness (bedcheck), and class absence and tardiness. Personal interviews (N=63) and open-ended questionnaires were utilized to assess student attitudes  toward the school in general, the token economy, perceptions of change, future programs, etc. Staff attitudes were evaluated in terms of a conceptual systems theory. Evaluation findings suggested the following: the most important conclusions were based on subjective data; most of the objective data indicated the program had not significantly altered behavior; the behaviors chosen for modification were extremely complex, deeply rooted, and influenced by external factors; lack of staff commitment, training, and/or opportunity contributed to project problems; some individual improvement was apparent.

Sex, place of residence (community context), father's occupational status, and achieved scholastic performance level were considered as determinants of career choosing behavior. Data were gathered between 1965 and 1970 in a West Virginia coal county and in three regions of Germany, Norway, and Kentucky. Questionnaires were administered to 2,000 American high school students, 1,427 Norwegian &quot;ungdomsskole&quot;  (comprehensive school) and &quot;gymnas&quot; (secondary school) students, and 811 German &quot;gymnasium&quot; (secondary school) students just before a major decision-making point in their educational career track. Findings included: teaching was the most popular career choice in all three societies, especially of girls; European boys accorded teaching a higher status; teaching was a more popular professional career goal among youth from working class families; and scholastic ability had little effect upon the relative popularity of teaching among American high school and Norwegian &quot;ungdomsskole&quot; girls.

During the year, the Fort Sumner, Artesia, and Carlsbad (New Mexico) school districts requested replication services. In addition, the Clovis-Portales Bilingual Early Childhood Program made replication, with training sites in Clovis and Portales. Teachers and aides were trained through visits by the outreach training team and a workshop at the parent center. Evaluation was conducted via: objective evaluations of the formal course; classroom visits; site-visits with  administrators, teachers, and aides; self-evaluation questionnaires from the trainees and trainers; and a review of various records/logs maintained by the outreach training team. A follow-up of former REPSAC students in grades 1-4 was conducted. Findings included: teachers gained a good understanding of handicapping conditions and of how to adequately screen their children; the training workshop had a positive effect on the participants' teaching behavior; and the follow-up study indicated a downward trend for Spanish language development, a slightly upward trend for English language development; and a rather stable trend for learning aptitude.

The handbook's first chapter is a general introduction to its focus and use. Chapters 2 and 3 address the organization of the local program and the content, organization, and instructional sequence of a single occupation within the local program. They consider the first four steps of the recommended six-step procedure for curriculum articulation: listing the occupations, deciding which occupations to teach, drawing the worker mobility chart, and outlining the occupational curriculum. Chapter 4  discusses guidelines for developing instructional modules and describes the fifth step in achieving articulation: writing teaching modules. Chapter 5 suggests a system for teachers to use in monitoring student's progress through modules toward their occupational goals and covers the last articulation step: developing a record-keeping system. Five appendixes provide a glossary, a sample task inventory, guidelines for constructing task inventories, measures to determine learner achievement, and advantages and limitations of some classroom media. A three-page bibliography is included. (JR)",

Both providers and receivers of placement services in Grant, Winneabago, and Racine Counties were surveyed regarding barriers and facilitations in securing educational/occupational placement. The survey indicated that: most high school resources were directed toward students anticipating further education; family and friends were rarely utilized as resources by school and community personnel; the placement-securing skills of many students were deficient; and students were concerned about marketability of skills. The model Career Placement Delivery System, a transitional placement developmental  program, is designed to maximize student independence in career planning/placement and the availability of career options. The system contains three main components: (1) instructional (placement skills: qualifying, securing, and maintaining), (2) guidance (outreach, orientation, appraisal, informational, counseling, planning, program selection, and followup services), and (3) referral (placement solicitation, placement development, and ancillary services). A conceptual evaluation was accomplished through a questionnaire survey (appended) of 26 evaluators (counselors, local vocational education coordinators, placement functionaries, and administrators); two evaluators were selected for an-indepth interview to test potential utilization of the model system.

        "description":"To test the differences in effect of postsecondary vocational training offered by public schools and by proprietary schools, a study based on a sample of 4,8000 students and graduates in the accounting, programing, electronic technician training, dental assisting, secretarial, and cosmetology occupations was designed. Even though vocational students are generally the least advantaged students in postsecondary education, the study determined that proprietary students were the least advantaged of these. Since proprietary schools offer narrowly-targeted, no-frills training in short, intensive, but flexible programs, they are frequently more attractive than comparable programs in the public schools. The study concluded that students from either type of program were liable to have  their employment aspirations frustrated unless they chose to work at the lower levels of the occupational hierarchy. Hence many schools are not living up to their explicit or implicit promises of upward mobility through self-help. Recommendations for protecting vocational education consumers include: access to reliable information on vocational programs, government standards regarding program effectiveness, truth-in-advertising requirements, audits by government-appointed agencies, equal pay for equal work for women and minorities, coordinated experimentation on ways to best use all occupational training resources, and self-evaluation of program objectives.

There are two methods of planning conferences: a systematic and organized method, and an informal method. Central to estimating the success of a conference is evaluation. In the evaluation process, obtaining information consistent with stated objectives is an essential first step, a task whcih frequently necessitates a full-time evaluator. To determine the full effect of the conference on all participants, it is advisable to include all participants in the evaluation process. Though expensive and time consuming, evaluation readily reimburses initial planning costs. The various symptoms of inadequate evaluation, for instance, low re-enrollments, high dropout  rates, and employer complaints, often contribute to the neglect of evaluation. Obstacles to evaluation include: difficulty in appraising behavior change, lack of comparative data, financial constraints, and unclear or unspecific objectives. Methods and techniques for evaluating a conference involve initial construction of a plan and utilization of valid and reliable evaluation instruments. Evaluators themselves must determine the combination of before, during, and after conference instruments appropriate for the purposes desired. (JR)",

Data was obtained from 1,404 vocational female faculty and 1,181 vocational administrators through an Equalitarian Perception Scale (measuring differences of perceptions) and a demographic data form (measuring status). Relationships between institutional type in the areas of dual-role conflict, career aspirations, and advancement possibilities are identified for both the vocational female faculty and administrators. Demographic characteristics for both groups, the origin and importance of the  study, a review of pertinent literature and four related sub-studies, procedures and data analysis, findings, a summary, and list of 10 recommendations are presented. Sixty-four tables and 19 graphs supplement the text. Findings indicate an adverse dual-role conflict, limiting female faculty in their career aspirations and self-concepts. Postsecondary proprietary school female faculty responses differed significantly from their counterpart responses in the three other kinds of schools; there was less disagreement among administrators. Preservice and inservice programs for both male and female faculty and administrators are recommended. The questionnaire is appended. (Author/LH)",

        "description":"Vocational, academic, and special education teachers who had received inservice education in the individualization of instruction were observed to determine the effect of the education on their teaching. Data collection and conversion instruments were developed. Six trained observers performed 364 classroom observations in 10 Texas districts with inservice programs, and in 10 without; the 10 inservice program administrators were interviewed. A literature review indicated that certain methods of inservice instruction rated higher in implementation than others (laboratory, simulation, team research, and internship), suggesting seven hypotheses which were tested, using linear regression analysis. Four examined inservice education's relationship to teacher performance; three focused  on the degree and level of individualization performed by each of the three groups of teachers. Inservice education in individualized instruction was found to make a difference for academic teachers, and, to some extent, for special education teachers, but not for vocational teachers. This suggests that teacher classification differences should be considered in planning inservice education programs. Academic teachers in Texas apparently are not receiving adequate training in individualization from teacher education programs, but the Texas vocational certification program is apparently producing teachers who can individualize instruction. Inservice instruction methods made no significant difference. The instruments are appended. (AJ)",

        "description":"A distributive education program of simulation occupational experiences was established in four rural pilot schools where the normal cooperative education program was not feasible. The plan provided for competency-based instruction by a distributive education teacher-coordinator (in management, merchandising, salespromotion, and control) in the classroom and in a simulated and/or school store. Procedures for establishing the programs are discussed: school selection, teacher-coordinator selection and workshop training, student recruitment, equipping the classroom-laboratory, advisory committees, organization of a local Distributive Education Clubs of America chapter, evaluation, and dissemination activities. Curriculum materials for the simulation project are described. Project  evaluation was accomplished through (1) self-evaluation by teacher-coordinators, administrators, and project director and (2) review by out-of-State experts. It was concluded that: overall objectives had been met, the plan was transportable, and that the simulation model was a viable alternative to cooperative programs in rural areas. Implications for rural and urban schools and teacher education are included with recommendations for those establishing the plan in other States. Appended are: a selected bibliography, sample correspondence, sample forms, workshop agendas, advisory committee guidelines, a schedule of career progressions in six business categories, and an equipment list.

The curriculum is designed to prepare first year students for selected entry-level distributive jobs and second year students for selected career-level distributive jobs. The materials are specified for classroom or simulation use, for year one or two, and are based on competencies  common to a salesperson or an assistant buyer for a department store. A brief teacher-coordinator guide introduces each of the areas, outlines topics to include, and lists instructional materials. The packet materials for each area present competencies, individual learning activities, and group activities in a three-column format.

        "description":"The study attempted a comprehensive evaluation of the process and product of a school-based job placement model operating in three Pennsylvania area vocational schools (AVTS). Random samples of AVTS and sending school seniors were post-tested on employability skills. Students, parents, school personnel, employers, Bureau of Employment Security (BES) personnel, and community contacts were surveyed. Study objectives were to assess job placement specialists' performance in: (1) preparing students with job searching skills and knowledge; (2) job matching (finding jobs satisfying students' interests and training); and (3) establishing and maintaining cooperative working relations with BES. The study concluded that a formalized placement service can increase the probability of a  student obtaining employment over those schools who do not have such a service. Further, students utilize such a service if it is available, and, along with their parents, employers, and others, believe that the school should provide such services. Finally, better cooperation between the school and BES can lead to effective job placement. Findings are supported with statistical data throughout. Selected recommendations addressing the pilot job placement projects deal with the continuation and improvement, where appropriate, of the projects' successful practices. Project-related materials and survey instruments are appended. (BP)",

The findings are based on interviews with 158 people including police managers, officers in charge of civilian employees, and the civilians themselves. Two types of activities were surveyed: (1) the employment of civilians on jobs in communication, identification, and deterntion facilities, and (2) the use of civilians as Community Service Officers (CSOs), 18 to 20-year olds who assist police officers on the street. Police managers and officers were favorably impressed with the use of civilians because they relieved officers for more critical duites, cut costs, and improved service to the public. Most problems were related to police management  practices or personality conflicts. Civilians' assessments of benefits and problems closely parallel those of the officers. Program success depended on the quality of planning, implementation, and management.

The pre-postsecondary business education curriculum for grades 11 and 12 provides experience-centered instruction through career exploration in business administration. A statement of the problems and philosophy, a list of the occupational areas, eight program objectives, the course content, and a list of resources materials are presented in the first part of the document. The body of the guide provides unit plans for the following business administration subject areas: an introduction to business, business mathematics, business English, economics, business law, introduction to data processing, accounting, human relations,  management, finance, marketing, and statistics. Developmental objectives, program objectives, behavioral objectives, learning activities, and program implementation are presented for each unit. The course is approximately 36 weeks in length and uses the block teaching approach. Visual aids, practice sets, games, role playing, and simulation are used extensively throughout. The document concludes with an outline of six recommended evaluation methods. A four-page bibliography is appended. (Author/BP)",

As a process, DACUM is a group-accomplished occupational subject area skills analysis; as a product, it is a graphic representation of those skills, called a DACUM chart, which can be used as a curriculum plan. Part 1 of the paper reviews the current literature on task analysis techniques used for systematic curriculum development. Part 2 describes the ways DACUM is being used, and Part 3 is the DACUM procedures manual, for coordinators leading groups in developing DACUM charts (skills profiles). Part 4 is a 142-page collection of terminal performance objectives drawn from  completed DACUM charts, classified into 24 general areas according to the Canadian Classifications and Dictionary of Occupations. Part 5 presents conclusions and implications: DACUM provides a means of building a large data base of instructional objectives, a necessary element for a highly flexible, computer-managed instructional system close to the open college concept. An epilog contains comments and additional ideas. Appended are several pages of charts and diagrams related to the DACUM skills analysis process. (Author/AJ)",

Project TIMES (Temporally Individualized Modular Education Scheduling) was incorporated in the 10-14 component at an area vocational-technical school. The computerized program included the identification of 20 career areas and the development of required skills; evaluation consisted of student/staff interviews, observation scales to assess the instructional environement, and teacher/student morale scales. The elementary component focused on the development and implementation of a model computer resource, career-oriented curriculum. Evaluation included student assessment in an  experimental and two control groups in addition to staff questionnaires. The junior high component, which focused on career awareness/exploratory experiences, sponsored a one-month staff development workshop and the development of a resource center. Evaluation included workshop assessment and program evaluation by faculty and a randomly selected group of students. The K-12 component centered on self- and career awareness, career exploration, and career preparation/placement. Evaluation instruments were a self-appraisal inventory, attitude scales, and occupational information tests. Approximately one-fourth of the document consists of appendixes containing copies of various evaluative instruments. (EA)",

The grade 10-14 component at Edenburg focuses on identifying 20 career areas, identifying behaviorally described skills required for the various occupations, developing the required skills through the use of tasks, modules, and units, and using computer hardware and software to manage the system. The elementary component in Crawford County focuses on integrating career and self-awareness with baskc K-6 academic materials, exposing students to a range of career clusters, individualizing students' learning programs, and using existing computer facilities for storing and retrieving career oriented curricula. The junior high component in Philadelphia focuses on fusing  career education concepts, experiences, and resources into existing curricula, providing career exploratory experiences, providing an effective guidance and counseling program, and developing a Career Education Resource Center. The K-12 component in McKeesport focuses on a series of career oriented assumptions: reality-bound assumptions, self-oriented assumptions, and personalized assumptions. In general, each evaluation describes the program and the means of evaluating program objectives, summarizes the evaluation effort, and provides conclusions and recommendations. Appendixes (50 pages) provide additional materials relevant to the respective evaluations. (JR)",

        "description":"The report investigates production and the cost effects of teaching within hospital departments. Models of primary production show that the cost effects of teaching are determined by the salaries paid to students (including residents, interns, medical students, and technical trainees) and physicians, by the levels of student inputs used in production, and by the productivity of student and nonstudent inputs. The models of departmental production developed permit costs to be related to the level of student inputs rather than to the more abstract variable, teaching output. Empirical analyses of radiology costs in 90 general medical and surgical hospitals in the Veterans Administration system were conducted. The empirical results suggest that, with the exception of one variable  whose interpretation is suspect, teaching reduces costs for most individual radiology procedures. Although the VA system differs from non-VA hospitals in many respects, the apparent cost reductions for many radiology outputs suggest that students can be substituted for nonstudent inputs in radiology. If costs of primary products can be reduced through teaching, as the radiology results suggest, it would be possible for teaching hospitals to provide a given medical program for patients at lower costs than in nonteaching hospitals.

        "description":"The Vocational Education Act of 1963, as amended in 1968, required States to engage in detailed planning and reporting to qualify for Federal funds. The report describes the State planning process as it exists, planning initiatives which have been made and problems which have been encountered by the States. Commonalities and differences in the States' planning processes are identified, and the various development methods are described. The origins of data going into the State plans are discussed, and the major steps in writing and reviewing the State plan draft are traced. The major problems encountered by State planning personnel, problem causes, and possible effects are identified, and State planners' suggestions for solving these problems are offered. Although the study is  descriptive in nature, an effort is made to gauge the effects of planning. Innovations in the planning process and examples of exceptional planning efforts are identified, and trends in the planning of vocational education are examined to determine whether the State plans are true planning documents or merely compliance documents. Finally, 12 recommendations to Congress are offered which, if implemented, should improve the planning of vocational education. These are aimed at stimulating legislative action at the Federal level.

The correctional planners attempt to strike a realistic balance between the need for incarceration of offenders and the need for rehabilitation and treatment. The multiple influences available through community corrections are seen as offering more possibilities for innovation and more effective retraining of offenders. The recommendations of the program planners are (1) the incarceration of as few offenders as possible; (2) the development of small, decentralized specialized treatment centers; (3) the use of individualized sentencing procedures based on social-psychological study of each offender; and (4) the development and use of diversionary methods to steer  first-time offenders away from the criminal justice system.

It is suggested that the degree of competition exhibited in an interaction is an inverse function of the quantity of resources available, and that the effect of situational characteristics on cooperative behavior is related to pressure from the social environment. The present experiment examines the dyadic interaction resulting when a competitive situation defined in terms of limited resources is altered by presentation of a cooperative contingency. The results of this study indicate that for each reward that can control the behavior of a subject in a social situation there exists a cooperative or competitive contingency for obtaining that reward.

A palmar sweat measure of stress was employed to examine inmate stress in relation to social and spacial density factors. The data suggest that increasing the number of people in a housing unit (and hence the potential number of interactions) leads to increases in levels of stress as measured by palmar sweat. In contrast, decreasing the amount of space per man does not lead to such increases in levels of stress. Apparently the social component of crowding appears to be the more important variable in producing crowding stress. The authors also employed a figure placement task developed by Desor to assess the degree to which the inmates tolerate  stress. The figure placement data suggest that individuals living under relatively high levels of social density develop greater tolerance for crowding than those living under lower levels of social density. This finding is in agreement with an adaptation level theory analysis of responsitivity to stress. (SJL)",

Seventeen tests of ability, along with four of the problem-solving criterion tasks, were administered to a sample of 490 fifth-grade students. Test-retest reliabilities  were found to be quite low, but regression analysis revealed that convergent production of semantic transformations and two memory abilities were related to performance on simulated problems; memory and evaluation abilities were related to Verbal Maze performance; and logical reasoning and noticing details were important to concept identification. The lack of important results indicates the need for replication of the study with several important changes in design. (Author)",

The results suggest that discrepancies exist between the perception of counselor's role and views of the counselor's perceived role, and that these differences are most pronounced within the faculty group. Group comparisons indicate that counselors view personal adjustment problems as more appropriate for counseling than other Ss and that this discrepancy is maintained even when other members of the campus community adopt the counselor's viewpoint. While counselors convey much ambivalence to the other members of the campus community about their willingness to deal with vocational  choice and routine college problems, they seem to have communicated their attitudes about the appropriateness of personal adjustment counseling to their faculty colleagues.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to present a theoretical tradition which may broaden the scope and perhaps suggest alternate avenues of investigation of the function which we call \"memory.\" As psychology developed during the past century, the area of memory has been strongly influenced on the theoretical level by the thinking of the British Associationists and on the experimental level by the work of Ebbinghaus. This influence has tended to overshadow other significant work and to narrow the approach to memory to those hypotheses and experiments which were consistent with or derived from the Associationist tradition. This paper will attempt to provide an overview of the Aristotelian tradition, with its basic theory and conceptual distinctions on the subject of memory. It is well  known that Aristotle first proposed similarity and contiguity as memory clues. What is not so well known is that he also prposed a theory of memory which was integrated into his framework of psychological functions and ultimately into his theory of man. From this basis, selected representatives of the Aristotelian tradition will be presented. As might be anticipated, these representatives will be predominantly from the field of philosophy.

These irrationalities persist despite people's conscious determination to change; many of them oppose almost all the teachings of the individuals who follow them; they persist among highly intelligent, educated, and relatively undisturbed individuals; when people give them up, they usually replace them with other, sometimes just as extreme, irrationalities; people who strongly oppose them in principle nonetheless perpetuate them in practice; sharp insight into them or their  origin hardly removes them; many of them appear to stem from autistic invention; they often seem to flow from deepseated and almost ineradicable tendencies toward human fallibility, overgeneralization, wishful thinking, gullibility, prejudice, and short-range hedonism; and they appear at least in part tied up with physiological, hereditary, and constitutional processes. Although we can as yet make no certain or unqualified claim for the biological basis of human irrationality, such a claim now has enough evidence behind it to merit serious consideration. (Author)",

Age was not significantly related to the work commitment of women. Changes in quality of employment through the life cycle were, for men, found to be one determinant of correspondence changes in work commitment. No matter how good or bad men's jobs were in the early part of their working lives, most men ended up with a fairly  low degree of committent just prior to retirement age.

Intelligence and off-the-job activity levels were investigated as possible moderators of the relationship between task characteristics, monotony, and boredom. Intelligence had no significant effect on the association between job characteristics and either monotony or boredom. The moderating effects of intelligence were confined to the relationship between perceived monotony and feelings of boredom. That is, monotony  was more closely associated with boredom among more intelligent workers. The moderating effects of off-the-job activity were likewise strongest on the relationship between perceptions of monotony and feelings of boredom, with the latter two variables being more strongly related among workers who were more active off their jobs.

Emphasis is placed on involvement of all elements of the educational system and on careful delineation of the role of each. Teachers are actively involved in the design and implementation of the assessment device, which was used to evaluate 180 children in its first year of use. It is suggested that this method eliminates many of the problems associated with conventional screening procedures. The method of test development and implementation is consistent with the principles of consultative school psychology and is effective in overcoming problems of validity and utility of traditional  assessment procedures.

The degree to which this adjustment is successful often plays a major role in determining the extent to which an individual finds his later years satisfying and rewarding. In a complex technical society retirement does not consist of a relatively simple change in status from the role of worker to that of nonworker, but has important interpersonal and intrapersonal implications that affect the retired person's personal and social existence. This monograph describes the results of a study of compulsory retirement among urban males and females. The data reported are largely concerned with the prediction and nature of responses to the retirement event, and  implications of these for the development of preretirement programs. (Author/HMV)",

        "description":"Enhancing Drug Education in the South was a project conducted by the Southern Regional Education Board in 1971-74. The project held regional conferences that brought together people in the SREB region with State-level responsibility for planning alcohol and drug education programs in an effort to find solutions to common problems such as coordination and program evaluation. SREB convened a task force of eight people with expertise in teaching and in preparing teachers for drug education. The task force first met early in April 1972 to determine what kinds of skills students need to live successfully in a drug-oriented society, and what classroom activities would be most effective in meeting these needs. With this as a basis, the second session, held at the end of April,  concentrated on determining the competencies--knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes--needed by a teacher who would carry out the activities. This report reflects the deliberations of two workshops that focused on teacher training for the role of drug educator in schools. The objective of these two sessions was not to design a curriculum or training program, but rather to determine what competencies a teacher needs to serve as an effective drug educator. Furthermore, the task force defined &quot;drug educator&quot; as a role that any teacher might assume, whether his primary assignment be English, social studies, science, or health. (Author/HMV)",

A second objective for the publication is to take away the threatening overtones to the word &quot;evaluation&quot; by showing the benefits to be gained and by pointing out the value that negative findings have for the ultimate success of a program. This book contains four sections: Why Evaluate?; Guidelines for Impact Evaluation; Suggestions for Process Evaluation; and Evaluation of Drug Programs (synopses of some examples of  evaluations of alcohol and drug education programs). The section of the book dealing with impact evaluation was developed by a task force sponsored by the Southern Regional Education Board project, Enhancing Drug Education in the South. The task force included State-level program directors, representatives from Federal agencies concerned with alcohol and drug education, and people with expertise in program evaluation. (Author)",

The present study compared the various ways in which mothers and fathers perceptually categorize the behavior of girls and boys. A group of white middle-class parents who had a boy and a girl between 6 and 11 were individually interviewed about the social behavior of their children. A long list of phrases descriptive of children's behavior was formed and submitted to another similar group of 40 parents who were asked to sort each phrase on the basis of how they would react if the behavior occurred in a boy or a girl of their own. Various statistical procedures  indicated the existence of a strong evaluative dimension of a good-bad social behavior underlying the structuring of the stimulus material. Seven other psychological dimensions were also revealed. Moreover, fathers and mothers differed in their perceptions of the social behavior of boys and girls. The authors discuss a number of studies which are either going to be conducted or which are currently being conducted. (Author/SE)",

The randomized block (RB) design has traditionally been a preferred model for much psychological research. The RB has had, however, the stringent requirement that the sample population be strictly defined and stratified beforehand, a requirement more appropriate in a controlled laboratory environment than in many field situations. This technical paper describes the development of an alternative statistical design which provides the advantages of the classic RB method without its operational disadvantages, and which will be useful not only in the area for  which it was developed, but in other areas of behavioral science research. The statistical model chosen for comparison and test was a modified analysis of variance (ANCOVA) design that does not require previously selected stratified samples and does incorporate the ability to handle categorical variables: the categorical analysis of covariance (CANCOVA). Empirically, no practical difference was found between the power of RB and CANCOVA when the samples were large. (Author/NG)",

Further, the results indicated that sex-typed people were more likely to report using power strategies consistent with popular sex stereotypes than cross-sex-typed or androgynous people. It was also found that sex-typed and androgynous persons had higher need for approval scores than cross-sex-typed individuals.

The approach applied to learning processes (called Suggestopedic) developed by Dr. Georgi Lozanov (called the Lozanov Method) utilizes mental and physical relaxation, deep breathing, positive suggestions, and background music to increase the amount of material learned in a given time, or reduce the amount of time necessary to learn new material. Theoretically, through the Suggestopedic approach, information bypasses emotional blockage and anti-suggestive barriers to go directly into the long-term memory area of the brain. This makes learning not only faster, but more enjoyable for both children and adults and results in a  higher retention rate. In addition, the self concept of the learner is enhanced both as a result of higher achievement and the positive suggestions which are a part of the approach. While research results are sparse and not readily available in English translations, there is ample evidence that the method is highly effective in a wide variety of learning and therapeutic settings. Additional experimental projects and practical applications are needed to assess the effectiveness of the method in specific settings and under realistic conditions as they are found in schools, hospitals, clinics, and agencies where teachers and counselors work.

In order to provide access to higher education that is compatible with movements toward social equality, the federal focus has shifted in the direction of student financial aid. Although Congress continues to fund three campus-based student aid programs, the keystone of the federal financial aid policy is the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant programs. The successes and problems of this grant program are described, and the steps taken to improve the management of the Guaranteed Student Loan Program are outlined. The speaker calls for greater coordination of effort at the state level between basic grants and such  joint federal-state initiatives as the State Student Incentive Grant program. (Author/SJL)",

The subjects, seniors at nine parochial high schools located in four midwestern states, completed an opinion survey and Kohlberg's Moral Judgment Interview. The results indicate that the perception of the high school environment is related to moral reasoning in much the same way as other studies have found behavior and attitudes of parents to be related to moral reasoning. The present study, however, failed to demonstrate conclusively that there is a relationship between student's perception of the humanism of the school environment and their level of moral maturity. There is a  progressive decrease in moral maturity corresponding to an increase in the perceived Traditionalism score. On the Strict Control Scale, those who perceive the high school environment as being low in strict control are significantly lower in moral maturity than those who perceive it as being moderately low, moderately high, and very high in strict control. These results are discussed in relation to the findings of earlier and related studies. (SJL)",

It was hypothesized that six determinants such as health, low income and job dissatisfaction are responsible for not wanting job promotion. Sex, age and race were hypothesized as determinants of worker's promotional expectations. A national probability sample of 1,159 employees were asked questions concerning their need for and expectation of promotion. Several multiple classification analyses were done and the following results were found: (1) the expectancy and need measures explained 46% of the variance in promotional desire; and (2) expectancies contributed much more to explained criterion variance than did the needs. However, since expectations could be  measured with greater precision than could needs, it is possible that the complete contribution of needs to promotional desire is not accurately reflected by this study.

        "author":["Foulds, Melvin L."],
        "description":"This paper reviews the results of three investigations of the effects of marathon Gestalt workshops on the measured self-actualization of volunteer, college student participants. In the first study, 10 students participated in a weekend workshop at the university counseling center. Subjects completed the Personal Orientation Inventory (POI) before the workshop and again four days later. Significant positive pre-post changes in mean scores were observed on seven of twelve POI scales for the experimental group. A nontreatment group controlled for sex, age, and college class demonstrated no significant changes. In Study II, 36 college student volunteers were randomly assigned by sex to experimental and control conditions. The experimental group participated in a continuous 24-hour  Gestalt workshop and completed the POI before, four days after, and six months after the workshop. Findings revealed significant positive pre-post changes on 11 of 12 POI scales. Posttest-followup comparisons indicated that these changes persisted over time and that additional gain was achieved on several POI scales. No significant differences were observed in control group mean scores for pre- and posttests. Study III was a replication of the second study with an increased number of subjects, and the results were highly similar to those in Study II. Results of these three studies suggest that marathon Gestalt workshops appear to foster increased self-actualization in volunteer college students. Suggestions are offered for future research.

        "description":"The author discusses the various aspects of the legal struggle for abolishing corporal punishment in schools. A review of several recent cases of corporal punishment brought to the attention of the Supreme Court shows that the court has so far upheld the right of schools to practice physical punishment, within reasonable limits, as a disciplinary measure. The court rulings were based on two major principles: a) the state educational boards have a certain degree of autonomy in their educational policies and; b) the constitutional rights that apply to adults do not apply to children. The author discusses many legal cases where the Court ruled the use of corporal punishment in institutions for delinquent children and in prisons was illegal, and argues that this decision is equally  applicable to public schools. In several recent cases the Supreme Court has ruled that before punishment is inflicted on students, principles and teachers should give students the right to defend themselves verbally, and teachers should have the permission of parents before physically punishing their children. These decisions, the author considers, are encouraging steps in the legal struggle to abolish corporal punishment once and for all. (SE)",

It is argued that the demonstrable existence of meta-conflicts about the conduct of social evaluation efforts, political sensitivities in the research arena, and the adaptive instability of evaluated programs do not functionally segregate social evaluation from traditional social psychology. Rather, these problems occur homomorphically in both arenas, although they are more often articulated in the former rather than the latter settings. The conclusion of radical social evaluation authors that the scientific method is inapplicable to their research settings in unwarranted:  experimental tactics are often degraded by the presence of complex system constraints, but other standard investigatory tactics may be reliably applied toward replicable knowledge. Any segregation of social evaluation from social psychology is dysfunctional, since a relevant social psychological science can be approached only with the development of overarching theory capable of explaining interactive behavior in both settings. Correspondingly, social psychological relevance varies neither with a researcher's investigatory strategy nor problem setting, but directly with the goodness of evolved theory. (Author)",

On the basis of this three-year project, the authors offer a number of recommendations for increasing the relevance and effectiveness of counselor education programs. These include: emphasis on the counselor's role as consultant to parents, teachers and administration; additional research on influence of on-site consultation; increased training in psychological education; and development of better procedures for career guidance training.

Demographic factors such as race, sex and age, education, job tenure and supervisory status served as the predictor variables; annual income objective and perceived discrimination and various measures of job satisfaction were the dependent variables. Three statistical approaches were used to analyze the data; 1) multiple regression; 2) automatic interaction detector (AID) and 3) multiple classification analysis (MCA) determining the power of sex as a predictor of income. Method two accounted for a higher percentage of the variance in income  than the first approach, showing a greater occupational discrimination based on sex. The third method accounted for 47% of the variance in income, somewhat lower compared to the other two approaches. The results indicate that sex is the third most important predictor variable of income after occupation and education; moreover women were found to receive lower salaries than men for the same kind of jobs.

The importance of any job facet was equated with its capacity to account for variance in job worker satisfaction scores. The job facets were subsumable into four basic dimensions: (1) opportunities it provided to perform challenging or self-developing activities; (2) the resources enabling adequate performance; (3) provision of a comfortable  work environment; and (4) provision of financial rewards and job security. The model was able to explain some 53% of the variance in job satisfaction scores, and the authors note some of the problems that make such explanatory power acceptable. Of the four dimensions, \"challenge\" seemed most promising. Further directions for research and refinement are indicated. (NG)",

        "description":"The major purpose of this study was to explore the differences between a group of 56 undergraduates who occupied single rooms and 57 undergraduates who occupied double rooms in the Gonzaga University Residence Hall System during the 1972-1973 academic year. The differences were evaluated according to one cognitive variable, grade-point average; two demographic variables, age and family size; and 16 non-cognitive variables. The 16 non-cognitive variables were evaluated according to the 15 need scales and counseling readiness scales of Gough's Adjective Checklist. The 15 scales included achievement, dominance, endurance, order, intraception, nurturance, affiliation, heterosexuality, exhibition, autonomy, aggression, change, succorance, abasement, and deference. Significance was  found two variables, the demographic variable, age; and the cognitive variable, cumulative grade-point average. Thus, the undergraduate who lived in a private room, in contrast to the undergraduate who lived in a double room, was apparently older and maintained a higher cumulative grade-point average. Results of a question which ascertained undergraduates' preference for either living with or without a roommate indicated 45 of 56 undergraduates who lived in a private room and 28 of 57 undergraduates who lived in a double room would prefer to live without a roommate during the 1973-1974 academic year.

It was hypothesized that in the experimental groups which received career counseling the student's career maturity and vocational certainty would increase over the control groups which received no counseling. In the policy study, intensive three-day workshops were conducted in which each student volunteer took an interest test, participated in a videotaped interview workshop, obtained intensive individual counseling, and went on a field trip to a local technical school and a local community college. The second study was done with students  enrolled in a power mechanics course. Over a 40-day period, along with the regular classes in power mechanics, each student was given an interest test, exposed to filmstrips of occupational areas in which he was interested, given individual counseling and participated in interviewing techniques workshops. Most of the students also went on a field trip to a local technical school and a local community college. In both the pilot study and the experiment the students' results on the Career Maturity Inventory and the career certainty questionnaire were generally in the hypothesized direction. (Author/SL)",

The aim of this program is to prevent problem drinking or alocholism in students who report concern about their drinking behavior, and volunteer to participate in a treatment-prevention program aimed at controlling their drinking patterns and rates. It is not recommended for those individuals who might be diagnosed as alcoholic, but only for those who show developing signs of a drinking problem, and who reject the requirement of total abstinence as a treatment goal. Research is presented which provides background support for the prevention program, based on a behavioral model of drinking behavior. A number of specific treatment techniques are described  as components of the program, including aversion therapy, assertive training, blood-alcohol level discrimination training, and relaxation training. This paper provides only an overview and description of the program, and no follow-up data are presented. (Author)",

Additional research suggests that the counseling relationship with deliquent populations is different from that with nondelinquent populations.

Thirty-six residents completed rating scales regarding the counseling relationship with their respective counselors (N=9) using the Counseling Evaluation Inventory, Relationship Questionnaire, and the Scale of Counselor Effectiveness. The counselors had previously been identified as high and low dogmatic on the basis of Dogmatism Scale scores. Data analysis by t-tests failed to support hypotheses  regarding low dogmatic counselors being perceived as more effective. The study concludes that the counseling relationship with delinquent populations may indeed be different, since the delinquent clients in this study perceived the high dogmatic counselor to be more effective.

        "description":"This paper investigated whether children can learn to cooperate under minimal social conditions. The research also compares the effectiveness of verbal instructions and a training task for teaching subjects the \"win-stay/lose-change\" rule. This rule has been used to explain the development of cooperation in the minimal social situation. Subjects were 19 teams of first-, second-, and third-graders. Five teams were composed of two girls; six were girl-boy teams; and eight were boy-boy teams. Ten of the 19 teams learned to cooperate in the minimal social situation without treatment. Two of four teams given the rule training procedure learned to cooperate after having failed to learn under typical social conditions. Of five teams given verbal instructions, four learned to cooperate  immediately. The probability of following the rule \"win-stay/lose-change\" was approximately 50% initially and did not increase significantly in later sessions. Therefore, it is clear that closely following the \"win-stay/lose-change\" rule is not a prerequisite for the development of a stable cooperative exchange. Explanations in the literature which suggest subjects learn a single rule, i.e., \"win-stay/lose-change,\" are probably misleading since children evidence a variety of rules, any of which might have been reinforced or punished over the course of the experiment.

The primary emphasis of the study was placed on the development of comprehension ability. The results of the study indicated that the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test measures many of the concepts being taught in the schools, and the results of a principal questionnaire, teacher questionnaire, and reading skills questionnaire showed that there are a large number of factors related to student's reading achievement and effective reading programs in school.

        "description":"These two papers were presented at a two-part session on using a competency-based approach to secondary reading teacher preparation. The philosophy and rationale of a performance based approach to reading are discussed by Richard W. Burnett. Competency-based courses in secondary reading are contrasted with such courses in elementary reading and realistic constraints are noted. Thomas R. Schnell identifies essential knowledge areas and teaching skills related to reading for the secondary school classroom teacher and the potential secondary school reading specialist and describes the topics covered in a \"Reading in the Secondary Schools\" methods course for preparing such teachers. The topics of the units of the course are as follows: course orientation and history of reading  instruction; group standardized measurement and evaluation; expectancy and readability; informal reading tests; vocabulary development and word recognition; literal comprehension skills; higher level comprehension skills; study skills; reading in content areas; instructional materials; and organization and management of reading programs. The course format of lecture-reading, performance, and field experience is explained in detail. (MKM)",

        "description":"If motivation to read fails to develop, reading failure is the outcome. All of us have very delicately balanced neural systems for integrating incoming sensory inputs, evaluating their significance in the light of past experience, and storing the learning for future use. Autistic and hyperkinetic children apparently have unbalanced neurological systems. Neurotransmitters from neurons in the hypothalamus located at the base of the brain are important in excitation and inhibition of the nervous system. Different neurotransmitters from neurons in the hypothalamus work on and through the pituitary gland which releases eight hormones manufactured in the hypothalamus into the blood stream. To relate this to motivation, a model describing goal seeking behavior is used. Expectancies  which are important in motivation are built into the sensory integration processing. Sommerhoff's theory of a lambda configuration as the basis for learning is presented and discussed as it applies to motivations and their patterns. Reinforcement and habituation are discussed. Reading teachers need to learn what to do to make reading both a challenge and a task at which students can succeed to utilize the motivation processes. (MKM)",

The study was designed as an inquiry into the first year of a school system's attempt to implement a program of continuous progress for inner-city elementary school students in the city of Chicago. The Continuous Progress Program (CPP) employs the concepts of mastery learning in an individualized instructional setting, based on the following concepts: learning is continuous; skills development proceeds in a spiral sequence; instruction is tailored to the individuals' needs; and each child must have opportunities to experience success. The eight chapters examine such topics as teachers' attitudes toward change; teachers'  perceptions of CPP; administrators' perceptions of CPP; differences between key informant teachers' perceptions of CPP in five categories; classroom management of CPP; individual instruction at Johnson school; and the conclusions and recommendations of this study. At the time of this evaluation, both classroom observations and teacher and administrator interviews revealed the state of implementation to be quite low. (TS)",

A dialect measure was administered to 208 black children and reading test scores were obtained, while teachers were placed in accommodation or interference groups and in teaching style groups. The black artful group had significantly higher reading scores than the interrupting and white liberal  groups, and significantly lower dialect scores than the interrupting and vocabulary groups. There was a significant negative correlation between dialect and reading scores for all groups. Black artful teachers were high on task orientation and mutuality of communication and interrupting teachers were low on both dimensions. (Author/JM)",

Textbooks being used in the average classrooms in the United States today in grades one through six were examined and analyzed to discover the way the two sexes are portrayed and the types of behavior encouraged for each. The major focus of this analysis was textbook illustrations. Three major classifications were used: age, race and sex of individuals portrayed. Illustrations of adults comprise 28% of the pictures in the first grade and 73% in the sixth grades. Eighty-one er cent of the illustrations portrayed whites, while only 8% portray blacks. The percentage of illustrations of females varies by grade level from 32% in the second  grade to only 20% by the sixth grade. The world of boys is shown as one of action and energy; the world of girls is shown as one of passivity, watching, and waiting for boys. While men are shown in over 150 occupational roles, almost all the women in textbooks are housewives. Science was discovered to have the most male oriented tests. Suggestions for what individuals can do about biased textbooks are listed for students, teachers, teacher groups, administrators, and parents and community groups. (MKM)",

Also included in this paper are two studies designed to investigate what, if any, particular factors could be identified which represented a profile useful in developing admissions criteria for E.O.F. students. From the data it was concluded that there are levels in several basic skills areas below which there is little chance that these students can complete a four-year traditional college program. Depending upon base competency  levels for disadvantaged students established at each institution, if students do not possess the necessary minimal skills, they sould be referred to other institutions as well as given some counseling on alternate programs to help them meet their academic, social and employment ambitions.

A criterion-referenced test was developed to test the reading achievement of fourth graders in the areas of word attack skills, comprehension skills, study skills and vocabulary skills. A statewide pilot test of reading was administered in 1974 and in 1975 a full-scale reading assessment was administered to a sample of 25 percent of Oregon's fourth graders. The results indicated that student performance was satisfactory or better on 18 out of 25 reading objectives. Students performed better in the areas of word attack and vocabulary skills than in the areas of comprehension and application-study skills. Groups  which performed above the state average were students who had never failed a grade or been held back, students from the eastern region of the state, girls, and students less then ten years old. Most students who needed assistance in reading were receiving that help. (MKM)",

        "description":"This report is part of an overview of the aspirations, methods, and summary results of associational analyses of Indiana assessment data. The study was based on the recognition of policy makers' needs to understand the causes of existing conditions in their schools and to be able to evaluate compound implications of their actions. A survey data base was used and an effort was made to select variables which corresponded directly to present policy questions and which could be supported by a review of recent literature. Scaling was kept to a minimum and no a priori assumptions were formulated about what analyses might signify. The first section examines the background, purposes, methods, procedures, and major results obtained by a reanalysis of the 1973 assessment data. The major  objectives of this study were to determine which aspects of the instructional process are most effective in increasing reading performance, and which of those important characteristics which govern reading ability could be altered within the context of the educational community. The second section is a summary of preliminary investigations. The third section is a summary of results with the student as the unit of analysis. The fourth section is a summary of results with the school as the unit of analysis. The two attachments include variable definitions and selected references. (TS)",

Secondary purposes were to determine the differences between high, middle, and low aptitude subgroups and between male and female subgroups. During 1973-74, the experimental group of 285 students received WDRSD treatment, and the control group of 220 students did not. During May 1974, all students were given the Short Form Test of Academic Aptitude and the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills to  determine aptitude and achievement. The tests of hypotheses showed no significant difference in reading comprehension, reading vocabulary, and total reading achievement between treatment and control group; and no difference in reading between high, middle, and low aptitude pupils of the two groups. However, in both experimental and control groups, female subgroups surpassed their male counterparts. (Author/TS)",

They also bring the studies of linguistics and neurology together. The purpose of this paper is to relate some of the research that describes language acquisition with the research about the early development of the human brain, particularly the sensory systems that are involved in speech. Three interrelated propositions that are considered are: (1) that structures for speech are genetically transmitted, including distinct cognitive and affective mechanisms in the brain; (2) that critical periods in development render the child susceptible to particular environmental stimulation according to a predictable sequence which peaks and declines;  and (3) that language itself supports and facilitates thought including special learning, and action on objects. These propositions are considered within the chronology of language development, beginning with neonatal response to sound, through sensorimotor integration in infancy, and into the rapid acquisition of propositional language in early childhood.

        "description":"A formulated definition of the term dyslexia is proposed in this paper in order to clarify the semantical confusion which exists among both specialists and the general public. Dyslexia is explained as a generic term for severe and puzzling reading disability, found to be both acute (where reading-age lags 25 percent or more below mental age) and chronic (resistant to treatment). Qualifiers are suggested to more precisely define the term. Specific dyslexia should be used where the intention is to indicate that there is no evidence of complications. Compund dyslexia will have primary (bearing on the origins of the problem) or secondary (resulting from the condition) complicating conditions. Etiological qualifiers should be congenital, suggesting genetic origins; psychoneurotic,  suggesting origins in emotional reactions or distress; and constitutional, suggesting a disability arising from minimal brain damage, chemical imbalance, or constitutional trauma. A hierarchy of terms to describe lack of reading ability is as follows: sub-optimal, disabled, severely disabled, dyslexic, and alexic--a virtual nonreader. A distinction is made between dyslexia and illiteracy. The questionnaire sent to a number of professional educators asking their judgment on the definition of dyslexia is included. (MKM)",

Children's art growth is discussed, and it is argued that dittoed drawings and coloring books are harmful to this growth because they promote a narrow and negative concept of what art is about. Art involves the acquisition of complex perceptual and cognitive skills that are related to skills needed in reading. A study designed to find out how art affected scores of children on the Metropolitan Readiness Tests is described. The findings suggested that children's reading readiness could be improved through art lessons that stressed the inclusion of details. An exemplary art lesson is outlined,  and it is concluded that the visual arts are basic to reading because they develop the ability to differentiate details and to integrate them into progressive orderliness.

A total of 144 bilingual migrant children, aged seven through twelve years, from six summer programs in Colorado were administered the Test of Concept Utilization (TCU) and the Silvaroli Informal Reading Inventory in both Spanish and English on alternate days. The main finding in TCU scores across all ages was that children gave more semantic discrepant responses in English than in Spanish, indicating that children were more fluent in Spanish. For the most part, however, the mean scores for TCU concept categories were the same in Spanish and English. The main reading level in English was approximately three years behind for all ages. Reading in Spanish was  almost nonexistent, with twelve-year-olds (sixth grade students) barely reading at a first grade level. It was essentially impossible to predict reading scores from TCU scores in Spanish because of the low reading ability in Spanish. In English, the concepts of shape and homogeneous function were the most consistent predictors for all age groups. (Author/JM)",

Other conclusions were that a significant proportion of entering students do have functioning levels which warrant the existence of the  remedial-compensatory courses; that students who take one or more skills courses are competitive with students whose placement scores allow them to take college level courses immediately; that success in academic courses is not dependent upon age, ethnic background, major, student type, employment, financial status, or residency, although women students were found to be higher achievers; and that the cost of educating a basic skills student is 62.5% of the college level student instructional cost.

        "description":"This summary contains instructors' discussions of an independent research report which evaluated the compensatory education program at El Paso Community College, Colorado Springs, Colorado. Because of open admissions policies, many students enter this college without the prerequisite basic skills necessary to understand their texts. Over 75% of entering students have been found to need one or more reading courses in order to successfully pursue college-level courses where the textbook may be written at an eleventh to thirteenth grade reading level. Over 35% of the entering students have been found to read at only sixth to eighth grade reading level. Similar deficits are found in English and mathematics. One important conclusion discussed is that students with a need for  compensatory courses do become more competitive in the college level courses after taking skills courses. A random sampling of students who needed but did not take skills courses showed a 73% failure in college freshman English and an 80% failure in a comparable level of math, while those who took skills courses because of their placement scores showed a 29% failure in college English and a 20% failure in math.

        "description":"The \"9 to 90\" Saturday Reading Program sponsored by the Fullerton (California) College Department of Community Services offers individualized reading improvement in hourly sections on Saturday mornings to anyone from ages nine to ninety. Groups of nine to fifteen students meet each hour with teaching teams of three instructors. The groups are divided according to age, with a third each at ages 9-11, 12-17, and 18-70+ years. Entry reading levels range from non-readers to college level and above. Four teaching teams and a support team receive pre- and post-program as well as inservice training on site, through articulation with California State University Fullerton. Results for the three semesters in which the program has operated show reading improvement for over 70% of the  students on standardized reading tests, and for 75-99% on informal tests of sequential comprehension skills. Attitudinal improvement was demonstrated by over 80% of the students and over 80% showed improvement on communication of written thought. All of the teachers involved have rated the program as having high value to them. Community interest remains high, with a waiting list of 300 or more maintained each semester. Materials and tests used for instruction and disgnosis are listed. (Author/MKM)",

Attention to all three aspects (the consolidative, the inervsive, and the prototypic) are in the domain of the theory of ludic modeling. Examined in this paper are various anthropological studies, and Piagetian structural approaches, especially riddles and games. A structural organization of game levels is delineated and includes pastimes, central person games, competive games, and sports. It is concluded that a theory of folklore through ludic models is an effective method of study. (TS)",

The subjects--homogeneous with regard to economic status, heterogeneous in race with non-white subjects distributed across age and sex groups--consisted of 120 children selected from five nursery school day-care centers in Ypsilanti and Ann Arbor, Michigan.

This program presents a variety of instructional options with more personalized learning manuals and a combination of individually paced instruction and conventional instruction. In addition, the program offers many curricular options for composition objectives which complement students' educational goals. Eighteen one-semester credit hour courses are divided into three groups: basic skills education, liberal arts education, and career education. All courses in group 1 are required, and the university's six-hour composition requirement may be completed by a combination of  courses in the second and third groups.

The first part of the paper examines and discusses the decline of English majors, the changing nature of college students, open-admissions, part-time students, adult enrollment, and the difficulty graduates are having finding jobs. The second part of the paper discusses the philosophy of the community college and the three distinct divisions of the community college: the division designed to provide the first two years of baccalaureate study; the career education division, designed offering community interest courses. Community colleges have much experience in dealing with students of all abilities, as well as part-time and adult  students. It is concluded that student bodies at universities and community colleges are beginning to resemble each other and that community college English departments have valuable experience in areas universities must begin to explore.

Four principles of vocabulary development are outlined: language development and vocabulary development are closely related; language development is concept development; vocabulary development is an ongoing process; and vocabulary is the basis for most tests of I.Q. The author argues that vocabulary development takes place in the context of the communication triad: reading and writing, speaking and listening, and visualizing and observing. These language development skills concern all teaching and learning. Such topics are discussed as the utilization of words for communicating, sharing ideas, conceptualizing, comparing, contrasting, classifying, reading, writing, and metaphorizing. Also discussed are learning  techniques; learning roots, prefixes, and suffixes; pronunciation and spelling; mispronunciation; riddles; and slang. (TS)",

They also point to interesting relationships between the structure of children's sentences with logical formatives and that of their negative and interrogative sentences.

A content analysis of drawings indicated colors and settings students &quot;borrowed&quot; from the book and those students used independently. Results showed that children's drawings do give an insight into children's reactions to literature and that age made a difference in children's responses, with  younger children responding more to the tree and older children interpreting the story as an account of people's inhumanity toward themselves.

The VOA's activities during the second world war are discussed, as are postwar activities, the International Broadcasting Foundation Proposal, and the Smith-Mundt Bill passed in 1948. The next section of this monograph discusses the activities of the VOA during the &quot;cold war&quot; years. The next section discusses the activities of the VOA from 1961 to the present. The final section makes conclusions about the VOA: it appears to possess the necessary  flexibility to cope with the changes that are likely to take place in world broadcasting over the next ten or twenty years; and VOA will continue to serve a useful role as a conveyer of life in America to the rest of the world.

The sampling included 192 young persons living in apartment complexes, of whom 109 subscribed to at least one of the two newspapers. The results of the analysis of the factors involved were broken into such categories as readership, education, marital status, occupation, lifestyle, mobility, and media comparisons. From the results it was concluded that more subscribers than nonsubscribers tended to be clustered in the higher socioeconomic group. Occupation together with income and education discriminated better than any of the demographic variables taken separately. Subscribers watched television news more  often than nonsubscribers. Both groups tended to believe that newspapers give the \"clearest understanding\" of state and local politics. It was later discovered that some of the \"nonsubscribers\" were actually subscribers to an afternoon newspaper. The data also suggested that although more than half the sample were newspaper subscribers, they were not traditional subscribers and more research needs to be done on this topic. (TS)",

        "description":"In the years 1942-1957, the Post Office Department used controls on the low mailing rate as a form of administrative censorship, designed to limit the distribution of periodicals which it could not otherwise restrict. The Classification Act of 1879 imposed four conditions for admission to the second-class rate three of which were physical requirements, and one of which considered content. Several cases of second-class permit revocation, including that of the socialist &quot;Leader&quot; in 1917, demonstrate how these conditions were a form of censorship. Revocations were informal, and obscenity was determined mostly by visual inspection until 1940. Much of the change in postal policy came about when Frank Walker became Postmaster in 1940. One of the magazines censored by the Post Office  Department at this time was &quot;Esquire.&quot; The &quot;Esquire&quot; case and several other revocation cases suggest that control over second-class privileges was a powerful and much abused weapon in the hands of the Post Office Department, employed to apply economic sanctions against publications.

        "description":"This paper discusses reasons why few journalism professors are personally confronting the news media with criticism or praise. One of the primary reasons for this is that journalism professors may fear retribution or keep inbred ties with the media or be following academic tradition. A survey was conducted in Spring 1975 for this report. The survey was sent to the chairpersons of departments listed in the &quot;Journalism Educator&quot; directory issue. Some of the major questions asked were: &quot;What does your department do in the area of media criticism? Do you monitor the media in some regular way? and do you cooperate with the media in some sort of critical evaluation service?&quot; The survey located few professors personally confronting the mass media. Some of the activities reported by the  departments included contests and journalism reviews. Only one case where professors took a direct and active position in media criticism was found in the survey. It is argued that there may be lessons to be learned from the way journalism departments relate to high schools and to community colleges. (TS)",

The study found the following: a significant decrease in the number of teachers who have assignments which include speech and in the number of teachers who majored or minored in speech, in spite of an increase in language arts teachers; increases in the  number of assignments held by speech majors that include English and in the number of speech assignments held by English majors; and a need to investigate further the significant increase in the employment of teachers who earned their bachelor's degree outside of Michigan.

In choosing and displaying news, editors, newsroom staff, and broadcasters play an important part in shaping political reality. Readers learn not only about a given issue, but also how much importance to attach to that issue from the amount of information in a news story and its position, thus the term agenda-setting. Agenda-setting applies to more than one area of research. To explicate the theory, four topics are considered: the general hypothesis of agenda-setting, the importance of the general hypothesis, the functional aspect of the general hypothesis, and the effects aspect of the general hypothesis. While this review indicates the potential value of agenda-setting theory, it also raises some  issues concerning the theory and its research. (RB)",

At present, however, the Federal Communication Commission's operational definition of the term &quot;public access&quot; is limited to the single act of opening a channel at the head end of all CTV systems. A rich future of creative human interactions through enlarged channel activity is possible only if there are human receivers in the system and if a portion of the public is skilled in producing quality video programing material. The education industry, especially teachers and civil liberations, must play a major role in defining  public access. Educators and others can influence the wiring of new cable systems and speech teachers can increase their students' familiarity with video equipment and with ways to use it to communicate. (JM)",

The following definition of rhetorical validity is proposed: an argument is valid when, in an adversarial situation, the degree of certainty claimed by (or for) a conclusion is less than or equal to that established by its related supporting proof. This definition is based on the following terms and relationships which are consistent with contemporary usage: claims are modified by implicit or explicit qualifiers, claims are drawn from a context in which both favorable and unfavorable evidence resides, and claims should not be considered as valid if they assert a greater probability than is identifiable via scrutiny of the argumentative context. The paper then seeks  to establish both empirical and critical procedures for aPplying validity tests to the wide spectrum of nondeductive arguments. A list of references is included. (JM)",

Cognitive Style Mapping is a diagnostic procedure. It is designed to determine how people derive meaning from the world around them, specifically how individuals encode, process and decode meanings.

It is designed to measure the gain or growth of an individual's knowledge, learning skills, or abilities, rather than measuring individual differences in relation to a group.

Subjects, 196 students enrolled in a basic speech communication course, completed the Mach scale and the 140-item Interpersonal Behavior Inventory Form which yields measures of fifteen personality variables. The fifteen scores, Mach scores, final exam score, and final course grade were analyzed by correlation and multiple regression analysis.

Charged with improving communication among work groups and hierarchical levels, the group was developed and maintained according to boundary and relationship concepts from open systems theory. It represented a microcosm of the system in which it worked, addressed problems raised by both employees and management; assisted in a survey feedback intervention; and survived concerns raised by the union, middle management, and leadership succession at the top of the organization. There is evidence that it substantially facilitated communication about difficult issues  within the organizations, earned more confidence from employees and management, and improved its own functioning over time. At the same time, the intervention was experienced as quite stressful and conflictful for all parties participating, including top management, consultants, communication group members, and other organization members whose work experiences were influenced by the group.
