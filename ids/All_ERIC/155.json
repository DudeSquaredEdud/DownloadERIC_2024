A 39-item form was administered to students of 18 instructors both at the beginning and the end of a semester course. Results were analyzed both by factor analysis and multiple discriminant analyses and the dimensions emerging were compared with those reported in an earlier study. Structure, skill and rapport seemed to be the dimensions common to the 2 studies. The differences between the results of multiple discriminant analysis and factor analysis point to differences between student stereotypes of teacher behavior and differences between  teachers. Both analyses provide useful information, but for uses in which the primary concern is to compare one teacher with another, the dimensions derived by multiple discriminant analyses seem likely to be more useful.

The problem is that of accommodating the numbers of students for whom a higher education must be provided at the lowest cost to the taxpayer. It will be enormously costly for the State to provide the needed student spaces if the private institutions are forced to close their doors or be absorbed into the State structure. To alleviate this problem, a long-term and a short-term plan have been devised. The long-term plan should be phased in over 3 to 4 years. It consists briefly of the following: (1) public institutions should extend user charges to cover the full educational costs, including instructional expense and student-related expenses, for those who can afford to pay; and (2) at the same time, the scholar  incentive program should be expanded to the point that, for students with the greatest need, it covers full user charges. The short-term plan allows for immediate implementation of the long-term plan and also includes provisions for financial aid to the private institutions in need. (HS)",

Findings show that consortia weaknesses stem from lack of adequate base financing, inadequate organization and top-level leadership, and lack of strong institutional commitment to the idea of cooperative programs. Notable exceptions to this finding occurred particularly where the consortium concentrated its efforts on 1 or 2 major program activities. Community participation in the programs and in the decisionmaking processes of a consortium also proved highly desirable.  (HS)",

In departments in which control was distributed in an hierarchical fashion, a negative relationship occurred between total control in the department and output.

In any event, educational institutions have found themselves accountable in manifold ways to the agencies of state government. As private colleges and universities secure state support, they too will find themselves publicly accountable. And as federal support of higher education grows,  both public and private institutions will find themselves increasingly accountable to the federal departments that administer the funds as well as to the state agencies through which they are channeled.

        "description":"In 1944 Congress passed a bill familiarly known as the World War II G.I. Bill. This piece of legislation enabled World War II veterans to continue their college educations at the institutions of their choice. Since that time, various other bills have been passed enabling ex-G.I.'s to further their educations. Now the country is faced with the return of Vietnam veterans, and the major problem confronting them is a financial one. College costs have at least tripled (300%) in the last 25 years in 90% of our colleges, and federal support of veterans has increased only about 30%. Because present veteran benefits only cover approximately 40% of college expenses, Congress is urged to increase federal support sufficiently to provide the veteran a wider choice of colleges. This could be  achieved either by an increase of 50% or more in educational assistance payments to the veteran himself or by a tuition payment of $1,000 or 75% of tuition, whichever is lesser, directly to the college. This report reviews the above issues and contains a 15 page supplement which compares the 1947-48 enrollments in U.S. independent colleges and universities with 1971-72 enrollments. (HS)",

The following goals have been established for education within the Army: (1) All commissioned officers are to have baccalaureate degrees and 20 percent of all career commissioned officers are to have graduate degrees. (2) All career warrant officers are to have associate degrees before they reach 15 years' service. (3) All enlisted men are to have a high school  education as soon as possible after entering the service, and career N.C.O's are encouraged to complete 2 years' college equivalent study before reaching 15 years' service.

Most cost evaluations have, up to now, revolved about operational costs such as those associated with instruction and plant operation. However, newer evaluations are centering on program quality and effectiveness. In this sense community college self-scrutiny moves from evaluation to accountability. This involves a complex, time-consuming, on-going, and multi-faceted process. Studies based on this process are needed to reaffirm legislator faith in higher education. Carnegie Commission guidelines can be the evaluation criteria by which a legislature assesses its state's post-secondary educational system. Restrictive measures  imposed by state government can possibly infringe upon the autonomy of the college. Not all accountability methodologies are suitable for every community college, but when possible they should be used in conjunction with long range planning. The public, throught its legislators, demands evidence of community college effectiveness and efficiency. The careful matching of appropriate goals and objectives for individual community colleges and their different programs along with relevant evaluation and accountability methods can meet that demand.

Recently, 2-year colleges have changed status and are now identified with higher education making them eligible for federal funding. This study looks at the legislative activity of the 1950's and 60s pertaining to the 2-year college as well as examining this past year's congressional activity. Noteable enactments are the National Defense Education Act of 1958, Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963, Vocational Education Act of 1963 and the Higher Education Act of 1965. The projected Higher Education Act of 1971 has the potential of elaborating the role of government as a  supportive agent of higher education. Presently, both houses of Congress have passed bills to provide more substantial operating support to 2-year colleges. Although the two bills must be compromised before final approval can be given, what remains important is that legislators have come to realize the significance and dynamics of the 2-year institution.

The results of a survey examining the extent to which public 2-year colleges are  conforming to this ideal model indicated that almost all 2-year colleges fulfill the guidance and counseling standard, but little over half of the colleges have the curricular offerings and admission policies expected of public 2-year colleges.

To meet stated goals, two basic departures from the usual academic practice were (1) to hire a minimum of line administrators, and (2) to abandon subject area departments and organization. Faculty and students were organized into &quot;college groups&quot; for administrative purposes. Within the cluster arrangement each faculty member in the group has responsibility for each student assigned to that group. Opportunity exists for individual clusters to evolve their own identity and uniqueness. An Administrative Council comprised of Deans of Faculties, Student Personnel and Business Affairs advises the President. The college groups  under the leadership of the Council constitute the core of the college. The cluster system permits each student to choose the way he learns as well as what courses he takes. Non-punitive grading is achieved by relinquishing &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; grades and allowing students to complete courses on their own time table. To allow for more courses and flexible scheduling, a quarter system is planned for 1972-73 school calendar.

Only four state constitutions contain significant references to 2-year colleges: two contain provisions for financing them and two  provide for the creation of statewide systems. Statutory analysis revealed that 40 states provide for public 2-year colleges. Control, concept, establishment procedures, and financing differ greatly among the states, but trends are noted. For analysis of operational differences, questionnaires were mailed to 237 public 2-year colleges in 22 states representing six legal structures. The returns and data were anlyzed and reported. On the basis of these analyses, it was concluded that marked differences among such legal structures do exist. (Author/AL)",

An in-service and a resident group were served. Sixty persons were involved in the in-service portion that consisted largely of a 2-week conference. The 26 individuals in the resident portion also participated in the 2-week conference, but continued for a year of full-time study at the university structured like an actual or potential junior college career field. Precise objectives specified for the in-service phase were: (1) improve participant competency in his specialty, (2) increase specialist-role awareness in the junior college scheme, (3) create appreciation for the junior  college's expanding role, (4) encourage people knowledgeable about junior colleges to return to them and provide leadership, and (5) prepare some to lead in the development and operation of educational programs for the disadvantaged. The specific objectives for the resident phase included the above and the development of (1) leaders to solve Southeastern junior college problems, and (2) a procedure to maximize junior college leadership. Project organization, planning, and implementation to achieve these objectives are discussed, as well as the evaluation of the outcomes.

        "description":"This issue on the general planning of vocational-technical education emphasizes that education for employment should be the main purpose of the educational enterprise, and that junior colleges should occupy a dominant position in this preparation. Vocational education was conceived of as part of the total educational structure and vocational theorists have never thought of it in any other way. It should be offered as an alternative to the \"go-to-college\" concept that has been so over-sold as to be taken for granted. The college preparatory program in high school and community college is probably the greatest farce ever. There can be no dichotomy between the general goals of education and vocational training. More and more the terms vocational education and occupational education  are being used synonymously. This should not create confusion as both indicate preparation for the world of work. Toward the end of the 1950s a number of regional conferences directed attention to post-secondary vocational education programs. These national studies showed that the vocational needs of people are a high-priority issue. The role of the junior college in meeting these needs has been clear over the past decade, but the junior college has been slow to accept its responsibility. Career education is a national goal with high priority but it can not be achieved unless junior colleges offer more options and seek greater inter-cooperation. (Author/AL)",

        "description":"Hypotheses generated from organization theory stated that if the primary responsibilities in decision making shifted in either direction between faculty and administrators, there would be a resultant change in their organizational environment. In this paper six community colleges were analyzed for change in organizational structure after the institution had been subjected to external forces resulting from the onset of collective negotiations. Representatives from the administration and the faculty (union activists, union members, and anti- or non-union members) responded to a pretested interview schedule. This resulted in data being developed for four bureaucratic indices on 15 items relating to academic matters and faculty welfare. The findings revealed a democratizing of the  organization and, at the same time, a formalizing of the bureaucracy. However, few changes occurred in the academic area after negotiations were concluded, although many gains were realized with regard to faculty welfare. Statistical analysis of the data revealed significant differences in many areas and thus it was concluded that the underlying hopotheses were generally confirmed. (Author/AL)",

Problems encountered in MBO programs include: lack of total organizational commitment, lack of prerequisites to implementation, failure to integrate individual and organizational goals, overemphasis on measurable goal attainment, and inadequacies in performance appraisal. To be most effective in community colleges, MBO must have the total  backing of board members and the president. Furthermore, the school must be prepared to commit extra time to implement MBO. The major determinant of the success or failure of MBO type programs is largely a result of its acceptance by users. (LP)",

Measures of effectiveness of instruction were also explored with particular attention to measures appropriate for a quantitative analysis. Criteria for a useful measure of effectiveness were specified and use of measurement of population saturation, achievement, and social benefits were examined.

While the computer can play an increasingly more vital role in facilitating reference searches of large literature collections, experience shows that manual searching gives the user skills and expertise that are essential to effectively use the computerized system. Several tools are available to aid in manually searching for information stored in ERIC files. These are: (1) Research in Education (RIE), composed of a series of document resumes and subject, author, and institution indexes; (2) Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE) containing coverage of 530 publications representing the core periodical literature in education; and (3) the Thesaurus of ERIC Descriptors with its  vocabulary used for indexing the various documents, projects, and journal articles entered into the ERIC information system. A subject search of the ERIC file requires three major steps: (1) establish a clear and concise statement of the problem or information need; (2) follow the two sequential procedures for manually searching the subject index; and (3) review the document resumes and article citations located in the subject index. Search strategies using the computer still require the use of principal ERIC tools, but in magnetic tape form. Whether manual or computerized searches are undertaken it will be necessary for users to ultimately seek actual documents in libraries or order them from ERIC. (Author/AL)",

The number of students over age 23 is increasing because of more leisure time, rising standards of living, increasing interest in education, and demands for specific job training and re-training. This study focuses on adult women students, defined as women over 25 years old, enrolled in credit courses at the four campuses of Santa Fe Junior College in Florida in the Fall of 1970. First, existing literature on adult women students is reviewed. The second part reports on the results of the questionnaire (a copy is appended) which gathered information on the students' age, marital status, number of children, race, educational interests, outside work, purpose in attending college,  problems in attending college, relationship with other students, extra-curricular activities, attitudes toward Santa Fe, and knowledge of and use of services at the college. Sixty-nine percent of the 285 women who received the questionnaire responded; the 285 comprised 13.3 percent of the full-time enrollment. While few generalizations were made about the respondents as a group, the report concludes that many adult women students have special needs and problems that the college could better serve with changes in scheduling and credit arrangements, special orientation programs, and counseling.

A basic assumption of the Center is that it must be a cooperative effort of  KSTC staff and Kansas community college personnel. Because of an emphasis on flexibility of scheduling and the need for student on-the-job experience in the community college, a competency-base module approach was adopted. Objectives and tasks were identified so that students attending the Center would know exactly what was expected of them. For example, future community college teachers are expected to be competent in their teaching field, have knowledge of various teaching-learning strategies, understand the needs and characteristics of junior college students, and know the philosophy and functions of community colleges.

Sophisticated cost analysis and possible income were not considered to be major objectives of the project; thus, some study information is somewhat superficial and poorly documented. The basic goal was service to the UCR campus clientele. Some of the problems are a result of resistance from within the organization both by users through fear of failure and expense and by the administration in their inability to provide adequate staff and  funding. In spite of these problems, a working system for both &quot;CA&quot; and &quot;CT&quot; tape services has been developed, and some experience and expertise in profiling and teaching methods, and a growing number of satisfied users have been gained.

Additional recommendations are as follows: (1) the authors of educational and cultural books should be Africans; (2) the first language to be promoted should be African; (3) the content of books should be in  line with the actual needs of the users; (4) priorities in book printing should be based on the urgency of the needs in general education and literacy work, and of those already gainfully employed and (5) printing techniques should come up to the user's requirements while remaining as inexpensive as possible.

SPIRES has two major goals: to provide a user-oriented, interactive, on-line retrieval system for a variety of researchers at Stanford; and to support the automation efforts of the university libraries by developing and implementing common software. SPIRES I, a prototype system, was implemented at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in 1969, from a design based on a 1967 information study involving physicists at SLAC. Its primary data base is a high-energy-physics preprints file. Evaluation of SPIRES I resulted in the definition of a production information storage and  retrieval system, SPIRES II. This system will be available daily, beginning in mid-1972, to faculty, staff, and students of the University. It is characterized by flexibility, simplicity, and economy. SPIRES II will operate on-line on an IBM 360/67 computer. This report summarizes the uses of the SPIRES I system over the past year and describes both the nature of SPIRES II and this system's development over the past year. (Author)",

The index provides the necessary linkage between a multiplicity of sources and a single receiver. Whether considering the source/document-space interface or the query/index interface, the elements of the underlying communication phenomena are the same: sets of documents, sets of attributes, and sets of relations expressing a connection between documents and attributes. The essential operation of the indexing system is the creation of a representation of the document space. The analysis -- document transformations and the final index-query transformations are shown to be, respectively, a prerequisite to, and function of, the document space  representation. The operating characteristics of the indexing system are modeled by means of the index space. From a different point of view, the concept of error, organization, information and search are introduced through a consideration of the indexing process as a thermodynamic system. Thus, indexing is viewed as an order-increasing operation that identifies common data elements and relations between data elements present in the input document stream. (Author/MM)",

        "description":"John Cory speaking at a conference on library networks identified four generations of library organization, each achieving increasing levels of capacity, effectiveness, complexity and versatility and decreasing unit cost. The four generations are: (1) A single library of a single type - a public, college, school or special library; (2) A system or network of several libraries of the same type (such as a public library system); (3) A combination of several library systems or several libraries of different types and (4) A combination of various types of libraries and non-library agencies concerned with related activities. This paper is concerned with the third generation which represents the growing edge of librarianship today, that is, with state and regional networks combining  resources of several types of libraries. It is based largely upon reports from the states on their administration of the Library Services and Construction Act, filed with the Bureau of Libraries and Education Technology of the United States Office of Education and on information received directly from state library agencies.

Adding new ingredients to the communications mix has a strong catalytic effect, releasing powerful forces which churn up established and long-stable policy matters, raising new questions and reopening old ones. This paper examines those regulatory, technical, and program developments which are a part of the &quot;shake-up in telecommunications,&quot; and explores their implications for those planning library and other&quot;public-service oriented&quot; communications networks. Such consideration must include recent and proposed changes in Federal Communications Commission rules and procedures; plans for new commercial special service common carrier networks; the predicted evolution of CATV into a national system of broadband cable communications; and developments in the satellite field In addition, it is important to see that other public and semi-public agencies are interested in network development and to explore what opportunities for cooperative effort and mutual benefits may exist.

Except for a small section of international library cooperation the concentration is on cooperation among public, state, special, academic, and federal libraries of the U.S.A. The efforts of library professional organizations to promote library cooperation are also covered. The entire paper is divided into two parts: cooperation by type of library organization and cooperation by function, and in each part the major problems are briefly identified. Within each topic references are made to major works treating the particular topic, and a complete citation is included in the working bibliography. Because of the need to limit  treatment of this subject, developments in cooperation among school libraries, among federal departmental libraries, between libraries and the book trade, and between libraries and the indexing and abstracting services are not treated. This paper also does not discuss contributions towards standardization, such as the ANSI Committees Z39 and PH5, despite its fundamental position in support of the development of interlibrary services and systems.

This record must be minimally capable of serving the needs of libraries, information centers, abstracting and indexing services, and national and trade bibliographies. What is proposed is a centralized National Bibliographic Service (NBS) composed of component institutions functioning as a unified whole. The authors assume the existence of a national network, with appropriate telecommunications. The intent is to demostrate the need for a centrally processed bibliographic record, to consider standardization requirements for such a record, and to point up the results of failing to  provide this record.

Nonprint materials are defined as those materials not totally dependent on the printed word for meaning. Nonprint materials were further identified as storage devices for information or experiences--these devices can be handled in information centers, or libraries, in a manner like all other informational units. Following the definition of nonprint materials is a discussion of the concept of a library or information resource center. The types of libraries holding nonprint materials are listed and ways or reasons for their further sharing of materials discussed. Specific potential problems faced in the path leading to full use of  nonprint resources are presented with potential solutions. The major portion of the paper discusses the technical aspects of nonprint materials retrieval and display as well as remote transmission of information. The paper is closed by a brief review of current significant developments in the media field that are destined to have an impact on library science or the use of information.

The querist, who originates a question of concern to him, is part of this network too. The question of primary concern in this paper is the trade-off between turn-around time (response time) and quality of the response. Small response time and high quality of the response both contribute to total benefit; also to total cost. A key factor determining both response time and quality is the quality  of the directories available to the various referential consultants in the organization that services queries. A directory, exemplified by the &quot;Yellow Pages&quot;, or a library catalog, points its user to the optional library resources and colleagues among which he makes choices. To design a referential consulting network is to; (1) select the number and kinds of referential consultants; (2) specify the directories which characterize each unit; (3) specify the way these units are interconnected.

CATV holds promise for fulfilling this need because of its broad-band multi-channel capability. CATV can be thought of as having two basic functions. i.e., retransmitting TV programs, and initiating its own programs and services. With regard to the former, whether retransmitting local or distant signals there is currently no copyright liability. Pending legislation would impose copyright liability on the retransmission of distant signals, at least. Regardless of the CATV role as a retransmitter, insofar as self-initiated services are concerned it is in no better position than any other broadcaster, from a copyright standpoint. Accordingly, the information  industry must learn to live with the copyright system if it is going to supply copyrighted material by CATV. It would behoove them to work within the system. To try to fight it at this point would be useless and not availing. (Other papers from this conference are available as LI 003360 - 003372 and LI 003374 through LI 003390) (Author)",

In some cases the decision will involve comparison of alternatives with outcomes that involve the behavioral responses of users to the system, and these responses may be difficult to measure. In other cases outcomes may only be predictable on a probabilistic basis. In all cases the decision maker needs a systematic way of expressing his values in the form of tradeoffs among the outcome dimensions. A decision framework that encompasses all of these issues is presented along with an example of its application to a hypothetical decision problem for a library system involving a  tradeoff between communication line costs and user terminal costs.

Administrative implications are the complicated accessing, indexing and control procedures required, but these are accompanied by a decentralized utilization pattern with greater total system reliability. In order to facilitate the use of mixed media in networking  functions four recommendations are made: (1) for improved standard-setting procedures; (2) for new research and subsidy in the areas of interface devices, the design of media bibliographic tools, and in review of experience gained during the picturephone development; (3) for subsidy of a national system of regional network depositories and (4) for subsidy of selected dual publication ventures assuring input of machine readable and accessible materials at the source, and for demonstrations of such materials in use.

        "description":"The function of libraries is to make it easy for the people in their community to obtain information from other people or environments that may be distant is space, time or imagination. To perform this function libraries require communication media. Storage media are essential, but duplication and transmission media can improve the service of libraries. Libraries differ from other communication institutions in that they serve as agents for the receivers of information rather than for producers or distributors. Technological changes happening concurrently with social changes make libraries the logical institution to develop and manage the 'education delivery systems' that the society requires. Expansion of duplication media in libraries and library-client transmission media should  be given higher priority than library-library transmission media. Cable television is likely to provide an excellent medium for library networks. Six key issues in network analysis are: Who is to be connected? Is it primarily a means of transportation, duplication or transmission? What information will be available? Will the network be shared or dedicated? What distribution of power does the network require? Should it be centralized or decentralized?

With the exception of some privately owned systems, broadband services have been furnished by the common carriers. Recently, a new element has been added--Cable Antenna Television (CATV) distribution systems. The &quot;excess&quot; channels available in CATV systems are seen as an answer for the demand for capacity to transmit large amounts of information. There are some difficulties in utilizing CATV systems as currently configured for two-way communications, but the difficulties seem small when compared to the tremendous benefits which can and should accrue from the interaction of broadband communications and advanced terminal developments.&quot;Interested publics&quot; should watch closely telecommunications developments--particularly regulatory developments--to attempt to escape mistakes of the past, and to ensure close coupling between communications innovations and their beneficial use.

        "description":"From the standpoint of information network technology there is a necessary emphasis upon compatibility requirements which, in turn, will be met at least in part by various techniques of achieving convertibility --- between machine and machine, between man and machine, and between man and man. It may be hoped that improved compatibilities between machines and between men and machines will lead to more effective man-to-man communications. In general, the compatibility problems in network planning and implementation are those of interface and interchange. These problems are not new. If an information management system is defined as emphasizing not only listing or retrieval by category but also the explicit identification of the individual record (including information on its  location and availability) and as providing individual record retrievability, then, again, the interfacing problems are not new. However, at least two major factors are new: (1) the formalization of information exchange networks and (2) the emergence of the teleprocessing technology, the &quot;marriage&quot; of computers and communications.

        "description":"Legal and contractual aspects of networks are reviewed from a lay practitioner's viewpoint. The legal basis for establishment of networks determines the authorization to enter into contracts, receive and convey funds, cross state lines, etc. Existing state laws (or lack of appropriate state laws) hinder development of networks by the process of interlocking agreements among existing institutions. Enabling federal legislation creating networks does not clarify legal identity or authority of such networks in relation to state or host institution laws or regulations. Once networks are established, the administrators are faced with legal interpretations pertaining to operations. The composition and nature of contracts with participants are not uniform and are often vague and lack  clarity. Legal interpretation pertaining to ownership and use of information banks within networks present administrative problems. The contractual interfacing of networks for extension of services or resources is difficult within the present confusion of legal jurisdiction and authority of networks. Suggestion for needed action consider a legal review of existing laws, a recodification or a national network law, and a &quot;standardized&quot; contract format.

The importance of study committees, both for making sound plans and involving library and state leadership at the earliest stage in the implementation process is emphasized. The first action step is to finance the network plan through the legislative or the appropriation route or both. The next step is to plan and activate regional or state networks through the participation of informed librarians and lay people at both regional and state levels. The paper concludes the network implementation process by describing briefly the types of regional and state networks in New York State, the means whereby different levels of government  and different types of libraries are brought together to form the networks, and the programs offered by them. A summary of network trends in New York State concludes the first section. The remainder of the paper identifies some of the key problems confronting network planners at three different stages: financing of networks; planning their implementation; and organizing and operating them. Solutions to the problems are suggested. (Other papers from this conference are available as LI 003360 - 003381 and LI 003383 through LI 003390) (Author/NH)",

We are not dealing with a simple difference of degree but, rather a difference of kind. It is always tempting to try to gain reassurance by pointing out similarities between an innovation and our accustomed way of doing things, but it is false reassurance when we are faced with a change in kind and still act as though we were in complete continuity with the past. The major contribution to the history and philosophy of science made in the last ten years is that science is not an unbroken, steady  accumulation of knowledge that continuously adds to our understanding of natural phenomena.

In fact, the organization could wake up one day and find all of its objectives met by other means, when its last cooperative act would be to vote itself out of existence. Indeed, some members would define FAUL as an unincorporated group of people bound together by a Constitution, By-Laws, prior investment and an uneasy feeling that money and time devoted to the enterprise could be spent better at home.

Each characteristic is examined in detail. The task of managing library networks involving a variety of types of  institutions is an uncharted area.

There also exists a strong, closely knit special library profession, managing to serve as storehouses of the information-data banks (law books) and as a bibliographic network. Nevertheless, the potential of the computer to introduce thoroughness, accuracy and speed to the manipulation of legal data and sophisticated communication devices to expedite access and thereby utilization of data hold genuine excitement for those who think and talk of networks.

Various information system models may be identified, such as the discipline-oriented, the field-oriented, and the problem-oriented. The Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) is an example of a field-oriented system, and the major portion of this paper is devoted to discussion of its objectives, accomplishments, and failures. ERIC has been successful in fulfilling objectives of: (l) collecting, abstracting, indexing, and making available the significant literature in the field of education, and (2) preparing reviews  and syntheses to place the literature in perspective. A third purpose has remained largely unfulfilled; that is, bringing the ERIC knowledge base to the attention of practitioners. The decisions to model ERIC services after a traditional scientific information storage and retrieval system and the large reliance on microfiche to make information available to users are questioned. Alternate procedures are suggested and outlined. (NH)",

The primary objective for this first year descriptive phase was to determine if the teaching staff could work productively with six pupils who presented a wide range of clinical, family and learning problems. The staff included a head teacher, an aide, a volunteer (none of whom had special education training), and a clinical psychologist. The program was organized around 3 structural groupings: (1) total group activities, to create group cohesion and improve social skills; (2) sub-group activities, designed around level of motor abilities and communication skills; and (3) individual therapy,  for perceptual-motor development, communication skills, social and emotional problems. Parent involvement and home visits were integral parts of the program. It was concluded that the staff worked effectively with the children since all children improved to some degree in the basic skill. Nearly all the parents were able to change their attitudes and behavior towards their atypical child. The document includes details of staff roles, case studies, classroom settings, meals, follow-up activities, and future placement information. (Author/AJ)",

One specially designed observational system consisted of 28 categories of social skills under six headings and permitted viewer behavior to be recorded on a reasonably low level of abstraction. However, the observational system lends itself to a variety of alternative forms of classification and data analysis. Results from first use of this observational scheme indicate that televiewing in the mobile classroom contributed to the development of social skills assumed important in the learning process within a socially structured environment. Another specially  designed observational technique evaluated the effect of individual programs in encouraging a viewer's overt reactions during a telecast. Eight paraprofessionals observed and coded the responses of 270 children to suggestions made by the television &quot;teacher.&quot; Coding was done at 5-minute intervals on a rotated, random schedule over 133 programs.

The specific behavior studied was that of taking-turns in situations where mutual assistance was necessary in order for either of two children to receive prizes. The four training paradigms were: (1) reinforcement treatment--children took turns in helping each other get prizes, the reward being one child received a prize on each trial, as well as verbal approval; (2) modeling treatment--children observed adult models taking-turns in getting prizes; (3) rule conformity treatment--the experimenter labeled turn-taking, explained how to take-turns, and instructed the children to take-turns; and (4) the cooperation  treatment--this emphasized \"No one gets prizes unless you help each other\" and \"If you take-turns, you will both get prizes.\" The subject were 69 matched pairs of 4- or 5-year-old children randomly selected for five two-person games during four experimental sessions on four days. The effectiveness of the training was measured by the degree to which it was transferred to new situations. Analysis of the data collected show that teaching a concept of cooperation (prizes can be obtained only by taking turns) was the only method that consistently led to more cooperative interaction in new situations.

A pilot study helped establish puzzles and procedures for the main experiment. In this experiment, each child played the Make-a-Picture Game. He indicated his comprehension of cues played on an audio flashcard by  placing puzzle pieces correctly into a frame. The alternative approach required the child to mark a picture in a workbook corresponding to audio flashcard cues. Criterion tests of listening comprehension and activity preference indicated that children showed no preference for an educational game over an instructional program and both groups of children made significant gains on pretest-posttest measures of language comprehension. The investigators conclude that the number of subjects was not large enough to provide a satisfactory test of the hypotheses. (WY)",

        "description":"Effects of lower versus middle class parental occupation, verbal intelligence, and action content of pictured stimuli upon nonverbal serial recall were investigated in white first-graders attending a semi-rural elementary school in southeastern Michigan. Forty lower class and 20 middle class children, (half boys and half girls) were grouped on the basis of sex, social class membership and scores on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. Children were given two trials and asked to recall a sequence of three color photographs out of six from each of four arrays following a 15-second delay between them during which photographs were reshuffled. Arrays consisted of (1) static objects (comb, zipper, glass of milk, guitar, steering wheel, hammer), (2) static objects-in-action (manipulated  by hands ), (3) activities (push, pull, lift something , run, jump, hang on the bars), and (4) faces (angry, happy, scared, sad, sleepy, stubborn). Occupation-intelligence yielded no main effects. Recall was higher for pictured static objects than for actions, and for objects in action than for faces and activities. A class-intelligence interaction with action content supported the underlying cognitive-developmental theory, while suggesting that intelligence is a better predictor than occupation in a small integrated community. Assumptions about encoding processes were explored using children's verbal and action labeling plus verbal report. (Author/WY)",

Some major approaches used in these projects and problems related to early intervention are examined. Head Start and Montessori programs are omitted. Strategies utilized in the programs discussed involve making use of health personnel; emphasize the importance of parent participation; develop competence in parents and thereby enhance their self-image, which in turn causes them to become more sensitive and responsive to the children's needs. Strategies that focus on preparing children for effective participation in the elementary grades are those concerned with neurological organization (large motor training, visuo-motor and perceptual  training, oral language training, and packaged programs). Approaches to learning concern the roles of motivation, operant conditioning, immediate reinforcement, and tutoring. The proper time to begin intervention is stated as being before the birth of the baby. Problems related to the design and the evaluation of intervention programs are discussed. To develop effective educational strategies, a number of theoretical and practical problems should be carefully explored. A series of operational intervention centers should be established, and these would feed information into a central agency designed to evaluate strategies and formulate policies for a national program.

In addition, some research was conducted. The demonstration portion of the leadership training program essentially provided for two basic classes of 16 three- and four-year-old preschool disadvantaged children. Research was conducted to determine (1) At what age is intervention most effective? (2) What kind of intervention is most effective? (3) How long should special intervention be continued? and (4) Can a structured program be implemented by paraprofessionals in the home or in a classroom setting? Research findings were utilized in determining the teaching strategies and the curriculum content used in the demonstration classes. The  Karnes, or Ameliorative, Curriculum was the basic curriculum used, and the Karnes program for working with parents was also an integral part of the program. The demonstration classes served the trainees in the following ways: (1) observation of disadvantaged children; (2) practicum in teaching the disadvantaged; (3) development of lesson plans and instructional materials; (4) administration of tests; (5) utilization of ancillary personnel; (6) record keeping; (7) studies as part of coursework; (8) working with parents; (9) interpreting the program; (10) use of instructional models; and (11) observation of application of research findings.

Data was collected from 70 kindergarten and first grade classrooms involved 7 different experimental programs and including 2 comparison (control) classrooms. The primary instrument used to measure teacher classroom management was organized around the concepts of the teacher's methods of control, the pupils' responses to these methods, and the emotional climate as represented by the expression of affect. Another instrument was used by observers to record teaching activities in terms of their agreement with practices espoused by Dewey. Data were submitted to factor analysis. Findings suggest that the teacher who feels pressure to give  pupils greater freedom may minimize both structure and control by reacting to her own discomfort in ways that do not support pupil growth. It appears that greater degrees of direction and structure are associated with greater amounts of growth in the simple cognitive objective, but greater amounts of freedom and pupil self-direction are associated with more complex abstract kinds of growth. With these disadvantaged children, negative affect seems to have little impact, while positive affect is related to cognitive growth. (Author/AJ)",

Subjects (black and white) included 26 boys and 35 girls ranging in age from 3 1/2 to 5 years. The subjects were shown twelve videotaped scenes each containing two children and one teacher--the children being of the same sex but of different race. Eight of the twelve scenes depicted one child with an instrumental problem--the other with an affective  problem. The other four scenes were conflict scenes depicting two children both trying to get control of the same toy. After showing each scene the subject was asked to state which child the teacher would help. Findings indicate that neither the teacher's race nor the race or sex of the child helped influence a child's perception of his nursery school teacher.

The study was intended to test Zajonc's (1965) social facilitation hypothesis that the presence of others as spectators or as coactors enhances the emission of dominant responses, and Berlyne's arousal-reinforcement theory (1967), which implies that the affective consequences of a stimulus will be dependent upon prior level of arousal, Teacher ratings identitied mutual friendships between like-sex children, and these children were paired in the experimental room. Electrodes attached to the fingers  continuously measured skin conductance while the children listened to tape recorded sound effects (gong, crashing dishes, barking dogs, etc.) spaced at unpredictable intervals against a background of white noise. Results provided support for the present application of neither Berlyne's nor Zajonc's hypothesis, since significant main effects of the Alone vs. Friend conditions were not found. (NH)",

        "description":"This paper is concerned with issues related to reasons why some early childhood intervention programs may not have lived up to expectations. By intervention is meant the introduction of planned programing deliberately timed and arranged in order to alter the anticipated or projected course of development. Although an intervention program should be a hypothesis testing program (one that requires that the dependent as well as the independent variable be clearly articulated) until the data is in, this is not the usual case. Matters recommended for discussion in establishing an intervention program include: (1) the variety of subsystems comprising the human organism, (2) the relationship between systems longitudinally, (3) the when of intervention, i.e., identification of the  significant epochs wherein particular interventions would have more relevance in getting the child on an appropriate \"course\" of growth, (4) the degree to which the child can assimilate and accomodate to the program, (5) the degree to which certain competencies or structures are susceptible to modification, (6) the relationship between the child and the broader environmental context, and (7) the interaction between the child and his parents. It is concluded that an airing of these matters will not only make intervention experience of value to the target children (minority group members), but will also facilitate the child's subsequent learning.

        "description":"The research presented in this document has two main hypotheses: (1) From locus of control theory, it was predicted that a warm, supportive, and consistent or stable home environment relates positively to internal control; (2) Methods derived from locus of control theory which increase an individual's observation and experience of behavior-effect contingencies give rise to more internality. Three samples were used to assess home environment correlates of locus of control. Another three samples were used to assess the validity of the second hypothesis. General conclusions are that the research at least partly supported the first hypothesis. There were sex differences in all samples with respect to the internal controls. For males, a warm, supportive, and consistent home  environment related positively to internality. For females, there was support for the notion that less stable home conditions force girls to seek more self-reliance and become more internal. The second hypothesis was supported by the finding that perception of internal reinforcement control increased in early graders and college students at the conclusion of locus of control counseling efforts.

        "description":"This paper deals with three areas concerning early vocal development: (1) review and critique of existing experimental evidence suggesting that early vocal behavior has the properties of an operant response, (2) speculations concerning the role of non-verbal vocal behavior in early psychological development, and (3) suggestions for future research. Skinner's \"Verbal Behavior\" takes the position that verbal behavior could be analyzed within operant conditioning frameworks. Chomsky argues that the system which Skinner proposes is too simplistic to account for the intricacies of human speech. Other work reviewed covers conditioned vocal responses, conditioned response differentiation, reinforcer effectiveness, and the relationship between age and conditionability. Speculation about  the role of early vocal responses includes a discussion of Watson's hypothesis that the human infant is structured from birth for the processing of response-contingent information and that at least two response-contingent sequences must occur within the infant's memory span in order for him to develop an initial awareness that his responses resulted in the change in external stimulation. It is suggested that the role of response-contingent stimulation on vocal development and its long-term consequences on vocal behavior warrants further investigation. (CK)",

In Part I of the discussion, a conceptualization of physical deep structure is developed, and three examples are given. In Part II, the role of physical deep structure in psychological development in the teaching of mathematics and science is delineated. It is believed that curricula should be developed upwards, utilizing what children demonstrate as their own way of thinking and own ideas about interesting phonema, rather than downwards from preconceived objectives based on traditional  paradigms, including systems of operations. It is suggested that the approach to curriculum planning should be one that respects the natural processes of the child. (DB)",

        "description":"This paper covers issues concerning public or cable educational television for young children. The basic question is whether the use of an interactive system should be taught to young children by untrained family members in the home or by workers in day care centers. Preliminary studies of such a system for four-year-olds from both advantaged and disadvantaged homes indicate that they not only can learn to operate such a system with the help of a parent or sibling but enjoy it. The advantages of such a system include: (1) Both the parent and child can receive instruction; (2) Master teachers and expert programing can be made available to every child with access to TV; and (3) Immediate feedback and tangible reinforcement of appropriate responses implement learning in young  children. Despite these advantages, the proposed system drew the full approval of only half of 10 educational specialists responding to a questionnaire on the system. This difference of opinion gives rise to two more issues: (1) the controversy on whether a tangible reward should be associated with learning in the young child, and (2) the question of whether the instruction should reward the child for learning a middle-class Anglo vocabulary or a minority-group vocabulary. Although some study has been made of these and other issues, it is recommended that interdisciplinary debate be conducted to provide guidance to public policy makers. (CK)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the processes that are at work which produce some of the differences between male and female human beings. The sex of the child is an important attribute of the organism's identity. Before birth, parents express preferences for the sex of the unborn child and start providing names as a function of the sex of the child. Studies of fetal behavior indicate that if the fetus is active, the mother interpreted this as a sign that the child was more likely to be male than female. Before the child is born and after, the parents and community respond to that child in a sex differential fashion. Of concern here is in what way are these early sex differential parental behaviors transmitted to the child and what kinds of infant behaviors are a consequence of them? In the  subsequent discussion in this paper, an attempt is made to demonstrate that in many aspects of the child's behavior there are early and profound differences in the infant's behavior as a function of its sex. For the first few months of life, boys receive more proximal behavior than do girls; however, by six months of age, this has reversed itself. By the end of the first year of life, girls touch and stay close to their mother significantly more than do boys. One method of socializing the young child is to turn the infant to a position facing away from and not touching the mother. The data indicated that in our society women have more freedom of action and more available choices in social interpersonal relationships. (CK)",

A 1966 study of nursery school effects on child development revealed the following breakdown: (1) favorable effects in the areas of general knowledge, vocabulary, capacity for linguistic expression and ability to manage certain daily routines without assistance, and (2) absence of results with respect to motorical, social, and emotional adjustment, marks scored in the test of readiness for school attendance, performance in reading, writing, and arithmetic during the first three years' attendance at school. The project reported on in this  paper concerns the use of new techniques of learning in nursery school methodology. The fields of social training, training in communications, and training in comprehension were the fields tested. The program is currently being implemented with the aid of control group procedures. All of the children are tested at the beginning and end of the school year with the following instruments: readiness for school attendance; sound analysis test, vocabulary test, attitude test, general knowledge test , and observations of standardized play situations. The methods used in the experimental groups are validated with the assistance of observations in accordance with a variant of Flanders.

In the second part of the paper more than 50 currently available instruments purported to assess the self concept of young children are described and classified according to the subdivisions of 5 major assessment approaches. It is anticipated that the categorization schema of this paper will be useful in the management of any large quantity of test information. Suggestions are made to indicate which testing approaches deserve further scrutiny. Part 3 included  observations and suggestions: (1) Although no definition has been widely accepted, self concept must be operationally defined as that construct or set thereof assessed by the set of self concept instruments (2) It is inappropriate to attempt to validate a self concept measure by simply comparing it with another such measure. (3) The bulk of currently available self concept tests is not likely to be of significant value of the educator concerned either with the development or modification of specific educational programs for young children.

There was little stability of any kind for visual regard and vocalizing to the mother or in crying and three behaviors indicating orientation to the locus of the mother's disappearance. In contrast, both short- and long-term stability were found for touching and proximity to the mother.

Results are discussed in terms of the temporal-acoustic pattern and content of the mothers' speech. Two claims are made about the kinds of speech a child hears: (1) The flow of speech is disrupted by broken sentences, extraneous words and phrases, and inappropriate segmentation; and (2) The child hears a random sample of sentences not contrived to teach the child about grammar. Each of the 10 mothers used in this study had one child 18 to 26 months of age and one child 4 to 6 years of age. The mothers talked with each of their children in a play situation and told a story to each of their children from a set of  pictures. The toys in the room and the story pictures were held constant across mothers and across children. Each mother also talked with an adult. The speech used by mothers when talking with their younger child was compared with the speech used by mothers when talking with their older child. The speech used with the adult was also compared to the samples of speech to the children. With very young children, mothers used a slower speech rate, and a restricted vocabulary and set of sentences. Sentence boundaries were well marked by pauses, and there was little false information in the form of broken sentences, disfluencies, or inappropriate pauses. As the age of the speaking partner increased, the rate of speech and the diversity of vocabulary increased. (CK)",

        "description":"Tests of conditionability in infants were used in a longidudinal study of 32 subjects in the first year of life. The research was based on Eysenck's hypothesis that conditionability i s a unitary factor related to introversion-extroversion and attention span. The objective of the investigators was to devise a battery of conditioning tasks applicable at ages 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months, which would examine individual differences and patterning in conditioning behavior. At each test period, the infant was given four conditioning tasks which were usually repeated on each of three days. Criteria for accepting conditioning tasks included: (1) Is it appropriate for the age? (2) Is it simple to administer? (3) Is it non-aversive to most babies? At each test period, the  Bayley Test of Mental and Motor Development was administered, a simple test of attention span was carried out, and the mother was given a questionnaire to fill out and return. Findings include: (1) Test administration is possible without unduly tiring the subjects; (2) Tasks set up for the infants must be simple, pleasureable, brief; (3) Subjects of these ages present some unique problems in that they are not likely to tolerate a bare physical setting and instrumentation; (4) The problem of acclimating the child to the strange setting was speeded by an initial play period with toys; and (5) Continued willingness to participate by the parents is maximized by answering their questions about child development and child rearing philosophy, and in some cases, referrals to proper help.

        "description":"The Heman Street Preschool was organized to serve two main purposes: (1) T o provide a group of three- and four-year olds with a preschool experience which would increase their chances for later success in school; and (2) To train future teachers and teaching aides to work effectively in a preschool program. The program focused on four groups: the children, graduate students, prospective teaching aides, and parents of the children. Participants included the Preschool Director and Coordinator, nine graduate students, 24 aides, and 75 children. One graduate student and two teaching aides were assigned to teach each class for a period of three months. Curriculum goals were general language development, development of certain cognitive skills and school-readiness behaviors. Basic  elements included in the daily program were Structures Language Program, Story Read or Told by Teacher, Teacher-Led Talk Sessions, Manipulative Cognitive Materials, Free Play, and Paints, Clay and Other Expressive Materials. Program evaluation revealed that students and aides improved their teaching and evaluative capabilities and that children improved in their ability to perform school tasks, in their language competency, and in their ability to draw. It is concluded that the Heman Street Preschool has demonstrated on e way a University and a school district can cooperate to produce a program beneficial to the children of the district, the students at the University, and members of the community served by the school . It is also concluded that a structured approach is more valuable than  an unstructured one. (CK)",

        "description":"An analysis of naturally occurring activities that make up educational programs for young children was made in a search for answers to the following questions: (1) How do teachers manage learning activities in preschool classrooms? (2) What are these learning environments like? (3) How closely do the actual occurrences match the teachers' conceptions of what ought to occur? To find answers to these questions, two research instruments were developed: (1) an observational system that identifies and describes the classroom activities; and (2) a teacher interview procedure. These two instruments were used in a study of one preschool classroom for disadvantaged children. The class was composed of 14 four-year-old children who were supervised by two teachers and varying numbers of  assistants. In all, there were 14 hours of observation by two observers, one clock hour for each child. Findings that characterized the activities of this classroom are: most time was spent in transition periods; much time was spent in preparing for scheduled events; children spent over half of the time as a total group; they were not required to interact or relate with each other; teachers rarely permitted the children to work without direction; and most activities were teacher initiated and organized. Two discrepancies between the teachers' expectations and actual outcomes that most impressed the teachers were the amount of time devoted to transition and that no block play was observed. (DB)",

        "description":"This address starts by explaining the educational philosphy of John Dewey. In this context, the central aims of education are cognitive and moral development. In a pluralistic society, the teaching of morals poses a grave problem and gives rise to a belief in moral and ethical relativity. This address proceeds to show what is wrong with ethical relativity conceptions and to show that the developmental-philosophic strategy is the only clear non-relativistic strategy for educational aims. The school's major conscious aim is seen as academic achievement as defined by tests and grades. According to Dewey, an educational experience which stimulates development is one which arouses interest, enjoyment and challenge in the immediate experience of the student. From the progressive or  cognitive-developmental perspective, insofar as behavior changes are of reversible character, they cannot define genuine educational objectives. Central to the progressive approach is the longitudinal perspective, the perspective that the worth of an educational effect is to be determined by its effects upon later behavior and development.

An emphasis is placed upon the behavioral goal as a necessary characteristic of educational and child rearing procedures. It is suggested that a prejudice against the young allows us to use punitive rules more freely and show less concern with justifying behavior goals when dealing with the young than when dealing with adults. Constructive suggestions are proposed and exemplified in classroom and therapy procedures. In these reports, the application of some simple rules are described. The rules are: (1) You learn what you do, (2) You learn what you teach, (3) You learn what is reinforced, (4) Bad behavior can be made more costly  without punishment, (5) The first demands must be small enough to guarantee reinforcement. Finally, the ethics of manipulating human behavior are reviewed with respect to the behavioral goal and the new concern for individual freedom. (Author)",

The growth of preschool teachers generally occurs in stages associated with survival, consolidation, renewal, and maturity. Training needs of teachers change as they gain experience over time and move through the stages. The location and timing of training appropriate for the teacher in a given situation must be flexible. The location of training should be moved as the teacher develops. At the beginning of the new teacher's career, training resources must be taken to her. Later on, as the teacher moves past the survival stage, training can move toward the college campus.  The timing of training should be shifted so that more training is available to the teacher on the job instead of before it. Experience alone seems insufficient to direct a teacher's growth and learning. As part of her role a teacher trainer should try to make sure that teachers, especially beginning teachers, have informed and interpreted experiences. (Author/WY)",

Two group-related comparisons were made: (1) differences between slow-maturing and average kindergartners, and (2) differences between an educationally handicapped group deficient in language skills and two other groups, a normal third grade and a hyperactive EH group. In addition, task-wise correlations measured relationships of task performance within groups. Results indicated that significant differences were apparent in all tasks when the two kindergarten samples were compared; and that the slow EH group was significantly  deficient in auditory and cross-modal tasks. Correlation measures suggested that: (1) Poor auditory processing and deficient intersensory functioning are correlated in slow-maturing kindergartners and the slow EH group; (2) Visual acuity is not necessarily affected by deficiencies in auditory or cross-modal areas; and (3) Auditory and visual acuity are similar kinds of capabilities for normal populations and for the hyperactive EH group who are adequate in language processing skills. The present experiment showed that a relationship exists between cognitive development and perceptual acuity in kindergarten. (Author/CK)",

        "description":"Two curricula, Englemann-Becker and New Nursery School, were analyzed for effectiveness with Head Start children over a period of eight months, using the Slosson and Merrill-Palmer tests, a socialization scale and classroom observations. In congnitive development, there are no significant differences between the two curricula as used by teachers who scored highest on classroom observations. There was significantly less failure in cognitive development in low-scoring teacher classes using the New Nursery School curriculum than those using the Englemann-Becker curriculum. The New Nursery School curriculum appears more functional than the Englemann-Becker curriculum in achieving the following results: (1) increased association of children with each other in play and work situations,  (2) increased interaction of children with each other in groups of three or more, (3) more active participation by children in work and play situations, (4) Sharing with other children, (5) a minimum of crying behavior with other children, and (6) increase in intellectual maturity as defined by the teacher. It is concluded that since cognitive skills acquired by the child seem to be about equal in the two curricula, and since the corollary elements which the child needs in his educative process are probably better supplied by the New Nursery School curriculum, there appears to be little reason for recommending the Englemann-Becker curriculum as against the New Nursery School curriculum.

In addition, four groups of the mothers taught a second child from their ethnic and social class background, and a third child from an ethnic and social class different from their own. Each mother taught a cognitive sorting game and a motor skill game to each of the children assigned to her. Data were organized in terms of \"own child\" data and analyzed by means of a  one-way analysis of variance, and predicted trends; the \"social distance\" data were analyzed in a 3 x 2 x 2 mixed factorial design. The data were coded usin g a Parent Interaction Code which allowed analysis of the teaching interaction in terms of programmatic variables: total time, input and pacing; and teaching loop variables: alert, format, child response, and feedback. The single best predictor of maternal teaching, or child response, was ethnicity with some replication of earlier social-class differences. The results tend to support stable constellations of behaviors within ethnic groups of a subtle nature. Further research is recommended. (Author/CK)",

        "description":"In this 4-part study, 1970 test data from 45 American Indian youth (aged 11-15) attending Riverside Summer Institute in Anadarko, Oklahoma, were examined. Part 1 of the study sought to identify the pattern of strengths and weaknesses on the &quot;Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children&quot; (WISC) of Indian students with average intelligence and average or above-average reading ability. Strengths were in similarities, picture completion, block design, and coding; performance scale IQs exceeded verbal scale IQs; and weaknesses were noted on the vocabulary and picture arrangement subtest. Part 2 dealt with patterns of strengths and weaknesses on the WISC of Indian students with average intelligence and below-average reading ability. Strengths were in picture arrangement, block design,  object assembly, and coding, and weaknesses were in information, comprehension, arithmetic, similarities, and vocabulary. Part 3 compared the performance on the WISC of retarded and nonretarded readers (as classified by the Gates MacGinitie Reading Test). The verbal scale IQ scores of both groups were lower than the performance scale IQ scores, and both groups exhibited weaknesses in vocabulary and strengths in picture completion, block design, and coding. Part 4 identified the strengths and weaknesses of male as opposed to female retarded readers. The mean verbal scale score (WISC) of males was about 10 points lower than that for females; the mean performance score of the males was 4.8 points higher than that for females; and the mean full scale scores of males and females were within 1  point of each other. The document contains a 5-item bibliography and 4 tables showing mean WISC scores. (MJB)",

This document represents a special report to the governor from the task force and is composed of an overview of the Texas migrant, reports from 8 state agencies (e.g., the Texas Employment Commission) and 8 non-state agencies (e.g., the Texas Conference of Churches, Boy Scouts), conclusions and recommendations, and a summary of findings of the advisory committee. Recommendations in the area of legislative  action include establishment of (1) a housing standards law covering labor camps and on-farm labor housing which will authorize the State Health Department to enter, inspect, and enforce; (2) a state housing authority to regulate and expedite farm labor housing; and (3) a loan program similar to that of the Veteran's Land Board for the purpose of improving housing for farm workers and improving the barrios. Recommendations for administrative action include (1) to insure that a realistic share of Federal funds for migrant projects be allocated to Texas, based on the state's percentage of the migrant population; (2) to expand the migrant health clinic concept in the State Health Department via close coordination with the Department of Public Welfare and the Texas Education Agency; and (3)  to provide free tuition in Texas institutions of higher learning to qualified migrants.

Projects and activities of the central office and of the 3 regions discussed relate to such topics as health, education, employment, housing, sanitation, family planning, and nutrition. Improvements and needs are reviewed; these include the need for more medical facilities, an increase in medical manpower, better housing, and more employment opportunities. Tables compiled from the monthly reports of each local migrant health project are presented; mainly, the tables depict the number of migrant recipients of services in such areas as immunizations, admissions to the  leprosy program, venereal disease control, tuberculosis control, chronic disease control, maternity, family planning, child health, crippled children services, and cardiovascular disease. A look to the future indicates that even though 23 local migrant health projects provide services to the migrant population (approximately 147,000), additional local projects are needed. Many counties, due to economic conditions, are not able to provide needed services to the migrant population as well as to the local indigent population. Unless outside funds are made available, migrants' needs will go unmet. (JB)",

        "description":"The Texas farm labor pool is made up almost entirely of Mexican Americans; many of these are naturalized but the majority are native-born American citizens whose families and ethnic ties remain in and around the border. All of these field workers have, at some time, migrated to a job or in search of a job either interstate or within the boundaries of Texas. Migrant farm workers are part of a distinct subculture in American society and are seemingly thwarted in any attempt to break out; in Texas, 80% of them are boxed in by these facts: family earnings for the most part below poverty level; home base being the most depressed area in the nation; low educational achievement (58% functional illiterates); substandard housing both at home and in the working areas; little health  education and insufficient health attention; extremely low competency in English; and a dearth of marketable skills. Figures for 1970 indicate a 7% decrease in migrants and approximately a 10% decrease in job opportunities. Help can come in the form of subsidy and welfare and/or training programs, which need to be expanded. This annual report discusses Texas agriculture and migrant labor, including sections on mechanization in agriculture; alien labor and immigration; the Texas inter-agency task force on migrant labor; scouting and migrant youth; current developments in education, housing, health, and job development; and trends in migration.

Specific subsidiary purposes were (1) to demonstrate that utilization of various disciplines--including medical, vocational, psychological, and social--coordinated with assistance from other professional and nonprofessional groups, can more effectively provide rehabilitation services and (2) to demonstrate that development and utilization of community resources for rehabilitation will return a greater number of disabled persons to self-sufficiency, self-support, and self-esteem. Two organizations had major roles in administration of  the program: Appalachian Regional Hospitals, Inc. and the Kentucky Bureau of Rehabilitation Services. The procedures used involved a referral system in which the disabled person, after comprehensive evaluation, was recommended for a particular type of service. Results indicated that all major objectives were realized. Some of the recommendations made were that a cooperative project with the Employment Service be established to serve as a liaison between job specialists in large cities and rehabilitation workers in Appalachia; that programs be developed to concentrate on whole family units rather than on the most obvious disability; and that psychological screening be used to uncover mental retardation or emotional illness in the family.

Phase 2 involved defining a research population, selecting a sample from that population, collecting and analyzing data, and comparing data to the summarized material available on lower SES youth. The population for the study was defined as Wisconsin youth in grades 5 through 8 living in rural counties where at least 2/3 of the population were rural residents with a median family income below $4000 per year. Of the 22 counties in Wisconsin meeting these criteria, Adams County was arbitrarily selected. The 176 lower SES respondents and 174 higher SES respondents in phase 2 of the study were equally divided as to sex. Instruments were designed to  measure 3 characteristics indicative of SES: occupation of head of house, education of head of house, and family possessions. Style of adult leadership desired was also measured as were personal characteristics desired in a leader, organizational participation, and parental attitudes toward club membership. It was found that youth from lower SES families are different from youth from higher SES families in terms of such factors as personal and parental interests in club membership, desire for different leadership styles, and characteristics desired in a leader. Thus if youth leadership training programs are to be effective, they will need to emphasize socioeconomic group differences rather than simply youth leadership in general. (LS)",

If the system is irrelevant and ineffective, ways must be tried to discover alternative plans, systems, and processes in Indian education. As part of the process of trying to discover alternatives in Indian education, it is suggested that projects combining research and demonstration be developed to explore the Indian value system, the Indian culture, and Indian parent participation. A research and demonstration project involving 12 institutions of higher learning in the Southwest is thus suggested; this project should have a strong research component to which the policy makers, administrators, faculties, Indian students, and  Indian parents are fully committed. The demonstration aspect of the suggested project should be designed and developed strictly by the participating institutions of higher education, but the development and implementation should be dominated by Indian students and parents. The students and parents should develop a 4-year curriculum which is indigenous to the Indian student and his community. The curriculum should be developed and built upon the Indian value system, Indian culture, and Indian life style. This should result in innovations which are relevant to the Indian educational system. (LS)",

        "description":"The transfer of schools operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to public school systems has been occurring for more than 100 years. When these schools are transferred to the public school systems, a financial impact on school operations, school construction, and the instructional program is felt by the public schools. Because of the financial impact and the special needs of schools educating Indian children, problems arise from transferring BIA schools to public schools. In the past, transfers have been accomplished through political pressure and arbitrary decisions. Today, most educators in the BIA and public schools, along with many tribal leaders, agree that what is needed is a planned program for transfer that involves the mutual readiness of Indian people and  non-Indian people; financial support from the local school district, state, and Federal Sources; and training of Indians and non-Indians in school affairs. A process consisting of 6 phases--compilation of basic data, school evaluation, determination of present status of transition or transfer, development of community readiness, preparation of a time-table, and follow-up--is presented in this paper.

        "description":"The pronounced need for community support and involvement in school affairs is evident throughout the nation. This need is especially acute in situations where cultural and economic differences exist between the school and the parents. Study of school boards can locate some of the correlates that articulate and enhance the Indian parents' and the schools' avenues of approach to each other. Increasing emphasis has been placed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and by Indian tribes and other groups toward maximum Indian involvement in all Indian affairs. The BIA has expended extensive efforts in organizing formal school boards and in training board members and school administrators to enhance community involvement. There is a pronounced need to provide analyses of these efforts  and to point out direction for future emphasis. If Indian parents are alienated or isolated from the opportunity to be involved in their children's education, factors causing such alienation or isolation need to be pointed out so that corrective policy can be implemented. If meaningful dialogue can be established to reach across geographic, cultural, and economic barriers that may exist between the Indian home and the school, the distance between the learning style of the pupil and the teaching style of the school will be reduced. In this paper, after a review of literature, 6 relevant topics for needed research are listed, and methodological considerations are discussed. (LS)",

Much research has been done in the area of Indian education; a corresponding effort has been made in the area of economic development. No efforts have been made to put the two together with Indian participation so that maximum development of economic opportunities will be a strongly motivating factor in Indian education. Training in distribution fields, in fiscal management of local government, and in management and supervision in industry has rarely been attempted with the American Indian. The solution to the lack of economic development in Indian communities is active involvement of Indians using  their mental abilities, political strengths, leadership, and insights. The place to begin is to provide the Indian with the opportunity to undertake research of a self-analytical nature that will increase understanding between Indian and non-Indian contemporaries. Only with understanding can programs be developed which will inspire Indians to a place of their own seeking and choice in America's economic society. (JH)",

The nature of the problem for the researcher would seem to be a comparative study to test the validity of various assumptions that are currently being made about the mental processes involved in second language learning and to test the relative efficiency of a  number of plausibly suggested methodological implications. The validity of the concepts of competence and performance for second language learning is the object of needed research. Also worthy of research is the validity of the principles of (1) teaching units for mastery and (2) the spiral curriculum approach. Arguments in favor of a particular linguistic sequence in contrast to other sequences invite research, as do arguments that stress the importance of the semantic content of the language lessons.

        "description":"Seven rural California counties participated in a teacher preparation internship program funded by the Education Professions Development Act. The 101 elementary teacher intern candidates--having a wide range of academic backgrounds, personal interests, and talents--first took part in an 8-week summer preservice experience consisting of (1) orientation to elementary curriculum, diagnostic instruments, lesson planning, classroom routines, organization, and management; (2) half-day student-teaching activities with fully certified master teachers; and (3) orientation to and study of the sociology of the rural community, additional methodology, and the customary district orientation procedures for new teachers. The year of internship represented a melding of 5 interfacing elements:  (1) classroom teaching; (2) problem-centered seminars; (3) assistance from supervisors; (4) professional coursework; and (5) a continuous program of self-evaluation and autonomous learning. A summer postservice period provided an opportunity for the intern to complete his teacher preparation on an individual basis, with some freedom to select fields of study or engage in other activities. The internship program emphasized the interrelatedness of the activities and responsibilities of the participating school districts, offices of county superintendents of schools, the State Department of Education, and the colleges and universities. The major portion of the text presents an evaluation of the recruitment and selection procedures and a description of the program model, its sequential and  mutually cooperative implementation, and the degree to which program objectives were attained.

The 28 practices were selected on the criteria of (1) evidence that they are effectively helping students, (2) relevance to the Northwest region, (3) implementation without extensive outside funding, (4) program design facilitating description and evaluation, and (5) not being generally known among small schools in the Northwest. Each practice is described in sufficient detail to be easily adapted in another educational situation, and a source for further information is provided.

        "description":"The need for modification of teacher behavior in teaching the Mexican American occurs primarily in 2 areas. First, the teacher must seek ways to improve her teaching by learning how to plan for, produce, and evaluate behavioral changes in her pupils. Writing instructional objectives in behavioral terms, learning ways to assess the effectiveness of verbal and nonverbal interaction, and understanding the use of positive reinforcement can all contribute greatly to changes in how the teacher approaches the teaching task. The second aspect of teacher behavior is concerned with knowledge about the culture that the Mexican American child brings to school. It is understood that the knowledge itself will not produce changes in attitudes and expectations about the pupils. However, accurate  information which the teacher can use as she observes pupil behavior can often be the key as to whether she will show sensitivity, appreciation, or a positive attitude. Modification of these 2 aspects of teacher behavior is a necessity if Mexican American pupils are to benefit to the fullest from an educational system that has failed them in the past. It is not unreasonable to ask that change take place to make teachers more effective in the classroom and that this effectiveness in pedagogy be enhanced by knowledge of the culture of the Mexican American.

During the 1960's, organizations took a more militant approach to solving problems through community action. The paper points up a need to gather and compile that which is written on Chicano community action efforts, a need to make literature and research available to scholar and layman alike, a need to sponsor and/or engage in  needed research projects, and a need for funds to implement suitable programs.

As reported, the major objective of the program was to develop and implement a group process approach to bilingual education; in addition, classroom instructional personnel were trained by site coordinators. Program success was regarded as outstanding in classrooms having strong administrative support for the program; partial success was achieved in overall efforts to create classroom enviroments and appropriate activities to facilitate small group interaction. The relatively unsuccessful aspects of the program were attributed to lack of (1) bilingual teachers, (2) a true heterogeneous  student population, and (3) supporting administration.

The major purpose of the summer institute (funded under Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act) was to disseminate information regarding new techniques, innovative programs, and current educational thinking. The theme for the institute was \"Contemporary Curriculum for Small Schools.\" The program attempted to meet the varied curriculum interests of participants with concurrent, small group sessions for administrators, secondary education, and elementary education. Sessions for elementary teachers and administrators were  concerned with individually prescribed instruction, behavioral objectives, effective discipline, questioning strategies, and change in reading instruction. Sessions for secondary educators dealt with educational trends, behavioral objectives, and the legal process and concerns in school affairs. Major presentations dealt with a new design for rural elementary and secondary schools, individually prescribed instruction, due process, improvement of self-concept, student apathy, reading instruction, and teacher selection and evaluation. Condensations of major presentations, reports of concurrent sessions, 7 papers prepared by participants, and the results of an institute evaluation questionnaire are included in this institute report.

The diagnostic teaching program specified behavioral objectives which fit the individual student, prescribed instructional styles for the teacher, and outlined techniques of diagnosing individual learning needs. It was hypothesized that the experimental group of about 40 boys, aged 9 to 14 years, would score significantly higher on reading tests than the matched control group. This hypothesis was not supported by the data from the post-tests, although the experimental group did show significantly higher subtest scores in letter names, short sound vowel recognition, short sound vowel production, and  two-letter consonant blends. Analysis of correlations of learning mode and score gains suggested that more gains were achieved (1) when motor activities were used as a learning mode, (2) when reading material was relevant to the student's experiences, (3) when differing experiential and knowledge levels were accounted for in instructional materials, and (4) when teachers used a variety of equivalent reading strategies to compensate for short attention span.

The development of the concept of reading readiness is briefly discussed, and four major factors involved in reading readiness are identified: mental factors, physical factors, emotional and social factors, and educational factors. It is recommended that parents and teachers be alert to the possibility of learning disability due to any of the above factors and that they should consult the specialist if such disability occurs. The importance of hearing, vision, speech, and motor control is emphasized, and their interrelationships and influence on reading readiness are pointed out. Other important factors for  reading success mentioned are age, sex, interest, desire to read, and the child's general pattern of growth and development. The author also discusses how the teacher may assess a child's reading readiness and urges the parents to discuss frequently their child's progress with the teacher so they might understand the purpose of the type of instruction prescribed for their children.

        "description":"The main barriers to teenage reading are lack of reading skills, lack of reading materials, and lack of time for reading. The school has often unconsciously contributed to the teenager's not reading by overloading him with homework and providing too many after-school activities. Another important factor that affects the child's attitude toward reading is that many people around him do not read. Our goal is not to see that the child merely reads words on a page, but to develop in him a positive attitude and genuine interest in reading. In order to achieve this, the child should be provided a comfortable, quiet reading environment. If the child is deficient in reading skills, parents might examine the possibility of a school remedial reading class or a qualified tutor. To improve  the child's attitude towards reading, parents should develop in themselves a reading habit. Pairing films with books and discussions among the family about materials read are good motivational techniques. Bibliography can be used to solve teenage problems, but must be approached sensitively. Encourage the child to read what interests him, but make good books available so that good taste might develop naturally.

Experiment 1 dealt with training kindergarten children to attend to and encode letter pattern cues and the word's contextual cues. Subjects were trained individually in a series of four tasks: developing attention to letter cues, sight learning of letter-contrasted words, sight learning of function and content words, and sight learning of the words in sentence context. Results of Experiment 1 indicated that the systematic letter pattern training did not improve sight word learning and that the sentence context may not be a very effective vehicle for learning sight words. In Experiment 2, kindergarten children  practiced sight words and phonics-based words in either list or sentence formats prior to testing and practice on a retention-transfer task. The factors investigated in Experiment 2 were found to be largely ineffective in improving word identification during reading. Tables and references are included. (Author/AW)",

The spelling-to-sound correspondences were established for 69 grapheme units, resulting in a total of 166 correspondences for the one- and Two-syllable words in the lexicon. These words were coded for the correspondence number of each grapheme unit, stress, syllable division, form-class, grade level, and special word conditions. Then 6,000 coded words were computer-processed and arranged by correspondences in a sequence for use in an instructional program. This systematic arrangement of words provided for the gradual increasing of word length and for organized introduction of vowels in  unstressed syllables. The sequencing also allowed each one- or two-syllable words to appear as an exemplar of only one correspondence, after all other correspondences in the word have been introduced. The uncoded words of three or more syllables were arranged in the sequence by hand, bringing the total number of sequenced correspondences to 186. Finally, all lexicon words, including exceptions to the correspondences and proper names, were arranged according to the sequence. References are included. (AW)",

The tutorial program was used in four of eight nearby schools. In these schools, remedial instruction for low-performing students following each unit of the reading program was administered by trained tutors and the teacher; in the other four schools the same remedial instruction was conducted by the teacher only. Pupil performance for both groups was compared, a tutor observation scale was  developed to observe behavioral differences between trained and untrained tutors, and responses to a tutor questionnaire were collected. This report presents the rationale used to formulate the tutorial program, describes the formative evaluation procedures used to develop the program, presents data related to the effectiveness of the initial program, and describes the revised tutorial program.

Students are tested both at the beginning and end of the course, and their scores are graphed to show each student's progress. Students are taught either by the instructors or by use of faculty-prepared or commercially-prepared tapes. Each faculty member prepared a taped lecture, an excerpt from his text, and a sample test over this material. A student experiencing difficulty in any course may  choose to work individually on tapes, excerpts, and tests. Each student evaluates and improves his own place of study and develops a system of budgeting his time and keeps a weekly schedule of planned activities which are checked by the faculty.

The first goal of reading instruction to vocational students should be to have them become proficient in basic reading skills which they can apply directly to the use of content materials in his chosen field. The development of reading skills should begin by using individualized reading materials and follow a controlled sequence which allows adjustment for student differences. Then the students should have the opportunity to apply these skills to textbooks  and magazines covering topics related to his job interest. Preparing the vocationally oriented reader to enter his world of work requires curriculum tailoring designed by drawing on the expertise of vocational, general study, and counseling staff members. Team teaching of vocational and reading instructors would prove helpful. An illustration of such a reading program for vocational students is the reading-study skills laboratory at the Madison Area Technical College. References are included. (AW)",

Reading grade equivalent scores were obtained for 92 eleventh graders and 84 post-high school students on a standardized reading comprehension test. Then cloze passages on health education were assigned to subjects on the basis of a match between grade equivalent scores of the reading test and prediction of readability on the passages. Obtained mean cloze scores for the high school students were considerably higher than those for the post-high school students. A sampling of the cumulative records, available only on the high school students, for previous reading scores on  other standardized tests yielded scores higher than those obtained in this study. It was hypothesized that the cloze material might have been at a difficulty level below these students' actual reading level. Since no major discrepancies were observed with the adult groups, the author concluded that it seems possible to use Bormuth's criteria for determining the instructional level with adults.

Experimental pupils used the Visual Tracking program, and the control pupils participated in directed listening activities in separate rooms. The teachers followed a weekly rotating schedule in supervising the groups. After 12 weeks of training, eye-movement of all pupils were photographed with the EDL Reading Eye Camera as they read silently. Forty-four pupils were retested to collect data for determination of test-retest reliability. Eye-movement scores of 96 pupils were analyzed by factorial analysis of variance. Results showed the following: (1) No significant differences were found between the two groups on any of the five eye-movement measures (fixations, regressions, span,  duration, and rate). (2) Girls read with significantly fewer fixations and at a significantly faster rate than did the boys (p < .05). (3) No significant interaction effects were found between visual tracking training and sex. (4) Test-retest reliabilities for the five eye-movement measures ranged from .66 to .88, and (5) Inter-rater reliability coefficients ranged from .82 to .98. It was concluded that the proposition that visual tracking training would improve first graders' silent reading performance was not supported. Tables, appendixes, and a bibliography are included.

Although the studies produced little statistical data, logs and reports of numerous teachers and paraprofessionals were used as the basis for this paper. It is suggested that the role of the paraprofessional ultimately depends on his own background and experience, but that the specificity of teaching objectives of the principle teacher can help define the paraprofessional's role. That role can vary from assuming tasks which free the teacher to work directly with the students to working with the students himself. Specific areas and specific tasks within those areas in which the paraprofessional can work in teaching reading are suggested. These areas include helping develop the  ability to sound out words, teaching listening skills, and helping improve reading speed by using games, drills, supervision of study, talking to the students about reading, and numerous other activities. The author predicts that the role of the paraprofessional will expand and change in the future. (AL)",

There is disagreement over the value of early letter-name training. It is variously said to aid in letter or word discrimination, to aid in attaching sounds to letters, and to interfere with both of these tasks. An analysis of the letter names and of experimental and pedagogical evidence lends little support to the claims of letter-naming benefits. Only 16 English letter names begin with a sound which they represent, and of these, seven (the five vowel letters, plus c and g) do not begin with the sound introduced first in most reading programs. In several countries, including the United States, the Soviet Union, and Israel, letter-name knowledge has been  found to interfere with learning to attach sounds to letters. But letter-name knowledge has also been shown to be one of the best single predictors of reading success, and no matter what can or cannot be shown experimentally about the utility of letter names, they are efficient labels for the letters and an inseparable element in the popular concept of reading instruction.

Attention was paid to phenomena of dialect and development on various levels of language. All subjects produced miscues, although average readers produce fewer miscues than slow readers. The substitution miscues had a strong tendency toward some graphic and phonemic similarity and were often the same part of speech as the text word replaced. The miscues were also mostly semantically and, even  more so, syntactically acceptable. The subjects tended to correct miscues which resulted in unacceptable structures, using selective strategies. Average readers used these strategies to a greater extent than slow readers and were more able to emphasize one strategy over the others while using all the language cue systems at the same time. There were developmental trends for many of the strategies, especially for the slow readers. Appendixes, including the Goodman Taxonomy of Reading Miscues, and a bibliography are included. (AW)",

Error categories included sequence and orientation reversals, other consonants, vowels, and total error. Reversals occurred in quantity only in poor readers, with large individual differences. Overall error pattern was similar for good and poor readers. The two types of reversals were uncorrelated in poor readers, therefore not reflecting a single process. No aspect of the error patterns was found to be correlated with cerebral dominance assessed by an auditory rivalry technique. More errors occurred on nonsense syllables than on real words, but the error pattern was similar, suggesting that errors reflect phonological  structure more than meaning. Since confusions among reversible letters presented in isolation occurred infrequently, their optical properties cannot be solely responsible for their confusions in reading. Comparisons of substitutions in the real word and nonsense lists support this conclusion. Reading of individual syllables was highly correlated with paragraph reading, suggesting that the beginning reader's problems are more concerned with synthesis of phonological segments than with strategies for scanning connected text.

Some of the conclusions were the following: (1) Controversy about literacy reports can be explained in part by traditional use of norm-referenced tests which require failure of some to balance success of others. Therefore, it is not currently possible to set accurate standards for literacy or to know precisely who has achieved it. (2) The preparation of teachers is dictated by state certification laws and effected by university programs. Inequalities in state requirements  and inconsistencies between instructional programs and those requirements make careful analysis of teacher preparedness impossible. (3) Inadequacies of evidence garnered from the research reviewed may be blamed on inadequacies in research design and description. Where programs, methods of analysis, etc. are not carefully described, or where conditions are not carefully controlled, it is impossible to synthesize findings and to generate universal conclusions, and (4) Reading disability does appear to be widespread, some improvements have been made in reading achievement, and not much has changed in teacher education in the last 10 years.

        "description":"A review of research literature on the subject of dyslexia printed since 1955 is presented, concentrating on the interest in the subject during the late 1960's. The authors initially admit that precise definition of the term dyslexia is quite impossible (they use the term to mean the inability to read) and devote chapters to describing problems related to definitions, problems of diagnosis, and treatment approaches to dyslexia. By taking this approach, the authors propose to construct an analytic framework for use by future theorists and researchers. The monograph is one of a series of ERIC/CRIER \"state-of-the-art\" papers, and is thus intended to be a review of research in a general area with conclusions about the present state of knowledge in that area and discussion of  implications for future research.

The first study used 113 high school students as subjects, and the second used 92 college students. All were given a variety of cloze tests and adapted portions of tests of associational fluency and verbal comprehension. Intercorrelations were computed for each experimental group, and factor analyses were made. Marked differences were noted between the high school and college groups. The high school sample had 65 of 66 significant (p<.05) correlations, while the college sample had 32 of 66. Fifteen of the 16 perceptual ability correlations were significant for the high school sample compared to five for the college  sample, all verbal ability measures were significant for the high school sample compared to 10 of 16 for the college sample, and the magnitude of all relationships were higher for the high school group. Factor analysis revealed similar results for the two groups with a general cloze factor emerging first, followed by a perceptual factor, and a verbal ability factor. It was concluded that the studies lend support to a differentiation hypothesis of varying difficulty from one age level to another. (MS)",

(2) A formalized, structured vocabulary development program is highly desirable. (3) Despite many existing information media, it is necessary to reintroduce students to reading as the major avenue of information. (4) The students should be carefully introduced to the best stories written today so as to rekindle in them an interest in words and reading. The author's Basic Reading Skills classes are described as an example of a vocabulary development program. In these classes, books used for instruction are chosen for their storytelling qualities. The word list dictionary approach and word card method are  used to enhance learning. Contextual and structural analyses are taught through the use of appropriate materials. The two aspects emphasized in the reinforcement and practice program--use of the words in conversation and writing--are strongly recommended. The author also recommends that teachers use new technologies which provide greater individualization and that they devise new learning techniques incorporating more dynamic approaches, laboratory experiences, and experimenting with the use of language tutors.

        "author":["Schale, Florence"],
        "description":"This study was based on the assumption that the average person should be able to grasp 14 words of pica type within the span of a half dollar. During the weekly Rapid Reading series, a cooperative venture of CBS-TV and the Northwestern University, a tachistoscopic challenge was presented to the audience. The training in rapid reading came through projecting articles on television, paragraph by paragraph at increasing rates, then asking comprehension questions according to the Reinforced Reading method. The tachistoscopic challenge was used to measure rate and degree of visual awareness up to 14 words in a circular span at 1/50 second. The first 15 people who responded to the feedback appeal averaged a circular span of seven words at 1/50 second. Those who returned progress charts  from the self-instructing television workbook averaged 939 words per minute with 79 percent comprehension while reading ninth-grade level materials. The author found the results consistent with the theory that rapid reading training does increase visual awareness of larger spans of print, and that the processing rates can be accelerated without loss of comprehension. However, no definite conclusions were drawn, and further study was recommended. References are included. (AW)",

Twenty words, 10 emotionally charged and 10 neutral, were taught to the subjects on 4 successive days. Pretesting on printed-word recognition was conducted before instruction. Five days after the last teaching session, the subjects were post-tested for printed-word recognition and recall. Results indicated that despite the fact that the emotionally-charged word performance at the outset of the study was significantly lower than the neutral word performance, the subjects made significantly greater gains in emotionally-charged words over gains for neutral words, and the final performance level for  printed-word recognition for both groups of words was identical. The post-test also showed that a significantly greater number of emotionally-charged words was recalled when compared to the number of neutral words recalled. The author concluded that the content of reading materials and the methods for teaching them should be revised so that reading deals with events, ideas, and feelings which are emotionally significant to the child.

Surveying the research in visual information processing, oral reading, subvocalization, and reading speed, the author concludes that the \"visual\" hypothesis is not commensurate with these findings. In particular, an experiment predicting the pause structure in fluent reading is reported, and a level of understanding involving both deep and surface structure information is proposed as characterizing such performances.

The authors state that they are concerned not with the scientist with computer experience, but rather with telling those without computer teaching experience about the possibilities and prospects. In their discussion, the authors distinguish at least five modes of usage, each embracing several types of output: alphameric or graphic, paper or film, and temporary or permanent. the five modes are: (1) producer of materials, (2) administrator, (3) tutor, (4) simulator, and (5) calculator. It is as a calculator that the authors feel the computer demands the most understanding and participation of the student, and the computer should have its greatest impact in science teaching. Various  facilities utilized are summarized under these headings: interactive, semi-interactive, and non-interactive. Several graphic display systems are described as interactive systems. The conclusion discusses the authors' concepts of how computer usage might alter the style and content of science education. (TS)",

Students use the computer in a number of ways on homework, on individual projects, and in the laboratory. Students write their own programs, whenever possible. On occasion, it is more useful to have the student programs written and saved by the teacher. Five areas of work are described: (1) illustrations from a broad range of study areas are introduced to show the versatility of computer-connected graphic display devices such as X-Y plotters and cathode ray terminals; (2) a simple, intuitive approach to the propagation of waves in dispersive media is shown; (3) a program is  described which can be used to calculate a large number of interference and diffractive patterns; (4) general methods are given to find a map field patterns for general distribution of charges and current loops; and (5) solutions are found to some simple Schrodinger equations using a computer program.

It is concluded that, at present, science can not provide the tools to fully meet the \"chanllenge\" of environmental problems perceived by the public, legislators and scientists, for it has not been possible to derive general principles of practical utility from the complex and diverse interactions in the environment. It is recommended that mechanisms for the provision and allocation of resources, and the determination of priorities, be established by government to guide the concurrent advance of environmental  science on the three levels of basic disciplinary research, intermediate scale (regional) systems analyses, and global predictive models. A manpower shortage is recognized and recommendations to alleviate it are made. Four examples of problems requiring the application of environmental science are illustrated and briefly discussed: fisheries resources, magnetic field reversals, grassland ecosystems, and oceanographic and meteorological interactions.

The improvement of park and recreation facilities and programs as one aspect in community development and land use planning is discussed at length. The situation is described as one in which parks and recreation are increasingly important in the political sphere of activity; funding in this field is an important consideration in the entire budgeting process; questions of state, federal, local, private, quasi-public, and regional roles and responsibilities are of concern to people in high places; and professionals in the parks and recreation field have  an inherent responsibility to assume leadership in these three areas and related areas as well. To understand the situation, consideration is given to the emergence of current patterns of land use and community form, dominating influences upon them, and the persistence of land use decisions. Existing trends are projected to view future needs, giving attention to assigning responsibility for land use decisions, and the guidance and direction of land use and community regional development.

New institutional directives in the form of enabling legislation and constitutional revision are deemed necessary. &quot;Estimating Recreation Demand - A Reality?&quot; investigates two opposing forces--expansion of outdoor recreation facilities in line with population growth and urban concentration vs. the spread of private land ownership and its restricted use.

Overall, the plan is concerned with any and all participation in leisure time activities conducted in an out-of-doors setting, rather than any single facet of recreation. Chronological aspects of development are traced following passage of the &quot;Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965.&quot; Supply, demand, needs, and action are described as components of the plan together with an assessment of how these components are presently being completed by the State. Possible uses and implications of such a plan are also considered within its realm as a reliable guide to the  orderly and efficient acquisition and development of outdoor recreation resources in Texas.

The first chapter reduces the problem of trisecting an angle to the solution of a cubic equation, shows that straightedge and compasses constructions can only give lengths of a certain form, and then proves that many angles give an equation which does not have any roots of this form. The second chapter explains how various curves (including the hyperbola and the parabola) can be used to trisect any angle, and the third chapter describes several mechanical devices for doing the same thing. Approximate methods are discussed and compared in the fourth chapter, and the final chapter is devoted to some fallacious solutions. The whole book has an  interesting historical flavor. The mathematics used rarely goes beyond secondary school algebra and trigonometry. (MM)",

Developed by the Water Resources Council pursuant to the Water Resources Planning Act of 1965 (Public Law 89-80), the purpose is to achieve objectives, determined cooperatively, through the coordinated actions of the Federal, State, and local governments, private enterprise and organizations, and individuals. Plans for the use of the Nation's water and land resources would be directed toward improvement of the quality of life through contributions to the objectives of national economic development, environmental quality, and regional development. Beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans on each of these  objectives, as well as effects on social factors, are also considered.

The role which mathematics can play in developing the individual personality is then discussed. The second part of this book considers first the needs for behavioral objectives in teaching, illustrated by the Duluth Elementary Mathematics Content Guide and over 250 objectives and sample evaluation items. Some practical aspects are then  discussed: student learning guides (student contracts), student achievement records, coding procedures, student planning schedules, student record forms, classroom design, and problems of evaluation of student progress.

A primary objective of the course is that children be taught the basic concepts, factual data, attitudes and intellectual skills of the social scientist in an innovative, flexible manner in order to motivate the students toward understanding and solving problems. It is urged that the teacher understand this basic course objective and suggested that in-service teacher training may be necessary. This six year curriculum program is comprised of units containing studies of geography,  economics, education and political science, providing important insights into generalizations, understandings and concepts. Kindergarten through second graders average 15 to 20 minutes per day comparing and contrasting their family life with families of other selected cultures. Third graders and fourth graders shift their study of village life. Fifth graders ask and explore what it means to be a human being. Sixth graders study American History using factual, biographical and \"main idea\" approaches. Suggested sequences of study are provided for each unit, along with charts, and multimedia materials.

        "description":"Advocates of the new social studies have long urged the use of concepts as the basic building blocks in social studies. The question of what concepts and definitions of them should be taught is a matter of agreement among qualified judges. As qualified judges in the international relations-war/peace international education field, we can determine the concepts to which students should be exposed. Such a determination will undoubtedly be picked up by curriculum writers and teachers. We have attempted to take up the task of defining and choosing concepts, generalizations, and a rationale for them in the Diablo Valley Education Project. We have asked: What are the crucial concepts which must be taught if students are to be better prepared to participate in the democratic process, to  the end of helping build the institutions of peace? Our initial answer to this is that they should include conflict, change, obligation and authority, power, interdependence, institutions, identity and role, with a discussion of values related approximately to each. We have attempted a definition, rationale, and attitude and knowledge objectives for the concept of conflict. We have also developed an outline of propositions for conflict which begins to provide the content around which we would encourage teachers to build specific units. Attached are excerpts from our work on the concept of conflict. (SO 002 078 is related.) (Author/JLB)",

        "description":"The problems mankind faces are of such overwhelming importance that it is easy to see why we are interested in integrating the academic disciplines to study war, violence, and social change. Could not the behavioral sciences, properly mobilized, enable us to reduce the probabilities of war and violence, and make social change more tolerable? Toward these ends, the integration of academic disciplines, and the cooperation of these disciplines with practitioners (educators) should prove worthwhile. There are several obstacles to interdisciplinary work: 1) the anxiety-provoking nature of this area of research, which causes people to withdraw to safe problems in their own disciplines; 2) the tendency to regard only the things in one's own discipline as problematic, and those things  outside as givens; 3) the defensiveness and jealousy that often exists between disciplines; and, 4) each discipline having its own distinct methods. One way to overcome these obstacles is to be aware of the conceptual convergences that exist across disciplines. These convergences set the stage for cooperation. There are new methods and concepts that make cooperation easier, e.g., the man-computer simulation to study conflict. It is not obvious how such projects can best be organized, and we need to collect critical incidents concerning successful attempts at cooperation. (Author/JLB)",

Its thesis is that: 1) reform must begin at both the individual and system levels; 2) we must clearly see how we are caught in systems within systems; and, 3) by responding somewhat acquiesently to these systems, we help keep them stabilized. The author first provides a model to account for human behavior, and discusses the way perceptions, values, expectations, and loyalties lead to foundations for social organization, custom, law, and institutions. Many of these widely shared values are associated with preservation of a society from inner and outer threats, and pursuit of national interests. The behavior of nations and empires is then characterized, mainly in terms of the dynamics of  leadership, how it interacts with the shared values, and the process of decision making by national leaders. The author discusses the importance of population and technology as parameters affecting the decisions of its leaders and attempts to account for the importance of these variables through a series of propositions. Machine (or man-machine) simulations of all levels of decision and control with real world data would allow us to determine scientifically not only how basic area, resource, population, production and other variables have combined and are combining, but also what trends are likely to continue, with what consequences.

The authors attempt to identify educational goals, based upon our changing concepts of man as a social being, to serve in considering the contribution of behavioral scientists to the future of education. Toward this end, the educational process itself is examined, and the relevance of affectively charged, experiential learning for man is discussed. Finally, ways are examined in which behavioral scientists may have both the opportunity and skills for participation in the changes evolving in education. The authors conclude that the behavioral scientists' understanding of child development and  the learning process means that they have particular insights to contribute to the planning of the educational process. Their understanding of conflict and of conditions essential for forcing change without violence may hopefully influence the development of curriculum if suitable means can be established for collaboration with educators themselves. A discussion by Portia Bell Hume, M.D., and response by Wilson Yandell follow the presentation. (Author/JLB)",

The network could develop an active person- to-person continuing education program, plus a series of monographs and media to individualize faculty learning. The development of the network is mainly up to the community college sociologists, however, the American Sociological Association could strengthen the experimental sector of the community college movement by working with it to prepare teachers, deans of instruction, and institutional  research workers. Research and development programs can be developed between graduate sociology departments and collaborating faculty and institutional research workers in community colleges. To develop academic and political support for improvement in social science education, the profession needs a Section on Teaching which could initiate independent activity to improve sociological education through better channels of communication, by initiating research, and by organizing to obtain new resources.

Education must go through reform from within that includes the adoption of a K-12, transdisciplinary, problem-solving curriculum. And must, also, offer students environmentally sound alternatives to the uncertain future they face, in an educational environment that is humanized. With the focus of environmental education on human behavior and the interaction of it with the total environment, the learning setting will change to include the community-at-large. The plan developed by the Northwest Environmental Education Center (NEEC), with state funding, provides for the implementation of environmental education programs on a number of  levels: community or district level, the county level, and the regional or inter-county level. Teacher training within each of 38 districts will be given the highest priority for the purpose of establishing a hierarchy of environmental specialists to function in each district. Intensive training of a cadre of teachers from each district will permit inservice training. The pilot project at Sedro Woolley School District is cited here at length and in SO 002 249.

They were then asked to rate the utility of their sources of information: TV at home, radio, newspapers, magazines, books, movies in theaters, teachers, textbooks, movies in school, TV in school, minister or teacher in church, and content of religion. Statistical analysis utilized a one-way analysis of variance, the dependent variable being the source ratings. 21 of the 64  comparisons had greater utility for the Seattle sample; the print and motion picture sources had greater utility for the Vancouver sample.

Focusing on recent developments in training and research programs within the Soviet Union, it points up the continued growth in size and diversity of international education programs, and shows their relationship to the Soviet national objectives. This report uses the general term, international education, to designate a broad range of programs: 1) the traditional study of other lands and peoples in elementary, secondary, and high education; 2) interdisciplinary approachs to specialized study of world affairs, international relations and policy particularly in colleges and universities; 3) comparative education and cross cultural research; 4) educational exchange and study  abroad for firsthand immersion in other cultures; 5) technical assistance to educational development through foreign aid programs; and, 6) international cooperation in intellectual exchange and educational development through international organizations and multilateral arrangements. The descriptions and analyses of specific programs in these categories provide the basis for comparisons with the ways the United States and other countries plan and function with respect to the international dimensions of education.

The first section of the manual provides sketches of some alternative schools in Massachusetts. These schools have been started by people of all sorts, and it is hoped that the sketches open up a few new possibilities. A second section covering state regulation of alternative schools includes the requirements concerning certification, compulsory attendance, curriculum, teacher qualifications, admissibility back to public schools, diplomas, accreditation, building code regulations, safety  standards, etc. Other sections cover liability insurance; the economics of alternative schools, including both private and public aid; incorporation; and taxation. Where to Get Help, outlines resource for educational and legal assistance. A list of legal services offices in the Commonwealth and a list of alternative schools in Massachusetts conclude the manual. While some of the advice on federal funding may find application in other states, the manual should not be assumed to describe requirements or give advice for other states. (Author/JLB)",

This report views the importance of recreationalists behavior patterns and describes the use of simulation models to predict demand data. Four research phases constitute the main organization of this paper: 1) Anticipation and 2) Recollection phases discuss and question the psychological needs of recreation. Attitudes, facilities, spacial relationships, cost, and distance traveled are identified as predictive factors for recreational attendance. 3) The Travel Phase looks at the distance that people will travel depending upon other factors such as site attractiveness. Research indicates that beyond a certain number of miles distance is not predictive. 4)  On the Site Phase considers site attractiveness (perceptual environment) as a major allurement which gives the greatest satisfaction to visitors. Findings of this research report raise questions regarding the nature and goals of recreation which need to be answered and suggest that a fruitful area for study may be conceptualization of the decision-making process in recreation. Included are 386 bibliographic citations, and an outline of current research topics in outdoor recreation. (SJM)",

        "description":"This report covers the first five months of the Sedro Wolley project which has been designed by representatives from Huxley College, the Sedro Wooley School District, and the Northwest Environmental Education Center as an experimental model. The project proposes to investigate through action at the school district level the nature and content of environmental education and to develop a K-12 environmental education program that will be useful to other districts in Washington and other regions. The proposed steps in the project include: retraining of teachers, involvement of students, development of curriculum and implementation of the program. A narrative discussion of the first step is presented in this report. To date the primary effort has been to orient teachers to  environmental issues and to determine those skills which will be of greatest use to them in restructuring the curriculum. The teachers' seminar found that an extensive restructuring of grade units, administrative units, daily and annual school schedules, disciplines, and teacher-training programs may be necessary to respond adequately to the challenge of the environmental problems of today. Future activities and specific findings of the project are also discussed. (Author/DJB)",

An introduction sets out the general context of ecological study, the assumptions on which the unit is based, and the general purpose of the course. The unit is lab and problem centered, and is built around an issue of the individual student's  selection. The course is structured into two separate phases, the second one optional but highly desirable. Possible objectives of the course are listed, the framework of the course is discussed, and several pages show the suggested organizational frameworks in chart form. They include: an interdisciplinary course; a unit within biology or social studies; an interdisciplinary unit taught in both biology and social studies courses. Some ideas are discussed for differentiating between an area of environmental concern and specific envrionmental problems. (JLB)",

They, plus a control group of 22 teachers, were tested before and after the workshop with two environmental awareness surveys. These surveys did not indicate a greater final knowledge of environment in the experimental teaching group. Changes in values occurred, however, with significant shifts in the experimental teaching group towards idealism and humanism and away from both a scientific and economic orientation towards life. Part II, the major portion of this report, contains seven individual project reports done by psychology undergraduate and graduate students for participating teachers who wished research assistance. Through observation and awareness  analysis they evaluated the effectiveness of the environmental learning packages which the teachers had developed and then used in their elementary and junior high classes.

Five social studies teachers taught 50 50 minute lessons over a period of 10 weeks to homogeneously grouped pupils in grades 4-7, using three local dailies as the instructional materials. The lessons were designed according to the instructional objectives of the American Newspaper Publishers Association Foundation Newspaper Test (ANPAFNT); both the lessons and the test are rated at the junior high school level. The two participating schools were in rural Hancock County, Georgia; 90% of the pupils were black and scored below national norms in reading before the experiment. Students were pre-and post-tested with a  nationally normed reading achievement test and with the ANPAFNT. The latter was also used 10 weeks after the instruction. Students scored significant gains on all of the post-tests, indicating that gains during the project were in basic skills rather than in quickly forgotten trivial information. (Author/DJB)",

Recent field trials indicate that children are learning economic concepts as well as other social concepts from the new units. The paper closes with the following recommendations to the historical profession: 1) historians must work more directly with teachers in the creation of teaching materials, to the point of using or observing the use of materials in classrooms; 2) historians and teachers should  work together to help eliminate an apparent bias against non-textual material evidenced by so many publishers; 3) All social studies materials, especially those based on history, should be reviewed and revised periodically.

        "description":"The holistic, synergistic, normative, self-actualization motivated, transpersonal psychology developed by Maslow and others has opened enormous opportunities for a new sociology, a humanistic, transcultural, value-committed sociology. Such a sociology would not have the glorification of science or knowledge for its own sake as its highest goal, but rather the enhancement of man's potential, and hence the improvement of society. It would be concerned with the institutions and values of society which can nurture man as a choosing, growing, self-actualizing person. The humanistic approach is not anti-science, anti intellectual, or anti-rational, but there is an attempt to correct an imbalance in Western thought that has downgraded or ignored the affective side of man. Humanistic  sociology should not be equated with radical sociology, the New Left, or the human potential movement--it is a perspective, not an ideology. This perspective requires some radical shifts from our dominant thinking and approaches, involving: 1) our images of man and his relation to society, and 2) our images of science and the nature of the sociological enterprise. A humanistic sociology would study the degree to which specific values and institutions based on those values, facilitate or hinder the good society. If sociology is to remain vital and relevant, a shift to a more humanistic perspective is called for. (Author/JLB)",

Enrichment of the programs by team teaching is recommended utilizing specialized teacher talents, and a broad framework encompassing the varying abilities of students is suggested. The first program, \"The Legacy of the Ancient and Medieval Worlds\", and the second program, \"The Origins of the Modern World\",  offer broad-based thematic possibilities for study, suggested historical concepts, and include topic suggestions.

        "description":"This report investigates student evaluations of a business simulation game as a learning experience in terms of specific claims which have been made for this kind of teaching technique. Ninety-nine junior college students in introductory business courses answered a questionnaire after playing the fame as an ongoing, semester-long activity. The results support the claims that games are self-judging, increase student motivation, and increase students' understanding in areas related to the game, but not the claim that games have special value for low-achieving students. The students considered the fame experience most valuable for learning relationships and for getting a feel for the real situation. In general, the students' evaluation of the game as a learning experience was  positively related to their understanding of the instructor's reasons for using the game. Also, acceptance of the game as self-judging was associated with low tolerance for ambiguity, and reported increases in business understanding were related to the students' course grades and their understanding of the game.

Educational accountability is a process of setting goals, making available adequate resources to meet those goals, and conducting regular evaluation to determine if the goals are met. The reasons are the influences of the federal government, the dissatisfied public and the technological-cultural difficulty of managing education. The events have moved from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, which required an accounting of how federal funds were expended in compensatory education programs, to a comprehensive all-school performance contract in Gary, Indiana. The major problems are reflected in the responses to the  following seven questions: Who is accountable? What is the accountability unit? How are educational outcomes measured? Will the focus on measurable student learning detrimentally affect the humanistic fields? Will accountability create a sterile environment which precludes creativity and imagination? Can accountability be applied beyond the basic skills area? Will accountability work? (Author/AWW)",

The problems are seen as: 1) the question of emphasis within the junior college curriculum; 2) the widespread vocational-technical orientation of students and administrators; and, 3) the relationship between the history courses offered on the junior college level and what the senior degree-granting institutions will accept from the transferring student. The promise and possibilities are seen as basically the general willingness of junior college trustees and administrators to supply the materials necessary for instructional innovation, and to accept experimentation in instruction. The paper offers suggestions  and resources for the development of new instructional materials and calls for diversity in methodology and technique. It concludes by posing a number of questions which must be answered before teaching of history and the connected problems may be clarified. One suggestion is for the American Historical Association to sponsor a study of history in the junior college classroom. (Author/DJB)",

Although conditions for demonstrating competency are specified by the instructors, students select the means for developing the competencies and follow their own schedule by completing formal learning contracts. This arrangement is called Structured Independent Study. The most exacting requirement demands that the student videotape, code, and critique two teaching performances in terms of prescribed teaching behaviors. Coding is accomplished with the Social Substantive Schedule, which assesses the congruence between a specified instructional mode and a teacher's verbal behavior. Preliminary results from  comparing students in the experimental course with students in a traditional course indicate that although typical measures of course achievement did not discriminate between groups, experimental students spent significantly less time on the course and conferred with the instructor significantly more often than traditional students. Students rated the videotape evaluation as the most valuable course activity. (RT)",

Moral teaching is defined as the process of open discussion aimed at stimulating the child to move to the next step in his development. Research evidence shows that internalized principles of moral judgement cannot be taught, but their development can be encouraged. The main conclusions are (a) the definition of \"good behavior\" should not be relative only to the standards or biases of the teacher; (b) the teacher's initial task is to understand, from the child's viewpoint, what is good and bad about a given behavior; (c) since the child's judgement follows a developmental sequence, some thinking can be defined as more morally mature than others; (d) it is  psychologically and ethically legitimate to encourage the child to act in accordance with his highest level of judgement; and (e) insofar as discrepancies between judgement and action reflect a form of cognitive conflict that may serve to promote development, encouraging correspondence between judgement and behavior will be a stimulus to further development as well as to changes in overt behavior. The teacher must be concerned about the child's moral judgements rather than about conformity with the beliefs and judgements of the teacher. (MBM)",

Part II examines criticisms and responses to criticisms of teaching in the humanistic foundations as they are formulated by writers from outside the field of professional education. Part III examines and evaluates several reasons for having prospective teachers study in the humanistic foundations of education which have been offered by scholars working within the separate foundations fields.

Rater-reliability for the classroom observation measure was high. The classroom observation rating scale is recommended as a survey instrument in a school system that is beginning to experiment with open education. Baseline data can be gathered and the measure can be repeatedly used to chart changes in classroom practices. A teacher questionnaire,  parallel in form to the classroom observation rating scale, may be used in workshops as a starting point for a dialogue about teaching. Both measures can be considered as initial steps in adding greater theoretical precision and empirical understanding to the concept of open education. (Author)",

Each of the instruments used related directly to the stated goals of the project. The pre- and posttest results of the Self-Report Inventory revealed no significant change in the attitudes of the 13 participants, while there was extreme disparity between the pre- and posttest scores of the Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory. Scores on the pre- and posttests of the Survey of Study Habits were similar, indicating little increase in motivation during the training session. The test results suggest the need for replication of the present program with an adequate increase in its duration to provide ample opportunity for significant personal  changes in participants.

The participants were tested to determine their gains in the acquisition of knowledge in the areas of child growth and development, media technology, and language arts techniques. Attempts were made to determine their level of motivation after completion of the program as well as their attitudes toward continuing their education. All evaluatory findings indicate the success of the program. The attitudinal profiles developed from the IPAT (Institute for Personality and Ability Testing) 16 Personality Factor Questionnaires and the Survey of Study Habits are suggestive of a screening  guide in the selection of future aides.

The basic aims were 1) to define some of the essential pedagogical features of open education; 2) to develop explicit, concrete indicators for each feature; 3) to check the validity of the indicators with the major writings on the subject and with important theorists and practitioners in the United States and Great Britain; and 4) to make comparisons to other relevant approaches, such as progressive and affective education. Eight major themes were used as a framework: 1) instruction--guidance and extension of learning; 2) provisioning the classroom for learning; 3) diagnosis of learning events; 4) reflective evaluation of diagnostic information; 5) humaneness--respect, openness and  warmth; 6) seeking opportunities to promote growth; 7) self-perception--the teacher's view of herself and her role; and 8) assumptions--ideas about children and the process of learning. Specific works of 28 selected authors were examined and analyzed for their attention to each of the eight themes. The authors were classified as writers of historical importance, progressive educators, popular critics, affective educators, and writers on open education. A list of pedagogical characteristics is presented, each accompanied by illustrative quotations from the literature. (MBM)",

The developer interviewed cooperating teachers and principals to determine competencies desired of student teachers before their clinical experiences in public schools. Students who had completed their clinical program were asked what facets of their methods program they felt were desirable and what competencies and experiences they would have  liked before beginning student teaching. Suggestions received were organized into a series of related experiences in the model, each having a rationale for its inclusion as well as both performance and evaluative criteria. Students who have field tested the model and helped to modify it have reacted very favorably to their preparation for teaching and feel that the activities designed for them have enabled them to direct classroom learning with confidence.

Five essential elements are identified: 1) teaching competencies to be demonstrated are role-derived, specified in behavioral terms, and made public; 2) assessment criteria are competency-based, specify mastery levels, and are made public; 3) assessment requires performance as prime evidence and takes student knowledge into account; 4) the student's rate of progress depends on demonstrated competency; and 5) the instructional program facilitates development and evaluation of specific competencies. Characteristics include program individualization and modularization; emphasis on exit rather than entrance requirements; the systemic, open  approach, with feedback loops and program alternatives; and student and program accountability. The advantages of PBTE are identified and include the attention to individual abilities and needs, the focus on objectives, the emphasis on the sharing process by which these objectives are formulated and used as the basis of evaluation, and efficiency. There are problems in the lack of valid evaluation criteria and in the domination of PBTE by competencies which are easy to describe and evaluate. (MBM)",

Data derived from the author's earlier Teacher Characteristics Study (1948-54) based on about 400 teachers in Hawaii and presented in relation to the following characteristics: 1) considerate, kindly behavior; 2) businesslike, task-oriented behavior; 3) stimulating, motivating, imaginative behavior; 4) favorable attitudes toward pupils, school personnel, and parents; 5) academic educational  viewpoints; 6) child-centered viewpoints; 7) verbal-semantic facility; 8) general personal-social adjustment; 9) commitment to teaching as a profession; 10) participation in teaching-related activities; and 11) response validity. The data for each characteristic are examined in detail, but no attempt is made to explain similarities or differences. The scales simply describe the characteristics which emerge from analyses of teachers' reports of what they do, what they prefer, how they think they would act, or how they think other teachers would act under specified circumstances, and what opinions and values they agree and disagree with.

Relationships between these dimensions and the teacher's sense of his own influence and autonomy are described. Each of 17 teams in six team-teaching schools was observed during six of its planning meetings. The number of times each teacher initiated task-related communication was recorded and totals were averaged to obtain individual participation scores. Teachers also responded to a questionnaire about their perceptions of their own influence and autonomy. Results indicated that interaction in team meetings is related to teachers' perceptions of their own influence and autonomy.  The organization of teachers into teams that have decision-making responsibility has implications for the way teachers feel about their own impact on decisions made both within and outside of the teams. Teaching teams do sometimes have balanced, or non-hierarchically differentiated status structures. The degree of balance in team structure is associated with the teacher's perception that he is influential and autonomous. It is possible, therefore, for a task group to have a status structure in which all members participate equally and perceive themselves as having substantial influence over the decisions made.

        "author":["Brewer, Jeutonne"],
        "description":"This paper is concerned with the historical aspects of Black English in light of recent descriptive studies. Linguistic investigation has established the following points: (1) There is a Black English dialect; (2) Black English has systematic rules which differ from those of Standard English; (3) There are indications that lead to the conclusion that there are historical connections between Black English and coastal West African languages. Black English has a cohesive, structured grammatical system, i.e., it is a language system. According to the creolization theory, black people brought to the New World as slaves first learned a form of pidgin English. This theory postulates that Black English developed as a result of the following influences: language interference, nonstandard  linguistic models, and isolation factors. The languages which are the most significant to the historical study of American black dialects are those which were spoken in the Guinea slave coast area; most of them are in the Niger-Congo language family. Black English has two perfective distinctions in its verb system which have no equivalents in Standard English. The grammatical characteristics common to Black English verbs also occur in West African languages. An immediate implication of this study is that the history of the English language must be broadened to include the Afro-American tradition. (CK)",

        "description":"As part of a curriculum class in English for doctoral students at Ball State University, these scenarios present an attempt to create an English curriculum that will meet the educational needs of the next generation. The scenarios are based on visits made by the students to Northside High School in Muncie, Indiana. The students analyzed the school's English curriculum; studied the plant facilities; observed and talked with the staffs in English, journalism, drama, and speech; and interviewed the librarians, counselors, and a cross-section of the high school students. Using these data, the university students wrote scenarios on the projected future of the school 30 years hence, making recommendations for altering the English curriculum accordingly. The results are presented in the  scenarios. The first details an alternative for the English department, that of melding technological know-how with the humanizing process. A more generalized plan, based on self-realization and the lack of coercion, is offered in the second scenario. In the third one, disturbing questions are raised about the future of education in Middletown, U.S.A. (Muncie); moreover, it offers a curriculum plan in English used nationwide. An imaginative tale of the total destruction of our educational system and the emergence of a \"new\" English completes the scenarios. (Author/DB)",

Suggested solutions to these educational problems are: (1) make the curriculum more responsive to the individual student; (2) allow students to participate with teachers in designing an elective courses curriculum; (3) utilize the British Primary Education Plan, which focuses on language in use and the uses of language rather than classification and  identification and accumulation of knowledge about; (4) move teacher preparation from college classrooms to school classrooms; and (5) utilize the teacher surplus to reduce class size, institute new programs, and develop new approaches.

The third category deals with English as a subject. The fourth refers to professional problems. The fifth deals with social change, and the sixth is a miscellany. Several of the respondents felt that the Council must change its structure in order to develop more efficient ways of communicating with the profession and the public. The problem of being more responsive to the needs of affiliates and to the needs of classroom teachers occurred frequently throughout  the replies. One respondent suggested that the &quot;English Journal&quot; create sections on humanities and on media, two recent and important concerns of the English teacher. A few respondents did feel that the annual convention needs overhauling.

Certain courses are described. Freshman Rhetoric requires a great deal of attention to the ways in which an essay can be persuasive. The purpose of Advanced Rhetoric is to provide more training in written expression for the general student and to serve English and rhetoric majors. Introductory Literature focuses on making ancient tragedy and poetry relevant,  insofar as possible, to the twentieth century college student. Business and Technical Writing courses are advanced courses in the art of professional communications.

The other is to propose a statement of needs, objectives, and components for an oral and written language program for elementary grade children. The method used for this study consists of five steps: (1) A survey and consensus of knowledge expressed by (a) language scholars and researchers, (b) curriculum specialists, and (c) teachers and other practitioners; (2) A survey of materials and methods presented in current textbooks for teachers and students; (3) A survey of students' and teachers' future needs in school and society; (4) Statements of needs and objectives of an elementary oral and written language program;  and (5) A proposal for the components of such a program. The results of each of these steps are presented in this paper. (Author)",

        "author":["Klingberg, Gote"],
        "description":"The literary genre explored in this study is The Fantastic Tale for Children, which combines magic and reality. Two examples of the \"pure\" fantastic tale are \"The Return of the Twelves\" by Pauline Clarke and \"Tom's Midnight Garden\" by Philippa Pearce. The motifs of the fantastic tale are methods which connect the world of the principal characters with a mythical or remote world, such as the living toy figures, the strange children, the modern witches, the supernatural animal figures, minature people, the combat between good and evil, journeys through space and time, and the door. The consequences of genre research for literary criticism of the fantastic tale are that with this literature, the critic must judge how independently or unoriginally the motifs are treated, and he must  determine if motifs of nonsense literature accord with the motifs of the fantastic tale. The educational purposes of the fantastic tale are to stimulate feeling and imagination; to give moral lessons and encourage philosophical discussions; and to satisfy the needs of children. Psychological problems related to the child's interest in the magic apparatus and their capacity for understanding it and for understanding the various ideas in the fantastic tale are discussed. A list of the 32 fantastic tales discussed is given as are references. (For related document, see ED 022 750.) (DB)",

It is stated that as time has passed, the Negro novel has never varied from its basic composition, but it has elaborated upon that basic composition in varied ways. It has, it is believed, afforded us a picture of the Negro mind which reflects both a permanent cast of Negro thought and the sensitivity of that cast of changes in the Negro's immediate environment.

        "description":"Two main points are stressed in this essay: (1) Reading literature aloud to students is not only educationally sound, but for many youngsters, necessary; and (2) In order to help his students become critical listeners of the literature that is read to them, a teacher must build bridges between the youngsters' experience and that in the literature. Three types of spoken language are listed: reading aloud, monologue, and real conversation. The differences between the first two and conversation include: (1) The intonation patterns of spoken prose are highly standardized; those of conversation are not; (2) Spoken prose is even in tempo; conversation is not; and (3) The pauses of spoken prose are closely related to the grammatical structure of these sentences; in conversation, they  are frequently unpredictable. To attune his ear, a student not only needs to hear his teachers read aloud a great deal, he also needs occasional practice himself. Listening comprehension in slow-learning children far exceeds reading comprehension for the following reasons: the speaking voice brings to interpretation pitch, stress, pause, rhythm, tone--audible clues to meaning which slow youngsters are unable to infer from print alone. It is suggested that television and film be used more often than they are to help slow learners, as these media combine visual and auditory clues to meaning. (CK)",

The establishment of a learning ecology is described as being based on the primacy of talk. In this context, teachers must personify the ways in which talk joins people. The methods used by teachers in creating common human bonds can include improvised drama, classroom discussion, choral speaking, and telling stories. To teach children how to read literature so as to gain its highest satisfactions, a planned program is said to be of prime importance. The elements of such a program are described, and its advantages enumerated. Listening is said to be a precondition to writing in that it helps the student to  know how the words should go. The teacher's approach to teaching the child to write creatively is described. (DB)",

Since Guttman is best known for his contribution to scaling theory known as scalogram analysis, a brief historical background is given to indicate how Guttman moved from a unidimensional approach (scalogram analysis) to a multidimensional approach (facet design and analysis). After facet design and analysis is introduced, an example of facet design is presented in relation to an attitude item paradigm for an intergroup situation. Some further research using facet design and analysis is introduced and some elaborations of Guttman's original formulations are expanded. (Author)",

The following discussion suggests ways more meaningful evaluation can be accomplished, meaningful in the sense that the resulting classifications, i.e., grades, imply definite degrees of progress up the behavioral hierarchy.

There is a large array of specific skills which constitute the ability to construct a valid Thurstone test. Since these skills are not generally available, a training package has been prepared to train the average college graduate to be able to prepare a Thurstone attitude test. Some of these skills involve voluninous arithmetic calculations for which the package provides two alternatives. Our method uses special computation sheets on which the calculations can be done by  hand. The other employs data processing techniques making the tasks much easier.

This paper traces the development of the procedure from Hevner's beginning method up to the various methods in use today and describes both the testing procedures and scoring methods used. The term confidence testing is applied to both probabilistic testing and confidence weighting procedures. Various procedures are presented and their relationship with personality factors discussed.

Statistical tests of this hypothesis are derived when the relation is specified with the exception of the additive constant. Two approaches are presented and various assumptions concerning the error parameters are used. Then the results are reinterpreted in terms of the possible existence of an unspecified linear relation between true scores of two psychological tests.

The item parameters for the models are discriminatory power, difficulty, and probability of chance success. Suggested uses for the approximations were to provide a basis for screening items for tailored testing, to enable a determination as to the appropriateness of a set of items for tailored testing, and to provide starting values for parameter estimation in maximum likelihood procedures. The conditions and assumptions necessary for an effective application of the method were delineated. Recent empirical results which bear on the properties of the approximations were examined. An investigation was  suggested to evaluate a further possible use of the approximations--that of their direct applicability in tailored testing procedures. (Author/DLG)",

Two types of confidence testing, Pick-One and Distribute 100 Points, were developed for comparison to conventional multiple-choice testing. The criteria for feasibility included end of block examination grades, number of student remediational sessions, and both student and instructor attitudes. In addition, the relationship of various personality variables to confidence test scores was examined for both types of confidence testing. The major finding was that while scoring was somewhat more time consuming, end of block examination grades improved slightly and the number of remediations required declined slightly when either confidence testing  method was employed. Other areas of investigation produced essentially null results. Copies of the Student Attitude Questionnaire and the Instructor Questionnaire are appended. (Author/MS)",

After selection of the training maneuvers to be studied, video tape recordings of the maneuvers were selected from video tape recordings already available from a previous research effort. Those discriminable performance events which could be observed using the video tapes were defined, and preliminary performance scales were developed to evaluate the video version of student performance. Through assessment and refining of the preliminary scales, the final pilot performance reference scales were developed. These scales were used by experienced instructor pilots to evaluate the performances shown, and results of these  evaluations were analyzed. The study indicated that (a) audio-video recordings of in-flight performance can serve as the basis for the efficient development of pilot performance reference scales; and (b) video tapes can provide sufficient information for performance evaluation purposes.

In one set of measurement problems, quantities were measured with different size units of measure. Centering on either unit size or the number of units alone lead to errors similar to those found in conservation problems. In a second set of measurement problems, quantities in different shaped containers were  measured with the same unit. Each type of problem was administered in three situations employing different combinations of equivalence and nonequivalence relations. Results are discussed in detail. (Author/MS)",

Two tasks were administered to 96 subjects in the fifth, eighth, and eleventh grades--32 at each grade level. Task I was an equivalence task comprised of a sequential presentation of eight geometric concept cards. Half the subjects were given a verbal presentation while the other half were given a pictorial presentation. Subjects were asked to explain likenesses and differences between stimuli. Task II was a free sorting exercise. Subjects were presented with a 26-item picture array, asked to select from the array cards which were alike,  and to explain the bases of their groupings. Task I responses were classified into Perceptible, Nominal, and Subject-Fiat categories; for Task II responses, only Perceptible, Attribute, and Nominal categories were used. This study found, contrary to expectation, that low SES children in grades 5, 8, and 11 do not vary significantly from one another in their bases of classifying geometric figures. Achievement, method of presentation, and sex were also found not to be a significant influence on bases of classification. (Author/AG)",

Data was obtained from surveys conducted as a part of field work to test the effectiveness of the program. The program population included 272 students who graduated from the Sequoia Union High  School District, who have either matriculated in colleges and universities or who have initiated new-found careers in various sectors of the country. Several mailings and follow-up procedures produced 136 respondents who comprised the study sample. All non-white and low income white students are eligible for the program. All that are referred by the Special College Counselors at each school are accepted. Particularly all need a detailed individual attention in order to complete various types of forms. Particularly all need financial aid. Seventy-five percent of program participants from 1969 to October 1971 are now in college. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Problems in measuring the attitudes of whites toward blacks have included: (1) Lack of contemporary content in existing measures; (2) Difficulty of determining scale validity; and, (3) The strong social reinforcement for being &quot;tolerant&quot; toward blacks making the assessment of &quot;true&quot; racial attitudes more difficult. The Situational Attitude Scale (SAS) was developed to reduce or eliminate these problems. The SAS consists of 100 semantic differential items that relate to one of ten social or personal situations. Two forms of the SAS were developed. Each contains the same situations, items, and instructions except that the word &quot;black&quot; was inserted into the situations in Form B. When the SAS is administered to white subjects randomly assigned either form, more negative responses  occur to Form B. This indicates that whites have generally negative attitudes toward blacks. This result has been obtained on several independent samples including the one employed in this study. The SAS methodology has been extended to cross-cultural comparisons and it has been found that white Danes tended to view &quot;Mediterranean foreign workers&quot; much as white Americans view blacks. It was suggested that the SAS methodolgy could be extended to many situations in attitude measurement where the investigation wishes to examine the experimental effects of one or more variables.

        "description":"If universities and colleges are to provide an optimal education for students from all cultures and backgrounds they should examine the relationships among their students. Since there has been an increase in black freshman enrollment at large universities from three percent in 1969 to four percent in 1970 and institutions are preparing students for life in a multi-cultural society, several questions may be posed: How will white students react? What are the attitudes of white students towards blacks? The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship among racial attitudes, authoritarianism, and dogmatism in white university students. Form B of the Situational Attitude Scale and the D and F Scales were administered to 233 prospective freshmen about to enter the University  of Maryland. Scores were intercorrelated to determine the relationship among student attitudes. Results indicated that whites holding negative attitudes toward blacks also tended to be more dogmatic and authoritarian than whites with more positive attitudes. Other studies done at Maryland have reported similar racial attitudes for freshmen and seniors. If an institution is committeed to preparing people to live and work in the larger society, providing for positive intercultural experiences on campus would seem to be a necessary and appropriate function. Required courses on race relations and support of student and faculty programs by the administration were suggested. (Author/JM)",

Information regarding compensatory education programs was one essential element in this inquiry. The institutions contacted were similar to Columbia in that they were predominately white four-year colleges and universities, and special attention was directed to those located in or near an urban community. Inquiries regarding courses and programs in ethnic studies, admissions policies, and supplementary or compensatory services for disadvantaged students and community-related projects were sent in the form of a questionnaire to the dean of the college or undergraduate school, and also a letter to the  university vice president for academic affairs or the college president at each institution. One hundred and twenty-five institutions, or 67 percent, responded to the requests. Other letters were sent to a sampling of major graduate and professional schools in order to ascertain how they are responding to the urgent need for more trained professionals from minority groups, as well as to the needs of the urban community. Descriptions of early and current compensatory programs, as well as those proposed or planned, were drawn from a variety of sources. Some of the programs described were instituted several years ago and were discontinued. (Author/JM)",

Practical life experiences must be provided for the child whose home may be lacking in the equipment, materials, or tools he will encounter outside that home.

The Language Arts Component was basically an individualized approach to reading instruction within each classroom in the Title I schools. A general trend in pupil performance favored Title I schools. Results from the standardized instruments used to evaluate the Mathematics Component indicated that the Title I program produced superior results in grades one, three, and four. Based on opinions expressed in principal and teacher questionnaires, the quality of guidance services improved during the year but still was not optimal. Approximately 200 paraprofessional  aides were employed. Inservice programs varied from good to weak depending on the school. Twenty-one interns served in four schools. The question is posed as to which is better, an intern or a student teacher. Augmented library services were offered in thre schools. The Nutritional Break program is in effect at all but one school. During the the school year 1969-1970, approximately 690 study trips were taken by students at the eight compensatory schools and one parochial school. Approximately 20 percent of the study trips were out of town. Although this was generally a smoothly running program, data showed that some teachers needed to be encouraged to take more advantage of this program. (JM)",

        "description":"It has recently been noted that Negro children, especially those of lower socioeconomic status, have a language system whose phonological and grammatical rules differ in predictable ways from the rules governing the standard English used by most white Americans. Four features of Negro non- standard American English have been noted with predictable regularity: zero copula, singularization of plural objects, zero possessive, and the use of &quot;be&quot; to represent time extension. The present research attempted to empirically validate the existence of these distinguishing features by having two Negro and two white examiners administer a task requiring 93 Negro and 108 white second graders to derive the present, plural, possessive, and time extension forms of nonsense syllables. In general,  the results support the hypotheses. For each dimension, white children supplied more standard English endings and Negro children more nonstandard English endings. All results were relatively independent of subjects' socioeconomic status. These findings suggest that most Negro children approach the traditional school situation with a language system whose grammar is different from, rather than deficient in relation to, that of their white peers and that of the standard tongue adopted by the school. It is recommended that more research data be collected and the results, if consistent, be incorporated into future curricula developments. (Author/JM)",

Community control is a major issue for non-white Americans who are increasingly concerned with owning and controlling those institutions that exist within the boundaries of their communities. The most relevant yet controversial issues facing social and human service agencies are those of community control and the challenge by the non-white staffs of these agencies for the leadership role in changing the agencies' images and functions in their communities, from decision-making to service delivery. There has been a general awakening of minority Americans to the neo-colonial system under which agencies operate and  minority Americans work. Where minority workers have moved into administrative positions with potential power and begun to develop viable communication with the non-white community of agency employees, the agency reaction has come under the guise of the need for economic and efficiency analyses. Use of various systems approaches has allowed agencies to control budget and policies in an attempt to stifle minority workers' demands for accountability. Such actions on the part of agency administrations point out the racist patterns that are woven throughout their systems, and that real commitments and real attempts to change will not easily come about.

For the first time it was thought absolutely essential that young people be brought into the monthly meetings to talk about their views of the four institutions or settings which have a major impact on them: the family, the public educational system, the labor market, and government. Two sessions were devoted to each of these areas. This dialogue is a composite  conversation which brings together the highlights of eight seminars. The young people appearing at the seminars did not appear as spokesme n for any particular youth population. The views they \"collected\" are admittedly random and represent a small sample. However, these preliminary surveys of important aspects of youth's relationship to our social institutions and their current reactions are a significant beginning, because they raise some very basic questions. It i s held that it is clearly apparent from beginning to end, that when we speak of youths' attitudes, there are no simple generalizations that ring true. (Author/JM)",

The participants represented diverse backgrounds and included corrections personnel, juvenile court judges, former offenders, and faculty and students from several disciplines. As the basis for the discussions, a paper on delinquency institutions by Gisela Konopka was read by all conference participants. The focus of this paper was on the need to phase out mass institutions and to replace them with a range of community based facilities, including group homes and small youth communities. She stressed that any program for delinquent youth must be geared toward the  enhancement of their self-respect. This means that only people who have a positive attitude of respect toward youth should be employed in such facilities, and that all staff members, regardless of their position or educational background, should receive training. She also suggested that community volunteers, and especially young people, should work with young delinquents in these group homes or youth communities. Finally the paper urged that stringent evaluation should accompany the implementation of any new system of treating youthful offenders. The discussion of the one-day conference was tape recorded and the dialogue was edited and reconstructed from the transcripts. (Editor/JM)",

        "description":"Anyone familiar with current internal political problems in India cannot remain sanguine about the passivity of her oppressed ethnic minorities, be they defined by caste, religion, or heritage; nor can anyone be, who looks at the long history of religious conversion and reform in India, for every success along these lines in the past 2500 years has depended largely upon the promise of ethnic emancipation. A survey of case histories of low caste households and villages lead to the following conclusions. Stigmatized ethnic identity is experienced as oppression. It is a human day-by-day experience of degradation and exploitation, not simply an abstract concept. People resent that identity and that experience regardless of the rationalizations offered for it. People continually  attempt to resist, escape, alleviate, or change that identity and that experience, even in the most unlikely circumstances--including the remote villages and urban slums of India. No account of ethnic stratification or stigmatized identity makes sense if it does not to these facts. How people respond to stigmatized ethnic identity depends upon their definitions of themselves, others, and the situations in which they interact. Not consensus on the legitmacy of systems of oppression but agreement on who has the power, and when and under what circumstances and with what effect it is likely to be used, enables them to continue.

        "description":"Higher Horizons 100 is an articulated approach to compensatory education for four groups fo approximately 100 urban students in grades seven to nine. Working through an instructional team made up of teachers and other specialists, the program is designed to motivate and encourage individual youngsters to react to a student-centered educational program. This program, which places a high degree of reliance on proven inner-city methodologies, includes in its operational repertoire: small group instruction, intensive counseling, teacher feedback, and cultural activities. The actual make-up of the 100 instructional teams have varied somewhat over the course of the program's five-year history. During the 1970-71 year, both the make-up of each center's staff and the actual conduct of  the instructional programs changed due to varying circumstances. The behavioral objectives of the programs were as follows: a significant increase in the mastery of language skills; a significant gain in writing skill ability; the achievement of a more realistic self-image toward school and society; and, the achievement of a better attendance record. The evaluation of the four team program was accomplished in terms of an overall pre-and post-test model. Test scores were obtained at the beginning and end of the school year. Gain scores were computed and assessed for statistical significance. (JM)",

        "description":"The Office of Economic Opportunity has commissioned a number of research organizations to undertake detailed studies of specific Community Action Agencies (CAAs) in conjunction with evaluation studies of the effectiveness of the programs run by these CAAs. A major difficulty in this type of research is that the variables selected for study and the techniques used to study them by the various research units may differ so widely as to rule out comparative statements about the relationships between the structure of CAAs and program effectiveness. For this reason, the Office of Economic Opportunity commissioned the Bureau of Applied Social Research to develop an inventory of key variables which would describe and differentiate CAAs and which would, presumably, be relevant to the  effectiveness of CAA programs. In carrying out this assignment, the Bureau undertook a careful review of the organizational literature, concentrating not only on organizational theory, but also on the literature analyzing the structure of action agencies and the particular problems encountered by newly created organizations. As the project developed it became increasingly clear that standard instruments ought to be developed for collecting information on these variables. As a result the Bureau interpreted as part of its assignment the development of a series of basic interview schedules to be administered to members of the CAA board and staff. Interview guides were also developed for local informants and heads of various local organizations having potential relevance to the operation of  the CAA. (JM)",

Their most recent efforts have focused on the training of teachers and teacher aides. A project of Education Development Center in Newton, Massachusetts, the Pilot Communities Program has functioned as the New England Regional Laboratory of the Office of Education. The specific project reported here involves an experimental program designed to teach junior high school students how to make films. The program was in operation at the Lincoln Junior High  School, in Washington D.C. for two years, 1967-1969. It involved only small numbers of teachers and a great deal of time, energy, and money from outside organizations. Its purpose was to attempt a change in the learning climate of the school. Film-making seemed to offer a natural bridge between teachers and students, because interest in it came naturally to both groups. The students who grew up in the Cardozo neighborhood of Washington, D.C.--like students everywhere--had seen at least 10 times as many movies as the number of books they read and had spent many more hours watching TV than sitting in a classroom. They watch every program, whether they like it or not. Teachers learned by testing that the students had remarkably accurate visual memories. (Author/JM)",

The major objectives of the program were: (1) to increase proficiency in reading; (2) to increase general achievement and stimulate motivation for school work by improving reading skills; (3) to make the corrective reading work more effective by encouraging reinforcement of reading work in the home classroom; and, (4) to encourage parents to actively participate in the pupils' reading program. Evaulation data was collected from a stratified sample of 30 schools, proportionally representing each type of school receiving program services. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"During the academic year 1968-69, the ESEA Title I sponsored &quot;Teaching English as a Second Language in the Public Schools&quot; (in the New York City Board of Education) was in its second of a projected three year program. The programs under this grant which are being considered in this evaluation are the Pilot Projects Using Linguistically-Oriented Materials and the Reception Class Project (Non-English). The focus for the former is on a linguistic approach to the teaching of beginning reading and, for the latter, on teaching English to non-English speaking pupils (especially new arrivals from Puterto Rico) on helping them adjust to school life, and on teaching the basic skills. The purpose of the evaluation was to determine the effectivness of the teaching and learning situation as  it involved the cited programs and to determine the effectiveness of the materials themselves with reference to the particular group of students with whom they were being used, namely students of English as a Second Language. Since such standardized tests as the Metropolitan Reading Tests are of doubtful validity when used with non-native speakers of English because of the linguistic problems involved, it was decided that no normalized instruments would be used during the second year of the evaluation. The basic data was provided by interviewing program personnel, questionnaires for the teachers, and an intensive analysis of the text materials used in the programs. (Author/JM)",

Application of the concepts of individualized instruction was one of the basic means by which the Neighborhood Educational Center (NEC) Project was to achieve its goals. Developmental activities required for the implementation of an instructional system so oriented included the production of three essential types of components: behaviorally stated objectives, prescriptive packages, and assessment instruments. Student performance data on the NEC objectives are summarized and disseminated in two ways: individual profiles and cluster  profiles. These are the bases for information relevant to the implementation, evaluation, and modification of the NEC process. Major emphasis regarding organization for instruction has been placed upon the implementation of the cluster concept as the basic instructional unit in the NEC project. The cluster is intended to provide flexibility, which in turn supports individualization of instruction. A cooperative and supportive relationship exists among the NEC teachers and administrative staff. An important outcome of the NEC project is the verbalized willingness of teachers and administrators to be accountable for student success on the NEC instructional objectives, something quite different from accountability for a standardized test score.

        "description":"What North Americans term \"race\" is not structurally isomorphic to and, thus, not synonymous with what Latin Americans apply the term to. The social identities determined by \"race\", and consequently the expected behavior ascribed to these identities, are so dissimilar that meetings between persons of both cultures produce uncertainty and discord. In both the United States and Latin America, the racial phenomenon emerges from cultural assumptions which attribute function as identity credentials for the social structure, and what expectations are ascribed to such identities. Given the fact that what are dealt with are cultures based on such unlike assumptions, it is difficult to understand why the elementary principle of cultural relativism is ignored, only to fall into rampant  ethonocentrism. Particular attention is given to the case of Puerto Rico. Although the North American image of the Puerto Rican is of a human unaware of racism and accepting of a non-white identity, the reality is quite different. The social and political implications of racial characteristics in Puerto Rico became accentuated through the Puerto Rican's misunderstanding of what to a North American constitutes membership in a racial category other than white.

This evaluation deals with the academic year 1970-71, the second full year of the project's evaluation. Most important among the goals of Project KAPS is the reduction of the dropout rate in the seven target schools. There were four other overall goals: (1) to increase attendance in the KAPS Kluster; (2) to increase project participants' achievement scores; (3) to increase critical thinking; and, (4) to effect positive attitude changes. KAPS is unique among Federally-funded projects in the Baltimore City Public School system. On a cost-per-pupil basis, the KAPS budget of $827,000 for  1970-71 is well-endowed in relation to ESEA Title I in Baltimore: $520-plus for each KAPS student as opposed to a Title I projection of less than $300 per target child. In addition, the Project is highly concentrated involving only seven inner-city elementary and secondary schools, the furthest apart of which are still within walking distance of each other. The overall student population of approximately 7,000 is very well defined, as in the community to be involved and served--the Broadway corridor in East Baltimore. (Authors/JM)",

Specifically, cognitive, demographic, learning, material, method, perceptual, and teacher characteristic data were considered to be of prime importance. The first generalization that may be drawn from this extensive research is that such preschool programs may and frequently do have positive effects on the cognitive functioning of economically deprived children. However, there is no single program, curriculum, or approach that appears to provide outstanding advantages. tTeacher personality factors,  organizational skills, and teaching ability appeared to play the decisive role in children's performance. Observations made of classroom procedures and of reactions to teacher in-service meetings tended to point to morale and commitment to the programs as highly influential factors influencing teachers' reactions to the program and their attitudes toward the children. This may be of special importance in such programs as this because of their experimental nature. (Author/JM)",

This is demonstrated using data collected by questionnaire and participant observation in an urban Roman Catholic secondary school in the American North-East, where the students are predominantly Polish-American origin. Like culture in the broader, more definitive sense, a school has a history and, thus, certain historically derived values, expectations, and a place in its community setting. These tend to greatly influence not only the school's relation to its students but also its relation to parents and the community as a whole. Thus, the staff, of predominantly German and Irish  background, tends to stereotype students according to perceived ethnic origin despite high ethnic heterogeneity. Student apathy is explained by theories of \"broken homes\" or \"Polishness.\" Choice of school program for girls is highly predictable along ethnic lines. The value of higher education for girls is negatively reinforced in the Polish-American family, providing functional congruity with the school. (Author/JM)",

Twenty-eight percent of the residents of medium and large sized metropolitan cities lived in poverty areas. The majority of nonmetropolitan residents lived in small cities or towns and only one-seventh lived on farms. In 1967, 40 percent of the urban population 14 years old and over were nonmigrants (people who  had never lived more than 50 miles away from their current residence), and another 40 percent were migrants of urban background. Since 1947, about 20 percent of the population have changed their place of residence. Population growth has slowed since 1950 because of a drop in the birth rate; the annual rate of increase from 1964 to 1969 was 1.2 percent--only half of the increase in the 1950's. (BC)",

Since most of the literature on the subject deals only in simple, logical theoretical discussion, this study attempted to answer critics through a practical implementation of the concept to ascertain if differentiated staffing could achieve school district dollar cost saving without a significant negative change in teacher morale and/or without a significant reduction in student achievement. Fifteen differentiated staff teams collaborated in  one school district, and a group of traditional teachers functioned as the control unit. The dollar difference was computed to be less than 1 percent of the total cost; none of the schools reported a lower teacher morale during the first year of the team operation; and, in terms of cognitive growth, those students team taught remained at least on a par with their control groups.

Although directed primarily at the architect and the building team, this material can also be useful to those who contemplate using building systems. Building systems are considered part of a more comprehensive systems approach to design and construction emphasizing the importance of the procedures and techniques of application. The first section surveys means of learning about the use of building systems, and the second describes a generalized model of a project that utilizes building systems and includes discussions of programing, design, and multistage bidding. The text is supported by sample bidding sheets, drawings,  letters of intent, and a 29-item annotated bibliography. (Author/MLF)",

Effective educational planning can work only if all elements of the community are involved in the decisionmaking process, the relevant factors and variables in the educational environment are considered, and the nature of the learning/teaching process in education is understood. As proposed, SIMU-SCHOOL would use simulation techniques to recreate the educational planning process. By utilizing a management information system as an educational tool, SIMU-SCHOOL would create a time-compressed simulation of a series of planning problems. Using this simulation technique, educational and community planners could become involved and would experience the results of their decisions within a few  days instead of several years.

Findings indicated that the five judges evaluating the students' art products made judgments highly correlated with each other as reported on the significant correlation matrix. A second finding was that both correlational analysis and analysis of variance showed significant relationships between art quality improvement and changes toward complexity in figure preference with positive changes in development of syntax as measured by the Stanford Achievement  Test scales for word meaning, paragraph meaning, and arithmetic computation skills. The third finding was that a correlation existed in some instances among scores on the Welsh Figure Preference Test art scale and low scores on art product judgments. (CB)",

Focus is on normal preschool development up through 5 years of age. Aims are to help the child function at maximum level by providing practical suggestions to parents for stimulating the child's development (behavioral and perceptual motor skills in particular). Discussed are selection of families for home care services and assessment rationale. An extensive assessment battery is presented as a basis for treatment planning, utilizing techniques of occupational therapy. The battery, with a graduated rating system, encompasses six skill areas: basic senses and functions, perceptual motor, fine motor, gross motor,  behavioral, and daily living activities. It applies to children functioning from 3 months to 6 years of age.

Involved were 25 parents whose children were on the waiting list for admission to the Colin Anderson Center, a West Virginia state institution for the retarded. After a 3-day workshop on the fundamentals of operant conditioning, parents kept progress recordings of their daily work at home training their child in a particular self help skill for 1 month. Then each parent met with the investigator of the project to discuss the training and to have filmed the parent's demonstration of  how they taught their children. Following evaluation of the filmed technique, parents returned home to work with their child for another month on the same or another skill. With the help of films made of parent demonstrations after the second month, parents recognized the progress which they and their children had made. Included in the report are five uneditied parental descriptions of how they trained their child on dressing and toilet training skills. (KW)",

The author's premise is that all children need to understand themselves and their world in order to understand those similar and dissimilar to them; how different children gain this understanding may differ. Educational programs are said to have three criteria: congruency of learning activity with child's nature, consideration given to best known theories about cognitive development, and content relevancy. The nature of projected educational program is shown to include learning about natural and social sciences, learning the concept of space, which is accompanied by suggestions for a directed teaching situation, development of concepts and language,  introduction to the concept of roadside market as economics, which includes suggested teaching methods, progression from meanings to oral language to reading, and mathematics. Discussion of the role of humanities in children's programs includes the value of great literature for children, effective music programs for children, support for sensory motor experiences, and an example study on the wind as a use of poetry for kindergarten students.

Covered are studies on haptic perception of form, the matching of perceptual data and motor information, Kephart's perceptual-motor theory, and supporting data for this theory from phsiological investigations. Such supporting data includes research on the concept of motor engrams, defined in physiological terms as a structural change in the nervous system effected by an experience. For visually handicapped children, the concept of motoric engrams is seen as an essential learning modality for motor orientation and spatial perception. Four motor generalizations significant in the education  of blind children are delineated: balance and posture, contact, locomotion, and receipt and propulsion. Concluded is the importance of establishing spatial orientation intrinsically through gross motor movements in early childhood (gross motor engramming as a learning modality for interacting with one's environment). All children are seen to need gross motoric engrams as foundations for spatial-perceptual development, with the blind urgently needing motoric environmental interaction as a readiness base for mobility.

Instruction as part of a communications system among teacher and pupils is illustrated. Target population of the present project is said to be underachieving boys with severe discipline problems, aged 10 to 15 years. The taxonomy is shown to limit its concern to the pupil's engagement in absorbing adaptive basic skills and concepts. Skills are broken  into subskills and then translated into instructional materials and non-material instructional stimuli. The taxonomy is shown to permit diagnostic teaching with stated goals of individualization and personalization. Basic skills in the field of reading are: cognitive-perceptual, language analysis, comprehension, and study skills. Structure and function of the taxonomic model are explained, followed by applications, of which the main one is said to be a tool for lesson planning. (See also EC 040 216 and EC 040 218.) (CB)",

        "description":"The sixth in a series of eight reports on mental retardation in a Canadian province recorded in detail the research methodology used in acquisition of epidemiological data (incidence and disease control) and in depth knowledge of mental retardation as it occurred in the target population. In addition to attitudinal, demographic, and other variables, the procedure was explained to allow for raw and/or scaled scores for psychometric, and conceptual and social maturation. The project was designed to facilitate subsequent and more intensive analysis of test items and methodological variables. Eleven data cards were used, with the total number for each individual subject varying according to age and household status. Card types 01 and 02 referred to household data and card types 03  through 11 included individual subject data. Data for the 11 cards were included in the report. A glossary of terms and definitions concluded the work. Rationale for test and individual data was discussed in the other reports.

Isolation of subsamples of the mentally retarded as well as samples of subjects having higher psychometric, conceptual and social maturity scores was said to require identification of subjects by standard deviation ranges from means of age/sex groups for raw scores on the WISC, SMS, and DAP.

The subjects were presented with a CAI task consisting of difficult mathematical problems. The subject's A-state during the task and number of errors he made on the task were the dependent variables in the study. The hypothesized relationship between dogmatism and A-state was not confirmed. When A-trait was controlled for, subjects did not differ in the level of A-state displayed during the experiment, regardless of their level of dogmatism. As hypothesized, high A-trait subjects had significantly higher levels of A-state during  the experiment than low A-trait subjects. Although neither A-trait nor dogmatism was related to errors on the CAI task, a significant interactive effect between mathematics ability and A-state on performance was observed. (JY)",

First, it would be a media facilities center, offering materials, classes, and studios for the production of programs. Because it would have a professional staff, the Center would also be a source of expertise to the community. Another function of the Center would be to coordinate and combine community resources to serve the varied needs of the community. Looking further into the future, other functions that the urban Telecommunications Center might be performing 10 years from now could be controlling traffic patterns, providing a two-way-video system for interpersonal communication, and supplying a myriad of other public functions. If these Centers are to function as the coordinators of the future  electronic culture, we will have to acquire new skills and understandings to deal with advances in technology. It is hoped that the Telecommunications Center will become a place of art as well as information, so that knowledge can be conveyed efficiently, but with humanity, grace, and humor as well. (SH)",

While this may be true of commercial television, the same poll indicated that viewers of public broadcasting programs pay more attention and are more involved in the programs. The CPB suggests that this is because the plots of many commercial television programs tend to be very predictable, while those of public broadcasting programs are not. Other polls reported by the Corporation indicate that since 1965, there has been a 23 percent increase in audience size for public broadcasting, with 38 percent of households interviewed having watched a  public television station in the last week. A dramatic increase in public television viewing was found for minority groups--this is probably due to the fact that \"Sesame Street\" is beginning to penetrate into these households. Additional findings were that median hours watched per week increased from 1.5 to 1.9 percent, that public television viewers are more selective in their viewing, and that public television is seen as less biased than commercial stations.

The subjects were low-ability students in first- and second-year typing classes. The programed instruction featured: little practice at ordinary stroking skills, early introduction of vocational typing tasks, explicit instruction in making decisions about attractive placement of materials on the page, and in-class practice on the typewriter in making these decisions. Tests showed that faster typing was produced by conventional instruction. However, for the most consequential criterion of proficiency, form errors, programed instruction was by far the more effective. Also, the level of work quality after one year of programed instruction was far higher than after two years of  conventional instruction. Although teachers reported much &quot;live&quot; reteaching of programed placement concepts, its contribution appears modest, judging by comparison of the performances of frequently absent and infrequently absent students. Teachers also estimated student attitudes towards the program as negative and the program not well suited to low-ability traniees. (Author/JK)",

Two other papers were presented which reinforced the notion of radical change. One reported the development of a single centralized agency to supply computing to all the campuses in a single state; the other described the development of an independent corporation to supply computing to the university and other agencies, both  educational and commercial. Thirteen parallel discussions followed the presentation of these papers. They looked at ways to perserve the existing forms of campus computer centers and at radical alternatives; the computer center as an independent organization; the regional center as an alternative to the on-campus computer; the ultimate concept of a national network of computer centers.

The AVSIN system is conceived of as a cooperative public-private sector effort in which a non-profit instructional satellite corporation controls the satellite, but in which software is made available to schools on a competitive basis. Using AVSIN as a point of departure,other alternative organizational schemes and the possible future role of existing organizations involved in public and instructional television are discussed. An appendix contains an assessment of  long-range social and political implications which a large-scale instructional satellite system may have for United States education. Particular attention is given to requirements for providing equality of educational opportunity. (Author/JY)",

        "description":"In the slightly over twelve years since its inception, computer-based instruction (CBI) has shown the promise of being more cost-effective than traditional instruction for certain educational applications. Pilot experiments are underway to evaluate various CBI systems. Should these tests prove successful, a major problem confronting advocates of large-scale CBI utilization is the conflict between the organization of traditional school systems and optimal methods of utilizing CBI. Large-scale and intensive utilization is the key to low per-pupil costs. Some means of low-cost telecommunications must be found if rural communities and sparsely populated regions are to benefit. Communication satellites seem to hold distinct advantages over existing commercial telephone communications  for linking remote terminal clusters with a central computer where computer-cluster separation is 150-200 miles or greater. This memorandum includes a discussion of the larger issues involved in CBI and a summary of experiments and costs of a variety of CBI experiments and approaches. (Author/JY)",

The test reliabilities were computed by the split-half technique and then corrected by the Spearman-Brown Prophecy Formula; they range from 0.96 to 0.99. Since all the 38 items loaded heavily on the first factor (the construct of concern) it can be concluded that the test is factorially \"pure\" and unidimensional. In addition to this, since many of the items in the test refer directly to attitudes toward ITV, it can be  concluded that the underlying factor extracted is relevant to the purpose of the test, and construct validity is thus established.

But before programs are produced (target date: September, 1973),  several tasks must be completed: gather more information on the projected audience, do curriculum research, create liaisons with public broadcasters and adult educators, plan quality programs.

Each subject listened to two tapes and then took achievement tests on the material. Results showed that students who could control their tape recorders learned more. A significantly positive correlation between learning achievement and the number of times the learner used the controls was found. Also, the addition of individual  controls for pacing the instruction significantly aided learning. Most of the subjects preferred the situations where controls were available and disliked the absence of controls.

Nine dioceses are already using instructional television fixed service (ITFS) distribution systems. The uses of ITFS are listed, and the ITFS system is compared with five others: commercial television, cable television, microwave transmission, cassettes and cartridge television, and the &quot;tele-cyclopedia&quot; concept of transmission. The comparison suggests that although 50 dioceses could profitably use the ITFS system, no one system is the best for every diocese.

The general orientation of the studies was to extend the concepts of imaginal and verbal coding systems to include individual differences in symbolic habits. Thus all the studies took into account the learner's ability to use the imaginal strategy, which was called imagery-ability, as the primary individual difference variable. The results of the studies suggest that imaginal processing is more effective for the learning of concrete words and verbal processing is more effective for the learning of abstract words. Another conclusion from these investigations is that imagery-ability reflects the ability of the learner to process  the information by verbal or by imaginal strategies. The implications of these studies for the everyday process of education are that imagery-ability can be measured from tests involving manipulation of objects in space, that the acquisition of new concepts can be facilitated by providing direct experience prior to the provision of a verbal label, and that students with low imagery-abilities are severly handicapped when they are forced to employ imaginal rather than verbal strategies.

A second study investigated the effects of different recall intervals under notetaking and no-notetaking conditions on the immediate and delayed recall of instructional material. The results of the study imply that notetaking has little value in situations in which written instructional materials are presented and the  notes taken cannot be used in later review.

They approached potential vendors of equipment for such a system and obtained cost estimates. Based on their survey they recommended that WSU take the initiative in establishing a model or prototype system. The proposed system would eventually cover the state of  Washington and would include one and two-way television communication and channels for voice communication, data, teletype, and facsimile reproduction. They estimated that the university would use the system for 177 hours per week and thus would require two duplex broadband dedicated channels.

The rules for the first of these, television broadcast signal carriage, are outlined in terms of three classifications which would divide all signals: mandatory carriage, minimum service, and additional service. The second general area offers policies concerning access to and use of nonbroadcast cable channels and emphasizes that cable operators should construct systems with a bandwidth which will ensure the availability of nonbroadcast services and the capacity for two-way communication. The third general area discusses technical standards which should be made applicable to CATV systems,  requiring that a signal meet standards of minimum technical performance on its arrival at any subscriber's terminal. Finally, concerning the fourth general area of Federal-State relationships, the FCC specifies minimum requirements in the local CATV franchising process. A dissenting statement made by one of the Commissioners is appended, as well as a list of the major television markets and a chart of cable signal carriage in major markets. (SH)",

Some of the major findings were that overall, about 77 percent of time is devoted to program content and 23 percent to announcements of various kinds; that commercial announcements (CA's)--product and program promotion--account for almost 19 percent of total time; that there were more commercials within programs than between programs; that CA's were evenly divided among four major categories--toys, cereals, candy, and other foods; that CA's appear to have both sexual and racial biases; and that little product information is given in the CA's. Other findings were that noncommercial  announcements were primarily either youth-oriented or for medical or environmental causes, and some of these did not appear to be appropriate for children. Also, when individual cartoons and other program segments were studied in detail for subject matter, it was found that 64 percent of the dramatic programming was in some sense violent, while 67 percent of nondramatic segments dealt with science and technology, race and nationality, literature and fine arts, and nature. However, 77 percent of total programming was drama, with only 12 percent informational. (SH)",

In response to the television industry's reaction to this petition ACT undertook the analysis of current commercial content on several popular shows for children. One of these, Romper Room, was viewed for one week in March of 1971. It was found that &quot;when time spent playing with brand-named toys and giving plugs or credits is added to the product commercials, the total commercial time averaged 47 percent and amounted to as much as 69 percent of total programming.&quot; A more extensive study (EM009312) which covered four Boston Stations on a Saturday morning indicated that cartoons and violence  continue to dominate programming, that the subject matter is impoverished and imbalanced, and that commercial content ranged from 17 to 25 percent, with another 23 percent being devoted to nonprogram matter. ACT also suggests bias in the Roper study which found public satisfaction with the amount of commercial content.

Residential segregation between linguistic and ethnic groups is determined by the index of dissimilarity; this index has been applied to the French and British populations and to the French-speaking and English-speaking populations in Montreal. Certain basic sociolinguistic principles become evident. The mother tongue is a far more powerful determinant of ethnic residence than is a language acquired later in life. The paramount factor influencing location is proximity to ethnic compatriots. The bilinguals in each ethnic group tend to locate in areas where their  monolingual compatriots are found. The continued maintenance of the various language groups reduces the need for bilingualism. The linguistic outcome in a diverse city such as Montreal is closely intertwined with the residential pattern among language groups. (VM)",

The step from speech to reading could best be made at the structural level. The emphasis at this point should be on sentence structure and the student should be taught to develop the ability to interpret the complexity of the thought processes as expressed in simple, compound, and complex sentences. Situational rather than linguistic grading should be emphasized, that is, it is necessary to describe the learner's experience. Writing, thus, becomes another method of communication. The student must also control pronunciation, intonation, and rhythmic features to develop his ability to read with appropriate speed and comprehension. Rather than  learning vocabulary, the student must learn intonation, function order in sentence patterns, structure words, and word-form changes. Once the student has been trained up to the sentence level, the next steps can lead him to developing critical reading skills. (Author/VM)",

This is evident in governmental publications and in the shortwave transmissions of the official broadcasting station. Four sources of the change can be determined: the influence of classical Marxism and socialism, the influence of Leninism and later developments in Marxist-Leninist theory, the influence of Russian terminology as developed in the Soviet Union, and the influence of governmental and party institutions. Almost all of the change in East Germany has been based upon state philosophy. The most frequent type of change is a narrowing of semantic field accompanied by a  considerable increase in frequency of usage. Different terms may, thus, be applied to overtly similar acts performed by socially and philosophically opposed groups. (VM)",

A surface-structure constraint, according to David Perlmutter, can be seen as a template which serves as a filter at some level after the transformational component. In the case of Hungarian cooccurrence of noun phrases and verbs in a clause, the constraint operates after the input to the phonological component and determines whether a sentence will be grammatical or not. The constraint declares that, if a clause contains an indefinite noun phrase in the accusative case and a finite verb, the verb has to be in the indefinite conjugation. The constraint operates in addition to the verb-object agreement rule. A similar constraint seems to be operative also in English.  (VM)",

The problems in designing computer programs to construct poetry include considerations in generating well-formed sentences which have the added restrictions that poetry requires: meter, rhyme, logic, diction, subject matter, and imagery. These restrictions are phonological and semantic. At the present stage of development of semantic theory, such linguistic features as imagery are of minor interest for poetry generation. The basic difficulty in poetry generation is introducing enough uncertainty to insure variety in the resultant output without violating the constraints that govern well-formed sentences. Numerous linguistic restrictions can be  added to computer programs to refine the poetic output. Generating computer poetry underlines the curious behavior of familiar words in unfamiliar combinations. In poetry, metaphor is readily accepted as an alternative to calling a sentence nonsensical. Metaphor is thought to be the special creation of the poet; this presents a curious problem when the poet is a computer. (Author/VM)",

The structure is designed to represent underlying semantic meanings that, with a lexicon and a grammar, can generate natural-language sentences in a linguistically justifiable manner. The semantics of natural English can be defined as a system of conditions and transformations applied to syntactic constituents to map them into semantic structures. A semantic structure for a statement is defined as a system of unambiguous representations of meaning interconnected by defined logical relations. The author feels that a semantic representation should probably be completely free of its natural-language representation. The correspondence between semantic structure and  natural-language representation should reside wholly in the grammar and the lexicon.

He reports on the contacts that he made and the programs that he observed. He gives his general impressions of the English-language activity in each location and makes several recommendations as a result of his trip. Students should be taught the right sound first and the applicable rule later. Composition should be taught as a creative and spontaneous process; writing should not be approached from the basis of rules laid down by an authoritative book. There should be a great deal more participation by the class in the entire learning process. Teaching of English should be undertaken to help students understand, evaluate, and influence,  intelligently and constructively, this rapidly changing world. English instruction should be concerned with the achievement of accurate communication. (Author/VM)",

Risk taking, change, and creativity should characterize the approach to bilingual education. Traditional ideas about language learning may not be suitable. It is not necessarily true that children cannot learn a second language unless it is taught to them. The behavioristic, audiolingual approach may not be the best for the bilingual child. Bilingual educators should not be overly concerned about the orthodoxy of their methods. The corrective approach to language teaching may not be the most appropriate one for the young bilingual child. Promoting psychosocial growth involves educating teachers and generating community involvement.

The study had three main tasks. The first problem was to develop a battery of test items that would be subject to varying degrees of interference and that would be sensitive to a wide range of responses of children between three and six. The second task was to compare the responses of two groups of children, one with expected low language proficiency and one with expected high language proficiency, on the newly devised tests and on a battery of standard tests designed to measure language proficiency. The  third step was to study the data and discover the implications for improved educational methods for children with language learning problems, especially those from minority groups. Included are details on personnel, test administration, experimental and standard tests, analysis of the data, conclusions, and implications for further studies. Tables give the statistical results; examples of the experimental test items are provided along with administrative details and references. (VM)",

Two types of language laboratories (recording and nonrecording) are examined to determine the effect of each upon the cultural-orientation scores of the students. The scores of the two laboratory groups are also compared with scores of a precollege control group. The experiment measures students' cultural orientation, i.e., student empathy with foreign people, their form of government, and general acceptance of their ethos. Tests used in the experiment were modifications of those used by Scherer and Wertheimer in their experiments in this area. Concluding remarks focus on statistical procedures used in the  analysis of data derived from the tests. (RL)",

The second paper, \"Student Participation in Governance,\" by Harold L. Hodgkinson discusses: the pros and cons of student participation in high school and university governance; the changes that have taken place over the  past 10 years, some of the consequences of increased student participation; and different models of student participation. The last paper, \"Access and Accommodation in Higher Education,\" by K. Patricia Cross deals with: the changing philosophies of access; the shift in emphasis from access in the 1960's to accommodation in the 1970's; the limitations of existing educational models; new models of education; and recommendations for policies and programs to institute new educational models, including projections of the effects upon youth and society if the new models are not developed.

Research on the program is being conducted by the American Council on Education (ACE) and CUNY. ACE has collected data on numerous variables pertaining to student socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, as well as attitudinal information  derived from questionnaires and interviews. Interviews have also been conducted with administrators and some faculty to assess the different ways in which each campus has implemented open admissions. The research will focus on: (1) characteristics of support services most closely associated with attrition rates; (2) components of remedial programs that have the greatest impact on improving skills; and (3) attitudinal and performance changes over the first year.

An effort was also made  to evaluate the relevance of existing governmental programs to scientific and technological capabilities of Negro schools.

The students were asked what they thought of the OA policy; and whether the policy had made a difference in their going to college. The results indicated that student attitudes toward OA were predominantly favorable. Career Students were most favorable, and senior college students the least favorable. Career students were more  likely than senior college students to say that OA had made a difference to them. One half of the OA students in senior colleges said that OA had made no difference to them.

        "description":"Student unrest has always been a concomitant of student life, going as far back as 1200 and 1229 when students were killed in Paris during town-gown battles. Much of the student unrest in early America was simply a matter of youthful high spirits, though there were some serious cases often involving mass rebellion. The greatest single cause for student rebellion was probably the food situation which caused students at both Harvard and Yale to stage a mass protest. Student grievances were also expressed over the rigid curriculum and harsh disciplinary measures. Unrest in the early days was generally confined to the Ivy League and Southern institutions, and in addition to the rigidity of the discipline, was caused by the influence of social and political flux in the emerging  nation, the clash of Southern and Northern life styles (there were many Southern students in Northern institutions), and the failure of the institutions to keep pace with rapid social change. The root causes of contemporary student protest do not differ sharply from those of the earlier period. Eighty-two percent of the disorders in 1964-65 and 66 percent of the disorders in 1967-68 were directed specifically at institutional problems; this was true for Columbia and the Harvard strike. Both in the earlier and present period, rebellions began when use of legitimate channels of expression of dissatisfaction brought no result. (AF)",

It also discusses the WICHE-PMS program classification structure that has been developed to provide a consistent means of identifying and organizing the activities of higher education in a program-oriented manner. The basic issue revolves around whether the grouping of an institution's activities (particularly those related to instruction) into discipline divisions and discipline specialties is a more appropriate output-oriented format than grouping the activities by degrees.

These objectives can be achieved only if there is agreement on using in-service training funds for programs with measurable outcomes, finding training with ultimate applicability to student learning, and supporting the instructor in his efforts to seek self-betterment through in-service training. An implementation model based on both program and instructor evaluation is put  forth. The \"right-to-creative-failure\" is stressed as a means of insuring imaginative professional behavior from instructors. Finally, this is related to student desires for what constitutes a \"good\" and \"bad\" instructor.

This has resulted in tighter restrictions on the educational dollar, causing most administrators to look for ways to become efficient as well as effective in operating educational programs. Increasing emphasis on Program Planning and Budgeting Systems (PPBS) as a methodology for analyzing financial needs has forced educators to seek, for the first time, measurable outputs related to the institution's basic purposes. Data from exemplary community colleges were analyzed to: (1) identify and investigate institutional and community input variables, and specified community college output  variables, (2) determine relationships between input and output variables, and (3) seek to identify implications of existing relationships. The primary purpose of the study was (1) the identification of significant variables existing in real situations, (2) discovering relationships among the variables, and (3) laying a groundwork for later, more systematic and rigorous testing of hypotheses. Spearman rank order coefficients of correlation were calculated relating each input with each output variable, and the level of significance of each coefficient was determined. A number of conclusions and implications based on the study, are discussed. (AL)",

Comprehensive community junior colleges traditionally offer two years of university-parallel work plus additional courses in occupational education, continuing education for adults, and community service programs. They also serve the special needs of communities. Programs included in the Arkansas comprehensive community junior colleges are university-parallel, occupational, technical, vocational, adult, community service, and general education. An important part of the total curriculum is a viable and effective guidance and counseling service. The statewide plan for Arkansas community junior colleges began in 1964, setting minimum standards for the  establishment of community junior college districts. Four basic criteria must be met to insure adequate site size, sufficient number of students, sound levels of local tax support, and a proper district size to permit students to commute. It is stipulated that no Arkansas community college be permitted to become a 4-year institution and no dormitories be built. Guidelines for developing a junior college are discussed and a long-range plan suggests that eventually every Arkansas county be included; this would bring the opportunity for post-high school education within commuting distance of all state residents.

Here, that concept has been related to the Omnibus Personality Inventory (OPI) scales in a study of several hundred freshmen in three California community colleges. These students responded to a survey that included both personality and demographic items. Responses of subjects were tabulated and rated as having high, medium, and low Functional Potential. The OPI was also administered and profiles based on the mean scores were compared with the three Functional Potential groups. Comparisons  were also made on the basis of sex, age, college attendance, and major field of interest, as well as on pre- and post-testing. Certain significant relationships were found between the Functional Potential model and the OPI profiles, suggesting the usefulness of this approach in further investigations of college students.

The historical approach used such methodologies as: (1) cohort, or percentage of survival, (2) curve-fitting, (3) ratio-method, and (4) correlation-analysis. However, the new perspective outlined in this discussion views enrollment as the product of demands for educational services by the student population, mediated by the operations of the college. Four major process areas are defined and discussed as appropriate to the new enrollment projection method. They are (1) definitions and formulas pertinent to the projection model, (2) outline of appropriate procedures for enrollment forecasting, (3) analysis of  current enrollment context, and (4) collection and analysis of necessary institutional and demographic data. The major difficulty in implementing this new method is the quantification of the effects of various limiting and stimulating variables on enrollment. In discussing the four major process areas, an operational definition for each variable is offered and used in a step-by-step procedure illustrating the new principles. Although this treatment of enrollment forecasting is new in relationship to the historical or classical methods, it does not claim to be final or definitive. Rather, it is advanced as an alternative procedure for viewing the problem of enrollment forecasting. (Author/AL)",

A summary of major trends in curriculum development uses seven categories: (1) growth of a third major division in the junior college curriculum; (2) greater influence from social-political upheavals; (3) expansion of vocational-technical curriculums; (4) continued innovation; (5) use of instructional objectives in curriculum development; (6) articulation; and (7) evaluation. Statewide and nationwide surveys were concerned with identifying post-secondary needs, classification of courses by transfer, occupational, and  comprehensive, and the role of music in the junior college. Articulation planners were recommended to solve the problems of advanced placement, transfer, state planning, and junior college research. Curriculum innovation centered on developing new uses of products commonly associated with educational media. Research into basic studies programs indicated that, now that they had progressed beyond the \"Subject A\" course concept, students tended to achieve greater success. Other work showed that, in addition to basic studies, ethnic studies and ethnic problems are becoming a permanent part of the junior college curriculum. At the same time, vocational education has become more work-study oriented. (AL)",

Such an institution would increase the relevancy of education to many of today's youth and more deeply involve them in the surrounding community. As such, the community and problems associated with its socio-economic structure would constitute the college's core curriculum. Several information collection and dissemination activities would be basic to the school's programs. They would (1) provide  channels for information flow about the community's life and economy, (2) examine alternative ways of solving community problems, (3) examine ways of developing community resources, and (4) stimulate a community information influx from worldwide sources about similar problems. Six staff members are critical to the organization's administration: (1) librarian, (2) technical director, (3) research coordinator, (4) counselor, (5) community coordinator, and (6) general secretary.

In particular, this proposed relationship is based on the learning center's special concern with facilitating student learning and, as such, on becoming an intercessory for clients with academic grievances. The campus ombudsman primarily receives students' complaints, effecting solutions for legitimate grievances. Good learning centers provide all who want to learn with access to available resources at any time in their academic career. Concern with academic survival and association with high-risk students, innovative educational media, and personnel concerned with innovative educational techniques have made the learning center  staff ad hoc academic ombudsmen. Learning center personnel are essentially pragmatic and want to help students improve basic skills. Because of their functional role in the campus organization, learning centers become refuges for high-risk and usually disadvantaged students. This student group usually has the greatest number of problems. Current education is highly hardware/software-oriented. Appropriate use of these tools and techniques is best directed by learning center staff. As a result, the learning center staff seem more appropriate as academic ombudsmen than deans of students or departmental deans. (Author/AL)",

The belief persists among teachers, in spite of objective research, that small classes are better. Here, it was hypothesized that (1) class size might influence academic achievement, and that (2) students assigned to a class size they preferred would do better than those not so assigned; it was also hypothesized that students would do better on their preferred exam type. The effect of cognitive style variables on each other and on academic achievement was also considered. The ultimate aim was to help match particular students with particular classes so that learning could be  maximized. The sample used in this study consisted of 250 students enrolled in Introductory Sociology with approximately equal numbers of males and females. All students received large class instruction, but some were also broken into small seminar discussion groups. The same teacher taught both sections. Results were obtained for: (1) Cognitive Style Measures, (2) Class Size, Test Preference and Class Preference, and (3) Cognitive Styles and Achievement. One of the major points these findings suggested was that what a student says he prefers in terms of tests and type of class may have nothing to do with his performance within these areas. Preference appeared to be independent of performance. It may be important, however, to allow teachers to pick the class size they feel most  comfortable with. (AL)",

        "description":"In spite of the lack of specific and properly defined goals and plans about the use of computers for their development, some non-industrialized countries have made substantial advances in this computer usage. In these countries, the number of computers installed ranges from zero to roughly 1 per 200,000 inhabitants. The distribution of these systems among areas of application (business and commercial engineering and scientific, education and training, military and defense), is fairly similar to that observed in advanced countries. The majority of the developing countries have installed computers of varying capacities in some of their higher learning institutions, which is acting as a triggering factor for more and better computer installations. The upper bracket of the  industrial, commercial and services enterprises of a substantial part of these countries have installed computer systems. The use of automatic data processing systems has initiated a revolution in management attitudes and techniques. There is, in almost all of the developing countries a strong tendency to increase the use of computers in government operations. (Author)",

The principal causes which are inhibiting expansion of educational programmes are first outlined and suggestions offered for achieving a better performance which is entirely feasible within the resources of the nation. The philosophy underlying the paper is that transfer of technology in the computer field, like in many other fields, can only be accomplished when the recipient country designs the proper &quot;matching impedance&quot; to ensure the transfer to occur from the donor country. The &quot;matching impedance&quot;, in this instance, consists mostly of reorganisation of administrative structures of university computer centers and a proper reallocation of existing resources. When these preconditions for growth are  established, the universities will be in a position to expand computer education quite rapidly and a concrete proposal is made in order to achieve this goal. The paper concludes with a discussion of the type of assistance that would be necessary to accelerate the process. (Author)",

In September, 1969, Argentina had approximately 200 electronic computers. The annual growth is estimated at 15-20% and the implementation of teleprocessing and time-sharing systems have made evident the shortage of personnel. Most of the requirements are being met by ad-hoc courses, held by computer companies. In Uruguay, approximately 20 electronic computers are presently working. There are about 100 students registered in the Computing Science Career curriculum. Paraguay does not, as yet, have a computer, however, a Computer Center has been created with courses in Numerical Analysis, Programming, Operational Research, etc. The shortage of  Computer Science teachers makes the multiplication of educational centers impossible. The United Nations could stimulate and aid the installation of Regional Centers of intensive education to train selected students in a short time. Since Spanish is spoken by most Latin American (and understood by Brasilians) the programming of such a project is much easier. (Author/NH)",

Most of the Computer Science curricula currently proliferating in Latin American universities were developed by computer industry professionals, and rely heavily on them for the teaching involved. The use of DP technology in Latin America has progressed to the point that the time-lag between the  development of a new methodology abroad and its application in Latin America has been reduced: such management tools as critical-path codes, simulation programmes, information systems, etc., are now being used as soon as they become available.

The results of several studies of the performances of these students both while in Australia and after returning to their own countries have become available. The problem discussed by these students are as relevant to electronic data processing training as to training in other technical fields. Thus the main relevant points are summarized here. The figures show that Asian students do not perform well in comparison with Australians. Possible reasons for this are: language problems, the emphasis on rote learning among Asian students, and differences in cultural backgrounds. On  returning home, students are faced with difficulties in trying to exercise their acquired skills because of: changes in the governments' policy and lack of recognition of Australian qualifications. Desirable mechanisms of training include: fostering paired university departments, provision of computing equipment for training, advice in setting up sub-graduate and undergraduate training programs, assistance in providing technical literature and provision of computer time to universities without computers.

The use of computers has spread in the private sector, public sector companies and government departments. However, propaganda against computers requires reconsideration of the role in developing countries. This paper outlines the following four major problem areas which vitally affect development and where the computer can be used to further development: infra-structure facilities, family planning, unemployment and data banks for economic planning. In developing countries, the future of the private sector is closely linked with the tempo of the development. By utilizing computer resources to assist development, the private sector  will not only help the developing country, it will also help in ensuring its own existence and progress. (Author/AB)",

In substance, the report states that information provided to researchers and educators can be anticipated to a large degree and that this lead time can be used to advantage by publishers, authors, and lecturers. In problems of medical care, the lead time is lacking and the information system must react to inquires after-the-fact. In essence what was good for education and research is not as effective in health care and collateral resources are called  in to fill the void. This report calls for an upgrading of directories, compendia, and guides to enable physicians to locate and use information in a severly time-constrained problem environment. It implies that there should be some innovative re-grouping of all types and sources of information to allow the clinician to gain as much from a national network as do the researcher and educator.

Efficient use of this service requires that the potential user understand something about the system as a whole: its contents,  the controlled vocabulary, and methods of indexing and updating the files.

The eventual goal would be to offer such services to all types of libraries in the state, with the exception of special libraries and large university libraries, from several (three to four) regional area processing centers. These in turn would be provided with all cataloging information from one center. The suggested steps for implementation include: (1) Appointment of a Technical Services Advisory Council; (2) Development of standards for cataloging and processing of juvenile materials; (3) Development of a financial pattern for center establishment and maintenance; (4) Choice of a center, development of routines, solicitation of members; (5) Initial production for current  juvenile titles; (6) Establishment of cycle ordering procedures for retrospective titles; and (7) Issuance of acquisitions lists as selection aids, especially for nonbook media.

Chapter 1 in this manual discusses what is involved in interviewing and information-giving in an I & R Center. What takes place in an interview is covered in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 discusses record keeping. If records are properly kept, the basic I & R service can provide important statistical information about the kinds of problems older people have, the extent of their occurrence, plus valuable information about the ability of the community to meet these needs.

Thus, follow-up is designed to: get services for people who did not get them the first time; make agencies more accountable for their service, secure planning information which sometimes leads to: advocacy, research studies or new services. Although follow-up can be a time consuming process, it is important because it fulfills the dual purpose of determining whether linkages between people and services have been made and also of monitoring the center's work. After the reasons for linkage failures that are related to the person himself, such as fearfulness, disinterest, physical incapacity, etc. have been  followed through, the question becomes what to do about linkage failures resulting from: non-existent services, agency malperformance or non-performance, or restrictive or punitive public policy.

One possible source of volunteer help might be the volunteers who participated in the center's community resources survey. Another source would be organizations that provide volunteer service for older people as part of their ongoing programs. A minimum of five volunteers should be used on a rotating basis in order to make allowances for the volunteer's own schedule as well as illness and family priorities. The matter of reimbursement to the volunteer for mileage and parking expenses should be worked out individually with each volunteer. The information and referral center should keep a file on volunteer  escorts including the volunteer's insurance agent, insurance company, address and phone number. All volunteers should be oriented to the service he is to provide and for the responsibility he is to assume. A volunteer escort service may be a crucial factor in helping the center fulfill its mission of linking people to the services they need.

This is related to the center's mission of linking older people and services together. Advocacy at the case level is concerned with individuals who have not received the services they need. Advocacy at the agency level begins with follow-up that reveals that many older people who have been referred to a particular agency are not being seen by that agency for service. Sometimes advocacy may be necessary at local, state, and national levels in order to bring about changes in public policy that will add new provisions for older people or make existing provisions available to them. The constraints on the use of  advocacy in an I &amp; R center described in this manual are summarized as: time, center image, stakes involved, and the possession of certain skills such as writing, speaking, and working with community groups.

An alternative hypothesis suggests that an inadequate analysis of the criterion task may, in fact, account for children's inability to perform successfully. To support this thesis, investigators examined the four-part Farnham-Diggory cognitive synthesis task (behavioral translations of logographic sentences) used in assessing maturational readiness and correlating positively with conservation. Two validation studies were undertaken and yielded evidence that (1) children succumbed to a response set because feedback and reinforcement were omitted from task administration procedures and (2) children reacted to each individual word in all sentences  because some logographic sentences (directions to do something) were ambiguous. Also, an unspecified but mediating variable such as the amount of reading training might be the source of relationships attributed to cognitive synthesis and/or conservation skills. Developmental psychologists are urged to pursue traditional viewpoints which require specification of antecedent conditions when dealing with performance tasks involving young children since traditional research focused more on the capabilities of young children than on their limitations.

Findings indicate that IDS children who experienced 5 years of enrichment generally outperformed control children on a number of measures of ability and achievement and appeared to maintain much of their early enrichment advantages over their controls. On those measures where rote memory or mechanical operations were extremely important, there were no significant differences between groups. The more  effective elements of the curriculum appeared to be those that were both cognitively and linguistically based. Twenty-four tables of descriptive data are interspersed within the text.

Data was collected on each child's family unit, home setting and available media. Longitudinal trends were obtained on each child's social and intellectual development and an interpersonal behavior assessment was made. For one week, each family maintained a \"dairy of the subject-child's television viewing: programs viewed, duration and intensity of viewing and reason for program selection. The heavy viewing periods on weekdays were naturally concentrated in the after school and evening hours. However, on Saturday and Sunday, the prime  viewing period shifted to the morning hours, suggesting that children are selective about their television viewing. The children ranged from casual watchers to nearly addicted television viewers. Study results indicate that the heavy viewer is physically active, but interpersonally passive. The casual viewer is less able to be distracted, less likely to be bashful about playing with others and more likely to initiate interpersonal contact. Numerous instances of spontaneous imitation of televised behavior were observed. Children paid greater attention and exhibited higher reactivity while viewing children's programming.

Direct, continuous naturalistic observation of behavior yields a great deal of information per assessment unit. The information is precise and because it is direct, there is no question that it represents a \"true sample\" of the target behavior, as there is when standardized testing is used. Mediators of behavior change (teachers and/or parents) and their consultants (e.g., the school psychologist) receive accurate, daily, almost immediate feedback concerning the efficacy of the behavioral strategy employed so that inappropriate or ineffective consequences may be altered rapidly. (A brief manual for recording behavior rates and a specific case study is described.) The use of behavior rates  has been examined as it relates to nonacademic behavior, but there is an unlimited potential in such use for teacher training, teacher effectiveness, identification of student competence, and a host of other academically oriented areas.

The regressive and anachronistic practice of financing schools through local property taxes perpetuates inequities detrimental to students and unfair to parents and taxpayers. Although it is the students in the inner cities that require special, more costly educational approaches, cities have an average of 30 percent less money per capita available from local taxes than do their suburbs. This is despite the fact that city property owners are taxed 40 percent more heavily than suburbanites. During the last 10 years, public education costs have more than doubled to nearly $40 billion in 1970. The same financial difficulties beset the nonpublic schools, forcing Catholic schools to close at the rate of one per day, and  increasing the public school burden. The defeat of all but 48 percent of the school bond issues presented to the nation last year suggests a growing rejection of our taxing system. A Presidential Commission is analyzing the school financing situation and suggesting appropriate new directions. This example should be followed on the state and local levels. (Author/AJ)",

Under the jurisdiction of Article I of the United States Constitution, the federal government has the right to determine the social welfare rights of people living on military installations; yet these people are not included in programs such as Head Start, Follow Through, and the proposed Family Assistance Plan, even though 20,000 service men have been forced to go on welfare. By military regulations, all day care must be maintained by tuition paid by parents and day care is a relatively expensive service to purchase. Since no federal funds are involved, the Federal Interagency Day Care Requirements do not apply and state requirements do not apply on federal property.  Since officers' families dominate military family housing, they have easier access to day care facilities as well as more money to afford the service. Resources to pay staff are toolow to attract or train well-qualified people. Existing military day care, like the grade school system, takes place on the bases, contributing to the isolation of an immense subculture. (Author/AJ)",

Each parent completed a scale of 25 items on which his child's anxiety was rated just prior to the child's entrance into nursery school. A teacher-rated scale was then devised to measure the child's separation reaction in the school and was completed for every child immediately at the end of each school day over a 2-week period. (Additional ratings were made later on in the year.) Results indicate that parental ratings of children before entry into nursery school correlate highly with the teachers' ratings. This suggests that separation anxiety prone children can be identified with  considerable efficiency before their entry into nursery school. Although later ratings showed lower levels of anxiety in children, correlations remained significant. Tables comprise half the document. A copy of the Parental Anxiety Rating Scale is also included.

Out of the original sample seen at the newborn and preschool periods, we saw 35 males and 27 females for half day assessment of play, and social and cognitive behavior when they were seven and a half years of age. Data were collected from three sources: (a) a 30-minute sample of free play, (b) measures of  intelligence, cognitive style, and motor ability obtained from the child, and (c) measures of peer and family relations and social maturity obtained from the mother. Preschool verbal communication was positively related to verbal IQ, social maturity and exploring in play at seven and a half years of age. High verbal males and females were brighter, more socially mature and spent more time exploring a novel play setting. Low verbal males appear to be less cautious, more impulsive and frenetic in their shifts of activity, darting from one activity to another. Low females appear hesitant, timid and cautious, not playing much and shifting in a slow deliberate manner. (Author/MK)",

Effectiveness tests (including cognitive and attitudinal measures) indicated that in most cases the Sesame Mother program improved children's skills and that more child involvement resulted in more improvement. Preschoolers for the project, recruited by each mother in her own  neighborhood, were between 3 and 5 years old with little or no previous school experience.

Findings relating to the 8 hypotheses tested included the  following: (a) that, during 3 years of public school, scores of 23 former project children showed a decline on the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale; (b) that scores on the California Achievement Test of former project children in grades 2 and 3 did not differ from their matched nonproject controls; (c) that there was generally no difference between former project parents whose children were designated under- or over-achievers in terms of value orientations; (d) that current project parents who received combined homemaking and child-development services for 6 months did not increase their level of general morale more than comparable parents receiving only child-development services; and (e) that, while 2nd- and 3rd-grade teachers reported favorable attitudes toward the project, some also  believed that project teachers should be better trained and that project children should be better disciplined.

        "description":"A 4-year follow-up study of children in the Rural Child Care Project has shown that greatest losses in intellectual functioning for former project children occurred in the first year of public school among those scoring above 80 on their first Binet but who were retained in grade 1. IQ change during grade 1 was negatively related to attendance at a project center and unrelated to social services received by the family. IQ loss was inconsistently related to qualitative Binet performance over time. Parent awareness and use of community, school, and project resources were unrelated to length of project participation. Despite differences between project mothers, project teachers, and middle-class mothers (in intellectual functioning, educational achievement, reported educational  attitudes, and control strategies), project mothers were equal to or more effective than project teachers in teaching their children to perform structured tasks. Although project teachers found parent training procedures difficult to implement, this project demonstrated the benefits of such procedures to both parents and staff. While children in the current program almost 2 years performed no better on UCLA Language Tests or Preschool Inventory than children with less than 1 year's experience, they were higher than summer Head Start children in general achievement. After discussion of these and additional findings, the document provides recommendations for improving the project within a &quot;focussed services&quot; model which stipulates specification of behavioral objectives and joint training of  child development and homemaking staffs in the use of child-centered activities as a primary means of increasing family adequacy.

Objectives included providing the opportunity for pupils to assume responsibility, develop self-reliance, and thereby increase self-respect; teaching the skills involved in outdoor recreation; teaching the importance of, and appreciation for, natural resources through realistic projects; teaching elements of democratic living through group living, planning, and sharing; and integrating outdoor experiences with the regular school curriculum. The project provided 5 1/2 days of outdoor education and camping experience, with a schedule organized around such activities as camp craft, fishing, swimming, conservation classes, and nature study.  Pupils were tested using the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale on the first day and a revised model on the last day. Statistical results indicated, for example, that the camping experience made the youngsters feel more in control of events affecting them and more confident in themselves; that pupils learned more than they had anticipated; that they made more friends than they had anticipated; and that the Nowicki-Strickland measure is valid for a predominately black population. Recommendations included continuation of the program; operation of the camp program independently rather than sharing the camp site; inclusion of children of different socioeconomic levels; and follow-up to ascertain what effects the experience may have had on school performance.

        "description":"The Economic Research Service has used 1964 census data to develop information on the characteristics of Spanish-surname farmers in 14 Texas counties. Selected characteristics were examined for this population and for non-Spanish-surnamed farm operators in the same counties. It was found, for example, that Mexican American farm-operator families generally had low incomes in the 14 Texas counties where they were found in significant numbers. Their sales of farm products averaged less than one-fourth of those for the Anglos in these counties, and their outside incomes were 40% lower. Moreover, their households averaged 1.2 persons larger than those of their neighbors. The Spanish-surname farm operators had fewer years of formal education than the others. Only 40% of the former had  finished 8 elementary grades versus 75% of the others, and only 18% were high school graduates versus 42%. The educational disadvantage of the Spanish-surname operators on low-production farms was greater than that of those on larger farms, and greater when measured at the high school than elementary school level. As noted, data relating to farm expenditures, value of land and buildings, and family characteristics and income were based on only a sample of farms, rather than a complete enumeration. Thus, some of the observed differences may be due in part to sampling error. (BO)",

Utilizing results derived from the Monroe Oral Language Scale for 16 of the 19 school districts involving approximately 6,000 predominately Spanish-speaking or American Indian children (grades 1 through 3), significant progress in oral language development during the interim between pre- and post-tests was found. Although no controls were used to account for maturation effects, it was  deemed probable that the gains were due to the special English classes. Among the recommendations, it is noted that a uniform testing methodology be implemented and that the comparison of results between different school districts be avoided. Further recommendations encompass financing and program development. Two references and 1 table are included. A related document is ED 044 192. (MJB)",

Federal and state programs designed to solve these and other problems are also described, including the  operation of state and local Indian education advisory committees composed of Indians; the Indian scholarship, higher education, and guidance services program; inservice training of non-Indian teachers; the rewriting of instructional materials; the dissemination of materials relating to Indian life, history, and culture; and the reorganization of the State Department of Education, involving the creation of a full-time Director of Indian Education.

In encouraging development of a sound balance between urban and rural areas, the task force report gives 12 principal recommendations covering 4 areas: rural-urban population shifts; governmental sturcture; health and housing; and public services. Recommendations  include (1) decentralizing industrial development, (2) requiring counties and cities to enact land-use regulations, (3) creating a state housing corporation, and (4) developing standards to measure the quality of education throughout the state. An appendix includes results of surveys of 3 rural towns, 124 Lincoln County college students, and 49 migrant workers; these surveys provided information in terms of rural-urban population shifts, attitudes and aspirations of college students resulting from residence in a small town, and socioeconomic influences as related to migrant workers.

To obtain accurate data on income and expenses, a detailed record book was placed in each participating home. In addition, an interview schedule was used in seeking socioeconomic information. The interview schedule yielded data on estimated incomes and expenses of the families during the 1968 calendar year. The record book yielded day-to-day information during a 2-month period. The decision makers in the families studied were found to have desires and motives much like those of other  middle-class or lower-middle-class families. The most significant difference was that the families studied depended upon income from highly variable sources. Although family income was quite acceptable or even quite high during a given period, the accumulation of debts from past periods or the anticipation of future periods of low income often required that the family live at a level incommensurate with current income.

A stratified sample of Indian leaders, Indian parents, and Indian students (from the 2 Indian reservations of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington with the largest populations and the 2  Indian reservations in the 4 states with the smallest populations) and of state superintendents of public instruction, local school administrators, and teachers (from school districts related to the same Indian reservations) was interviewed and asked to complete a questionnaire. Survey results indicated that the Indian people and professional educators support the development of a reading and language system based upon Indian history and culture and agree that it is feasible.

When the two groups were compared, results from variance analyses indicated (1) there were no significant differences on all total test and subtest scores, (2) the Mexican-Americans averaged 4.29 months older, and (3) the Mexican-American group averaged 2.62 more children in the family. Chi-square analyses showed that (1) the Mexican-American group had more male heads of family (p<.01), (2) the Afro-American group had more broken homes (p<.01), and (3) there was no  significant difference in terms of welfare assistance. The average scores of both groups ranged from 1/2 to 3 1/2 years below grade level except for visual analysis and syllabication. Both groups achieved higher scores for visual analysis than for phonics knowledge and for nonlanguage IQ than for language IQ.

The purpose was to help the content teachers understand the nature of reading and increase their ability to teach reading skills at the same time the content is taught. As a result of an inventory questionnaire completed by participating teachers, it was decided that word recognition skills should be taught first, with at least three workshops devoted to these skills. In addition to the eight scheduled workshops, the  Materials Preparation Center provided inservice sessions to help develop innovative materials and teaching strategies for secondary students. At least one workshop provided a demonstration class for teacher observation and critique. In addition, a monthly inservice meeting was conducted for the reading consultants to increase their ability in working with the teachers. The inservice program was evaluated by classroom observations made by the reading consultants and coordinator and by an evaluation form completed by teachers after each workshop. (AW)",

The first task of the teacher is to see that the child can handle spoken words adequately. Word mastery begins with learning basic labelling and categorization skills through experience with concrete objects; proceeds to learning words for actions, discriminations, and more abstract concepts such as time and location; and finally progresses through guided vocabulary development to learning words about words. The emphasis should be on consolidating and extending the child's oral vocabularies, on speaking in sentences, and on acquiring a respect for inflections. Then the child can be guided to learn the capabilities of language by reading and writing. While at first it might be necessary to  tolerate substandard communication, the goal should remain precise, lucid exchange and evaluation of ideas through speech and reading. Separation of communication into listening, speaking, reading, and writing may be useful for reading teachers, but it is harmful to total language development. Word meaning cannot be learned in isolation; it begins with mastery of simple skills on the oral level and proceeds to increasingly more complex skills. (AW)",

Two hundred and ten braille readers from grades 6 to 9 were assigned to one of the three treatment versions. Nine groups were formed on the basis of comparable age, IQ, and reading achievement. Within each group assigned to a particular version, one group was assigned to one of the three recall conditions: set relations, multiple choice, and reconstruction. Recall was measured immediately after reading the assigned version and again 1 week later without rereading the passage. Analysis of the data revealed that for the set relations groups, versions 1 and 2 read at significantly higher rates that  version 3 (88.86 and 75.40 compared to 46.53 words per minute). For the multiple choice groups, versions 2 and 3 read significantly slower than version 1. For the reconstruction groups, version 3 read significantly slower than version 1. Results of all three recall conditions revealed little difference among the versions with respect to recall (either immediate or delayed) of the essential information in the passages, with one exception--the inferior performance of version 3 subjects on the common multiple-choice items during the delayed recall task.

In four states, ABE has made reported, tested differences in adult reading ability. In New York and Missouri, students gained an average of about 1/2 year in reading ability on completing the first 100-hour cycle and another 4 months after completing the second cycle. The dropout rate was 50 percent. In a Florida migrant program, an average gain in reading of approximately half a grade in 2 months was reported. The Aker study in Mississippi involved a stipend program. Of the 183 individuals for whom pretest and post-test data were available, 93 percent experienced reading gain  ranging from 1 to 4 grade levels, and the dropout rate was 27.6 percent. These studies indicate that ABE does help. However, they also show that stipending may be a major factor in the success of the program and that criteria for dtermining dropouts in many programs were inconsistent with ABE philosophy.

The tutors, 33 fifth graders identified as low achievers in reading, were trained to provide sight word vocabulary instruction to beginning first graders. The training consisted of four 1-hour sessions and included tutor behavior, tutoring skills and procedures, and program objectives. The tutors were also taught to use the Dolch Picture Word Cards. The actual tutoring was held 3 days a week, 30 minutes each day, and lasted for 2 months. The Primary Word Recognition section of the Gates-MacGinitie Reading  Test was used for pretest and post-test. Data were analyzed at the .05 level of significance with a t test. Both the experimental and control groups made significant gains during the 2-months period, but the experimental group indicated significantly higher gain than did the control group.

Twenty high school students enrolled in a precollege reading and study skills program participated in an 80-trial (10-session) scanning experiment. The task involved searching for a target sentence embedded in a page and responding by pressing the appropriate button on a machine. Errors were of two types: when the wrong button was pushed or when response time exceeded 1 second. Data analysis showed that the mean scanning times for session 1 and session 8 were significantly different (p<.01) and that there was some improvement in accuracy. Correlations between mean rate scores on the two sessions was high (.78). Both mean scanning  time and mean number of correct responses did not differ significantly between (1) same vs. different context, (2) oral vs. written stimulations, or (3) male vs. female subjects. Slow scanners were more constricted in application of strategies, while fast scanners reported more variability in eye movement patterns. Multiple regression analysis of test variables in a pretest battery and initial scanning speed revealed that the highest correlation obtained was between impulsivity as measured on Smith's I-S Scale and scanning rate (.65).

The objectives were to improve the child's reading ability, personality development and assurance, and interest in the school routine. The program also aimed to provide the children with a positive environmental atmosphere. On the basis of teacher recommendation and testing, students attended the remedial reading classes two or three times a week. The classes were composed of less than six students at a session. Various causes of reading retardation were taken into consideration by the remedial teacher. Instruction in a wide range of reading skills was given, aiming at reading fro meaning and comprehension. Materials used included a variety of reading books, reading kits, programs, and games.  Teaching machines such as the tachistoscope, controlled readers, audio-flashcard systems, the Hoffman Information Systems materials, and tape recorders were used to aid instruction. Student ability and achievement were measured by using different kinds of standardized tests for diagnosis and evaluation. The program also guided other creative projects such as a student-edited newspaper, book fair, and intracultural festival. Test scores and references are included. (AW)",

Form A of the Nelson Reading Test was administered twice with a 4-week interval. While the control group was told only that the post-test was given to measure how much they had learned since the last testing, the experimental group was told that those making any performance improvement would win material rewards. Those making the most increase received one of six transistor radios; others received a university sweatshirt or a 25-cent candy bar. Results were analyzed using analysis of covariance. Two major dependent variables were the total number correct (NC) and the total number of items attempted  (NA). Post-test means were adjusted for pretest differences between the two groups. The effect of the reward treatment was found to be significant in all instances on the NC variable (p<.01) and on the NA variable (p<.001).

Simplified interaction analysis techniques can be useful in diagnosing and assessing the thinking and feeling competencies of students in the classroom. The right kinds of teacher questions can create an environment conducive to developing critical reading skills. Using the levels and categories of these taxonomies as a framework the teacher can classify his own questions and thus determine whether or not he is challenging his students on a variety of cognitive and affective levels. By restating questions, the teacher can easily  vary the kinds of responses elicited from his students. Frequently, the change of a key word or phrase in the question is all that is necessary to vary the kinds of response required from the listener.

        "description":"The concept of functional literacy might be considered to have its ceremonial initiation at the World Conference of Ministers of Education on the Eradication of Illiteracy in Tehran, Iran, in 1965. At that conference important implications emerged for program development, methodology of teaching, and program content. An effort is made in this paper to work out more specifically these implications. The author states that literacy projects should be planned basically as part of the educational effort on one hand and as part of the economical planning for the country on the other hand. The comprehensive nature of the program should include economic, social, and political development. The program should also be linked with the literate environment of the community and should be  formally evaluated. Lack of proper selection of priorities causes the project to lose its focus and effectiveness. Today functional literacy projects face such problems as (1) reflecting clearly both educational and economic concerns, (2) coordinating relations between project staff and field staff, (3) finding effective administrative methods, and (4) promoting the concept so that highly professional commitments at all levels could be obtained.

Structure words were identified as those which carry no lexical meaning and which serve as markers, connectives, etc. Subjects were 85 fourth graders selected from a Mississippi school system on the basis of average intelligence, vision, hearing, and physical abilities. An oral reading screening device was administered to all subjects who were then grouped according to difficulty experienced in reading the 180 structure words in the 509-word passage. In addition, a verbal  discourse passage similar in length to the reading passage was solicited from each subject and analyzed for type and frequency of structure words. Data were analyzed using t tests which resulted in confirmation of significant differences in structure word errors in oral reading and in use of structure words for the two groups. It was concluded that a close relationship exists between structure word usage in reading and in verbal discourse. A bibliography and tables are included. (MS)",

        "description":"The addresses and discussions of the 1970 Maryland Reading Institute focused on the theme of \"accountability\"--defined as the responsibilities of teachers to their students, community, and society. In Part 1, highlights of the keynote address are followed by summaries of a five-member panel discussion, five reactors' statements, and a concluding address. Reading educators were seen as responsiblie for providing a solid basis for all education. In addition, because of the wealth of recent research on the reading process and the learning-to-read process, the teacher of reading has the responsibility to learn as much as possible in her field and apply her knowledge in the classroom. On another level, programs in colleges and universities must supply future teachers with training in  teaching reading skills and in the development of effective reading curricula. The second part of this volume includes an address by Kenneth Goodman entitled \"Psycho-linguistics and Reading\" and summaries of speeches on reading and learning centers, teaching values in elementary social studies programs, and our responsibility to children.

The cases included 96 students from three New Jersey school districts, one California school district, and one Tennessee school district. Approximately 69 percent of the cases exhibited reading retardation as evidenced by an actual reading level below their chronological and mental age group. In only 33 percent of the cases was reading retardation mentioned in the referral of the student to the school psychologist. The cases with reading retardation were predominated by males, the age group 9 to 11, grades K to 3, Caucasians, middle socioeconomic status, and within an 81 to 100 IQ range. Of those  students referred, only 23 percent had previously had remedial reading instruction, 1 percent were referred by remedial reading personnel, and 81 percent were referred by classroom teachers. Further research is suggested in light of the large incidence of reading retardation in such cases and in light of the low percentage of cases in which reading retardation was mentioned in the referral.

As an organizational framework, the area was divided into three subareas: maps, graphs and tables, and reference skills. The professional literature, instructional materials, textbooks, and standardized tests relating to each of these subareas were surveyed and briefly summarized. The present approach has been to identify a few basic skills that are introduced early in the sequence and occur with more sophisticated variations at each successive level of development. Three basic skills have been identified in the subarea of maps: representation, location, and measurement. Six basic skills were  identified for the subarea of graphs and tables: picture graphs, bar graphs, circle graphs, line graphs, and single and multicolumn tables and schedules. Seven basic skills were identified for reference skills: location, book skills, library use, reference materials, reading rate and purpose, organizing and evaluating materials, and work habits.

The Design provides behavioral objectives and criterion-referenced tests for each skill. The results of the machine-scored tests indicate the skill strengths and deficits of each child. Resources including published materials and teacher-directed activities are also keyed to each skill. A management system in the form of a profile card provides a continuous record of each child's skill development and permits flexible grouping on the basis of skill needs. The intent of the Design is to provide  individualized skill instruction as well as a continuous progress approach to reading. The Design is in its second year of field testing. (Author/AW)",

The participating students were uninterested in education beyond high school and accustomed to low achievement in school work. Learning activities in the program were selected to capture student interest and to generate experiences of success. For students with problems in basic skills, for example, activities for building oral language, reading, writing, and listening skills included mock job interviews, taping of conversations, newspaper reading, vocabulary study from standard forms, advertisements and signs, paperback reading, journal writing, free-response writing, and discussions of  current popular issues. Methods of grading and evaluation were revised. Results of reading skill tests showed that the program was successful in improving reading skills, and principals from the high schools attributed a lower dropout rate to the success of the program.

In Experiment 1, the effectiveness of exposure to graded reading materials and audiovisual tutoring was tested in an automated reading program with specific behavioral objectives and a self-contained reward system. Twenty-one students formed three groups of equal reading proficiency. The group receiving specific audiovisual tutoring showed substantial gains in reading accuracy over the groups receiving trial-and-error training in reading and in mathematics. Tutored students' gains were highest on successive comprehension and untimed standardized tests. During the second year, in Experiment 2, the audiovisual tutoring was administered to 19 students, and gains were compared to those  students not receiving any machine instruction. Improvement in tutored students paralleled that of Experiment 1. In Experiment 3, students participating in Experiment 2 intermittently received automated instruction on several everyday life reading skills. The tutored students' improvements across the year were significantly greater than those of students receiving no tutoring. Tutored students also showed some generalization to skills not included in the automated tutoring. included. (Author/AW)",

The study was undertaken to discover what kind of programs have been tried, which ones have been successful, and how the federal government might encourage effective interdisciplinary problem-focused programs. The report reviews the problems that universities encounter in organizing interdisciplinary environmental programs and recommends that the universities develop new administrative structures responsive to the complex nature of environmental problems. Two features are considered essential for problem-focused programs to be successful: (1) substantial or complete control of the faculty reward structure; and (2) freedom to be innovative in introducing course  material, educational programs, work study programs, and curriculum requirements for degrees. The study indicates that federal funds being expended at universities for environmental problems do not encourage problem-focused multidisciplinary education and may even discourage such programs. A separate report included as an appendix, Federal Administration and Support of University Interdisciplinary Research, reviews the history of federal funding of interdisciplinary programs. (PR)",

The sample for this study consisted of ten randomly selected classrooms: three ninth-grade general science classrooms, six ninth-grade earth science classrooms, and one seventh-grade earth science classroom. Tape recordings of a single class session for each of the ten classes were used for the interaction analysis. The day following the recording session students in each class were given the SCAC, an instrument designed to measure the inquiry oriented activities, consisting of 55 true-false questions organized into seven categories. The Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient  analysis was used to relate the total score on the SCAC and the six areas of the interaction analysis. The highest coefficient was given between SCAC scores and percent of time attributed to teacher questions (.90). Pearson product moment coefficients between sections of the SCAC are also included in the results, indicating significant positive correlations for all but three of the coefficients. Results also indicate that inquiry makes up only a small part of what took place in the classrooms in this study; teachers generally dominated classroom discussions. (PR)",

All teachers were experienced, given a special training session, and volunteered to participate. The adjusted trend analysis revealed some evidence that, after several experiments using the inductive method, the hypothesized curvilinear trend in achievement scores of the open-inductive group was equally as good or better than for the scores of the control group. The  laboratory behavior of the two groups was significantly different on five of six comparisons as identified by an interaction analysis system developed by the author.

Of the qualified respondents who were employed, most were in three major  sectors of the economy: 72 percent in industry, 14 percent in government, and 7 percent in educational institutions. Fifteen percent of the qualified respondents regarded themselves as other than engineers, even though they met the criteria to be counted as engineers for purposes of the survey. Forty-three percent of the qualified respondents were licensed in one or more states. Less than one half of one percent of the group were women.

(Non-science oriented students are those who did not take either chemistry or physics.) A sample of 1,493 seniors took the Test on the Social Aspects of Science (TSAS) as part of the Test Every Senior Project. The 52 items on the TSAS are grouped into five areas: the relationship between science and technology, the interaction of science and society, the nature of science, the characteristics of scientists, and the scientist's role in society. A chi square comparison between the science and the non-science oriented students was made on each of the test items in these groups.  Science-oriented students showed a more positive attitude toward science, a better understanding of the nature of the scientific enterprise, and a more realistic conception of the characteristics of scientists. Non-science oriented students were weakest in areas related to the nature of science and the characteristics of scientists. Curriculum for both science and non-science oriented students needs to more effectively emphasize the social aspects of science. (PR)",

The project provides inservice training workshops in mathematics for elementary school teachers. These teachers are then encouraged to provide specialist instruction in mathematics for their own class and one other class at the same grade level by means of a trade-off of teaching assignments. The objectives and procedures for these workshops are included, and three phases of the 1969-1970 research are reported. Phase One examines the cost effectiveness of varying the instructor participant ratios in the workshops. Phase Two compares the achievement of classes for different socio-economic levels of the communities involved. Phase Three compares  pupil achievement of classes taught by teachers who commuted to workshops with those taught by teachers who resided on campus during the workshops. Results of the three analyses are reported. Teacher training had a positive effect on pupil achievement in mathematics, particularly in grade two in low socio-economic areas.

Legislative and administrative environmental action of the Federal government during 1969-70 is reported. This covers policy and organization, water quality, solid waste disposal, and air quality. State action echoing Federal concern in these areas as well as financing environmental improvement and land use is also recounted. A chart delineates the environmental legislation in each area of concern for all states. The annotated bibliography was developed to provide background for Commission consideration of the need for additional studies of intergovernmental problems in the  environment. It is arranged in two parts--The Environment: Politics, Policies, and Programs and The Environment: Specific Areas of Concern. The latter takes into account air, power, shore protection, waste disposal, water, and noise. Books, journal articles, reports, and pamphlets are annotated. (BL)",

This report concerns the effects of increasing worldwide use of the metric system on education in the United States. Its purpose is to present the educational advantages and disadvantages of both the metric and the customary systems of units; to determine the current usage of metric measurements in schools, and trends in that usage; to find the ways in which education would have to change as the U. S. accommodates to increased worldwide use of the metric system, under a planned national program or without such a program; and to estimate the costs of the changes; and to make recommendations for ways in which to take best  advantage of the changes. It is concluded that the advantages of going metric in education are significant but not overwhelming. On the other hand, the costs are not prohibitive and can be met largely out of normal expenditures. A conversion period of 10 years seems to be close to the optimum, but national leadership and sense of purpose would be needed to completely benefit from metric conversion. (Author/TS)",

Production of the film was undertaken in an attempt to provide a more effective means of presenting basic ecological principles to students in introductory, college level biology courses. The report summarizes the situation of the biology courses offered at the University of South Florida; the value of including ecological principles in biology courses; and the need for developing a relevant film for these courses. To this end, the film produced examines six major natral communities found in Florida: Pine Flatwoods, Sandhill Association, Sand Pine Scrub, Hardwood Hammocks, Coastal Strand, and the Everglades. Depicted in each  community is the general appearance, important vegetation, the soil, and some of the interrelationships between animals and plants. Also, the effects of important physical factors are illustrated. In conclusion, the report discusses results in class use of the film. (BL)",

        "description":"Data, secured by questionnaire from single household dwelling units in Warwick, Rhode Island, were used to ascertain differences among social status groups with respect to attitudes and conceptualization pertaining to water pollution and water supply. A social status index was used to delineate three status groups having high, middle, and low rank (designated as groups I, II, and III, respectively). Tension related to water pollution was experienced in each status group; however, it was greater for groups of high and middle status than for the low status group and differed significantly only between groups I and III. An information index was used to measure the general level of knowledge about pollution and supply of ground water and surface water. No significant differences were  found among status groups. The affirmation of belief in man's control of water pollution and supply was greater in the higher status groups than in the lower ones. A preponderance of respondents agreed that control of situations and responsibility for them are associated. Beliefs under conditions of no conflict and conditions of conflict differed significantly.

This course of study presents a modern view of chemistry suitable for pupils with a wide range of skills and abilities. The outline of topics provides the unifying principles of chemistry together with related facts. The principles included in the outline are basic to man's understanding of his environment. The topical outline is divided into nine major units: Matter and Energy, Atomic Structure, Bonding. Periodic Table, Mathematics of Chemistry, Kinetics and Equilibrium, Acid-Base Theories, Redox and Electrochemistry, and Organic Chemistry. A tenth unit, Application of Principles of Reaction, is to be related to, and integrated in, other units as it applies. Each unit is subdivided into  specific topics, each of which has additional material associated with it. Understandings and Fundamental Concepts outlines the basic concepts, while Supplementary Information provides amplification and explanation of the basic concepts. Two appendices deal with an energy level diagram used to depict electron configuration and with some mathematical concepts used in the course. (Author/TS)",

Socialization agents are the parents, older and like-age peers, formal education agencies, churches, leisure time child and youth serving agencies, legal enforcement and protection agencies, therapeutic, rehabilitative, and resocialization services, employers and work supervisors, political socializers, and mass media agents. Generally these socialization agents deprive themselves of the dialogues they critically need about ideals, goals, and desired outcomes. The young cope with the complexity of pluralism of inputs in several ways; their biggest problem being the challenge to more  effectively influence the structure and functioning of the socialization community so that they can meet their needs and grow and develop. Communication between the segments of the socialization community; team-building with the socialization agencies; development and coordination of collaboration between professional and volunteer resources will facilitate improving the socialization process. Planned change efforts include development of a \"temporary\" system team; internal data collection; reviews and derivations from external resources; micro experiences for leaders; commitment to a tryout period and supportive follow through.

Investigations explored the kinds of questions the children asked, their use of information, the parts of the systems they utilized, and the inquiry characteristics of the children which related to use of the system. Extensive investigation was made of the types of help the children needed to make use of the data banks. It was learned that it is  possible to support curriculum in the social studies with information systems presenting various world cultures. It also appears possible to develop a self-administering systems which will present to students cultural problems, which will present them concepts and modes of inquiry from the social sciences, and which will induce them to engage in the exploration of those concepts and the application of those modes of inquiry to the study of cultures and cultural problems.

        "description":"This bibliography of juvenile literature, textbooks, and professional resources for teachers is based on acquisitions received between January 1st 1969 and May 25 1971 by the Educational Materials Center of the National Center for Educational Communication. The books annotated within have not been evaluated, however, they have been selected on the basis of three criteria: 1) publication during this period; 2) critical reception or favorable review by at least two professional journals; and, 3) ecological content. The nonfiction juvenile titles in the first two sections divide around three themes: 1) the problems endangered species of animals and plants, overpopulation, hunger, pollution; 2) the natural resources available and their utilization as the basis of the solution of the  problems; and, 3) surveys of what has been done in recent years to repair the ecological damage. Biographies, animal stories, and conservation and ecology picture books are included in the second section. The next part describes fifteen juvenile fiction books about encounters between animals and people, imagined or fictional, but relevant to everyday happenings; some are fantastic in nature. Science and social studies texts are listed in the fourth section with teacher resources in the fifth. The review sources, and author and title indices are appended. (Author/SBE)",

This publication differs from the directories and summaries of the projects begun in the late 1960's in that the reports are based on personal interviews between the Social Science Education Consortium Teacher Associates and the project personnel. Interviews were conducted between November 1970 and April 1971. With the exception of four instances they were made on the project site. Emphasis is on the current status of the project, but coverage includes future plans and projected publications. Further, this paper represents a more personal and candid view of the projects, from the perspective of the teacher and department head, and  includes informal observations of project directors and their staffs.

        "description":"In the spring of 1969, a survey was conducted on the extent and nature of economic education in Oregon public high schools. The purpose of the survey was to determine the number of public high schools in the State that offer economics as a separate course, the proportion of high school students enrolled in these courses, the competence of high school economics teachers, and the role of economic education in Oregon compared to its status in other states. Approximately 1000 questionnaires were distributed to the social studies teachers of Oregon with a yield of 305 usable questionnaires which form the basis of this study. A capsule summary of the significant results reported here indicates that: 1) of the 211 public high schools, 49 offered a separate course in economics during the  1968-69 school year; 2) in those schools where economics is offered, about 8% of the student body elects to take the course; 3) slightly more than 2% of all students were enrolled in economics; 4) about 12% of the teachers had the equivalent of a major in college economics, and 18% had the equivalent of a minor; and, 5) compared to other states, economic education in Oregon high schools is about ten years behind the national norm.

Thematic classification was of value theory performed on the periodical and book literature which reflects and influences the thinking and practices of social science educators. The themes were contrasted to one another and to the views of the axiologists. New social studies curriculum materials were then  examined for evidence of valuation theories which are internally inconsistent with the views of the axiologists, or antithetical to the fundamental purposes of inquiry. The findings indicate significant and extensive disagreement between the various groups studied, and a generally unsound axiology within the materials analyzed. It is concluded that education is beset with a plague of misconceptions, contradictions, inconsistencies, ambiguities, and myths about valuing. (Author/DJB)",

After an introduction to the need for introducing population education in the school curriculum and the way this need is perceived by family planning leaders and educators, the discussion is largely focused on two questions: 1) potential content and scope of population education; and, 2) strategies in developing a program. Content and scope are delineated by a few general statements, but the author suggests that each country will need to develop its own specification within the general dimension. Several steps in the development of strategies are listed and discussed: 1)  determination of the scope and general objectives of the population education program (for Thailand); 2) establishment of an organizational unit or units responsible for providing leadership for the development of population education; 3) assessment of the personnel requirements; 4) development of a general plan of procedure; 5) development of arrangements for keeping informed about population education activities in other countries; and, 6) determination of financial resources needed and identification of sources of such support.

        "description":"The author traces the emergence of national and international efforts toward population education, and suggests that the growing acceptance of its need and the problems revealed in the early efforts have set the stage for a more fundamental and critical appraisal of population education. As a means of identifying issues and problems which will face American educators in the expansion of population education activities in this country, the following five elements involved in any curriculum innovation are discussed as they relate to population education: 1) the nature of the learner; 2) the distinctive features of the body of knowledge relevant for the curriculum; 3) the specific outcomes desired from the innovation; 4) the qualities of the instructional staff; and, 5) the  constraints posed by the social characteristics of the school system and its program. Each of these is considered briefly in order to suggest an approach which needs to be employed more exhaustively. Several themes appear throughout the presentation: 1) the need to develop an approach specific to population education rather than a piecemeal adaptation of older patterns; 2) the need for research on background factors as a base for curriculum development; and, 3) the simultaneous development of population education in many parts of the world, with the evident need for means for sharing experiences.

        "description":"Paralleling the growing use of the black community as a sociological laboratory, a movement for self-determination by blacks has been gaining momentum. Self determination is here defined as the power of black people to decide what should be researched in their community, why, and by whom, and the desire for it has grown because researchers generally: 1) use a common (middle class) frame of reference; 2) lack knowledge and consideration of the historical parameters that affect those researched; and, 3) fail to use obtained data for the betterment of the subjects. Much research is conducted in the black community that has no other function than to promote the social and economic interests of the researcher. The tradition of scientific racism, which began during the time of slavery  to justify the status and treatment of blacks, is still being used to support erroneous assumptions about black people. The exploitation of blacks by white researchers can be diminished in several ways: 1) include blacks in the formulation and execution of research projects; 2) make the practical application of research results an integral part of research design; 3) compel researchers to inform the population of research results in understandable terms; and, 4) require white researchers to acquaint themselves with the black culture before attempting to conduct research.

Both pathology and potential are illustrated by descriptions of our current management and development of human resources: voluntarism; socialization of the young; problems of personal identity and interpersonal support; the crisis of interdependence versus \"own thingness\" in problem-solving; and, the \"common cause\" issue of the quality of environment. Several strategies to identify common cause issues as focie for the mobilization of involvement, commitment, and action on the major confrontations are to:  1) give top priority to promoting value inquiry training, exploration of self, and value confrontation experiences; 2) find effective designs for community participation in problem solving and goal exploring dialogues; 3) develop tools and designs for action-research diagnosis of community needs, problems, and potentialities; 4) experiment with new ways of sharing power; 5) find ways of supporting serious experimentation with new and different styles of life; and, 6) develop the Human Resources Bank as a community facility to provide consultation and training for team building and group problem-solving.

Research evidence on the effectiveness of microteaching is  examined and the teaching skills involved are listed. There is a bibliography of 58 items. The second paper, \"Microteaching in Teacher Education Programs,\" by Robert F.

A brief concluding section suggests that microteaching holds promise as a research strategy for investigators interested in patterns of instruction. (MBM)",

The first, &quot;Interaction Analysis in Teacher Education: A Review of Studies,&quot; by Norma Furst, concentrates on those studies which were designed to teach the Flanders behavior recording technique to preservice educators. These are divided into early studies, attitude studies, the Ohio State University study, and studies in secondary education programs, with an additional section on future research areas. The second paper, &quot;Classroom Observation Systems in Preparing School Personnel,&quot; by J. T. Sandefur and Alex A. Bressler, starts by setting out the case for observation systems in evaluating teacher effectiveness and by defining the terms used. Selected classroom observation  systems are described, including affective systems, cognitive systems, and multidimensional systems. The third paper, &quot;Supervisory Conferences in Selected Institutions,&quot; by Donald J. Johnston, describes four supervisory conference procedures resulting from a study carried out by the author and four consultants. Four supervisory conferences were recorded on videotape at each of four universities (Temple, UCLA, Stanford, and the University of Illinois) and analyzed to identify supervisor behaviors and institutional characteristics.

It narrowed the focus of Project COD to helping teachers in specific classroom develop a practical approach to the transition from traditional to &quot;open&quot; classrooms. The 21 participating teachers in grades 4 through 8 were selected by their principals on the basis of teaching experience, competence, and motivation toward change. The help given the teachers by Project COD staff consisted of small and large group workshops in specific techniques, such as nonverbal communication and goal setting, continuation of individual assistance and counseling, and orientation of parents and administrators. Evaluation of the project was accomplished through pre- and  post-observation using a specially developed instrument; analysis of journals kept by teachers; and questionnaires completed by teachers, principals, and students. Results of the observation showed a definite change in teacher and student behavior toward those behaviors identified as being typical of a student-centered classroom. Responses to the questionnaires indicated that the majority of those involved--from 75 percent to 90 percent--favored continuation of this approach. Dissemination of the project was accomplished through newsletters, newspaper articles, and conference speeches.

The Model is considered applicable to all levels of education, all subject matters, and any length of instructional unit. It consists of four components: 1) instructional objectives, 2) pre-assessment, 3) instructional procedures, and 4) evaluation. The selection and specification of instructional objectives is probably the most important step in the Model. Once an instructional objective is selected, according to one of several possible models, it should be specified in behavioral terms which describe what students are to be able to do upon completing a unit of instruction. Pre-assessment is probably most essential when an instructor is beginning a unit of  instruction and is unfamiliar with his students' skills, knowledge, and attitudes. In some situations pre-assessment for each unit may be unnecessary. The design of the instructional procedures involves selecting the modes of instruction which appear most efficient, selecting instructional materials, preparing new instructional materials when necessary, and developing a sequential plan. The most important thing in designing evaluative measures is that the instrument measure the identical behavior specified in the objectives. Limitations of this four-phase system for new \"open education\" programs have recently been recognized. Work is in progress on revisions for open education. (RT)",

The Commission has found great interest in non-traditional education, although the term is difficult to define accurately, and the subject matter for non-traditional study is still largely unexplored. Some conclusions are that the philosophy of full opportunity in education should be fostered, that changes should be made by an evolutionary process rather than by radical upheaval, and that special attention should be paid to counseling and guidance for the potential student. More data gathering and other research are necessary and special agencies should be created to deal with accreditation and non-traditional curricula. (MBM)",

The work phases begin with the students identifying problems which they have encountered in the subject area and a presentation of the instructor's frame of reference. The final phase involves a review of the syllabus and bibliography. The instructor should  also demonstrate a willingness to receive feedback on the course, negative as well as positive, in order to encourage authentic communications, and he should also credit the students' way of working when this has been honest and productive. Although the author considers that all the elements outlined in this paper need to be considered by an instructor in any subject, he emphasizes that the model is not meant to provide a rigid framework.

Standard III provides that the cooperating agencies must specify the evidence that they will  accept and the manner in which they will ascertain that the prospective teacher has reached an acceptable level of competence. It also requires that the program provide individualized opportunities for the candidate to gain and demonstrate the competencies necessary for certification.

        "description":"The concept \"performance-based teacher education\" connotes a program designed specifically to provide the prospective teacher with learning experiences that will prepare him to assume a specified teaching role. Successful completion of the program is accomplished only when the teacher candidate provides evidence that he possesses specified requisite knowledge and can carry out in practice specified teaching functions. Most of the programs studied thus far are designed so that the professional studies component is the part that is performance-based. This component is a collection of units including behavioral objectives, independent study, and periodic assessment and feedback. Some programs, however, focus on the performance of pupils. In this case, the objectives for pupil  learning must be translated into appropriate teaching competencies before a teacher preparation program can be designed. Some of the promising practices currently receiving new or renewed emphasis on performance-based programs are sharper focus on objectives, attention to individual differences, integration of theory and practice, and change in the role of the teacher. Although there are numerous problems in the design and evaluation of performance-based programs, it is hoped that this new approach will provide one means of bringing about needed reforms in public education.

Central to the question of performance-based certification is the issue of whether performance beyond the knowledge level should be defined in terms of teaching behavior, or some combination thereof. Issues that arise in relation to either of these criteria include means of determining desired outcomes, methods of demonstrating and measuring these outcomes, and the relationship between the criteria and the teacher training program. As one moves closer to the ideal of criteria based on the  products of teacher behavior, the development of training programs and certification procedures necessarily become more complex. (RT)",

Evaluation is part of teaching, but it may also be a separate activity carried on by a third party. Evaluation methods differ according to the purpose, whether for guidance of preservice teachers, improvement of training programs, or certification. For both teacher education and teacher certification a major problem is that of defining all the kinds of jobs that teachers are expected to fill and adequately describing the social and institutional settings in which the jobs exist. No matter what the main reason for the evaluation of a particular teaching performance, the evaluator must take some account of what the  teacher is trying to accomplish. If teaching performance is to be evaluated in detail, some theory of teaching is needed as a guide to how it should be broken down. Adequate justification for the theory must be available in some form. A particularly difficult problem in evaluating teaching performance is that of gathering sufficient accurate data. If teaching performance is to be judged on the basis of pupil learning, great care must be used to eliminate major sources of error in the assessment of learning. Among the many issues related to the problem of evaluating teacher performance are racial bias in teacher selection, merit rating, accountability, differentiated staffing, and community control of the schools.

The optimum criteria would be a mix of the first and second levels, since there are too many uncontrolled variables in measuring the effect of teaching on student behavior. These criteria should be applied by a teacher evaluation system independent of the training institution. The evaluation system would require a catalog of skills and behaviors to be developed under the supervision of a national commission including representatives of all interested groups. The licensing of specialized personnel should be the responsibility of the teaching  profession through a system of extra legal \"specialty boards.\" With financial support from the U.S. Office of Education and state departments of education, these boards would certify reading specialists, curriculum specialists, teacher training specialists, and so on. Initial entry-level certification by the state would be a prerequisite to certification by the board. This new type of certification will require reconstruction of teacher training at both preservice and inservice levels, which in turn will necessitate greater cooperation between the U.S. Office of Education, state departments of education, public schools, and universities.

The required development strategies would include labor-intensive employment generation in urban areas, rural development oriented to small farmers, and emphasis on &quot;non-formal&quot; education. The human resource approach in building such strategies recognizes the importance of increasing the total material wealth or GNP of African nations, but gives higher priority to  the goals of full employment, more equitable income distribution, and relevant skill and knowledge development of the labor force. The techniques of human resource assessment range far beyond the traditional type of statistical surveys of high level manpower. They involve continuous enumeration of the labor force, tracing of career patterns of school leavers and university graduates, the study of the labor-absorptive capacity of different industries, and the calculation of cost-effectiveness of investments in human resource development.

        "description":"This monograph summarizes the development of the Pupil Observation Survey Report (POSR), an instrument designed to be completed by pupils in junior and senior high school classes in order to describe their teachers. The instrument consists of 38 statements followed by four choice agreement scales. Data from a single class are reduced to item means and then to scores on six factor dimensions isolated by analysis of over 100 student teachers studied in the Mental Health in Teacher Education project at the University of Texas. The monograph reviews the various published research studies on the development and applications of the instrument and includes a FORTRAN computer program for scoring the raw protocols. An example of an IBM 1230 optical-scanned answer sheet for the instrument  is also included. Comparisons of factor structures obtained from analysis of data describing large samples of male and female teachers are reported, as well as an extensive series of regression analyses concerning various potential influences on pupil evaluation of teachers. This instrument is currently in use in a number of experimental studies being carried out by the R & D Center in Teacher Education. (Author)",

Audio tape recorded lessons of two groups of students were compared. One group of 27 taught ten lessons in a teaching laboratory using a sequence of instructional and learning tasks. A control group of 27 taught two lessons only. Instructions for both groups for the taped lesson were the same. Analysis of the final performance lessons indicated that the experimental group was rated significantly higher than the control group on three of four teaching dimensions (determining readiness, motivating, evaluating): there was no difference on the dimension of clarifying objectives. Behaviorally, the experimental group had significantly greater amounts of use of  student ideas, questions, directions, student response, and student initiation. The controls used more lecture. The results support continued use and experimentation with microteaching in the undergraduate teacher preparation. Findings should be of interest to teacher educators and researchers in teacher education. (Author)",

        "description":"Individualized instruction is defined as a process by which each learner is assisted in developing his own unique path, which may vary not only in rate, but in approach and content as well. There is concern at the present inability to provide such programs. Students must be provided opportunities to receive instruction, each at his own level. To facilitate this, teachers must have an organization which moves emphasis from holding children together for instruction to consciously encouraging the greatest possible span of achievement. The Experimental Teaching Division of the University of Texas R& D Center in Teacher Education examined what happens to teachers and students as they move into new organizations of instruction, seeking to develop an organization in which to train  undergraduates in elementary education. Team teaching was selected as the organization to be used in the schools. The team teaching organization is described, and individualized instruction within this organization is outlined. The need is for qualified teachers to implement such procedures; the challenge is to find ways to train such teachers. Efforts in these areas as conducted by the University of Texas R & D Center are described. (Author)",

The research findings in cognitive development of Jean Piaget and Jerome Bruner are examined, together with other sources concerned with perceptual development and the stages through which the growing child progresses. The aspects of creativity, including originality, fluency, and flexibility, are discussed, as well as aesthetic development and children's responses to visual stimuli and their drawing development from making simple marks on paper for the enjoyment of movement to the understanding of asymmetry and perspective. The implications of these stages for  the art education curriculum are explored at various grade levels, and recommendations are made for appropriate strategies, with abundant stimuli provided for the beginning grades, effective aesthetic training beginning in the fourth grade, and emphasis on relevant, in-depth studies in the seventh and eighth grades, together with the development of attitudes and values. Finally, a model lesson for finger painting in the second grade is examined to illustrate the use of behavioral objectives in the art curriculum. (MBM)",

A total of 1100 articles and research papers published in 1967-68 were used as a data source and were qualitatively analyzed with respect to their substance and methodology. A stratified random sample of 390 papers was evaluated by 39 judges for contribution to theory, contribution to educational practice, and use to research methods. A 12-page questionnaire was mailed to all the authors to collect data on their background, training, career lines, attitudes, research context, and topic selection. All the data was analyzed using multivariate tubular analysis, and authors trained in schools of education were compared with those trained in the behavioral sciences. Professional socialization was found to  be strongly related to research quality, and behavioral scientists did better research than education doctorates. The positive relationship between research socialization and quality was contingent upon certain background characteristics, with female, areligious, and Jewish subjects doing better research than males and those belonging to other religious groups, and young researchers doing better than older ones. Other related factors were institutional setting and being a staff member of a university research center. (Author/MBM)",

The Consortium had five major objectives: 1) to increase the number of graduates from teacher education programs; 2) to provide systematic programs of inservice training to improve the quality of teachers and other school personnel; 3) to establish teacher programs in early childhood education with special emphasis on the needs of bicultural and  bilingual children; 4) to improve the quality and quantity of personnel engaged in pupil personnel services; and 5) to improve the quality of administrative and supervisory personnel. During its first year the Consortium engaged in planning activities and conducted 29 summer workshops. Other programs were implemented in special education, educational leadership, guidance and counseling, career opportunities, and drug education. Areas still requiring attention are the development of affective means of communication between consortium members, and the definition of the structure of the consortium and its relationship with other divisions in the State Department.

The major points for and against merit ratings are summarized, followed by a description of the requirements for a successful plan, including the prerequisite conditions of acceptance, mutual confidence, participation, and research; a validated and continuous evaluation system; and a basic scale of salaries which adequately reflects the importance of teaching. The wider acceptance of merit rating plans in the United States than in Canada is considered, as well as the probable cost of such a program, which has been estimated at  an additional 18 percent of payroll. The philosophical problem raised by merit rating is due to the conflicting views of the school system as a bureaucracy or as a profession. If the teacher is to be rated by someone else, he cannot retain his professional autonomy. The Saskatchewan Teachers' Federation has developed a program of teacher accreditation by subject, based on the belief that in accepting the authority for program modification and student evaluation the teacher is also undertaking the responsibility to defend what he is doing and why he is doing it.

The remaining group of approximately 400 student teachers from these two universities were placed according to conventional procedures and served as a comparison group. Data for the study were gathered through two procedures: 1) questionnaires distributed to student teachers in experimental and comparison schools and to supervising teachers and administrators in experimental schools, and 2) on-site  interviews based on a structured questionnaire form. Analysis of the questionnaires indicated that student teachers did benefit from concentrated placement; that cooperating personnel in experimental schools generally favored the program, although there were some instances of dissatisfaction, especially in secondary schools; and that the program did not cause any significant increase in inservice activities in the schools involved. Conclusions are that concentrated placement is a feasible and beneficial method, but flexible formats suited to local conditions should be explored.

The kinds of competencies and skills required to function effectively in each phase of the model have been noted along with resultant implications for leadership development programs. A suggested program for training educational  administrators using this model would include a leadership team comprised of three to nine members in each school district and an instructional team composed of professors from an institution or consortium of institutions of higher learning. This team would \"instruct\" the leadership team in the skills of organizational renewal, but not in the traditional way. Rather, they would take the leadership team members through the phases of organizational renewal in the district so that team members would learn appropriate skills and competencies by using them as needed.

The integrated model, a 5-week experience-based unit consisting of role playing, interpersonal exercises, videotapes, critical incident films, and discussions, was adopted as the most successful of the four attempts. Research results indicated that participants increased their levels of sensitivity to their own feelings, increased their ability  ot express their feelings, and increased their capacity for warm, meaningful relationships.

Subjects consisted of teachers and fifth grade students randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. Those in the experimental groups were instructed in nonverbal communication. All groups were tested to determine if the instruction in nonverbal communication produced differential effects. None of the hypotheses advanced were statistically confirmed. Since the hypotheses were firmly grounded in a theoretical perspective, it seemed premature to reject the theoretical base. Consequently, attention was focused on the experimental procedure, and it was determined that there were some areas that could be strengthened.

There are essentially three pragmatic functions of language in communicative interaction: manipulative, expressive, and informative. Recently, ethno-linguists have pointed out that there is structure and pattern in the way a language functions in its matrix culture. The rich variety of language styles recognized by the Black community has been noted by several educators and socio-linguistic researchers. This information can prove invaluable to a teacher in a second dialect program. Perhaps the most important criterion for the teacher who is  committed to bringing about social change in the most effective way is an awareness of the centrality of language to the sociocultural context in which he is operating. He has the responsibility to add to his fund of knowledge concerning the functional nature of social dialects and the methods of effective agents of change. (CK)",

        "description":"A program was devised and presented to four classes of college freshmen who demonstrated a need for remedial English instruction. An experiment to ascertain relative merit of programmed and conventional classroom presentation was conducted. The program was divided into phonetic spelling, basic word usage, effective sentence construction, and basic and advanced paragraph construction. Each of six teachers administered the program to 25 experimental and 25 control students. Experimental and control groups were administered the following tests: (1) a comprehensive pretest over the entire program, (2) a pretest over each unit, (3) a pretest and as many posttests as necessary for the student to make a grade of 85 on a 100-point scale for each lesson in each unit, (4) a general  posttest over each unit, and (5) a final comprehensive posttest. Using the Spearman Brown statistic for reliability, a sampling of pretests indicated a reliability of 0.85, of posttests a reliability of 0.65, and of the comprehensive final examination a reliability of 0.88. A summary of general conclusions includes: (1) A programmed approach to learning must have a valid, precise, and complete statement of objectives; (2) The innovational teaching approach must be proved markedly superior to the conventional classroom procedures if a change is justified; (3) The program should be structured toward the \"average\" student, but should allow for individual rate of progress with an open-end semester.

A list of 7,300 English homophones was compiled and used to construct two tests. Scores were obtained in these and on reference tests for J. P. Guilford's factors CMU, CSU, DMU, and DSU for 70 native speakers of midwestern American English from a university population. The homophone tests showed Hoyt reliabilities of .95 and .87 for these subjects. Following Harris's procedure for determining Comparable Common Factors, the 15 x 15 matrix of intercorrelations was subjected to three factoring procedures, each yielding oblique and orthogonal solutions. Results were in close agreement for all analyses, yielding three common factors. Two corresponded to CMU and to DMU. The CSU and  DSU tests loaded on the third factor, which had its largest loadings on the homophone tests, and involved comparing verbal stimuli with formal elements of internally generated lists. These findings replicate Harris's failure to extract distinct CSU and DSU factors and suggest that homophone recognition tasks can provide short but reliable reference tests for the symbolic factor into which CSU and DSU coalesce.

Fourteen classes used the composition program in conjunction with the SWRL Second-Year Communication Skills Program (SYCSP). At the end of the tryout, the story-writing performance of a random sample of children who used the composition program was compared with that of a comparable group of children who had used SYCSP without the composition program. Statistically significant differences favoring children who had used the composition program were obtained for judged quality of stories, story length, and punctuation  and spelling performance.

The central hypothesis was that structured practice with recorded tapes containing programmed material would produce a significant difference in performance achievement as compared with unstructured, non-programmed practice. The experimental population consisted of 52 fifth-grade male beginning cornet and trumpet students. The experimental treatment consisted of structured daily practice with ten weekly  20-minute tapes containing programmed material. The control method consisted of daily 20-minute practice of the same material, out in a non-structured manner without tapes. Two-way analysis of variance, t-test, and correlation were the statistical procedures used in testing the hypothesis. The .05 level of significance was adopted as the criterion for accepting or rejecting the hypothesis. Programmed practice was found to be significantly superior to non-programmed practice as evidenced in performance achievement. The .01 level of confidence was achieved. (Author/CK)",

Available evidence about R. D. & D. training programs seems to be reflected in the practice of programs surveyed. Changing pedagogical conditions with concomitant changes in the utilization of research, development and dissemination personnel, suggest both the existing research base on training practices and many training programs may be too narrowly conceived to cope with conditions. While colleges and universities continue to absorb most of the  available \"R\" talent, they are in direct competition with local school districts, state and federal agencies, and independent research agencies for the few \"D & D\" specialists trained each year.

Observers were trained by videotaped interaction segments, and computation of observer reliability is explained.

The psychometric properties of AIM and evidence for its construct validity suggest that it may be useful as a criterion measure. A self-scoring form of AIM  is appended. For Grade 11 norms for AIM, see TM 000 671. (Author/AG)",

Tutors were given spurious information, allegedly based on testing, as to current and predicted intellectual fucntioning of their pupil. The experimental sample was comprised of 44 tutor-child pairs, with 11 paris assigned at random to each of three expectation conditions: High, Average, and Low. The possibility of selective coaching was tested by including a second High expectation condition in which tutors were familiarized with the criterion measures. The WISC Similarities subtest and the PPVT were administered to the children before and after seventeen weeks of tutoring. Significantly greater PPVT gains were achieved by children whose tutors had been  familiarized with the tests than by children in all other conditions. There were no other significant differences between the groups on either measure. (Author)",

Only 39% of the items discriminated the sexes. Of the nine item factors in females and ten in males, four occurred in both sexes. These MF factors were neuroticism and religiousity (feminine), and power and scientific interests (masculine). The need for four homogeneous, orthogonal MF scales based on these dimensions is requisite for any rational exploration of MF in  relation to sex-role identification, achievement, homosexuality, etc. (Author/AG)",

The most logical groups of criteria were found for those former enrollees who had full-time employment experience. Relatively clear patterns of job-oriented capability and success were dominant as were two separate factors bearing on personal adjustment to the job and to the community.

        "description":"To determine if tryout samples typically used for item selection contribute to test bias against minority groups, item analyses were made of the California Achievement Tests using seven subgroups of the standardization sample: Northern White Suburban, Northern Black Urban, Southern White Suburban, Southern Black Rural, Southern White Rural, Southwestern Mexican Urban and Southwestern Anglo-American Suburban. The best half of the items in each test were selected for each group. Typically about 30% of the items in the upper half of the distribution of item-test correlations for a group on a test did not meet this criterion with another group. By this criterion minority groups were relatively similar as were the three suburban groups. The resulting unique item tests did not  correlate well with each other. Scores of minority groups were relatively better on the selected items. Thus, standard item selection procedures produce tests best suited to groups like the majority of the tryout sample and are therefore biased against other groups to some degree. This degree varies. Ways to minimize this bias need to be developed. (Author/MS)",

Through this review of previous outcome research, it was determined that three basic criterion areas related best to traditional outcome variables such as therapist and community informant ratings, length of stay, and rehospitalization. These three criteria were: (1) satisfaction with self, (2) satisfaction with interpersonal relations, and (3) satisfaction with the therapeutic outcomes. With this impetus, an eighteen item scale was developed to measure the present state, and the magnitude and direction of change of the three criterion areas. The scale was administered to eighty-six former physchiatric patients from Fort Logan Mental Health Center. The scale was found to be  extremely reliable and internally consistant. As a partial validation of the scale, a sub-sample of community informants' ratings on the treatment effectiveness scale was correlated with patient ratings. High correlations indicated partial validation of the instrument. (Author)",

Women in the Air Force (WAF) test-retest performance was evaluated on the Armed Forces Women's Selection Test (AFWST) which is used throughout the Department of Defense. WAF performance on the AFWST was compared with their performance on the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT), the instument currently used to establish the mental ability level of males entering the military services. It was found that mean aptitude indexes have increased over time for both male and female enlistees on the AQE and the ASVAB. A positive relationship was demonstrated between  level of education and aptitude index. Regional aptitude patterns for WAF did not conform to those traditionally found for male enlistees. A significant difference was found in WAF performance in a test-retest situation for both the AQE and the AFWST. WAF performance on the AFQT was somewhat lower than that of male enlistees, with the difference attributed primarily to the lower achievement by the WAF on the Mechanical Comprehension subtest.

As a consequence of the project, 28 separate collections of instructional objectives and related test measures were produced, in all, over 2,000 objectives and more than 7,000 test items to measure these objectives. During the period of the project's existence, well over 30,000 separate collections had been distributed to American educators. Regarding quality control, both reviewer-based and &quot;selection-assistance&quot; strategies were used during the project to improve the  quality of objectives. In particular, the situation-assistance strategy involving ratings of extant objectives by various clienteles, e.g., students, parents, and teachers, was extensively field tested. For test items, both a priori and a posteriori procedures were employed with certain advantages noted for each. An extensive analysis of competing classification schemes failed to yield any markedly innovative category systems which appeared particularly useful. Nonetheless, recommendations were reached for revised classifications of objectives in the various collections, chiefly on the basis of more limited numbers of content general objectives. (Author)",

Moreover, these teachers lacked the necessary preparation for guiding pupils toward an understanding of the eclectic characteristics of a society because of a lack of experience in intergroup relations.

The subjects (Ss) consisted of 100 disadvantaged and 100 advantaged boys from an urban integrated high school. No Ss were in the college preparatory curriculum. The level of aspiration was determined by requesting Ss to set down the grades they thought they would get at the end of the semester in two courses, English and science. Then, the actual achievement was obtained at the end of the semester. Self-concept was measured with a standard semantic differential instrument. Disadvantaged youths, in comparison to advantaged males, showed higher course-grade predictions, more  positive self-concepts, and lower achievement. It may well be that disadvantaged boys, due in part to an inconsistent pattern of past achievement and lower achievement motivation, are less realistic and more variable than advantaged boys about future achievement levels.

Both disadvantaged and advantaged high school girls showed a pattern of group-dependence, self-assurance, expediency, and relatively little frustration, with the disadvantaged girls indicating greater  emotional instability, less intelligence, lower ego strength, and tough-mindedness. Disadvantaged and advantaged college women seemed more sociable, assertive, conscientious, venturesome, sensitive, guild-prone, self-sufficient, tense, and controlled.

What justifies this, in nearly every nation in the world is that fact that the school is accepted throughout the society as the gateway to opportunity; and individual advancement as the most desirable personal goal. Considering the uses to which such talent as has already been identified are put in most societies of the world, this seems both a dubious and circular justification. When the society becomes polarized, the schools come to be considered by those rejecting its more conventional values as instruments of propaganda or repression. If those rejecting the society's values comprise its more privileged  youth, both their elders and the underclass are intolerably threatened. A paradoxical alliance then develops between members of the underclass and spokesmen of the establishment to defend the schools against such derogation and abandonment. (JM)",

Because of new needs, education for family planning and birth control has not been an officially recognized program area. From a national survey of aides, it was discovered that there was a high degree of ethnic and religious homophily between aides and clients, which is considered indicative of communicative reliability. Many women came to aides for help in family planning, and many were helped. Aides strongly believe in family planning. Based on the findings, a recommendation was made that an officially supported family planning education and information program be  established by the Extension Service as a part of the EFNEP low-income program.

Focusing principally on the latter, the thesis is that family responsibility for socialization and social control of youth to the status of child influences the quality and quantity of parents' school participation. Within this broad thesis, this paper specifies and tests five hypotheses by examining variations in the rate of parent participation with survey data on urban-slum residents with 10-19 year-olds in the household. The study also uncovers evidence of greater normative emphasis on socialization and social control to childhood among affluent and Jewish families, although these same groups, in contrast to  poor families, seem to emphasize socialization to socioeconomically relevant statuses.

Specifically, a study in New Haven, Connecticut was done to explore the relation between social class and the average emissions for the air pollutants: carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and particulate matter. (Data are taken from a New Haven Health Department study in 1968.) Lower class urban dwellers are more often exposed to air pollution; and that each of the particular pollutants, when ingested at certain modest levels over continuing periods, is likely to be an important influence upon one's ability to persist in the struggle for improvement of social position. The upper class urban or suburban commuter, although he faces peaks of high  pollution exposure, his body has much longer troughs of lower exposure levels and some ability to discharge the irritants. However, the urban poor face unremitting exposures, which like nutritional deficiencies, seem one mechanism by which class differences are maintained. This is true not only for air pollution but also for noise and other assaults upon the senses. (Author/JW)",

The model proposed is considered applicable to the American South, and with some modification, relevant to other settings. The objectives are: (1) to show that residential segregation indices are related to measures of educational, occupational, and income inequality; and, (2) to demonstrate how the residential segregation factor may be incorporated into an economic competition theory of minority-group relations. Data were drawn from a sample of Southern cities. The results suggest that residential segregation is important not only for its direct effects on educational inequality but upon occupational inequality as well. In terms of the  competition model, the findings pertaining to residential segregation raise some questions as to whether it is the minority percentage itself or the dispersion of that minority which results in producing a perceived minority threat.

The study was conducted at four predominantly white colleges in upstate New York during the 1969-70 school year and was financed by a grant from the Ford Foundation. The main purpose of the study was to report the black experience at white institutions from the point of view of black students. Colleges in diverse settings were chosen to provide a comparative perspective. Data were gathered from lengthy unstructured interviews with individual black students and from tape-recorded sessions of approximately ten students on each campus who met regularly throughout the school year. The results showed that many black students distrust white administrators and faculty members, believing  them to be engaged in a conspiracy against blacks; and that black advisors are necessary and essential links of trust between black students and white institutions.

A total of 202 subjects were randomly assigned to three research groups: those having available the services of the agency, those having vocational counseling services only, and those in a control group limited to other existing community facilities. Over 40 business firms provided temporary work opportunities for 160 subjects at any one time, with wages totalling over $300,000 a year. At the end of the study, rehospitalization rates for agency subjects were lower, but not significantly, than the other  research groups. However, for subjects entering the study within 4 months of leaving the hospital the reduction in rehospitalization rates for agency subjects was significant. Work exposure was secured for 85 percent of agency subjects, including transitional employment, compared to 57 percent for control and vocational counseling groups. A third of all agency subjects failed to utilize services beyond 20 visits, exhibiting a high drop-out rate. (Author)",

One of the biggest difficulties is a lack of data on the nature of, and solutions to, the problems of these areas. Frequently revised data at least as comprehensive as that provided by the decennial census are needed. This project was designed to determine possible means of gathering the needed data so that program planners could make decisions based on facts instead of intuition. Although this is a case study of an inner-city poverty area in Philadelphia, it can be generalized to describe any similar urban area.

Although research in occupational education is limited, because the field has been emphasized only recently, considerable related research has been conducted in career development and vocational guidance. Existing programs are concentrated at the junior high school level, although the emphasis is not on the development of elementary school programs, with master plans to  coordinate programs at all levels through Grade 12.

The consensus of the 2-day conference was that schools must focus attention on the career needs of all students, not just those going to college. To accomplish this, schools must consider new approaches through revised and broadened curriculums and place considerably more emphasis on  guidance and counseling services that aid the student in his career choice irrespective of his desired goal.

Regarding the integration of  vocational-technical education with general or academically-oriented education, concern centered around the possibility that an integrated system at the elementary and secondary levels would be focused on orientation to work, vocational guidance and exploration, but would fail to be specific enough to acquire an entry-level marketable skill and would delay specific preparation until postsecondary level.

        "description":"This study of opinion leadership among vocational agriculture teachers in South Carolina solicited nominations of teachers as sources of information and advice from participating teachers at two different points in time, spring 1968 and spring 1970. This time-lapsed design allowed an estimate of opinion leadership stability since the sample of teachers remained the same except for natural shifts due to teacher replacement and program changes. In addition, this study attempted to replicate the key-informant versus sociometric techniques comparison for identifying opinion leaders. Data were collected on reasons for the opinion leadership selection and the communications linkages for face-to-face relationships among teachers, supervisors, and teacher educators. Major conclusions of  the study included: (1) Teachers of vocational agriculture named as opinion leaders were older, had more earned college credit, and had attended a greater number of workshops than their peers, and (2) Teachers nominated as opinion leaders in more than one instructional area were stable for the 2-year period, while the opposite was true for teachers nominated in only one area.

As a result, many of these individuals are doomed to become burdens on society. One solution to this problem lies in the development of expansive vocational training programs which would involve the adoption of specific extended school year programs. Thus, this document describes school organization patterns which can set the stage for an influx of new students into ongoing or new vocational training programs, including needed changes in administrative and teaching practices.

The purpose of the material is to give some indication as to the states' population served by vocational education in the major cities and the expenditures that were made for vocational education. Conclusions drawn from the tabular data include: (1) A comparison of vocational education enrollment with population reveals that the percentages of enrollment in major cities fall behind the percentages of population. In 25 cities, the enrollment percentage is less than the population percentage. (2) A comparison of Federal expenditures with population reveals that 25 cities  expend a lesser percentage of the state's Federal funds than their percentage of population. (3) A comparison of state and local expenditures with population reveals that 28 cities expend a lesser percentage of the state's total expenditures than their percentage of population. (4) A comparison of enrollment by target group with total enrollment reveals that 17 cities have a higher percentage of disadvantaged than their percentage of the state's total enrollment and 12 cities exceed in percentage of handicapped over the state's total enrollment.

In the elementary years, the curriculum will relate reading, writing, and arithmetic to the ways adults earn a living, and during junior high school years, students will explore career opportunities in various occupational clusters. By senior high school, students will concentrate on one cluster, developing sufficient skill in a specific occupation to qualify for a job.

Following a review of medical and electronic literature, a survey instrument was developed and sent to hospitals, manufacturers, clinics, and research centers in the bio-medical field. The data were analyzed and presented to an advisory committee which assisted in the determination of the areas of concentration and curriculum. The greatest need for Bio-Medical Electronic Technicians was in the area of maintaining and servicing, and a lessee need was for engineering aids and technicians capable of modifying and adapting equipment. It was concluded that to meet these  demands the technician needs an in-depth knowledge of basic electronics with abilities to read and interpret schematic diagrams. Suggestions for the curriculum included emphasis on the service and maintenance of equipment, but not neglecting modification, adaption, and operation. A proposed 2-year (six quarters) program would culminate in an Associate of Science degree in bio-medical electronic technology. (Author/GEB)",

The general conclusion of the 2-day conference was that the present program of education does not meet the career education needs of youth or adults. Some recommendations were: (1) Career education should be adopted as a national program and with appropriate funding priorities, (2) Improved techniques should be developed for projecting  manpower needs at the local, state, and regional levels, as a basis for program planning, (3) A partnership should be formed with education, the community, business, labor unions, and government to design the structure of career education, and (4) The guidance and counseling program needs to be improved by providing career guidance, job placement, and followup services.

The general consensus of the 2-day conference was that the present total educational system is inadequate but that vocational education has generally provided relevant and useful services for its students.

The general consensus of the 2-day conference was that education is not meeting the needs of people, the needs for manpower, nor the needs of the economy. The concept of career education appears to be the most popular approach to the infusion of change in the educational system, but the many definitions of career education  are creating communication barriers to the development of processes and are stimulating fears that the term will eventually water down all existing good practices that are proving effective in meeting a fragment of the needs.

Among the findings are: (1) Effective programs in guidance and counseling require full support for implementation, (2) There is a very positive return on investment in vocational-technical education both to the individual and to society, (3) Community college level programs for the disadvantaged are more diversified and comprehensive than secondary level programs, and (4) Employers are not completely happy with the  products of Florida's schools. Recommendations concern: (1) better publicizing, (2) work experience programs for counselors, (3) accurate labor market supply and demand information, (4) occupational programs at the secondary and presecondary level, and (5) adequate funds for vocational guidance.

With emphasis on occupations which, by tradition, have been either open or closed to blacks, the design of the study involved three samples of 100 college women from three social settings--white middle class, black middle class, and black working class. Instruments used in the study were the French Test of Insight and the Questionnaire on Vocational Goals of College Students. Analysis of the data collected with these instruments revealed no systematic relationships between motivation indices and aspiration to the above occupations. However, it was noted that  whites were more indecisive than the blacks regarding their real occupational goals and their ideal occupational goals. Further, it is suggested that black women are more career-oriented and use the same occupations when responding to questions about their ideal goal as they do when stating their real goal.

Recommendations and details of the study are found in the text and in Volume 2 (ED 056244). Major findings include: a conservative estimate of the number of gifted and talented from the total elementary and secondary school population of 51.6 million is 1.5 to 2.5 million; existing services for the gifted  serve only a small percentage of the total; differentiated education for the gifted and talented is perceived as low priority at Federal, State, and most local levels of government; 21 states have legislation to provide services but in many cases this merely represents intent; services for the gifted can and do produce significant outcomes.

Recommendations resulting from the experiences of the first three pilot states, and which might be useful to other states that are attempting to establish information dissemination projects, are: (1) A state should plan initially to provide its own computerized search capacity; (2) A state that decides to install QUERY might well plan to have their computer and retrieval personnel visit a similar installation that has already been through the process, so that ways of  overcoming problems can be learned; (3) The Office of Education or the QUERY contractor should provide assistance to new installations until the program is operational; (4) The rationale behind packaged information should be well understood; (5) Retrieval services should adopt a means of continual reassessment of their methods; (6) Procedures for completing the process should be determined in advance; (7) Personnel of an information service would do well to visit an existing retrieval service and analyze their record-keeping and filing systems; and (8) The qualifications and capabilities of the staff should be determined in advance.

The five case studies cover eight programs in 15 schools. While each study is treated in a self-contained report, it has also been part of a coordinated investigation of more than 20 programs conducted from 1969 to 1971. This volume begins with a brief description of Rand's field study. Implications are then discussed under seven headings: instructional processes, cognitive growth, resource requirements, evaluation, program management, returns to contractors, and the major advantages and disadvantages of performance  contracting. Conclusions include: (1) Individualized instruction was the goal of all programs; (2) The performance contracts, in most cases, produced respectable gains on standardized achievement tests; (3) Costs of programs vary widely; (4) Performance contracting fostered a healthy emphasis on the student and his learning as a measure of program success; (5) Performance contracting is proving to be a useful research and development tool; (6) This contracting has not generated large profits so far; (7) Performance contracting facilitates the introduction of radical change in education; (8) Some programs have been so complex that management has been severely hampered.

        "description":"This Report describes a performance contracting program in Norfolk, Virginia; presents its results; and draws some inferences about the utility of performance contracting as a means for improving education. Participants were students from grades 7-9 in one junior high school and from grades 4-6 in one elementary school; both schools were in the inner city and had an almost entirely black student population. Learning Research Associates (LRA) provided the training and materials for conducting an individualized program of instruction in reading to the program teachers. Individualization consisted primarily of determining each student's strengths and weaknesses in reading by means of a diagnostic test, and assigning the materials that would remedy the weaknesses uncovered. Despite  the improvement in classroom atmosphere, the results of the final testing showed that students at the junior high level gained in reading achievement only about as much as they had been gaining in the past and that students at the elementary level were, in many instances, scoring lower on post-tests than on pre-tests. Interim tests of performance on assigned objectives demonstrated that the students had actually reached the program objectives, but there is no way to prove that the program was responsible for these results. The Norfolk program demonstrated that performance contracting does not automatically solve the deeply rooted problems of compensatory education.

        "description":"The Texarkana model of performance contracting consists of five major elements: (1) turnkeying of cost-effective new technology as a basic program goal, (2) use of a performance contract for instruction, (3) use of a management support contractor, (4) selection of the learning system contractor by formal competition, and (5) use of independent evaluators and auditors. It is clear from the Texarkana experience in 1970-71 that performance contracting has been a mechanism for educational process change. In both years, the program successfully met the goal of reducing the dropout rate. It was unsuccessful, however, in producing any significant achievement gains as measured by standardized norm-referenced tests. Achievement measurement still has many logistic, administrative and  conceptual problems. Texarkana evaluation procedures' have enabled impressive feedback of pertinent managerial information. Model Cities provided a mechanism for solving some problems and a source of seed money for modest expansion and development of the program.

        "description":"In September 1970, Behavioral Research Laboratories of California (BRL) assumed jurisdiction over the entire curriculum at the Banneker School in Gary, Indiana. The elementary school resembles most well-maintained, well-supported surburban schools, with the one exception that the student body and most of the faculty are black. The program as contracted envisioned the use of the well-known Sullivan programed learning texts for reading and mathematics, plus the development of materials for individualized instruction in other areas. By the end of the first year of operation, instruction in areas other than reading and mathematics was relatively conventional. The teaching/learning process at Banneker is substantially different from that in the conventional school: (1) there is a much  greater emphasis on materials; and (2) there is more flexibility, with emphasis on small-group instruction, a greater span of ages within groups, and differential staffing. The authors report results at the end of the first year of the program show average gains of 1.7 achievement years in reading and mathematics for grade 1 students, and 0.7 for reading and 1.2 for mathematics for grades 2 through 6. Two features of the program that appear to be having district-wide impact are the use of curriculum consultants and the emphasis on special education support within regular classrooms.

The average gain at the end of the program was 0.6 achievement years in reading and 0.8 achievement years in mathematics, well below the expected two-year gain.

(Alpha), Combined Motivation Education System, Inc. (CMES), and Westinghouse Learning Corporation (WLC). The programs of all three contractors featured contingency management and individualized instruction, and all used commercially available materials and equipment. The WLC program accommodated 340 low achievers in two inner city schools in grades 1-6. The CMES program accommodated around 550 low-achieving pupils in an inner city middle school, grades 6-9. Both of these programs had rooms furnished much more comfortably than regular classrooms. The Alpha program accommodated 300 low achievers in a middle school  in grades 7-9 and 300 low achievers in two elementary schools in grades 1-3. All schools were in the inner city. Average achievement gains in the WLC program for pupils who attended at least 150 days were 0.67 in reading and 0.58 in math. The average gains in the CMES program for pupils who attended at least 150 days were 1.2 in reading and 1.0 in math. Achievement data for the Alpha program were not available at the time of this publication.

        "description":"The present paper is the first in a series dealing with the development of the role of the educational field agent, and deals exclusively with issues relating to gaining initial access and soliciting requests from local educators. The first issue facing each field agent was how to sell his services to the educational community. Initial activities were, therefore, publicizing the program and trying to stimulate requests. A questionnaire was sent to the agents asking them to indicate the origin of their requests over the first few months of the program. Data analysis of the results revealed that the model group of clients represented the most recent status in education held by the field agent himself. This distribution indicates that most field agents may find it easier to  stimulate their first requests from a group which is more accessible to them and whose problems are more familiar to them, although the client-group with which a field agent works initially is not always a matter of the field agent's choice. All new social service programs have two major objectives: (1) to establish the program and build acceptance of it among the target groups, and (2) to develop procedures which will help to ensure that the program achieves its goals.

The primary goal of the project is to enhance in this leadership their knowledge of child growth and development, and their feel for, and sensitivity to, appropriate modes of education for young children, as well as pervasive awareness that what happens in the education of the very young child has implications throughout the educational process and in all the complexities of life. The thrust of the project is to match what has been learned about the process of growth and development of the child, and the process by which children actually learn the educational processes of the schools. Where the educational process does not &quot;fit&quot;, that is, where it is not  based on a developmentally sound model, an area for potential change is identified. In the first phase of the project, more than 50 educational leaders attended a week-long conference on early childhood education. The focus of the conference was on &quot;The Child From Three to Eight.&quot; Workshops on specific task-oriented topics and field trips to model programs are being held regularly. In progressive steps, the project staff and consultants will work with the participants as change agents in the local community to bring about a closer match between the educational process and the processes of growth, development, and learning in the young child.

Further, what does each ingredient comprise and just when do these compatibility conditions work?

Although the discussion is restricted to a communication model, its applications extend to all real-world situations involving networks.

The organization of the training guide is as follows: Part I is concerned with outlining the principal content areas that relate to the concept of change agent from a variety of perspectives; Part II and III provide some suggestions on how to select training goals and what principles to include in a good training design; Parts IV thru VI suggest how model training programs could be put together for various types of objectives-- Part IV provides a framework with eight design features that should be incorporated in any viable plan, and suggests how such an outline can be used to develop  training programs to meet various objectives, Part V presents outlines of several potential programs generated by conference task force groups, and Part VI presents a training model worked out for a particular type of role in detail (change agents in state education agencies). The total volume contains a number of ideas, suggestions, frameworks, principles, and tactical detail as several levels of specificity applicable to a wide range of change agent skills and situations, and thus should be a useful aid and reference source to trainers and training program developers.

The first part of the book examines the skill requirements for industrial development in low-income countries, the aims and characteristics of industrial manpower training programs at the national level, the measures needed to ensure a more effective use of manpower, and vocational and technical training for small-scale industrial enterprises and their personnel. The second part, after advocating the development of new employment opportunities and the achievement of full productive employment for the whole of the labor force in the industrial sector, brings out the importance of choosing the appropriate form of industrial technology to attain these  objectives. The main considerations that affect any wage policy designed to promote industrialization are listed, and the aims and nature of social participation schemes through which workers' and employers' organizations may contribute actively to the elaboration and application of industrialization programs are examined.

As defined by the study, the \"disadvantaged\" are those who have had an irregular work history; they tend to be the poor, or minority group members who have not had the education necessary to qualify for any but dead-end jobs. The \"advantaged\" are older workers who already have extensive job histories, but who are looking for a second, more satisfying career. Both could be candidates for paraprofessional work in rehabilitation, or for training in a professional rehabilitation career. As part of this study, a literature search was conducted to find books, articles, pamphlets and publications centered around paraprofessional and professional roles. Because not all material in  this field could be included, references were selected on the basis of their relevance to the utilization of the paraprofessional. The paper is divided into five areas: Professional Characteristics, Professional/Paraprofessional Roles and Relationships, Paraprofessional Career Ladders and Training, Client versus Organization Identification, and Community Issues.

Social gerontology seeks to discover the role of the social environment as a determinant of aging and of the behavior and position of older people in society. In the United States, some 20 million people are over 65 years of age, and the median age of the elderly has risen to age 73. There are suggestions that there may be a direct relationship between successful adjustment in old age and educational attainment. It is estimated that about one-sixth of the elderly are functionally illiterate and only five percent are college graduates. It is believed that the solutions to the complex problems in gerontology will require the application of research techniques of practically every scientific discipline. A  program in Cleveland, Ohio, utilizes retirees as \"Gatekeepers\" who act as liaison between health personnel and the elderly in the neighborhood. Communities need to offer a variety of alternatives to match the variety of individual needs among our aged and aging population. Services should include prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of health problems, and rehabilitation services. Each individual should be offered education tailored to his needs. (DB)",

It is divided into three main sections: (1) necessity, limits, and means of experimentation; (2) methods and fields of experimentation; and (3) the fields of experimentation. Hypotheses examined include: (1) The cultural minorities who are conscious of their situation as a minority are more open, seek more actively the raising of their level of knowledge and skill than the majorities; (2) The concept of school progression based on phonetic progression seems to have to be abandoned in the field of adult education; (3) Neither for the teacher nor for the taught is the traditional manual likely to be the best pedagogical instrument. It is concluded that in the  conduct of the Functional Literacy Programme, each project, in terms of the objectives that are set for it, the circumstances, the specific capacities of its cadres, should work out an experimentation plan supported by a corresponding evaluation plan.

Its objectives were to develop a training program for homemaker services that would: (1) establish an expectation of high quality performance and standards for all who care for the aging and other families, (2) provide a nucleus of trained homemakers to meet community needs, and (3) develop a prototype training program adaptable to junior and state colleges in Kansas and other states. A three-step training procedure was followed consisting of (1) teaching, (2) participation and demonstration, and (3) practical application. The teaching was performed by a staff of 25 specialized persons. The subject areas were working with and understanding people, food for families, home management skills, personal care of others,  and professional development. Conclusions include: (1) Women can and will take advantage of educational training opportunities and become fully employed as qualified homemakers; (2) Families in communities can benefit from having available qualified homemakers to work for them in times of need; (3) In-residence training provides a quality of instruction for the most essential concern of homemakers, that of providing personal care and understanding; (4) Support from the training center and employment services must be made available to the trainee after graduation.

The aim in compiling the Handbook has been to bring together at the National and State levels all the major agencies--university, statutory body, government departments and voluntary bodies--that provide programs of teaching for adults open to members of the public. There are listed also the large number of governmental or voluntary bodies which undertake educational work in special areas. The Handbook also lists all the major public  institutions--State Libraries, Museums, and Art Galleries--that serve importantly to supplement the direct teaching of adults by their collections.

CMI is primarily concerned with data management in the instructional process, and CAI is the use of computers to control the instructional process itself. The uses of computers in instruction can be described in four main categories: (1) Drill and Practice, (2) Tutorial-CAI, (3) Games and Simulation, and (4) Computation and Problem Solving. In Tutorial-CAI, instruction is carried out on the computer in a set of frames similar to programmed instruction. The use of computers in the instruction of Adult Basic Education (ABE) students was investigated in two ways: (1) The use of an IBM 1500 System investigated the use of computers for testing, Drill and  Practice and Tutorial-CAI, and (2) The development of an Instructional Process Control (IPC) System using a mini-computer and simplified student stations to control response feedback on programmed instructional materials. Conclusions include: (1) ABE pupils found the complexities of the student stations of the IBM 1500 System difficult to master and prone to produce anxiety; (2) The IPC System provided no impediments to learning. Recommendations include: (1) CAI in its conventional forms should not be explored any further at present for ABE pupils; (2) Further demonstration programs should be supported to develop applications of the IPC System.

        "description":"Proprietary schools fill an important gap in post-high school education. Because it is profit-oriented, the proprietary school is forced to provide new and unusual programs for the benefit of employers and students. The simple factor of specialization affords these schools an advantage over public schools. Other advantages, as reported by students, are: (1) Students can usually start a class within a week after enrolling; (2) Course completion can be achieved within a relatively short period of time; (3) The curriculum is usually entirely skill-oriented; (4) Assistance is available in securing employment after training; (5) Deferred payment plans are of direct financial assistance to the students. The potential of these schools, however, is inhibited because they are not status  symbols and those who attend them are from the less powerful and less vocal groups in society. Recently, a movement by business has developed to view the proprietary school as a sound investment. A number of corporations have entered the proprietary school business. As states assume responsibility for appropriate regulation of these schools, their potential may be more completely realized. This study faced a fundamental problem when it looked to other states for leadership in \"coordinating council-proprietary school relationships.\" The summary of the 50-state questionnaire survey regarding proprietary schools reveals that other states do not have organizations clearly comparable to the Oregon Educational Coordination Council. Replies to the questionnaire are summarized. (CK)",

        "description":"In Oregon, schools licensed by the Department of Education serve a broad base of occupational training needs and are governed by broadly stated and permissive legislation. It is the loose construction of statutes that gives the Department's Advisory Committee its purpose. The Committee and the Department jointly set standards of operation for the proprietary school. As the schools' involvement in training Oregon residents during the 70's, the strength of the state-school relationship will be tested. Therefore, it will be helpful to have a detailed description of the present relationship between proprietary schools and their respective licensing authorities. A recent Oregon Educational Coordinating Council report, &quot;Proprietary Schools and Educational Plannings,&quot; October 1970,  dramatized the problem further by demonstrating that nationally, &quot;the 1960's could be considered a decade of indecision by local educational organizations which failed to develop new working relationships to utilize the facilities or programs of proprietary school.&quot; The following conclusions have been reached from the research and preparation of this report: (1) State licensing agencies for proprietary schools have established a close and significantly unique relationship with the proprietary school in Oregon which is nationally unprecedented; (2) The proprietary school can no longer be ignored in the assessment of educational resources in the state; (3) There is a need for the state to be equipped to objectively assess the performance of a school in at least teacher training and  supervision and program evaluation.

They indicated that making money and social status were not significant considerations in job choice. These views represent a significantly different \"alternative life style\" for these students from that of their \"middle American\" parents. The espousal of alternate political and social values by the adolescents was found to reflect a long-term pattern of intergenerational conflict. Students  who experienced the parents' marital relationship as discordant or the child-parent, especially the child-mother, relationship as conflictive and lacking in understanding, were less authoritarian and less likely to internalize parental values regarding politics, sex, religion and life style. No relationship was found between the students' life style and parental education, income or occupation, and the college experience did not prove a liberalizing factor. (KS)",

A subsequent videotape-feedback training program resulted in improvements in both therapist and child behaviors. These were maintained even after the training condition was withdrawn. Based on these positive results, 3 mothers were similarly trained to work with their own young children. A major point revealed in this investigation is that it does not suffice merely to present the nonprofessional therapist with a behavior  modification program and an injunction to carry it out.

        "description":"Three experiments are reported, each of which was designed to investigate how people in ingratiating and non-ingratiating situations would be evaluated when they communicated immediacy through the use of another person's name. While immediacy is acknowledged to be generally associated with positive affect, it is suggested that evaluation of a person who communicates immediacy would depend on the appropriateness of this communication to the context or situation. The authors predicted that when the use of another person's name occurred under conditions of non-ingratiation, it would be positively evaluated, while the reverse would be true under conditions of ingratiation. Results of all 3 experiments are in accord with the prediction, thus providing support for Jones (1964)  ingratiation-attractiveness model. Possibilities for future research are suggested. (TL)",

        "description":"In the author's view, the first step in solving college orientation problems is to assess the character of the campus. Orientation personnel interested in designing a useful program should note: (1) the size of the school; (2) whether the institution is primarily commuter or residential; (3) the size of the budget; (4) the degree of faculty and student involvement; (5) how receptive other campus offices are to innovations and changes in the orientation program; and (6) what kinds of students attend the school. A great deal of emphasis is placed on the success of facilitating productive interaction among persons crucial to the orientation program. Several aspects of the program at the University of Florida are highlighted: (1) the Summer Orientation Program; (2) the Student  Volunteer Program; and (3) the Teacher-Counselor Program. All are shown to \"fit\" the character of the campus. It is felt that a truly successful program will include students in the planning. Six recommendations from students attending the National Orientation Directors Conference conclude the paper. (TL)",

He then describes the potential resistances, to an elementary guidance program, by amdinistrators, teachers and parents. These, he feels, can be overcome through a public relations approach which facilitates communication, develops understanding and promotes involvement. Possible concrete steps are enumerated. A breakdown of the author's work week shows that his time is distributed among teaching guidance classes, counseling, group work, and teacher collaboration. Several of his instructional methods are briefly discussed. It is the author's feeling that counseling is the most crucial function. Thirteen case studies are included which provide a range of situations likely to be encountered in elementary guidance.  Evaluations of the pilot program by the principal, teachers and students are summarized and obviously weigh heavily on the author's concluding suggestions for possible changes, priorities and improvements.

The study placed a subject in an emergency situation in which one of 3 confederates served as a model: (1) male peer; (2) female peer; or (3) high status male. In the control condition there was no model. When a male model failed to offer assistance there was a significant decrease in helping on the part of the subjects. In all other cases the rate of helping was high. The results indicate that the greater influence of the male model, as compared with the female model, was due to his greater ability to provide information which could be accepted as a valid definition of the  emergency situation.

Rather than having reinforcers contingent upon critical responses, they were simply correlated with the critical response. The 8 adjective pairs from the evaluative scale of the semantic differential (and 4 buffer pairs) were presented verbally by real subjects to confederate subjects 5 times in random order. There were 4 experimental groups: subjects who, as \"experimenters,\" were trying to influence their (confederate) subjects to a more positive evaluation of labor unions by the way they verbally presented adjective pairs; subjects who were trying to influence to a more negative evaluation; the difference between these first 2 and the other 2 (control) groups  was that the latter were only monitors not trying to influence their respective subjects. The sessions were concluded with an interview to determine awareness. The post-experiment interview data confirmed the lack of awareness and the effectiveness of reinforcement via their subjective feelings of success as an experimenter. (Author/RK)",

In the experimental condition, 2 rewards were offered, one of which was concealed by a question mark. In addition the question mark concealed one of 2 possible rewards, presented according to varied probability schedules. To the subjects, it was uncertain what was under the question mark. The control condition contained no such uncertainty, since the question marks were colored and associated with a specific, known reward. Findings indicate that children chose the question mark more frequently in the experimental condition than in the control condition. Other findings are also reported which suggest that the desire to reduce uncertainty is not the  only variable operating, but that the value of the reward influences choice as well. The data points to the incentive properties of uncertainty reduction, or information, for children. Implications for learning are touched upon in the discussion. (TL)",

Four black and 4 white female high school graduates received extensive practical training in administering the WISC, and each then tested 14 black and 14 white children. The children all completed a test anxiety questionnaire prior to administration. Results show that, while the black children generally scored lower than whites, the predicted interaction between race of child and  race of examiner was not obtained. In all instances, black examiners produced higher scores than whites. Finally, no significant main effects or interactions were found in relation to the anxiety measure. The findings are discussed.

Data were obtained from a survey of American workers conducted by the Survey Research Center of the University of Michigan late in 1969. Results showed that the average working  woman received $3,458 less than her male counterpart.

There were some trends in the data to indicate that women who are not career  oriented show more discrepancy between the real and ideal feminine self concept. In general, on the female valued items, women would like to be more feminine than they believe themselves to be and on the male valued items, they would like to be more masculine than they believe themselves to be.

Major findings link self-disclosure to environmental parameters and interpersonal friction. In the Privacy without Stimulation condition, Ss possibly attempted to cope with this austerity by engaging in verbal exchanges which, doubtlessly, decreased social distance between pair-members and resulted in greater disclosure breadth at high intimacy levels. Stimulation in the No-Privacy groups probably mediated verbal exchanges by reminding Ss of past experiences. However, the especially close interaction forced by the No-Privacy manipulation tended to encourage guardedness; while  groups in Privacy with Stimulation exhibited the least amount of disclosure due to being physically separated, especially those under Long Mission Expectations. Findings have broad implication for exchange theories and can be useful in training men to adapt to isolated and confined situations. (Author)",

The data are based on like-aged, like-sexed gros of 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 16, and 20 year olds which are comparable with regard to personal and social characteristics, group size and number of sessions met.

Results suggest that, contrary to what is usually thought, child-adult qualitative  interaction differences are more directly attacked through quantitative comparisons. Certain of the data suggests that, while physical maturation may be slow enough to hinder the child's complete attainment of adult interpersonal styles, children may also lack adult interaction structure due to poor, or incomplete, socialization.

Subjects received shocks one, 5, or 9 times. An interaction between attraction and actual shock probability was found on probability estimations. Subjects in the negative attraction-90% probability condition estimated higher shock probabilities than did subjects in either the negative attraction-10% or positive attraction-90% conditions. Only when the subjects could make an attribution of malevolent intentions by receiving consistent  punishment from a disliked harm-doer did subjective probability estimates rise above 50%. Subsequent liking for the confederate was determined by initial liking and was inversely related to the number of shocks received. The more often the confederate delivered shocks, the more active and the more potent he was perceived to be. (Author)",

Results indicated that frequency of reciprocated shock (counter-aggression) was a direct and linear function of frequency of initial aggression delivered. Also, the low-frequency aggressor was over-punished and the high-frequency aggressor under-punished, demonstrating a curious but apparently reliable phenomenon consistent with the Berkowitz and Daniels' studies (1964).

Problems involved in the longitudinal study of psychological variables are discussed and 2 feasible designs applied in an effort to differentiate the effects of chronological age, secular trends, generation differences, as well as the effects of repeated measurement upon selected personality variables for adults ranging in mean age from 25-81 years. The first involves performance-task measures of personality style, psychomotor speed and motor-cognitive rigidity, while the second involves questionnaire responses concerning personality traits, personality-perceptual rigidity and social responsibility. All measures show significant age differences which are  interpreted as generational differences. While the data is consistent with a stability model of adult personality, many interesting phenomena are suggested for the developmentalist. The author concludes that, although adult personality structure doesn't change, the sociocultural impact upon successive generations leads to clearly observable age differences in personality at any single historical point.

Some suggestions would have counselors: (1) serving as consultants to administrators; (2) urging administrators to provide paraprofessional help; (3) working in crisis intervention; and (4) providing assistance in supportive programs designed to improve a young person's skill in basic areas so that he can succeed in the school environment. The authors further suggest that  counselors actively involve themselves in broad system programmatic changes which include providing homebound services for emotionally ill young people, staff in-service activities to encourage humanism, and communicating information through the media of the community, i.e., newspaper, radio, PTA, and other groups.

A typical cross-sectional comparison of a sample of older adults' performances on a battery of measures revealed that non-surviving subjects and those who refused to be retested 5 and 10 years later scored consistently below retestees. These results point to a heterogeneity in the aging population and to biases in the sampling process, and suggest the need to define the population more specifically. Analysis of scores by going backwards in age starting with the time of death suggests the occurrence of lower limits in performance. Decline with age is attributed to a sudden drop in performance occurring within 5 years prior to subjects' deaths (terminal drop). Throughout adulthood, performances of long-term  survivors are unchanged. The decline with age usually observed is attributed to the increasing number of subjects exhibiting terminal drops.

A secondary purpose is to relate these personality factors to academic achievement. Approximately 320 sophomores were administered a psychometric battery which included: (1) an impulsiveness scale; (2) the Rotter Incomplete Sentences Blank; (3) a culture-fair intelligence test; (4) a temperament survey; (5) a capacity test; (6) a survey of study habits; (7) an adjective check list; and (8) an anxiety scale. Criterion measures utilized were grades in selected courses, conduct scores, number of behavioral infractions, and drop-out information. Comprehensive and varied data analyses were undertaken both for answers  to specific questions and for exploration of other possible relationships. The most significant findings indicate: (1) a low but significant correlation of anxiety with impulsiveness; (2) a relationship of both to study habits; (3) a positive relationship between high impulsiveness and behavioral infractions and dropping out; and (4) no significant relationship between the ratio of impulsiveness to anxiety and academic achievement when other factors are partialled out.

        "description":"A study is reported in which the effects of 2 competitive treatments on mean classroom performance, interest and retention were examined with the use of a 10-day vocabulary-learning task. Sixty-six 5th grade classrooms were randomly assigned to one of 3 conditions: (1) control; (2) competition with reward; and (3) competition in a game setting. The results indicate that, contrary to prediction, neither performance nor retention was increased under the competitive treatments. However, interest was found to be significantly higher in these treatments than in the control. Finally, and according to prediction, little variability was found between the effects of the 2 competitive conditions on the 3 dependent variables. A model relating task-complexity and motivation to increased  performance is proposed and discussed. Several related areas of educational research are suggested, all of which concern aspects of cognitive and affective motivation. (Author/TL)",

Data from Vital Statistics Reports and from empirical studies are utilized to establish similarities between married and unwed teenage girls with respect to fertility patterns, socioeconomic level, and access to life's choices. The presumed relationship between too early marriage and/or child rearing and the incidence of poverty  is noted from the standpoint of (a) decreased time and energy and/or lack of opportunity for continued educational pursuits, (b) low, income level, and (c) excess fertility. The&quot;high risks&quot; of pregnancy and childbearing to young girls and their infants is also considered. These major conclusions are drawn: (1) in relation to poverty, the timing of the first birth may be of greater strategic importance than the ultimate size of the family; and (2) adolescent pregnancy is far less a moral problem than it is a socioeconomic and health problem.

Face-saving, defined as sacrificing tangible (monetary) rewards to avoid public embarrassment, was measured by the length of time subjects publicly performed an embarrassing task. Subjects' payoffs increased the longer they performed. It was hypothesized that face-saving would be reduced when (1) subjects believed that another was dependent on them for his outcome; and (2) subjects expected to encounter the other afterwards. Two significant main effects confirmed the hypotheses.

The sample was comprised of 160 low and middle SES subjects (K-4) matched for upper and lower VA, to each of whom was administered a battery of Piagetian tasks. Results indicate SES to be a negligible variable, while VA has much stronger discriminative power.

The findings support the Piagetian position that culture, schooling, and language have only a limited effect on intellectual development. (Author/TL)",

This context effect was demonstrated using variations of the Peterson-Peterson (1959) paradigm for both aurally and visually presented material, verbal and arithmetic context, and within and between Ss designs. Experiments were conducted to discover whether the context effect was due to differential ability to rehearse in the recall interval, differing intertrial intervals, and different amounts of activity on the Ss part during a trial. None of these hypotheses was supported by the data. An experiment was conducted to find out if proactive interference was the cause of the context effect, and this also turned out negative.

Students from a large state university and a medium-sized Catholic university were used as comparison groups. The survey measured the student's definitions of his college experience within the context of 4 alienation variables: meaninglessness, powerlessness, normlessness, and social isolation. The results showed that freshmen come to college with low levels of alienation and by mid-year the levels increase to the extent that they match the other classes. Inter-school comparisons showed that despite some differences in the magnitude of levels of alienation, students at the 3 schools also  shared common attitudes toward college experience. It was concluded that despite some variations in magnitude of alienation between subsamples of students at a small liberal arts college and some variations in magnitudes of alienation at the 3 schools, students share, to a high degree, common alienated attitudes.

It was expected that the determinants would vary from company to company because the company situations are different and the determinants would reflect the particular situations. The resulting individual company regression models did show differences even though these five companies were members of the same corporation. The results of this study do not explain why there are differences or what effects manipulation of the determinants would have; these questions require  further study.

The research focuses on the practical perspectives of these efforts, especially the constraints encountered in program design and implementation, and the various techniques and responses which may overcome these constraints. The findings of this report are rooted in large measure in judgments of program staff, management officials, union leaders who have dealt closely with special projects, and the interpretations of the authors who have studied the upgrading issue for the past 2 years. This report is intended to fertilize the thinking of decision-makers about the problems and possibilities in providing greater opportunities for non-supervisory workers. Primary  findings include: (1) Management will mount special training efforts when a specific need is identified, (2) Litigation by government agencies has often forced companies to develop special upgrading efforts for racial minorities, (3) Management is just beginning to relate production difficulties to personnel problems, (4) Workers are not articulating demands for more upgrading opportunities, and (5) Workers are reluctant to participate in upgrading programs involving substantial expenditures of their time and money.

In addition, the amputees were interviewed by a psychiatric social worker. The clinical interviews revealed a universal presence of chronic depression among the amputees. The experimental tests indicated that there was no evidence that amputees who were able to pass conventional driver licensing tests have greater  accident frequencies than do unimpaired persons. The vehicle simulator experiments revealed that, with appropriate power assists, unilateral orthopedic impairment should not necessarily impair driving performance. On the basis that orthopedically impaired persons usually have a high degree of motivation to succeed as safe drivers, it was recommended that the driving abilities of impaired persons be reappraised according to their overall ability to operate vehicles in interstate commerce.

Records for 411 vocationally trained subjects were used for the analysis of earnings. The data were analyzed by analysis of covariance and multiple regression analysis. One strong relationship uncovered was the negative association between I.Q. and benefits from vocational training. Some conditions among former vocational  students that were found to be related to relatively higher income potential were: (1) study in health occupations, (2) being of the male sex, (3) working at a job requiring specific training, and (4) being a high school graduate. It was found that training led to similar proportionate income gains among the educationally deprived as well as high school graduates. (GEB)",

A secondary goal was the evaluation of the effectiveness of using programed instruction in vocational training of adolescents with moderate intellectual and/or emotional handicaps. Four teaching methods used included the: (1) Automated Method, (2) Conventional Method, (3) Integrated, and (4) Programed Lecture. The most effective of the four methods proved to be the integrated method, while the automated method was more efficient than the conventional and the programed lecture methods. Students who were  taught by the machine method alone, demonstrated the weakest performance on proficiency tests. A final conclusion was that the training of mentally retarded and emotionally handicapped adolescents can be enhanced through a coordinated program of good teaching instruction and programed instruction.

This study outlines the development, organization, and procedures of the regional specialized, and governmental accrediting agencies in the United States. The arguments for and against separate accreditation of occupational education are discussed. Because of the rapid growth of occupational education, problems still exist in judging its effectiveness. In addition to a review of literature, procedures included letters soliciting information, personal interviews, and the use of questionnaires. Suggestions for future action on the part of  accrediting agencies are included. (Author/GEB)",

The two major tasks are: (1) to ascertain the extent of group agreement on the occupational guidance role of secondary school counselors, and (2) to determine the relationships of selected variables to the degree of such agreement. Data were obtained from principals, counselors, general education teachers, and vocational education teachers from a random sample of all North Carolina high schools having a 12th grade, a vocational education position, and a guidance counselor. It was concluded that principals, counselors, and teachers have similar conceptions of the occupational guidance role of the counselors. There is some slight disagreement on some of the role  expectations listed on the 60-item instrument used. Those variables related to this agreement or disagreement are the attitude of the counselor to occupational education, the type of counselor, and the frequency of interaction between counselors and general education teachers.

In comparing the factor structures for the various demographic groupings, patterns of scale loadings across groupings were emphasized. It was expected that some factors would be common for all demographic groupings of employees, while other factors would vary in their patterns of scale loadings. The resulting factor structures showed that factors related to compensation and personal progress and development work aspects had very similar scale loadings for all groupings of employees. However,  the two remaining factors that dealt with superior-subordinate interactions and the context of the organization were perceived differently among the demographic groupings. Thus the conclusion of the study was that demographic characteristics reflected a difference in the perception of organizational-related variables but not in the perception of individual-related variables for job satisfaction.

There were some anticipated successes--trainees jumped between two and seven grades in educational attainment within 10 weeks--and some unanticipated failures. There were also some tentative research conclusions which may influence national manpower policy, or stimulate a heated controversy. The so-called \"untrainable\" and \"uneducable\" men and women coming into the program to prepare  for a job, were advanced so quickly, that new work and educational options opened to them: a high school diploma and college entrance. Despite first year failures, over 66 percent of the graduates were permanently placed in private-industry jobs, an increasing number of trainees began to obtain their high school diplomas, and an equal number went on to college and stayed there.

Data came from a 1966 survey of 7,000 male high school seniors enrolled in general, commerce, agricultural, and technical curriculums, with supplementary data from the students' fathers. This first volume of the five-volume report includes an overview of the entire study and an introductory chapter. Japan was chosen for this study because of the exceptional data coverage and reliability, and the notable similarities and contrast with the United States in relevant educational matters. In this volume a generalized  sequential human-investment and career decision model is presented, which permits the inclusion of both monetary and non-monetary factors.

Using statistical analysis of the data, it was concluded that the National Business Entrance Stenographic Test and four of the 16 personality traits as measured by the 16 P.F. Personality Test are predictors of job success when using the Minnesota Satisfactoriness Scales. To analyse the data, researchers used correlation, analysis of variance, statistical \"t\", and chi  square statistical analysis. (Author)",

The finding of a strong, positive relationship between similarity of interests and likability would be significant for two reasons. First, it would represent an extension of the similarity-attraction hypothesis, so important in personality research, to the field of vocational behavior. Second, positive findings would provide further support for Halland's theory of vocational choice by testing the validity of some of its assumptions. When results were compared directly with previous research concerning the effects of similarity of attitudes or personality on likability, a strong positive  relationship was found between interest similarity and rated attraction. The implications of these findings for a major theory of vocational behavior are discussed. (Author)",

Baldwin describes a curriculum package entitled Ecology the Web of Life, designed for high potential students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. It is intended to develop higher level thought processes, features several methods of inquiry, and is multidisciplinary. Jean A. Morse discusses barriers (social pressures and restrictions) faced by gifted girls while growing up which depress manifestations of their potential, and subtle and direct barriers faced by gifted women. Covered are role expectations and opportunities, discriminatory employment practices, problems in choosing and pursuing a career, and suggestions for workers in the area of the gifted. Jack L.  Fadely addresses the subject of whether professional women in education, especially at administrative, higher education, and supervisory levels, find their sex a barrier to advancement and equal opportunity. Examined are issues involved, current trends, and opportunities, based on a review of related studies and interviews. James L. McDuffie compares features necessary for special education programs, particularly for the gifted and retarded. Identified are key program features useful for program development and evaluation.

A briefing group is one which is called together regularly in order that company decisions and the reasons behind them may be explained to employees at all levels. The objective of such a group is to convey understanding of a communication to every employee through face-to-face contact with his supervisor. Each manager is responsible for communication to the people he supervises. To avoid distortion of the most important information, a written brief is frequently issued as a support. Briefings occur once a month and last from 15 minutes to half an hour. Groups vary from 6 to 20 in most of the nine companies.  (CK)",

Five of each of the respondents' newspaper articles were randomly selected, and 100-word samples were randomly chosen from each of the five articles. The Farr-Jenkins-Paterson Reading Ease Formula was used to determine reading ease or readability. Personal data and agents' attitudes toward writing and the use of newspapers as a teaching aid were collected by means of mailed questionnaires. The data were analyzed by use of descriptive statistical methods, according to tenure in Extension, education, reading habits,  writing experience, and regard for the newspaper article as a teaching method. Findings are that: (1) only 7 of the 100 agents wrote in the \"standard\" range; (2) the agent's field of education affects his ability to write at a relatively high level of readability; (3) a small number of agents had received writing training; and (4) the agents place a relatively high value on the use of newspaper articles as a teaching method.

This project's primary purpose was to test and demonstrate the effectiveness of providing intensive vocational rehabilitation services to federal offenders at two specified states in the correctional process. A total of 484 cases were monitored, 107 of which were assigned to the experimental group. The subjects were drawn from releasees and probationers under supervision of the U.S. Probation Office for the Northern District of Georgia and from the inmate population of the U. S. Penitentiary, Atlanta. The project was based on two basic hypotheses: (1) that traditional VR services are ancillary to effecting attitudinal change in the offender client, and (2) that areas essentially innovative to VR concern need to be explored  if patterns of criminality are to be interrupted. In brief, the findings are: (1) supportive counseling and psychotherapy proved to be the two most significant services provided; (2) emergency services should be flexible and provided at the point of need; and (3) the client and his family should be treated as a unit rather than simply providing services to the client alone.

The two communities are studied as to reputed influentials, the business and economic subsystem, the civic organizational subsystem, the educational subsystem, and the governmental subsystem. A comparison of the two communities as to influence structure revealed both similarities and differences. One community, Riverview (a pseudonym) had a structure of influence directed by community influentials; in the other community, Newton (a pseudonym), the reputed community influentials, with one exception, seemed neither to be the source of influence nor  closely allied to influential units of the community. Conclusions are that: (1) the reputational technique makes it difficult to locate and identify socially and geographically removed individuals, emerging influentials, and influentials no longer active in community decision making; (2) the social system as a conceptual tool is useful as a theoretical framework from which to analyze the structure of influence; (3) the vertical system concept is a useful tool in analyzing extra-community based influence; and (4) the two communities exhibit characteristics similar to larger ones.

The methodology used in data gathering was: (1) the selection of &quot;judges&quot; who were knowledgeable in one or more areas of community life; and (2) the designation of community influentials by the judges. In Riverview, 9 judges nominated 21 individuals two or more times, and 18 of these people were interviewed. Six of the 18 were mentioned four or more times in  answers to questions concerning general community influence; only these individuals were considered as general reputed community influentials. This influence was based on particular elements such as power (both formal and informal), rank, status-role position, sentiment, and sanctions. No vertical systems--extracommunity based power--were active in the structure of influence within the community.

The discussion of cost-benefit analysis is based primarily on the assumption that the value of consumption in the society, given a certain distribution of income, is the goal of society. Other goals that society might wish to implement through government literacy programs are: (1) to redistribute income among certain racial groups, certain age groups, or regional areas; (2) to stimulate economic growth and guarantee a self-sufficient economy; and (3) to help correct its balance of payments problems. Methods of implementing these side  goals are discussed. Rates of return to literacy and primary education are illustrated by results of studies conducted in India, Latin America, and the United States. Cost-benefit analysis in adult literacy programs provides the decision maker with a useful tool with which to make more rational choices in the allocation of funds to education. (DB)",

These questions concerned: (1) the instructional effectiveness of the 30 video programs and pen and pencil lessons; (2) the two programs as single or dual instructional media; (3) target population attitudes toward English usage and video program characters; and (4) learning retention among program participants subsequent to a time period following the final program exposure. Findings of the field testing show: (1) the Empleen Ingles Video Program and Paper/Pencil Lessons produce dramatic and significant gains in English comprehension, usage, and vocabulary; (2) a combination of the programs produce greater  learning effects than does a single instructional medium; (3) the target population perceived the video program in a favorable light; and (4) the degree of English proficiency 20 days after program exposure remained significantly higher as compared with pretest scores. It is recommended that: (1) a dissemination plan be conceptualized and implemented to provide the target population with these instructional programs; and (2) consideration be given to continuing the development of the Empleen Ingles series until 100 or 150 video programs have been completed.

The AABEDC operates in the Appalachian counties of thirteen states from New York to Mississippi. Its target audience is the rural isolated mountain people. AABEDC activities fall into four areas: change agent, training, research, and demonstration. Change agent activities included local, state, and regional advisory boards, seven conferences, inter-agency cooperation, 29 monographs and brochures and dissemination of innovation. Training activities included a graduate program in adult and continuing education, three Adult Basic Education (ABE) training institutes, and  staff training in field units. Research activities included seven studies. Demonstration activities included 14 projects or modules in 11 states. The evaluations of the AABEDC Regional Board of Directors and the Michigan Institutional Survey and Consulting Service are reported. It is recommended that the model of a research, demonstration, and training center serving a distinct subpopulation of ABE students and staff in a several state area is an efficient and effective use of monies available to adult education.

The research was undertaken from two different vantage points: (1) determining how farmers view farm information sources, and (2) determining how views of farmers about sources are related to the variables considered in the study. The semantic differential was used to assess views in both phases. In Phase I, three steps were taken to secure a diversity of farmer opinion: (1) As many item scales were sought as would be reasonably expected to relate to views held about farm information sources; (2) A wide diversity of farmers was chosen to give their reactions to such sources in terms of the scales selected; and (3) The farmers were  asked to express their views about a representative range of sources from which they ordinarily obtain farm information. In Phase II, the general procedure was to have samples of farmers rate five of the eight designated information sources in terms of the 14 selected item scales. Some general conclusions reached are: (1) Farmers have characteristic ways of viewing farm information sources; (2) Utility practicality, affectivity, and accessibility views can be distinguished; (3) The farmers studied differentiated between classes of sources in terms of these qualities.

The adult basic education component is designed to allow any recruit to enter at any level from illiteracy and proceed in the program at his own pace to whatever level he may achieve up to grade 10. The initial skills training subsystem includes training in small engine and auto mechanics, welding, business and commercial skills, entry-level health occupations, and child care and homemaker assistants.  Recruitment is an active outreach measure. Mass media advertising, personal contact, contact with interested groups and other parties for referrals are used.

It was designed to cover the complete production process involved in the growing of cole crops for processing. The general approach used by the instructor was as follows: (1) Terms familiar to those in attendance were  used in preference to technical terms; (2) Ideas or concepts that were deemed new to the growers were expressed in more than one way; (3) The farmers were given the opportunity to ask questions and suggest topics.

These three questions dealt with age, full-time study, and instructional sources. Responses to the 12-part questionnaire will be published in a  subsequent report. The statistics presented here were obtained from the household spokesman for individual persons. This report is one that shows multiple participation in various kinds of sources of adult education.

One county was selected from each of Ohio's ten Extension administrative areas. County faculty mailed the course lessons at regular intervals to  leaders in the experimental group. Leaders in neither the experimental nor the control group knew that they were involved in a research project. The new leaders' knowledge about 4-H was measured by a 20-item multiple choice test.

A growing number of women are seeking re-entry in a wide range of income levels. The demand for part-time work appears to exceed supply. Official machinery for assisting re-entry women exists, at least nominally, in all the countries studied. It has to be decided, however, whether special machinery needs to be created to deal with the particular problems of this group and whether such machinery should take the form of a Women's Bureau. In the United States, the Women's Bureau is getting results. Many women have been handicapped in their careers through lack of vocational guidance. Where there are good openings,  many are prevented from taking advantage of them through lack of basic educational qualifications. Success achieved in training older women is being achieved. This study has shown that re-entry programs for older women can be a satisfactory investment for both the community and the woman herself. The nature of the women's labor market will in any case change over the next decade as a result of the combined effects of technology and of the introduction of equal pay. (Author/CK)",

Conclusions are: (1) The importance and performance of supervisory tasks were perceived quite differently by groups of the Extension Service faculty when grouped by: position of employment, tenure, age, level of educational accomplishment,  and subject matter major of the most advanced degree attained; (2) Extension faculty consistently view the importance of supervisory tasks higher than the performance of these tasks.

The following conclusions were reached: (1) Adult educators in the county considered themselves well prepared in the field of adult education; (2) Factors that were related in a statistically significant manner to a higher professional preparation level score were longer tenure in adult education, completion of college courses in adult education, participation in initial orientation programs, attendance at adult education conferences, and reading of adult  education journals. Factors that were not related in a statistically significant manner to a higher professional level score were age, graduation from college, per cent of total working time devoted to adult education, participation in in-service training programs, time spent with supervisors, and membership in professional adult education associations.

Sixteen community issues were analyzed in terms of: (1) the relative importance of each issue as perceived by the residents, (2) the perceived performance of the city for each of the issues, (3) the amount of volunteer effort for each problem area, and (4) the amount of financial support for each service area. The subsystem proposed for use has been named MIS for Municipal Information System. The functions of MIS are oriented to both citizens and  decision-makers; the potential users of information are the gatherers and processors of it. MIS breaks down into three major function areas: gathering, processing, and utilization. The system would provide an opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of present programs, allow more active participation by the public in planning programs, and produce better baseline information necessary for effective planning.

Two sections of this compilation deal with the application of Adlerian principles in the classroom and in counseling situations. Three articles elaborate on the use of classroom discussions as effective means for children to gain insight into their goals as well as methods of achieving them. Story-telling and discussion in the classroom are also useful for developing a sense of sharing, generosity, patience  and social interest free of the four goals of children's misbehavior. The section on counseling includes: (1) the Adlerian conceptual foundations of counseling; (2) a rationale for interviewing parents; and (3) an Adlerian elementary school counseling model. (TL)",

A significant, positive relationship was found between race consciousness and the number of children desired, but not between race consciousness and agreement with the notion of family size limitation for black people generally. Moreover, reported use of birth control did not relate to race consciousness. Finally, race consciousness was not found to relate to endorsement of any of a series of statements concerning race genocide.

All group members were junior college freshmen females. At the end of their freshman year, the cumulative grade point averages of the three groups were compared.

How this information was treated, and why, comprise part of the content. (TL)",

Nearly half of the students (seven) accessed three data files, and two additional students accessed four files. This correlates with the number of sessions these students had with the system. Case studies for eight of the students who participated in the field test are presented in the following format: (1) use of system; (2) general description; (3) expectations; (4) system activity; (5) reactions; (6) impressions; and (7) general discussion. A variety of outcomes are represented.

TEEPS is designed not only to deal with deviant behaviors, but also to facilitate the development of intellectual skills, leadership skills, social skills, and creativity in children. The program has three components: (1) research and development; (2) consultation; and (3) evaluation. Current thinking on the consultation process, which utilizes behavior modification techniques, is discussed  extensively. Its success demonstrates that: (1) a psychologist and teacher working together can define problems operationally; (2) they can formulate concrete intervention plans; and (3) they can measure what they have accomplished. Data further indicate that such consultation teams are highly effective, reasonably efficient, and that consultation as a service can attain a high level of acceptance in schools. (TL)",

In general, elementary and secondary education are nearly universal, while the college B.A. continues to be a minority commodity. Decreasing attrition rates and increasing costs are also discussed.

The paper takes an into-the-future look at the day when an artificial intelligence system guiding simulated counselor, teacher, and career generator systems becomes a feasible programing task. Toward this ultimate goal, the author proposes to start with the career decision game, and to develop the full system as a series of increasingly complex modifications of its basic format. The game in its present form is described and its use as a miniature model for the entire system of  interacting simulations (teacher-student, counselor-client) is discussed. (TL)",

Using a brief, semi-projective task, moral judgments were elicited from undergraduate fraternity members. These were scored for maturity of moral judgment.

Where role communication to parents and the community are concerned, considerable variety was found, most of which relied on video assistance or role playing and audience participation. However, there was a distinct absence of systematic follow-through. Role communication to pupils is generally done in the form of cartoon characters (junior high) and  organized orientation programs (secondary students). A conventional talking approach was found to predominate where counselors communicated their roles to teachers. Sample activities are included for all groups. (TL)",

The study concerns itself with the identification and interpretation of those factors that are germane to a Mexican-American high school graduate's perception of himself, his school, his home, his community, and their interrelationship and from which he attempts to relate himself effectively to the rest of the world and, thereupon, to construct the matrix of his life after graduation from high school. A conversational approach to data gathering was utilized. The author illuminates the reader concerning Laredo itself, the entire geographical area, the school district and, most importantly, the situation of Mexican-Americans who must live and confront this environment. Wide-ranging implications and  conclusions, based on the comprehensive data, are included. In general, the public schools of Laredo are grossly deficient in providing the Mexican-American graduate with the skills and experiences which he needs to make it in the society with which he is confronted upon graduation. The research reported herein was funded under Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. (TL)",

        "description":"Useful definitions for both \"educationally disadvantaged students\" and \"survival\" are proposed. The approaches and results of many nationwide collegiate programs directed at recruiting and sustaining such students are discussed. Two basically different approaches are being taken: (1) the remedial approach; and (2) the \"cultural difference\" approach in which black culture and urban problems are stressed and field experience in the community is often part of the courses. Two programs, in particular those at Stanford University and Northeastern Illinois State College, are cited for their remarkably high survival rates. The latter, with its components, is described in some detail. On the basis of the review, the author concludes that disadvantaged students are clearly able to survive  in college. Experience in a wide variety of institutions provides enough commonality of methods and results to encourage every institution to provide specialized personnel and services for establishing or improving college programs for the increasing numbers of disadvantaged students.

Federal involvement so far has been in the form of Federal aid that is temporary, specific, and often used for remedial purposes or appropriated for emergency situations. A Federal support program, on the other hand, underwrites a Federal Government share in State and local financing. It is directed to general school operation, attacks fundamental problems of broad financial needs, and involves longrange commitment on the part of the Federal Government.

Evaluation supports decisionmaking in program adoption and program improvement, as well as research for a better understanding of the educative process. An experimental design should, therefore, be structured to accommodate all data requirements for the evaluations.

However, increased tax pressure, school overcrowding, and the need for additional educational programs contribute pressures for change. Extended educational opportunity through better utilization of facilities in a lengthened school year can help relieve the strain on both budgets and overcrowded classrooms. Extended school year plans are grouped into staggered attendance programs, summer programs, and extended year plans. When both factors of quality and quantity are considered, an extended school year of continuous study for all pupils seems to offer the greatest promise. Staff and community involvement, support, and preparation are essential  to the success of any change. (Author)",

It provides several perspectives on the educational problems of cities, offers some suggestions for improvement that are being tried in two metropolitan regions, and describes some of the talents, resources, organizational patterns, facilities, and commitments being employed. The case study technique was used to examine and analyze two medium-sized areas (Hartford, Connecticut, and Nashville- Davidson County, Tennessee) to learn from these metropolitan regions about providing high quality education equitably and economically. After analyzing data gathered from over 50 indepth interviews with community and educational leaders, 200 questionnaires, local  newspaper stories, and all available reports and documents, researchers concluded that (1) although Nashville and Hartford are using different means, they are both making meaningful progress toward an equitable, efficient, and economical metropolitan effort in education; and (2) for many communities the voluntary or Hartford model provides the best promise.

The component's purpose was to determine if children deviating from their peers could be educated as an integral part of the regular class. Children with an IQ under 80 were provided individual prescriptions in the regular classroom by a teacher assistant. Language development prescriptions were provided outside the classrooms for children with gross motor problems, learning disabilities, or immature speech. Instructional strategies and content in the areas of social and emotional development, motor development, language development, and parent education are detailed. Evaluation showed that the special education students had posttest mean scores  only slightly below those of the other children and above those of day care and kindergarten comparison groups. Greatest gains were made by 3-year-olds. Most of the children entering with IQ's under 80 were able to enter regular first grade classes. It was concluded that individual and language development prescriptions were successful and that early childhood programs can accommodate children deviating from their peer norm in the same classroom.

Graduates of School B who have been out of school for varying lengths of time were also compared with each other. Interviewed were 41 School A and 41 School B graduates from the years 1964 and 1965, and 114 School B students who graduated between 1952 and 1963. Students were compared on social, vocational, and economic measures, such as job placement, tenure, income, community  participation, and other factors. It was found that graduates of School B had a better school attendance record, held more full-time jobs, had higher occupational levels and salaries, were more likely to seek further education, were more prudent in money management, married later or remained single more often, had better homes, and participated more actively in community activities.

The influence of Eric Erikson (1950) on the ideas expressed is acknowledged. It is stated that each of the major types of behavior problems (withdrawal, impulsivity, dependence) results from a major disruption at a specific point in a child's psycho-social development, and that to understand the meaning of the behavior problems evidenced, it must be determined where the process of psycho-social development has broken down. Described in detail are the following three stages of development: the development of basic trust (birth to 18 months of age), the process of socialization (18 months to 4 years of age), and the development of  independent (4 to 10 years of age).

A program model is presented and used as a gauge of the effectiveness of state programs. No one state ranks consistently high or low in all categories of service. Rather, a high-low randomness is evident among the states and among departments and agencies in any one state. Following a discussion comparing the planning, coordination, and organization of services in the five states, each state program is examined.  The following topics are covered as they relate to services for the mentally retarded: demographic data, local governments and districts, revenue and expenditures, state organization, planning and planning coordination, legislation, and the various types of services provided (residential institutions, community centers, day care sheltered workshops, rehabilitation, medical services, social services, special education, and others).

Presented are February and August 1970 analyses of data on the primary  dance program and the music program, the results of the Semantic Differential administered to teacher workshop participants, a concurrent validation study of the Face Attitude Scale with mentally retarded, and an inventory of videotapes on the program. Evaluative comments and opinions are given by project teachers. Six examples of evaluation tools (tests, scales, evaluation sheets) are included as are the project's 1969-70 evaluation budget and evaluation expenditures. (KW)",

The questionnaire concerning motivation factors causing people to enter, remain in, and leave special education was sent to personnel in the field, while the questionnaire concerning the effect of PL 85-926 funding on university special education programs was sent to universities offering programs for training personnel in the education of the handicapped. Results of the surveys demonstrated positive effects of PL 85-926 in  all respects. It increased the capacity of universities receiving funds to supply manpower, and improved the quality as well as the quantity of graduating students. Attrition from the field was less among students receiving grants than among others.

The 50 state special education agencies were surveyed concerning the flow and utilization of special education information and their capability to utilize the model. It was found that few states had special education information systems capable of providing predictive as well as evaluative data, and in few states did data on handicapped children include all sources of education. It was  concluded that, despite some obstacles to automating special education data processing, almost all states had the capability to utilize the MRPM and it could be operational in two to three annual data cycles in most cases; availability of information flow capable of providing required input was a major factor affecting implementation.

Should it be left with classroom teachers or given to specially trained instructional design teams? The latter approach is preferable for \"mainline\" systems (those systems that are specifically designed to teach a complete course), and the former is better for \"adjunct\" systems (those that supplement a teacher's regular course). Instructional software design teams can provide a full range of information, such as documentation and justification, a management plan for development, and heuristics for quality control that are useful for supplemental programs but almost indispensable for full-scale or mainline systems. The second issue concerns  whether CAI should emphasize discovery learning or carefully controlled programs (expository instruction). Studies have shown that bright students do better with discovery learning, but that average or below average students learn more from expository instruction. For slower students, programs may use discovery techniques within the context of more carefully structured, ordered programs. (JK)",

Mainline CAI programs are expensive. A course equivalent to a three-credit semester course usually takes a year to write and another year to evaluate. Present costs range from at least $5,000 to $10,000 per student hour, and at best, they might be reduced to $3,000 an hour assuming the existence of languages, systems, and authoring techniques which are still under development. However, one possible individualized instruction environment which could accommodate the logistics of CAI is described and illustrated. It  makes extensive use of program design and supplementary help by teaching assistants. This model, which uses as an example a course in college freshman mathematics, has been shown to be reasonably effective and to be more economical than traditional instruction. (JK)",

The model of instructional design used at the University of Texas Computer Assisted Instruction Laboratory includes five steps: outlining needs, goals, and a justification; developing the design architecture and rationale; writing an author's draft; producing a computer program; and  evaluating the course.

One reason for doing so is that knowing how to write Arabic characters helps students to remember the unfamiliar sounds of this language. A computer-assisted instruction (CAI) program was felt to be more efficient and rapid than either conventional teaching or programed instruction because it allows for individual instruction and immediate feedback. To cover the objectives of this course, the CAI program is divided into four cycles, each of which presents seven letters and a few diacritics. This report describes the lessons, the hardware and software requirements, and the procedures employed in authoring and producing the program.  Development of the course followed the instructional design model developed at the University of Texas CAI Laboratory. Tryouts of the course showed that its use prevented the usual attrition in attendance which had occurred previously because of the long time required by other methods to teach the writing system. Also the standard deviation for the CAI group was much smaller and the learning gains for slower students were greater enabling them to approach the proficiency of the best students. (JK)",

The data base is completed with the addition of a lexicon, also in network form, which is used to store definitions and work-related syntactic information. A very simple command language is used by the student to request explanations, definitions, or quizzes over a specified set of sentences in the original text. A syntax-directed, natural-language sentence generator derives from the data base a set  of simple sentences which preserve the meaning of the text passage specified by the student. The sentences may also be transformed into questions which help the student to evaluate his understanding of the text. A generative grammar and auxiliary functions were developed which produce sentences conforming to standard English practice with limited use of third-person pronouns. A conversational system was implemented in the LISP programing language. Potential applications of the existing system to language instruction are described. (Author)",

The basic discussion points of the conferences are summarized. It was felt that the conferences were significant in that they brought together participants with diverse backgrounds and focused on a substantive concept--Technological Augmentation of Cognition (TAC). A TAC system was defined as a system capable: of extending and complementing the human mind's natural learning skills; of making each student more aware of his own learning skills; and of making each student more aware of his own learning processes than is presently possible and so motivating him to improve these  processes. Twelve major TAC problems were identified, and design requirements for a TAC system were established which emphasized the need for planning and cooperation among the many TAC projects now extant. Conferees warned against the \"trivial use\" of computers, that is, use which does not exploit the computer's full capabilities. Two action programs were completed which consisted of a popular monograph and a proposal for a TAC museum exhibition. A list of conference participants is appended. (JY)",

To permit maximum flexibility and individualization, the course consisted of a series of well defined, self-contained instructional units, grouped homogeneously into modules. The four basic modules, each of approximately three and one-half weeks in length, covered prerequisites, instrumental forms, vocal forms, and current popular music forms. A wide variety of resources, both human and material, were used, including the learning laboratory, a dial access system, text books, tape slide sequences, videotapes, programed  texts with audio, audio units, multi-screen presentation, a student manual, student and faculty performers, and media specialists. An evaluation of the course showed that it was well-liked by students, efficient in both student and faculty time and space utilization, and effective in overcoming the differences between students without any musical background and thus with training in music. The phases of course development, testing, and evaluation are described. Selected pages from the student manual, course revisions, and related results are presented. (JY)",

        "description":"An instructional management program was developed to assist students in selecting learning activities. The program was based on a general model for specifying hierarchical curriculum structure. This model was developed using the directed graph, a mathematical form of a structural model. A hierarchy could then be generated from the curriculum designer's responses about the prerequisite relationships among the lessons in his curriculum. Using a student mastery data base, programs were designed to input data on a student's mastery of lessons, list data, and putput options for learning activities for students. The program to provide options eliminated lessons which students had already mastered and printed out an option only if all its prerequisites had been mastered. Also, feedback  about activities chosen was returned to the designer. Flowcharts for these programs are included. Field tests of the programs in a first-grade science class led to the conclusion that its future application requires mature students, a relatively free instructional setting, a quick and reliable computer system, outside financing, close ties to classroom management, and a structured curriculum based on well defined objectives.

The study was conducted to aid in the design of a drill-and-practice, computer-assisted instruction (CAI) spelling program that would complement some recently developed tutorial CAI spelling programs and, at the same time, would expand the range of the spelling curriculum taught via CAI. A brief overview of the interface between tutorial CAI spelling and drill-and-practice CAI spelling serves to introduce the study. Elementary school students were asked to rate themselves on how well they  thought they could spell a word after hearing the word spoken. They were then asked to spell the word. The students appeared to be able to predict accurately those words that they could not spell correctly, but were not able to predict from auditory input alone the words they could spell correctly. An examination of this data, together with the results of a survey of the spelling strategies used by the subjects, has implications for the design of instructional programs. (JY)",

This study delineates the history of instructional television with special reference to ITFS and provides a consideration of the relationships among various alternate methods of television distribution. Conclusions regarding the state of the art of ITFS are based on the author's survey of the present ITFS licensees and applicants, interviews with persons involved in various aspects of ITFS utilization, and personal visits to individual ITFS systems. Survey results are geographically depicted to indicate comparisons among systems in terms of size,  staff, equipment, budget, and utilization. The study provides statistical profiles of the 65 ITFS systems on the air in April 1970 and a directory of persons responsible for individual systems. Appendixes include tables of frequency assignments, information on private users of the ITFS band, and FCC application procedures.

Subjects were randomly assigned to either a group in which program frame sequence had been scrambled by means of a table of random numbers or to a group in which the program frames were logically sequenced. Two programs dealing with heart disease were employed: one program contained material of some familiarity to the subjects and the other contained technical content which was new to the subjects. The results indicated that, as expected, the type of sequence caused significant differences in achievement on the unfamiliar materials but not on familiar  content. Interactions between sequence and verbal ability were not found, though there was some evidence for triple interactions among sequence, verbal ability, and anxiety. The results provided further evidence that a pupil's prior familiarity with subject matter may be an important moderating variable in determining which instructional mode or type of content organization leads to superior achievement.

Thirty college students and 31 ninth graders with extreme discrepancies between their verbal and quantitative aptitude scores were taught eight principles of class reasoning by random assignment to one of two versions of a programed instruction unit. One version contained verbal examples and scientific terminology; the other substituted letter symbols for the scientific words. It was hypothesized that if adaptation of instruction to individual differences is an efficacious practice, then students who were highly verbal would learn better from the verbal program version and students with low verbal aptitude would  benefit from the symbolic version. Although there was a slight tendency in the hypothesized direction, in no instance was the interaction between program version and discrepancy type significant at the .05 level. However, it was demonstrated that class reasoning principles can be taught by means of a relatively short instructional program and that such instruction will transfer to understanding of conditional reasoning principles.

        "description":"In an effort to gain an overview of the application of computer technology in education and training, to identify areas requiring additional research, and to identify potential application areas for use in technical training, field visits were made to representative military and civilian institutions which are using the computer in instructional programs. A review of the recent research literature and computer equipment manufacturers' technical data was also conducted. The primary focus of the study was on the terminal devices available for use in a training system and on the software required for effective use of a computer in a training environment. Several computer terminals used in computer assisted instruction (CAI) are discussed and computer-controlled audio presentation is  described. Programing languages which have been used in CAI are categorized into four groups: general-purpose problem languages, extended problem languages, interactive terminal problem languages, and author-student problem-oriented languages. A typical language from each category is examined. On the basis of their survey, the authors make some suggestions regarding terminal devices, programing languages, and areas for further research.

The progress of the program to date in four major areas is described: needs analysis, communications technology studies, systems synthesis, and the educational impact of the program on Washington University. In the area of needs analysis, some of the problems facing education, such as educational costs and equality of opportunity, and some of the available communications media and educational technology have been assessed. Several studies of communications technologies are being carried out in such fields as satellite and terrestrial  communication techniques, still-picture television distribution, and Gunn-effect wideband Ku-band amplification. Progress has been made toward identifying and structuring a small number of alternative systems which could provide educational satellite services in the near future. Two of the results of the program at Washington University have been the creation of a new master's degree program in technology and human affairs and the increased interaction of faculty members, professional staff members, and students from a wide variety of backgrounds.

        "description":"Three films were produced to serve as instructional aids in teaching the rhythmic gymnastic skills of performing with clubs, balls, and hoops. The content of the films was determined with the aid of specialists in rhythmic gymnastics. To evaluate the films as aids to instruction, 170 women enrolled in elementary physical education courses were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: An experimental group which received instruction in rhythmic gymnastics from an instructor with the aid of the films and a control group which received instructions from the same instructor without the aid of the films. At the end of the course of instruction, the students were evaluated on their skills with clubs, balls, and hoops by a panel of five qualified judges. The addition of the  films to the regular instruction tended to increase the level of performance with hoops, but did not affect performance with balls or clubs. The films seemed to be an aid primarily in increasing motivation and interest in rhythmic gymnastics and in eliminating much of the trial-and-error learning period for the student, particularly in unfamiliar skills such as hoops. It was concluded that the films would have their greatest value in assisting the inexperienced teacher with a limited background in rhythmic gymnastics. (JY)",

The phonetic component itself converts linguistic knowledge of the structure of the speech act into time-varying commands suitable for control of the articulatory mechanism. Performing involves knowledge, and this knowledge must be expressed in a form accessible to the speaker operating in time. Knowing how to use knowledge of performance constraints involves manipulation of the conversion from segmental notional time embodied in simple sequencing to timing of muscular control. A solution to the handling of this time conversion is discussed in this paper. (Author)",

The author suggests this be done by showing that underlying the two components of the grammar there is a single unified structure, with a generative capacity embodied in a set of string-structure rules and a further set of transformational rules converting a deep level of representation to a surface representation and embodying such phenomena as neutralization, ordering, cycling, and other properties.

The monumental task of presenting precoding and encoding information to a learner makes it necessary to organize and reduce this information to dimensions that can reasonably be taught in the classroom.

        "description":"The non-academic adult comes to his English class with deeply fixed convictions about teaching methods, proper classroom procedures, and what constitutes learning. Often, the less educated the student, the more firm and precise his ideas about education. To fly in the face of these convictions by presenting English using a methodology developed primarily with children and academic adults is to lose the students' attention in the classroom, if not their attendance. If the adult feels that he cannot learn in this way, he will not, in fact, learn. Instead throughout the lessons the means must be found to satisfy the students' pre-conceptions while at the same time satisfying the educational and linguistic requirements of learning a language. However, this means need not be a diluted  compromise in either direction. The search for methods to satisfy every requirement equally can lead to better lessons and provide insights useful in other learning situations. (Author)",

        "description":"English spelling is reputedly full of irregularities and therefore not a safe guide to pronunciation. Most modern teaching of English pronunciation to adult speakers of other languages has relied on some kind of ancillary device, variously called a special alphabet, broad phonetic notation, or phonemic transcription. Such devices have been successful because they deal with the phonology of the language in isolation, as the beginning student needs to deal with it. Eventually, however, the student must make his way with the conventional orthography. Attempts to lead the student from sound to spelling by describing \"phoneme-grapheme correspondences\" are erroneous and futile. English orthography provides information which is much more than phonological, in the narrow sense.  Interpretation of written English depends on grammatical, etymological, tactic, dialectal, and morphophonemic considerations. The student needs to learn the orthography for what it is, in a systematic way. This article provides specific suggestions, illustrated by contrastive analysis of pairs of words, for developing the student's competence in this area. (Author/RL)",

The second purpose is to provide the classroom teacher with specific linguistic information for each child in each language group which could be used as a diagnostic guide for teaching methods or materials. A third objective is to provide a means of assessing the relative merit of various English programs. These objectives require that certain  decisions be made which can be classified as placement, diagnostic, and evaluative. The norming group consisted of 7,547 children.

Of the possible motivators, that of desire for integration with the culture of speakers of the language correlates most highly with learning success. American Indian students are faced with the need to integrate to a certain extent with speakers of English. Their hopes for jobs and social advancement largely depend on their success in coping with the language and culture of the larger society. Yet many things in their life situation militate against an integrative motivation. The history of white wrongs against Indians, the prejudice that they encounter, and the increasingly militant anti-white attitude of some members of their race make integrative attitudes difficult or impossible. Tests show a  positive correlation between low achievement scores, low English scores, and feelings of normlessness, meaninglessness, negative attitude toward school, and low expectations for the future. Problems that are probably more related to the culture of poverty than to ethnicity become polarized in the direction of ethnic identity. The resulting negative attitudes are directed specifically against the white culture and the effectiveness of English language learning may be impaired. Results of an attitudinal test administered to Indians are included. (Author)",

These attitudes can be clothed in rather authoritarian modes of behavior. They are the products of linguistic and cultural misunderstandings on the teacher's part.

The present state of classroom teaching methodology of English as a second language is such that dynamic infusions of ideas from within and from outside the field are needed. Learners of all ages and levels exhibit less willingness to tolerate the ever existent gap between  mechanical practice and meaningful language usage. (Author)",

Transfer students as defined here are those undergraduate students who were enrolled at a State University institution in the Fall 1970 term, but who have attended other colleges or universities prior to Fall 1970. This report briefly discusses: (1) the general findings; (2) class levels entered; (3) transfers with unknown histories; (4) type of educational background; and (5) applications, acceptances, and actual enrollments. Two summary tables are presented by prior and current institution type, and by prior institution and student level. The bulk of the report consists of data on transfer students by previous institution, total numbers, class level, and number not admitted for each State  institution in New York.

The gradepoint averages of 230 students who enrolled in Honors courses in 1965 to 1966 were computed for both the Honors and the non-Honors courses they took. The figures were computed for courses taken at each level, i.e., freshman through senior levels, as well as the total GPA's for the 4-year program. Comparisons of Honors and non-Honors GPA's were made by year as well as for the 4-year program, and an analysis of variance was used to test the statistical significance of differences between Honors and non-Honors GPA's. The findings indicated that Honors courses do not penalize, and indeed may enhance, GPA's of the students invited into the program. However,  the range of grades given to these students may be slightly greater in Honors courses than in non-Honors courses. (AF)",

After tracing the development of the concept of financial need as it relates to student aid and the various procedures that have been used to determine financial need, the issues related to need assessment are examined. Research on the problems involved in the collection of financial information is reviewed in an attempt to identify the most reliable items and procedures. In addition, the procedures used to analyze individual financial needs are examined, the steps involved in the development of a need analysis model are pointed out, the data used to construct the standards against which the financial situations of individual families are evaluated, as well as the differences in the analysis of incomes  and assets that exist. The final section discusses current problems in need assessment, including its relationship to available aggregate financial aid, the appropriate living standard to be incorporated into the need analysis model, the different effects of \"absolute\" and \"relative\" financial need, and the effects of changing economic conditions on the ability of parents to pay for higher education and the consequent financial need of students.

        "description":"There has been a trend in state government toward tighter and tighter centralization that, though done in the name of greater economy and efficiency, is in large part a reach for political power. Not all services of the state can be performed well if integrated into a single monolithic administrative pyramid with all other state services and functions, and this is especially true of public higher education. The university or college almost always has its legal corporate identity, and as a center of learning develops an integrity and morale of its own: it is a living organism. At the same time, most agree that some form of coordination is essential within the statewide system. In some states the desire for coordination has led to the creation of one statewide governing board. In  other states coordinating boards were established with only advisory authority, while in other, boards with a semblance of coercive powers were created. For higher education, a style and technique of intercommunication and liaison, not of hierarchical control is called for. Some thought is also being given to applying centralization to the whole state educational system, including the junior colleges, the private institutions, and the pre- through high school system. This paper discusses some of the efforts in this direction and the pitfalls. (AF)",

The first and second sections are devoted to a discussion of the various economic and social-psychological aspects of institutional size. The third section examines an alternative to the traditional form of university organization, the cluster college, as a possible organizational adaptation that might allow institutions to grow larger while still providing unique, small, and  personalized educational environments.

Upward Bound students appear to enter college at a higher rate (80%) than the national average (65%) and are only slightly behind in the number still enrolled among non-program counterparts. The studies indicate the extent of institutional involvement with disadvantaged students is not great. As late as 1968, three-quarters of the institutions surveyed sponsored no special efforts for the disadvantaged; few institutions with such programs approached the problem with maximum utilization of their resources. The graduation  rate of black students is said to be high (90% versus 60% for whites) but there are little data on the progress of students specifically designated as disadvantaged. Existing data usually refer to first semester college GPAs as the dependent variable.

        "author":["Byrnes, James C."],
        "description":"Postsecondary education in the United States is in a state of financial crisis. The two reasons for this are: (1) the college age population increased at a rate of 4.2 percent per year during the 1960's; and (2) during the 1960's the locus of growth in the number of years of formal education completed by the young shifted from secondary to postsecondary levels. During the 1960's, the average number of staff members per student declined at a rate of minus 1.5 percent per year, and dollar expenditure per staff member increased by only 1.0 percent per year, as opposed to a 3.3 percent increase for the average U.S. family. Because a college education can help the individual achieve a higher lifetime income, it cannot be restricted to anyone for arbitrary reasons. More important, a  college education gives a person an opportunity to enhance his skills and abilities, and it is society that ultimately benefits. Society should therefore finance the future growth in postsecondary education by creating two new programs of educational aid. One should be a general per student-year grant sufficient to provide a basic minimum level of resources to any non-profit organization that provides educational services of a nonexclusive nature. The second program would permit students to finance as much of their expenses as they wish through a government postsecondary education tax foundation. (AF)",

This is followed by a statement expressing Machlup's opposition to collective partisanship on the part of university faculty. In \"Institutional Neutrality: An Appraisal,\" Walter P. Metzger reviews the academic rationale for neutrality in American colleges and universities set forth in 1915 by Arthur Lovejoy. He also identifies some of the forces that are creating pressures on American institutions to modify this rationale. The  last article, \"The Socially Uninvolved University\" by Richard H.

These functions of the associations directly affect the quantity and quality of health manpower. A general consideration of accreditation is followed by descriptions of how the US office of Education, National Commission on Accrediting, AMA Council on Medical Education, and ADA Council on Dental Education carry out these functions. Discussion of the process of and requirements for certification precedes a summary of issues affecting allied health professions and occupations.

Conducted in 1968, the survey was aimed at 1600 trustees; some 800 responded. The remarks deal principally with findings of importance to the trustees themselves, and answered 4 general questions: (1) who are North Carolina's trustees; (2) how prepared are they for the trusteeship; (3) what are their views toward constituents of their campuses; and (4) how do they operate. The first question covers characteristics such as age, race, education, religion, occupation, and political views. The second used indicators of preparedness such as familiarity with relevant reading material and participation in campus activities. The third documented attitudes toward students, faculty and  administrators. How trustees operate was explored by selecting issues and asking respondents whether they should decide, review and advise on, or approve and confirm them. (JS)",

Attitudes and perceptions of the learning environment were the variables measured during the students' fourth semester in college. The learning environment variables were: democratic governance, undergraduate learning, freedom, and concern for innovation. Attitude variables used were: the thinking introversion, theoretical orientation, estheticism, and complexity of outlook scales of the Omnibus Personality Inventory; the community and peers scales of the Alienation Index; and the concepts of interpersonal relationships, community, and independence autonomy as measured by the Semantic Differential. Significant differences were found in undergraduate learning, freedom, thinking  introversion, and complexity of outlook. It was concluded that: (1) a distinctive educational environment can be created within a subunit of a large university; (2) students attracted have strong academic and intellectual interests; (3) faculty participation should be at the invitation of students; (4) programs should not exceed 250 students; and (5) the parent institution should encourage autonomy for innovative programs.

        "description":"Unlike the student protest movements of the 1930's, which were linked to adult political parties, the dominant ones of the present constitute a genuine youth rebellion. This is primarily due to a change in the political climate in the last 10 years, with emphasis shifting from events and threats from abroad to social ills at home. Student activism is generally a result of social discontent. Though a small minority, activist students have dominated the political tone of many campuses (they are characteristically from homes of liberal persuasion that are relatively well to do). Once activated, student groups can play a major role in mobilizing public opinion. The factors that motivate students to action are those frustrating elements in the student role. Students are by occupation  a marginal group: they are in a period of transition with no specific social or occupational role, often dependent on their parents, and in an environment that is full of tension and primarily idealistic. Involvement in university life and often the political traditions and image of the institution itself make politics a particularly critical source of self-expression. The changing faculty role has helped create a climate of opinion that presses students to the left, and because of fewer commitments students are more available for new political movements. (AF)",

The model should be useful in analyzing national educational data and in answering some policy questions.

Students in post-secondary institutions can obtain long-term loans on which the government generally pays the interest while the student is in school. The government bears all losses for defaulted federally insured loans and a large portion of the losses for defaulted State or privately insured loans. This review by the General Accounting Office examines lending institutions' loan disbursement policies and practices under the GSL program and their effect on the cost to the Government for interest payments made on behalf of qualified student borrowers. An effort also was made to determine whether certain students  who had received loans under the program continued to be eligible for such funds throughout the academic periods for which the funds were intended. This report discusses the authorizing legislation, the program operation, and loans disbursed since 1966. It also examines opportunities to reduce federal interest costs on student loans: the major one being to arrange for lending institutions to disburse student loans on an installment basis when the funds are for use in more than one academic period, rather than in a lump sum.

It is suggested that a gradual or evolutionary approach to implementation is preferable to a large-scale design and implementation program in order to gain the benefit of training and early experience. The 6 suggested beginning steps are: executive training, development of an analytic capability, implementation of program cost accounting, application of a resource requirement model, application of a student flow model, and selection and implementation of a  scheduling model. The first 2 steps are necessary to develop executive capability and confidence in the planning technology. Cost accounting is a prerequisite to almost all other analytic efforts. Implementation of the 2 models is recommended to gain a better understanding of the institution's underlying processes. (Author)",

The reasons for this resistance to change stem in part from the cast of characters in the academic world: the administrators who often come from careers where they were little involved in educational policy, the conservative nature of the faculty, and the indifferent trustees. Changes that have taken place have often stemmed from student action. This does not mean that faculty and administrators have failed to criticize or question educational policies and practices, but that these criticisms rarely led to constructive action, and that when changes occurred they were generally of an additive nature. With the bleak  economic situation, it is not possible to introduce change through expansion or addition, and the natural tendency for the faculty will be to favor a gloomy conservatism and to be reluctant to participate in policies of shrinkage or substitution. To preserve faculty democracy and involvement in governance, the faculty should concentrate on matters most important to it. This paper concludes by listing some theses pertinent to faculty governance that were made in the first report of the Assembly on University Goals and Governance. (AF)",

This paper discusses: (1) the natural and intrinsic limitations on faculty participation in governance that include: the delegation of power by governing boards, the frequent absence or inadequacy of the structure for faculty self-government, the often negative faculty attitudes toward governance, the rapid expansion of higher education that has rendered decisionmaking more remote, and campus unrest; (2) the external threats to autonomy that include: restrictive and punitive legislation,  recent court litigation, which has occasionally become a vehicle for criticism and repression of campus orthodoxy, campus surveillance by police and FBI agents, collective bargaining, the serious financial problems facing higher education, and the self-regulation process; and (3) some ways that faculty can combat these incursions and thus restore some control over the character and destiny of their profession.

        "description":"This paper reports the results of a validation study of data obtained from a teacher rating survey conducted by the University of Akron Student Council during the Fall 1969. The rating questionnaire consisted of 14 times: two items measured the student's overall evaluation of his instructor; 5 items measured specific performance dimensions such as stimulation, communication, consideration, evaluation, and workload, and each of these dimensions was measured by two methods: (1) asking the student to compare his instructor with others he had known, and (2) requiring the student to make an absolute evaluation of the instructor on a graphic rating scale. The last two items obtained information on the student's class standing, and his cumulative GPA. Information was also obtained on  the size of each class, the average grade given in each course, and the instructor's rank. The data analysis consisted of the multitrait, multimethod approach to convergent and discriminant validation, first proposed by Campbell and Fiske in 1959. The results indicated that the performance dimensions showed fairly high reliability and convergent validity. However, the discriminant validity was not high enough to conclude that independent dimensions of instructor performance were being accurately measured. (AF)",

        "description":"American society has been and is beset by contradictions and the best that can be said for it is that it has manifested good intentions and poor performance. Merit and money, education and success - in short, all the keys to advancement in American society until recently - have been closely guarded from those citizens who lacked the proper credentials of race and ethnic background. Though we are moving toward a more equal society in the 1970's, it is a period of conflict and tension. In addition, many of what seemed to be essential truths 20 or 30 years ago are now regarded as platitudes, such as the belief in integration, which has been replaced by the desire for pluralism. These changes in outlook have profoundly affected higher education, with students wanting the universities  to be small scale replicas of a new egalitarian and pluralistic society. With pressures also increasing from other parts of society, higher education is in a state of almost constant turmoil. One of the great concerns in the period ahead is thought to be the conflict between equality and excellence; yet these two are not necessarily antithetical. The real problem will be to change our testing methods and selection mechanisms so that these will not be discriminatory, and also to create diverse pathways to obtaining academic degrees. (AF)",

This field is based on the fact that an experiment with human subjects necessitates social interaction between experimenter and subject; thus the social nature of an experiment may have an impact on its scientific aspects. In the first project, a random sample of undergraduates at the University of California, Santa Barbara, were asked about their attitudes concerning social science experiments and other aspects of their college careers. Reactions to the experimentation were generally favorable, although most students placed little value on their own participation. The second project was a role-playing simulation of the \"classic\"  Festinger-Carlsmith experiment on forced compliance. Results and conclusions paralleled the original study. The final project was a \"real\" laboratory experiment in which 2 variables were manipulated to explore why subjects tend to lie in post-experimental interviews. It was found that high apprehension and low commitment lead to greater honesty. Implications for further research are discussed. (JS)",

Results showed no significant differences in the attainment of objective (1) using mixed conventional and machine procedures, but that groups receiving laboratory and lecture by machine only performed at a significantly lower level.

Two years later, additional data were obtained from a followup survey of Michigan dropouts as well as from dropouts from the University of Washington. A typology was developed consisting of social, academic, religious, and 2 intellective-cosmopolitan variables. Different entrance characteristics were found to be associated with different dropout types and varied  consistently according to the sex of the student. Persisting students appeared to have the same problem and at the same intensity as dropouts. It was concluded that future research must take the student's sex and the type of dropout into consideration in designing studies. Data related to salient environmental presses should also be analyzed. And, attitudinal variables are more useful than demographic data in distinguishing among types of dropouts. (JS)",

The monograph examines the concept, position and role of such a planned change specialist. It explores the theoretical bases of the role, places the functions within the framework of NLHE's Administrative and Organizational program, and  suggests a model for implementing the concept. The discussion is based on a review of the literature on organizational change and development, planned change, internal and external change agents, and institutional innovation and reform.

The initial problem was in adopting rather than adapting the traditional pattern of student government practiced in 4-year institutions. The failure symptoms were: no real authority for student government; indifferent student body; ad-hoc student groups that bypassed their government; elections that were largely popularity contests; real issues skirted while attention was given to procedural matters; and lack of mechanism to replace officers who resigned. To regain the commitment of the whole school, a new student government constitution had to be ratified by a majority of students, administration, and faculty; two faculty and two administrators  were made full voting members of the Student Executive Council; students were to hold a majority and a student was always to be chairman. The powers and duties of the council are to: allocate and approve student activities budget; work in conjunction with the inter-organization council; appoint student representatives to the College Senate committees; act as liaison between students, faculty, administrators, with other campuses, and with regional and national affiliations of student government associations; make proposals and recommendations to appropriate authorities; and act as an Appeal Board for student conduct and discipline cases with the Dean of Student Affairs serving as chairman.

The basic philosophy of the college (existing to teach and serve students) is exemplified in student scheduling and registration. SWITCH (Sectioning with Instructor and Time Choice) is the processing of data by computer. Fundamental SWITCH concepts of student scheduling are: (1) students should be free to enroll in courses best suited to their particular needs; (2) ideally, students should be free to select the instructors they feel are best for them; and (3) students should be free to set the time they are available for attendance at college. Necessary considerations and steps in processing the data provided on student course request forms are reviewed. The master schedule must be designed  within the concepts of SWITCH. It is desirable to defer the final master schedule design for as late as possible in the registration process. Based on counseling, testing information, and enrollment forecasts, the general procedure for scheduling is outlined. The following information and examples are included: schedule for classes for a semester, step-by-step scheduling procedure for a semester, application for admission, forecast of enrollment, calendar for scheduling, guidelines for scheduling, instructor hour patterns and preference questionnaire, study lists, and temporary class rolls.

The accounts could be restricted to use in schools while junior colleges retain their present role in the system, or they could be used without being restricted to schools and the junior colleges could be freed from their traditional role. As for accounts usable only in schools, one proposal would put all present school funds in the hands of parents, thus more nearly equalizing the resources of rich and poor and the competitive status of public and private schools, and giving parents far greater discretion in the content and timing of their children's schooling. If the accounts were not restricted to schools, the individual could buy any service or  object the community considered educational. Of the funds allocated to each citizen (calculated at $150 per year or $17,000 per lifetime), junior colleges would probably attract a large proportion, especially if they truly fulfilled their community-service function of being a real educational resource center for all residents. The implications of these two alternatives to the present system of funding and function are discussed in detail. (HH)",

Fifty-three junior colleges participated in this program, financed under Title III of the Higher Education Act of 1965 and sponsored by AAJC and USOE. The project was composed of: (1) Vincennes National Conference, which reviewed and set the tone for the whole project; (2) regional workshops and activities; (3) consultants sent to participating colleges to help assess their strengths, weaknesses, and potential; (4) specialized workshops as a response to needs for group consultation in federal affairs, computer use, and human affairs; and (5)&quot;Salt&quot; seminars, which focused on the systems approach to learning. The keynote of the program was decentralization, with some of the functions formerly performed by the central office placed in the hands of regional coordinators and the funded colleges. An important feature of this second-year project was the provision for colleges to encourage faculty personnel to make inter-campus visits and attend professional meetings on program funds. The results of evaluations of the second year of this continuing project by the participating colleges are included. The reader might want to consult the First Interim Report of PWDI (ED 032 070).

The training consists of in-service or pre-employment education, the latter composed of career categories either identical with the private employment sector or unique to the public sector. The basic public service career families are in: community development; educational, human, and judicial services; public finance; resource management; and transportation. Government programs in the Department of  Housing and Urban Development or Department of H.E.W., for example, enable community colleges to be extensively involved in community affairs. Challenges to be considered are: identification of distinct career families; need for data; improvement of student services; faculty shortage; and hurdles in government hiring practices. Public service education is analyzed; examples of organization and administration of career education are offered.

Examples are given for the various types of grants and/or loans along with potential sources of funds, such as state and federal donations, philanthropic foundations, alumni, business corporations, churches, service groups, and governmental agencies. It is felt that as much control of financial aid programs as possible should be maintained in one office, and that one administrator should have ultimate control.

        "description":"The Educational Development Officer (EDO) is a new kind of college administrator, a full-time catalyst for change. In the Junior and Community College Division of the National Laboratory for Higher Education (NLHE), the EDO has been defined as an innovation-minded professional who questions existing practices, works constantly for constructive change, and specializes in the improvement of instruction, both in subject matter and in psychologically sound methodologies. To insure accountability, he requires specific learning objectives; if these are not met, he sees that the ineffective programs are revised. His appointment shows a firm commitment by the college to the improvement of learning, and implies the support, confidence, and cooperation of both administration and faculty. A  primary function of the EDO is to help the faculty follow the six essential steps of the systems approach to instruction. To do this, he must (1) train faculty in the necessary skills, (2) help select measurable learning objectives, (3) assist with measurement problems in constructing criterion tests, (4) help design a variety of learning activities, (5) oversee a continuous revision of objectives, and (6) promote research-based decisions throughout the institution insofar as they affect student learning. This brochure describes EDOs in action and lists the 10 topics for which NLHE is now developing self-instructional materials. (HH)",

The first explains the rationale for such a system based on systems theory, surveys and research projects, and research in the field of behavioral sciences. It is a system of organizational leadership that translates organizational goals into specific objectives for organization members by providing the required link, such as a department head in between a dean and instructor. Critical elements are analyzed and the following advantages noted: better services, more learning on the part of the student, less turnover among staff, and generally a better climate in which to conduct educational activities. The second speech has to do with planning organizational change using MBO as the operating mode, with emphasis on  management planning and problem solving. The following are needed for successful organizational change: management development; an understanding of fundamental behavioral findings and of hypotheses on the nature of people as they function in organizations; creative environment; participative style of management; and an appraisal system implemented as part of the whole MBO system.

Desirable facilities were found to include vocational information facilities, close proximity to student records, group counseling and conference rooms, testing room, outside windows, sound-proofing, carpeting, adequate storage space, adequate reception/waiting area, individual offices for counselors, stenorette tape recorders for each counselor, more room,  bulletin boards, more clerical and paraprofessional help, removal of the counseling center from the administration area, air conditioning, attractive and colorful furnishings, and provision for growth.

It is based on the assumption that students can learn from a variety of methodologies. Innovation is discussed under the categories of grouping, curriculum, and administration. Students are grouped to maximize the goals of the class. If the goal is to disseminate information from a variety of sources and approaches, a large group or lecture is used; if the goal is to better understand material through interaction, seminars are used. Curriculum (experimental course content) is discussed for developmental, transfer, and occupational courses. Examples are given of which courses use  various methods for what purposes. Administrative organizational structure is based on participative management. The following concerns are discussed: rationale for instructional organization; method for identifying tasks basic to the successful operation of the instructional process; method of identifying who will be responsible for seeing that tasks are performed; guidelines for the instructional task coordinator; and procedures for conducting meetings of each instructional area. Supplemental reports from individual committee members are included. (CA)",

In the seventy years of the Commission's history, the number has grown to 260 public libraries. With the establishment of regional library systems on a cooperative, contractual basis in Nebraska, in 1957, all libraries (large and small) began working together. In 1970, when multi-regional networks were begun, even the smallest public library became an important channeling agency for its area, through a telephone-teletype arrangement. This year, new emphasis is being placed on the individual role of each library in the state: its service areas; its financial support; and its measurement with appropriate standards. This manual for trustees,  along with the new Nebraska interim standards and rating steps, will assist even the smallest library to achieve its important goal of good library service to its community.

The international transfer of technology, like domestic transfer, takes place in a two-step process operation through intermediary agents called technological gatekeepers.

The establishment of new and expanded information services in the agencies has created at least four administrative problems for librarians and for agency leaders: (1) whether the extra-library information programs duplicate the functions of  the libraries in their agencies; (2) the administrative positions of libraries and extra-library information programs; (3) the clash of newcomers to the field of information handling and (4) disparities in the salaries of librarians and staff of extra-library information programs. The four extra-library information programs studied do not materially duplicate the library programs of their agencies.

Guidelines for reviewers are presented in Part 1; Part 2 contains guidelines for the novice editor. The goal of the reviewers and the editor is to ensure that meaningful correctly indexed abstracts of nuclear-safety information move quickly from the Center to the computer, which is used in making fast literature searches for those who subscribe to its services. Many examples, with comments, are provided to illustrate key points, and the slant is toward useful integration of certain aspects of the jobs so that subscribers can be reasonably satisfied with the  literature searches they request.

The experiment compared two methods for doing the outside of class assignments in support of a course in library science instruction. The plan called for the control groups to do the outside assignments in the conventional manner. The experimental groups were to do the outside assignments by attending a learning station. The material available to them at the learning station covered basically the same content area as that available to the control groups. The difference was in the provision of a format which was designed to clarify the organization and interrelationships of the subject matter, and which would accommodate student differences  through the provision of several levels or paths. Results of this study led to the following conclusions: the learning station pattern of instruction is highly effective for; (1) bringing a group of students to a guaranteed criterion level with respect to a specified body of knowledge, (2) providing a significant savings of student time for completing the outside of class assignments and (3) creating a more favorable attitude towards the outside of class assignments.

Data on general intelligence, concept development and maternal teaching style were analyzed to determine the effect of home visits on the child and mother and to compare treatment effects associated with each of the projects.

Results of testing showed little difference between treatment groups and suggest a useful plan for involving paraprofessionals in a meaningful \"career ladder\" which results in an educational intervention project staffed entirely by paraprofessionals.

The role of a foster parent is extremely difficult, and there is a need for training foster parents to become more effective which, in turn, will have positive effects upon foster children. The PET program, developed in 1962 by Dr. Thomas Gordon, consists of eight 3-hour training sessions and is limited to 25 participants. Through lectures, role-playing and practice, parents learn these communication skills: (1) active listening--the parent learns to reflect back what the child is trying to communicate about his problems in a way that facilitates the child's growth; (2) &quot;I&quot; messages--the parent learns to communicate personal feelings when the problem  is his, rather than placing the blame on the child and (3) conflict resolution--working out conflicts so that both parent and child are actively engaged in reaching a satisfactory solution. The program also focuses on the problems of using power in the parent-child relationship, and on assessment and modification of parent values. (Author/AJ)",

        "description":"The role of genetic factors in infant response to redundancy was evaluated through observation of the behavior of three sets of same-sex fraternal twins and six sets of same-sex identical twins to combinations of redundant proprioceptive and auditory stimulation. The twins ranged in age from 6 weeks to 24 weeks. One member of each twin set was placed on each side of a partition in a motor-driven rockerbox, and four 1-minute treatments were administered in mixed order, with 1-minute pre-treatment and post-treatment periods. The treatments consisted of combinations of fast and slow rocking under conditions of sound and no sound. An observer rated the activity level of each twin on a 5-point scale at 30-second intervals. Treatment was associated with a significant decline of infant  activity independent of zygosity. Identical twins exhibited marked behavioral consistency compared to fraternal twins during and after treatment. The results appear to provide positive evidence for the role of endogenous, genetically linked regulation of infant response to redundant stimulation. (Author/NH)",

Interactive behavior of 32 mother-infant dyads was observed in the home for a total of 2 hours for each pair, in order to explore various types of interactive processes and analyses. A checklist divided into 10-second intervals included various observed behaviors, for example; infant fret/cry, vocalize, play, smile, and eat; and mother touch, hold, vocalize, play, change, and feed. The data seemed to support the proposed model of state, namely that infant condition (behavior) alone was insufficient to describe state since often the same condition had widely different consequences which in turn should affect future conditions.  The data also revealed individual differences as a function of the sex of the infant. Briefly, girls received more distal responses to the same behavior for which boys received proximal responses. This finding was discussed as an important source of individual variance and its effect on subsequent cognitive functioning. (Author/NH)",

Anemia is frequently seen among children of low socioeconomic status but is probably also the most frequent nutritional deficiency disease seen among children cared for by private doctors. Possible reasons for the widespread occurrence of this disease are: (1) an erroneous belief among many physicians that iron is not absorbed before 2 or 3 months of age and that therefore it is useless to give iron to young infants, (2) lack of awareness among professional workers and parents that most unfortified foods provide limited amounts of iron, (3) inability of many parents to carry out a program of daily administration of medicinal iron, and (4)  feeding of milk, a poor iron source, to infants in large quantities to the exclusion of iron-rich foods. Recommendations are given for average daily intake of iron. A massive educational effort directed to professional workers and to parents is urged, and suggestions are made for evaluation of maternal and child programs. Tables give data on the prevalence of iron-deficiency anemia and the iron content of commercial infant foods. (NH)",

Group I received supplementary bi-weekly tutoring from teachers with no parental involvement. Group II was tutored but in the presence of their mothers who became involved. Group III was offered the same tutoring as Group II, and mothers participated in small group discussions about childrearing. The Stanford-Binet and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) were given as pretests and posttests to all children. A revised version of the Pupil Behavior Inventory was completed by teachers and two standardized questionnaires were  completed by mothers to tap attitudes toward childrearing and cognitive stimulation in the home. No significant differences were found between groups in IQ gain on either the Stanford-Binet or the PPVT, although all groups gained significantly. Significant differences did emerge on factors of parental measures, but not on the teacher rating form. Desirable changes in maternal attitudes were found in the mothers who had been offered opportunity for maximum participation. (Author/AJ)",

APT is used to supplement the standardized instruments being used to measure program performance. The test consists of four subtests and an experimental section: Part 1 deals with color naming, identifying body parts, and right-left discrimination; Part 2 (described in this report) is the basis for determining specific cognitive learning from the early childhood education curriculum; Parts 3 and 4 are Piaget-type, conservation of number and size tasks; Part 5 is an experimental subtest designed to measure understanding of cause and effect, logical  classification and letter recognition. To measure the achievement of cognitive objectives Part 2 was given to 273 children in three treatment groups, and subsequently to a 60-child sample in a comparison group. Children who viewed only the television program and were not exposed to the home visitor and mobile van teachers scored significantly lower on the test. Results indicate that the home visitor, more than any other part of the program, has a great potential for influencing the child's behavior, especially if she can produce changes in the child's environment.

Since this was one of the first attempts to measure these skills in young children, another objective was to learn as much as possible about the development of these skills. The children were divided into two groups. One watched the daily television program, &quot;Around the Bend,&quot; and was visited weekly by a home visitor. The other group watched the program, had home visits and visited a mobile classroom once a week. A task which involved placing model furniture in a model house was selected as the task which would most stimulate the  occurrence of behaviors that facilitate the process of learning in group situations. Observers coded children's behavior under six major categories: initiation, request for help or questions, giving help, refusing help, group consciousness, and response to peers.

It consists of 30-minute television lessons broadcast into the home each day; a weekly home visit by paraprofessionals to discuss the program with parents and children, and to deliver materials for the parents to use with the children; and group instruction once a week in a mobile classroom. Tests used, methods, and results are reported for children's gains in cognitive, language, psychomotor, and social skills categories. Field test  results are presented in four areas: program effort (describes material and personnel requirements); program performance (children's achievement gains and parents' and children's attitudes toward the program), program pervasiveness (describes the population which might be served), and evaluation synthesis (summary).

Data are analyzed by a three-way analysis of variance and an analysis of covariance procedure. Because of the highly specific nature of the test items on the PPVT, it is not likely that it reflects general program effects as well as the more broadly based instrument in a test battery. Two groups of children (Package and TV-HV) scored  near the national mean (50th percentile) in IQ and two groups (TV Only and Control) scored near the 40th percentile when compared to the national sample. The lack of overall deficit indicates that many of the children have an adequate vocabulary level.

Eight factors were identified: vocabulary; reasoning; general reception; identifying body parts; general cognitive skills; visual perception; auditory memory; and verbal expression. The results of the factor analysis showed that, to some extent, the factors revealed certain abilities which discriminated between groups of children  tested. The effectiveness of the Early Childhood Education (ECE) Program on at least a few factors was indicated. With the exception of the category of \"verbal expression,\" in which the comparison group scored the highest, the ECE subjects had higher factor scores.

        "description":"This report describes a technique which can be used to provide both formative and summative evaluation of television programs designed to promote educational development in 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old children. The daily half-hour program evaluated is part of an Appalachia Educational Laboratory project, now in its second year. (Other project components are weekly visits in homes by paraprofessionals, and weekly visits by a mobile classroom.) Of the 170 TV programs transmitted in the first two years, observational data was collected on 133. The telecasts, designed to elicit overt responses from children, made possible a systematic observational evaluation of viewer responses. Each of eight paraprofessionals watched the program with a different child every morning so that, in a random  fashion, all 270 children were observed an equal number of times. The observer coded children's responses while viewing the TV program and rated them on a standard tally sheet. First year and second year programs were compared on (1) the ratio of responses to questions asked by the TV teacher, (2) the ratio of negative reactions to enthusiastic reactions, and (3) the average number of enthusiastic reactions. Results indicate that systematic observational systems can provide formative evaluation of preschool TV programs to guide changes in presentation techniques, content, and emphasis.

The survey forms were designed to determine which programs were viewed by the children, if parents watched the programs with the children, if parents thought the children enjoyed and/or learned from the programs, and if parents  thought the different programs were good for the children. Parents were asked to rate the programs from the best to the very worst and give the program sponsors' names. Eighty-one percent of the 150 parents to whom forms were mailed responded. &quot;Around the Bend&quot; was rated best by 51% of the parents; &quot;Captain Kangaroo,&quot; by 38% and &quot;Romper Room,&quot; by 11%: The ratings varied among the parents of children in different treatment groups. Many of the children watched two or more children's programs each day. Many parents watched the programs with their children and felt that instructional television combined with home visits was an acceptable procedure for early childhood education.

        "description":"To evaluate the Follow Through portion of the Planned Variation program (1967-1970) eight distinct approaches were studied. The approaches rest on differing philosophical and psychological premises and employ a variety of pedagogical strategies. A battery of 14 existing and specially developed measures were used to cover the cognitive area. Factors such as organization of classrooms, parent-child interaction, supervision, child performance data and diffusion effects were analyzed. Among the most important outcomes of the first year of this 3-year assessment study are (1) cataloguing the process of program implementation (2) describing classroom processes (3) establishing the scheme and instruments to be used for the second and third years of the study. The general conclusion of  this document is that first year outcomes are encouraging but it is too early to assess with confidence the specific outcomes of specific program models.

The first group of findings deals with differences in ease of implementation in new locations and with external factors which facilitate implementation. The second group concerns the nature of experiences provided to children by preschools based on different educational philosophies and methods. The third set of findings concerns the effects of preschool programs on children and their families.

Eligibility was determined by economic criteria, ability to attend the full 5-week program, and probability of benefit from the program. Pupil-teacher ratios were generally 9 to 1; part-time psychological and speech services and a nurse were also available. The general program design was to provide enrichment activities to children in an open classroom atmosphere. Because a control group was not available, evaluation of program effects was undertaken by pretesting and posttesting with the Child Behavior Rating Scale (CBRS) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT). The CBRS was also administered over the telephone to a sample of 20 parents. Teachers kept a record of contacts with  parents to assess general parental involvement in the program. Evaluation findings indicate that: (1) students made significant improvement in two of the CBRS scales (Self-Adjustment and School Adjustment); (2) parents tended to rate their children lower on the Self-Adjustment Scale than did the teachers; (3) the mean IQ scores as measured by the PPVT were comparable to the national average; and (4) almost all parents were involved in the program, and their assessments of the program were positive. The document also includes program reports and photographs from the two schools, a replica of a newsletter sent home weekly, and selected letters from parents. (AJ)",

Teachers and mothers were also interviewed. The purpose of the study was to capture the children's experiences in the different settings, not to evaluate the model itself. Summaries of case studies of 16 children are presented. Classroom observers agreed on these findings: (1) the Head Start experience is valuable to the children; (2) there is not enough contact between the home and the school; (3) concentration on cognitive aspects of the model tends to make teachers less aware of other important  aspects of the child's life; (4) the models restricted the teachers in tailoring the program to the individual child; and (5) in many instances the curriculum seems better geared to boys. Investigators concluded that the case study approach is feasible. A final section comments on the functioning of the models and the extent to which Head Start goals are being met. (NH)",

A historical contributor to the present condition is the decline of the coal industry. Also a contributor is the general apathy of the citizens toward change and economic progress. The state's basic social and economic infrastructures, consequently, are sub-par to national norms. Economic expansion can be realized if (1) the national economy continues to grow, (2) the Federal regional programs and the Appalachian Regional Development Program proceed as scheduled, and (3) the state legislature authorizes public expenditure programs adequate to support the projected expansion of the private sector; however, this prediction for  economic expansion rests upon the application of qualitatively and quantitatively adequate public expenditures. The document provides an analysis of factors producing West Virginia's economic situation in 1968, suggestions for governmental action and a government expenditures policy, and discussions of expenditure areas such as the educational system, public welfare system, health, industry, and the transportation system.

The overall purpose of the research was to ascertain promising instructional procedures for underachieving (as measured by standardized achievement tests) Mexican American boys in grades 4-6. Hypothesizing that differences exist in qualitative characteristics of self-image in relation to ethnic classifications and in reading level achievement, and that reading achievement of culturally different children is directly related to differences in teaching techniques used to accomplish reading skills, 50 low-achieving and 50 achieving boys of Mexican American descent and 50  achieving boys of Anglo American heritage from 3 \"disadvantaged\" Los Angeles schools were studied. Findings tended to support hypothesis 1 while negating hypothesis 2. It appears that there are value conflicts between the Mexican American boy and the American school which affect his classroom achievement. His masculine orientation, strong peer-group identification, and lack of \"driveness,\" as well as the informal classroom which is at odds with his needs for a formal educational setting, are causes of the conflicts. It is recommended that the American school reexamine and restyle its curriculum to enhance legitimacy for all socially or culturally different students. A bibliography and 13 tables are included.

It involved building a curriculum based on behavioral objectives and preparing materials and methods particularly appropriate for 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds living in rural Appalachia. A timetable was set up to carry the program through a 5-year period. The planning period was from October 1967 to August 1968; field-testing began in September 1968 and was completed in May 1971; and all final reporting is to be completed by May 1972. The Curriculum Materials Team set up natural groupings of objectives and from them developed units of  work and an allocation of the time to be devoted to the units. All curriculum materials (e.g., tapes, children's worksheets, parent guides, mobile classroom guides) were produced by the Curriculum Materials Team. &quot;Around the Bend,&quot; the television element, was a 30-minute broadcast aired 5 days a week from the end of September until mid-May. The home visitors were 8 women recruited from the area in which they worked. Their effort was directed toward helping the parent help the child. The mobile classroom was staffed by a professional preschool teacher and an aide. Ten locations were visited each week by the mobile classroom. The document provides a program description and a summary of results of the research carried on by the project. (LS)",

These children were tested in June and September 1970 by individuals trained by the Appalachia Educational Laboratory but not otherwise involved in the program. In this way, it was hoped that any examiner bias would be minimized and that which remained would be a constant factor throughout all treatment groups. Data from the 4 groups were analyzed by a 3-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and an  analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) procedure. The ANOVA procedure involved 4 treatment levels, 2 age levels, and 2 levels of sex; the ANCOVA used the &quot;Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test&quot; raw score and chronological age as covariates. The BMDX64 general linear hypothesis program for unbalanced design was used to run the ANOVA and ANCOVA for each variable. There was no need to test the homogeneity of variances since the program adjusts for any lack of homogeneity. In the document, graphs of significant interaction effects are presented for each subtest where such effects occurred, along with results of Scheffe post hoc comparisons.

        "description":"Throughout the 1968-1969 hearings of the National Council on Indian Opportunity (NCIO), interest was shown repeatedly in the development of Indian centers within urban areas. Existing Indian centers in the cities visited by the NCIO were marginally funded operations which nevertheless fulfilled important functions such as intake and referral; housing assistance; recreation and sports for children and youth; legal aid; employment assistance; and provision of a social gathering place, a mailing address for those without a permanent residence, and a site for the preservation of Indian culture. Quite positive feelings and aspirations about the functions of an urban Indian center were common among the Indian witnesses. Statements of plans and hopes for Indian centers sometimes  contained references to hoped-for funding sources. Most often, it was expected that Government funds would have to be provided, and there were indications that the funding of urban Indian centers should be regarded as a responsibility of established Government agencies such as the Bureau of Indian Affairs. This report organizes the concerns and characteristics evidenced during the hearings which had to do with the Indian center. Much is included in the way of direct quotations from Indian witnesses.

It is concluded that (1) outdoor education programs require the cooperation of both professional and voluntary national, state, and local agencies; (2) outdoor experiences are important components in the &quot;growing up&quot; process; (3) outdoor education programs provide one of the few areas in which it is still possible to gain firsthand information--a &quot;learning by doing&quot; process; (4) both informal and formal classes are necessary; (5) ample resource material is available; and (6) because of the informal method of conducting  outdoor education classes, each student may progress at his own rate. Among the recommendations are that (1) programs utilize natural local facilities fully and maintain content relationships between formal and informal settings; (2) program innovation is essential; (3) traditional institutional atmospheres be removed; and (4) programs integrate the mentally retarded with other members of society living within the community. The document also provides a list of the states considered and their Federal, state, and local organizations and agencies actively involved in outdoor education, a list of residential camping programs for the mentally retarded (163), a list of resource materials, and an 18-item bibliography.

A Q-instrument containing 50 self-reference statements was developed by the investigator, who administered the instrument to 411 Indian adolescents selected from Sherman Institute, Riverside, California; these students represented 5 southwestern tribal groups: 100 Navajos, 100 Pimas, 96 Papagos, 90 Apaches, and 25 Hopis. The investigator made an item  analysis and accepted a group response if it comprised more than 67% or less than 34%. It was concluded that a composite self-concept of the Indian adolescent can be obtained using Q-technique methodology. While there were some self-concepts common to all 5 tribal groups, data indicated that there were also important and definite variations as to tribal perceptions of self and that a self-concept rating system can be obtained from the derived data and is desirable.

To validate this research in the Southwest, a diary indicating the out-of-school activities was requested from teachers interviewed during the 1968-69 school year as part of the National Study of American Indian Education. Each teacher was requested to anonymously account for his or her out-of-school activities over a 15-day period. Approximately 20% of the teachers returned a diary (20 diaries). Of a total of 439 recorded events outside of school time, 126 (or 29%) involved Indian people. Of this number, 74 (or 17%) were school-connected events  and 52 (or 12%) were nonschool-connected. A &quot;typical&quot; school would show percentages of 24%, 17%, and 6% for the same categories.

The 35-item questionnaire was used to obtain 5 basic types of information: prevalance of use of particular drugs, demography, attitudes, participation in social activities, and peer-group relationships. In general, findings showed that prevalence of drug use in rural areas is lower than in suburban areas; absence of the father may not be an underlying factor affecting drug use; there is an  absence of association between drug use and such factors as race, religion, and sex; for sources of information, students will listen to those who have used drugs and those who are experts in the health-information field; participation or lack of participation in organizations does not appear to be strongly related to drug use in either the rural or suburban area; frequent drug use by friends increases predictability of drug use by 22.5% for rural and 38% for suburban students; and drug education programs, in order to have impact, must precede grade 10.

The analysis, in part, revealed that rural farm women were employed in large and growing proportions; variations in rural farm employment rates were quite similar to variations among urban women; women married to men with nonfarm jobs had higher employment rates than those in farm jobs; and there was a variation in the employment of wives of men in different kinds of farming activities. According to the  analysis, further research should focus on such areas as (1) differential employment rates and patterns among different rural areas in relation to supply-and-demand factors, (2) high levels of fertility and fewer employment opportunities in rural areas, (3) employed women having jobs that are less than commensurate with their education, and (4) scarcity of professional and clerical employment opportunities in rural areas causing well-educated women to leave for the city.

Ninety Mexican American 8th-graders in San Antonio were assessed. Among the measurement tools used were the California Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills and Anderson and Evan's Language Usage in the Home Scale. The findings were that scores on the personality and achievement measures increased with acculturation; acculturation group differences on locus of control and achievement motivation were obscured by sex differences; an active coping style is related to high achievement in school for males more so than females; and  acculturation and socioeconomic status, in combination, predicted significant amounts of variance in all achievement criteria and all personality criteria except achievement motivation. Results, in part, suggest that a future study include an achievement via conformance measure as a means of improving prediction of female achievement; that comparisons with Anglo groups would be strengthened by using an Anglo sample from the same schools as the Mexican American sample; and that a description of the reference group should be included with self-concept findings.

For maximum effectiveness extension courses should (1) emphasize the technical rather than the theoretical preparation of reading teachers, (2) combine lecture and discussion with classroom practice activities, (3) provide a variety of classroom reading materials, (4) consider effective instructional techniques, and (5) include visits by the instructor to the classrooms of his pupil-teachers. Two types of inservice training activities that have proved effective are presummer school experiences and major summer and school year programs. Several presummer school 5-day programs are being conducted in Minneapolis for teachers who will be teaching a prekindergarten summer school  experience. These summer inservice efforts are characterized by demonstration teaching with the provision of relevant classroom instructional materials. The Minneapolis Combine Project is an example of a major inservice program. It is a comprehensive effort to resolve the reading problems of innercity children through the combined efforts of teachers, graduate and undergraduate students, and university personnel. Descriptions of these programs are available through the Gordon Instructional Materials Center, Minneapolis Public Schools and through the office of the author at the University of Minnesota. (VJ)",

        "description":"Schools have been paying too much attention to intellect alone, ignoring the total development of the student as a whole. Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives in the cognitive domain categorizes knowledge into knowledge of specifics, knowledge of ways and means of dealing with specifics, and knowledge of the universals and abstractions in a field. Intellectual ability and skills are categorized into comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. A second taxonomy of educational objectives, by Krathwohl, Bloom, and Masia, relates to the affective domain and leads to an understanding of the whole learning self. It deals with interests, attitudes, values, appreciation, and adjustment. These are characterized as receiving, responding, valuing, organizing, and  characterizing by a value or value complex. These educational objectives involve a greater inclusiveness and are related to both the cognitive and affective domain. It is time to create programs and educational settings which will help meet these objectives. We are beginning to see students as whole persons with a broad spectrum of needs, and we need to have more respect for their potentials. We want them to be independent learning persons who are intellectually competent, articulately communicative, emotionally free, idea seeking, idea creating, and honest in their relationships.

It is important to let the chld gain a variety of experiences prior to school entrance, such as the parents reading aloud to the child and allowing him to follow the lines with his eyes while listening. Much research has been done on modality preference of children, holding it true that some children can learn best by a certain method. If difficulties with learning to read occur, teachers should observe each child and appraise the different modalities involved in the instruction. Activities should be provided which provide training in sensory-motor skills, auditory perception and discrimination, visual perception and discrimination,  language skills, and thinking abilities. Linguistics offers insight into the reading process and reading instruction, but it does not offer a method for teaching reading. Many researchers believe that it is necessary to change the point of focus if the new knowledge about language is to be utilized so that reading programs are designated to develop word sense and to build comprehension strategies. In other words, semantic, syntactic, and phonemic-graphemic cues should be taught to help the reader determine new words. Each skill toward the mastery of reading should be over-learned until the use of it becomes a habit. References are included. (AW)",

Comprehensive diagnostic and post-instructional evaluation procedures were employed for the 27 students whose grade equivalent scores ranged from 7.0 to 14, with a mean of 9.89. Each student worked in competition with himself and kept his own records. In addition to graded reading materials, textbooks, and workbooks, students used newspapers and magazines such as Harper's, Saturday Review, the New York Times, and  the Houston Post to improve their ability to understand opinion shaping, fact and opinion inference, and propaganda. Book talk sessions were also held to share opinions and ideas about books of common interest. Vocabulary encountered in these readings formed a basis for studying context clues, syllabication, and other word attack skills. Aesthetic appreciation of reading materials was encouraged through closed-circuit televised sessions of play readings. At the end of the year the mean gain in total reading achievement was 2.5 grade levels. References are included. (VJ)",

A review of reading research reveals that future classroom teachers will be called upon to regard the diagnosis and treatment of learning difficulties as a crucial part of their role as teachers. A study with approximately 150 primary-school teachers in Australia asked them to provide comprehensive information concerning their current practices in diagnosis and treatment of reading difficulties. It was concluded from analysis of the data that reading diagnosis and treatment was unsuccessful and inadequate. To correct this deficiency, extensive preservice and inservice training of teachers in diagnosis and treatment is  needed. One effective inservice program sought to develop a strong commitment to the concept of improving instruction for retarded readers and to provide teachers with knowledge, skills, and understandings of a practical nature, plus a specific approach capable of adaption to individual classroom situations. Emphasis was given to practical experiences through the use of model lessons, mockup situations, and observation. However, further research is needed to assess the value of such programs in terms of problem readers and the conditions of the school. A bibliography is included. (VJ)",

Of these studies, only Bursuk firmly supports the theory that the modal preference of an individual should be considered in teaching him to read. All seven studies concentrate on studying visual and auditory modalities. The author feels that it would be extremely difficult to find an approach for teaching which would eliminate almost entirely the role of either the visual or auditory mode. A second problem he mentions is the identification of modal preference--for this  purpose a modal preference test considering both the conceptual and the perceptual aspects of learning should be developed. He concludes that more experimentation is needed to assure the testing of modal preference and its relationship to learning. References are included. (AW)",

The cards were arranged in 125-word groupings according to the common letter clusters. In training sessions two or more cluster groupings were studied in terms of the visual and auditory structure of the whole word. Up to 20 words were utilized with the same letter cluster in eigher the initial, medial, or final position. The goal was to have the learner respond, by habit, to the word structure that contributes most to the sound of the whole word. The summer-school program, funded under  Title I, had 56 remedial readers ranging mainly from third to fifth grades. The developmental 1-year program, funded under Title III, had 217 students ranging from first to fifth grades. Pretest and post-test scores on the word analysis section of the Durrell Analysis of Reading Difficulty indicated (1) that the average improvement for the 1-year program youngsters was approximately 2 years and (2) that the average gain of the summer-program students was slightly less than 1 year, with the boys' average gain approximately 4 months less than the girls'.

Passing through the \"Age of Awareness\" of the forties and fifties when \"brotherhood\" was the key word, through the \"Age of Racism\" of the sixties and seventies when ethnic identity achieves importance, into the \"Age of Understanding\" of the future when, hopefully, differentiation of minority groups will cease to mark a book as appropriate for one group only, we can now hopefully evaluate books for their literary quality rather than for the \"messages\" of their content and the ethnic qualities of their  characters. By examining several outstanding books and their reviews from the past decades, we can trace the development of criteria for evaluation and can formulate criteria for judging books in the future.

Besides the basic developmental and remedial reading courses, the specialist trainee should also take courses in curriculum theory, statistical analysis and research design, dynamics of instructional groups, administrator behavior, and administration of the school reading program. After the specialist is on the job he should take those inservice courses that are necessary to meet the particular requirements of his job. In addition to course work, a variety of field experiences should be part of the training program. These experiences include a practicum with a \"master\" reading consultant and work in clinics, schools, and classrooms. These field experiences  should give the trainee opportunities for active participation in both the decision-making and the implementation processes of program development. Short-term projects are beneficial if they allow the trainee to develop his own style of program development. The final benefit of field experiences should be the opportunity for the trainee to decide whether or not he is suited to fill a central office reading position. (VJ)",

It was summarized that reading specialists should be able to answer positively the following questions and their implied subquestions: (1) How well do they relate to people? (2) How well informed are they about how children learn? (3) How well do they understand the language that children bring to school? (4) How well can they teach the many tools of communication? (5) How well do they appraise children? (6) How well do they know and use many approaches to reading? (7) How well do they know how to develop independent reading? and (8) How well do they know what children  are reading? The author saw little need for specialists to serve as clinicians in a clinical setting in an elementary school. Rather, it was felt that reading specialists should be able to operate with whatever space, materials, and equipment are available within the monetary limits of the system within which they work. And finally, he concludes that reading specialists should be willing to do anything short of immorality to teach children the tools that they need to get through our system as it is set up. (VJ)",

First, instruction in ways of locating and using sources of information should be given. Second, students should learn flexibility in reading by developing the skills of skimming and scanning. A third important study skill is the ability to select and evaluate ideas, which consists largely of identifying significant ideas and relevant details. Related to  this skill is the ability to organize ideas by determining relationships among them. Outlining, notetaking, and summarizing are helpful ways of organizing ideas. A fifth skill that is of benefit to junior-high students is the ability to follow directions, beginning with very simple procedures and progressing to the complex.

Standardized tests from three batteries (California Achievement Test, Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test, and Stanford Achievement Test) were analyzed at three grade levels (1 to 2, 4 to 6, 9 to 14). The first analysis, for readability, used the Dale-Chall and the Spache formulae, and the second analysis, for difficulty of test items, used specially designed rating scales. Tests differed on all readability counts and scores increased with higher grade levels, although not always at the same rates either across tests or within them. Test items tended to use  different types of questions for similar kinds of materials. Questions fell generally into paraphrase and concept types. Frequency data were calculated for each of the readability and difficulty measures, and correlation coefficients were calculated for several characteristics of individual tests. While differences were found among the tests, they appeared to be testing abilities similar to those evaluated by intelligence and achievement tests.

Subjects were students in El Paso, Texas, schools, including one-third Anglo-American, one-third Mexican-American, and one-third Negro-American. Each child was tested on the Spache Diagnostic Reading Scales, an intelligence test, and two psychological tests.  Among the findings were (1) that age, sex, and ethnic background did not significantly affect frustration level; (2) that reading level, intelligence, emotional control, cognitive style, and perceptual acuity did affect the frustration level; and (3) that not counting repetitions as errors resulted in a significantly different frustration level than the accepted 10 percent error, 90 percent correct.

Then the pretest groups responded to items in the pretest, while the no-pretest group responded to items unrelated to the stimulus passages. Four weeks later, the skimming groups were asked to skim the two passages (one science and one social science) under controlled time limits. All subjects then immediately took the post-test. No significant main effect differences were noted for social science after adjustment for differences. For the science passage, the raw scores and gain scores differences between the skimming/pretest and the no-skimming groups were both significant. The raw score difference between the skimming/pretest and the  skimming/no-pretest groups was also significant. When pretest scores were used as a covariate in analyzing the post-test raw scores, a significant main effect due to the amount of background information was found. It was concluded that skimming was effective only when there was cueing via exposure to the pretest. Since the subjects did not skim the social science passage effectively, the author believed that skimming strategy might be used appropriately for some types of material, but not for others without special instruction.

The second approach involved comparing the characteristics of the group of ISCS teachers classified as being most effective with the group classified as least effective. Results indicate that effective ISCS teaching was not related to the grade level taught, to the number of science hours studied by the  teacher, to the number of physical science hours studied, or to the highest degree earned.

Of 94 colleges eligible to receive COSIP grants, 29 had been awarded grants. Questionnaires were sent to students of the eligible institutions while they were freshmen and again when they were seniors. Institutional characteristics, such as enrollment, selectivity level, percentage of Ph.D.'s on the staff, and number of volumes in the library were also included in the analysis. Analysis of the data led to the correlation of selectivity, faculty quality, and affluence with the institutions receiving a COSIP grant; with the percentage of Ph.D.'s on the staff being most significant. In addition to these characteristics, grant recipients were  likely to be nonsectarian liberal arts colleges which were relatively progressive. The students at these schools tended to be male and Protestant with superior academic records. They had high professional aspirations and a strong orientation toward science. (JG)",

The subjects were 78 kindergarten children in an urban public school. They were given a battery of tests, each assessing the ability to perform a specific task involving counting, use of numerals, or comparison of set size. The test scores were subjected to scalogram analyses. Results suggested: (1) a reliable sequence of skills in using numerals; (2) the dependence of learning numerals upon prior  acquisition of counting skills for sets of the size represented; (3) acquisition of numeral reading for small sets before learning to count larger sets; and (4) the independence of counting and one-to-one correspondence operations in young children.

        "description":"This self-pacing program is the result of a cooperative curriculum development project between The Maryland Department of Education and The Baltimore County Schools. Included is a teachers guide for the use of the materials. The philosophy of this approach is that of individualization of instruction wherein the student moves at a pace commensurate with his ability and background. He studies a topic, either individually or with a small group, then he takes a test measuring mastery of that material. The test is marked &quot;complete&quot; or &quot;incomplete.&quot; If he &quot;completes&quot; the topic unit, he proceeds to the next; if not, he does some remedial work until he &quot;completes&quot; the topic unit. It is suggested that written progress reports be kept for each student continuously and that grades for the  course be based on number of units completed. The content of this course includes systems of linear open sentences, polynomials and factoring, rational numbers and experssions, relations and functions, real numbers, complex numbers, logarithms, progressions and the binomial expansion, probability, quadratic systems, and matrices. Also included is an extensive itemized list of behavioral objectives for each topic, student assignments for each topic, and tests and keys for each topic unit. (Author/CT)",

        "description":"Reported is a study of the implementation of the new Project Physics course in American high schools. In the summer of 1970, 457 teachers attending 14 National Science Foundation institutes and 98 of their school administrators provided information through discussions and questionnaires. At the four institutes at which an implementation conference was held, questionnaire responses were obtained twice from both teachers and administrators during the conferences. The participants of the remaining institutes were tested by mail. The questionnaires obtained personal information, school and school system data, attitudes, and opinions regarding the course adoption decision-making process. Conclusions made from the data analysis include: (1) the classroom teacher is most important in  the adoption process; (2) adoption is most likely if the administration provides broad support; (3) the school most likely to adopt has a history of adopting other new courses; and (4) delay in adoption is increased by ineffective communication among school personnel. The characteristics of a teacher most likely to adopt a new course are presented in an ordered list. (Author/RS)",

Interview data collected when these 67 schools were visited supplemented questionnaire data. The results indicated that effective implementation of new programs required the provision of assistance and support to school curriculum development personnel in terms of research and resource materials for curricular decision making, a total curriculum plan, appropriate inservice education, and continual curriculum evaluation and revision. A list of school procedures that help overcome  specific problems, such as student deficiencies in mathematics or reading and inadequate teacher preparation time, is included. Tables summarize questionnaire data on teacher preparation, teachers' reports of implementation problems and their ranking of teacher needs for successful curriculum adoption. These tables are provided for IPS courses, biological sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) Biology, CHEM Study, and Physical Science Study Committee (PSSC) Physics.

Contacts were made with approximately one-half the schools in the Minot State College service region. Discussions were held with administrators and teachers, and facilities at each school were evaluated. A resource center offered experimental programs to determine types of services earth science teachers really use. As each program was offered, notation was made of the types of schools and teachers using it, and of the impact on earth science classes. Results indicate: earth science programs lack equipment, however, rich resources are available from other science programs; funds for earth science resources  seem to be available; teachers generally lack training in earth science, but have substantial background in other sciences; there is a strong demand for in-service offerings in earth science, and also for regular seminars and lecture series on earth science designed for teachers; workshops are popular, but appear to have little impact; teachers having regular contact with the resource center will take advantage of opportunities to borrow equipment; and serious interest in trading specimens appears to be lacking.

The focus is on the individual and the responsibility each bears to move beyond awareness to action to return man to a balance with nature. One must incorporate an assessment of the impact of all that he may plan or do on nature and its finite resources, as well as consider alternatives which might minimize environmental damage. The development of an environmental ethic which values the heritage of  man on the earth is needed together with a commitment to back up this belief. While the elements exist for a successful solution to the problems of environmental degradation, man must unite to achieve such goals and offer Americans their best hope for dramatic success in restoration and preservation of the environment.

Problems are identified in the areas of people, culture, resources, and the lack of significant action in bringing about environmental quality. The scope and goals of environmental education are defined, and the need for responsibility and accountability for the achievement of the goals is expressed. Exemplary components of a master plan having a major responsibility for environmental education are identified and include: state governments, school  districts, colleges and universities, professional associations, businesses and industries, local governments, federal and regional governments, citizen organizations, individual citizens, independent education organizations, and mass media. Each component is described at length, outlining its objectives, constraints, and strategies. Final recommendations emphasize the need for establishing a trans-disciplinary task force to develop a master plan for environmental education for Illinois. (BL)",

This was a longitudinal study involving the distribution of questionnaires to freshmen at 186 institutions during the fall of 1966 and a later distribution of questionnaires to the same students as seniors in December 1969. The criterion variables measured by the questionnaires included the following: college major, anticipated future occupation, persistence in college, review of the student's college education, student's satisfaction with his college, and the nature of the student's planned future  work. It was concluded that students are less likely to transfer out of schools which receive COSIP grants. Students in COSIP schools are significantly more likely to aspire toward the Ph.D. There were several small positive relationships between COSIP variables and student plans to teach. The choice of engineering and physics as majors was significantly associated with COSIP funds. (PR)",

        "description":"This consultant paper for a war/peace curriculum development project is concerned with the challenge of preparing members of our society for a more rational approach to problems of inter-nation conflict. The nature of conflict and conflict solution in relation to the experience of learning are emphasized. Topics discussed include: 1) effect of physical environment upon evolution of man; 2) aggression, and human behavior; 3) psychological processes and values; and, 4) war as a social institution. The characteristics of human reaction to this fear are explored, such as dehumanization, alienation, and social involvement. Also discussed are: 1) unconscious defense mechanisms; 2) intra- and inter-group conflict; 3) socio-economic and political forces; 4) ethnocentrism; and, 5)  communication problems. Guidelines suggest teaching these concepts: 1) idea of a world in which conflict, but not inevitably war, will continue to exist; 2) alternatives to violence are available as outcomes of conflict situations; 3) conflict can function as a creative force; and, 4) there is a need for new institutions for the conduct of conflict and the control of violence. A bibliography of 24 books and articles is appended as well as a list of 9 additional reference sources. Other consultant papers in this Inquiry session are SO 001 262 through SO 001 265.

Both classical and modern political philosophy are explored in discussing the difficulties of definition. Main interpretations investigated include: 1) the idea of the soul as a substitute for self, historical works of Socrates and Plato; 2) the unique individual, or the autonomous self, derived through Nietzschean philosophy; 3) the notion of the self as role player, a viewpoint of Kariel; and, 4) the inter-connection of self and order, called the social self, or the genuine self as envisioned by Etzioni. Additional factors in  understanding the meaning of self are investigated such as, basic human needs, autonomy, freedom, social values, socialization, equality, responsibility, social stability, and a counter culture philosophy.

Beginning with an analysis of interaction and conflict between individuals, the author proceeds to examine its occurrence on the group, organization, and nation-state level. He points out that since all human interaction involves some conflict, we should consider alternative modes for conflict management. Several uni-causes have at times been put forth for war--including biological instinct, a form of psychotic behavior, etc. The line of argument taken here is that national leaders will always try to move their nation in directions which reduce whatever discrepancies they perceive between the state of affairs they believe they are living in, and the state of affairs they prefer. Based on this  analysis, the general dynamics of conflict and violence between nations of varying levels of power are examined. The author points out that because of these dynamics, warfare is almost inseparable from the nation state (and empire) system as it has existed with the exception of a few countries such as Sweden, who have chosen to play world politics in a different way. Comments on Prof. North's presentation by Irving Janis and Thomas Milburn accompany the document. Related documents are SO 001 259 through SO 001 267. (JLB)",

As in earlier editions, the tables are the core of this report. They contain data organized in three major sections: 1) a worldwide overview of information on population, economic development, and governmental positions on family planning for broad geographic regions; 2) demographic, social, and economic characteristics for individual countries in both the developing and developed world; and, 3) national family planning policy and program data, including such information as personnel and funds allocated to  services, acceptors, and estimated current users of such services. Data presented in the tables are taken or computed from published and unpublished sources, as specified. In some cases data are estimates based on incomplete information. International comparisons are to be viewed with caution because of differences among the countries in concept, definition, and operation. (Author/JLB)",

        "description":"This narrative unit on idealism was developed as an illustration of minority group efforts to reform the social structure of American democracy, the implications being that American life was in many respects lacking. The general teaching objectives are: 1) to stimulate student consideration of what would be their ideal society; 2) to foster a feeling that human institutions can be improved and effectively changed; 3) to value individual and group efforts to improve society; 4) to appreciate a goal which holds out for something better than a life based on material things; and, 5) to understand why people drop out of society and what problems they face. The narratives are divided into two sections: the first briefly describes conditions as they existed before a response was made to  the condition; the second section deals with the form which the response took. Except for a narrative on peace, all the others have historical roots in the nineteenth century and include selections on utopian socialism, penal reform, and abolitionism. The methods shown in these narrative studies should invite comparison with present idealisms, which, for the most part, are a continuation of earlier ones. The readability range in all five narratives runs from a reading grade level of seven plus to eleven plus. Discussion questions to encourage inquiry, a vocabulary list, and a test are included.

The study is based on data collected from documents published in the USSR and in the United States, and on information obtained from a series of interviews during 1962 with: members of the Communist Party, a member of the Central Committee of the CPSU, ministers of education, chairmen of city boards of education, inspectors of schools, and various administrators and faculty of institutes of higher education. Questions discuss patterns of decision making, policy change  procedures, and the distribution and exercise of power and authority; questions for further study are delineated in a final section. The primary conclusion is that the decision-making power resides in the CPSU's Central Committee, operating through democratic centralism. Appendices provide selected readings, a glossary of Russian terms, and a list of ministries and committees that administer higher education. (Author/DJB)",

        "description":"This memorandum derives estimates of the private rate of return to schooling for men and women based on a 1965 labor force survey, past cross-sectional data, and the long-term educational public policy of Bogota, Colombia. Here resources may be viewed as an investment in the future productive capacity of people. Depending on the costs and benefits associated with a particular educational activity and alternative investment opportunities, this activity may or may not be an attractive investment for efficiently promoting economic development. This association between schooling level and earnings, or the private rate of return, along with a partial social rate are estimated for elementary, secondary, vocational, and higher education. The empirical findings state that the private and  social returns on both men's and women's secondary and vocational education, and to some extent, men's primary schooling, are high in Bogota. But the returns on university education are unusually low. It is concluded, therefore, that a high economic priority should be given to the expansion of secondary and vocational education with particular emphases given to achieving a more equal distribution of educational opportunities between urban and rural, rich and poor regions of the country. Continued expansion of public support for higher education without rapid growth in domestic demand for high level talent is not likely to be remunerative, and may only accelerate emigration of universty graduates abroad.

Technological and operational innovations were sought for improving literacy training, vocational and agricultural education, and teacher training. Since only three months were allocated for this pilot effort, the research concentrated on the advantages that could be provided by the use of educational television for the primary school system. The study found that if educational television is to be really effective, it must be introduced into a system that has not only a good foundation of qualified teachers and administrators, but adequate educational facilities. As a result of this effort the  feasibility and need for additional research in this area was revealed. (Author/AWW)",

In the process, long-range educational goals have evolved: 1) to provide universal primary education; 2) to ensure enough places at the secondary and higher levels for educating those with recognized abilities; and, 3) to organize the educational system for meeting the country's manpower needs, thus stressing expenditures in education as an investment in the Nation's economic development. The structure and administration, finance and government aid, curriculum and examination elements of this formal system are  discussed along with educational programs outside the system including youth programs, adult education, professional development programs, and conservation education. Two highlights of the report are: 1) a description of the establishment and development of community self-help or Harambee schools; and, 2) a description of the 1970-74 Development Plan giving rural development top priority and setting a goal for making the secondary school curriculum more relevant to the country's social and economic needs. Curriculum excerpts, a schedule, and selected references are appended; thirteen tables of statistical data on enrollments and expenditures are also included. (Author/SBE)",

In the study of Asian cultures it is necessary to stress historic facts and the richness of the culture; an exclusive attention to economic growth, modernization, and the social and political problems is not appropriate. The most effective way to achieve balance is to use the comparative approach integrating both the humanities and the social sciences. How a teacher organizes his course and what method he chooses depends on his philosophy: 1) whether he postulates a linear or cyclical view of history; and, 2) how he stands on the uniqueist versus the universalist view of culture. It would be of great value if Western civilization  could be studied first to facilitate comparison between institutional structures, values systems, and history. The basic methodology should start from the frame of reference of the student; the teaching of concepts, and the utilization of induction and deduction are all valid here. Study can be synthesized by selecting material from the native literature, art, music, and philosophy. Films may serve as a final summation or equally well as an introduction.

Two short pocket books make them accessible and acceptable to students: 1) The Dance of Shiva and Other Tales from India by Oroon Ghosh, published by the New American Library in New York; and, 2) Gods, Demons, and Others by R. K. Narayan, published by the Viking Press in New York. In the first book, the stories are compiled in short, summary fashion. The second book is for secondary school students, and introduces them to the two great Hindu epic poems, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. It is suggested that these epics be studied with special attention to the Bhagavad Gita, a book in the Mahabharata. Both poems provide the subject matter for understanding the  culture, basic values, and attitudes of Hinduism; the Mahabharata is the repository of India's national tradition, a great encyclopedia of ethics and religion, and or political and moral duties. Students should also learn the story of Krishna and his early life with the Gopis. If possible, they should also dip into the Panchatantra: five books written for the instruction of three princes in niti, the right conduct of life, using animal stories as the vehicle.

In developing the activities, the authors have chosen situations which would help bring the process of social control to the child's consciousness. In teaching this unit, the teacher should realize the tripartite emphasis upon the process, affective, and substantive dimensions. The process dimension concerns itself with the development of mental abilities such as observing, identifying, collecting, and evaluating data. The affective dimension considers the internationalization of favorable attitudes toward self, immediate others, and differing races and cultures. The substantive dimension addresses itself to developing a consciousness of social control  present in formal and informal relations and mechanisms. Essentially, the teaching act exists as a meld of the three processes.

In dealing with continuity and change, the authors began with certain assumptions: 1) learning should involve children to the highest degree possible; 2) social learning should deal with numerous examples of cultural and geographical settings out of the child's immediate tactile range; and, 3) social studies activities do relate to the adjustment of the individual to American mores. However, that adjustment does not emerge as the primary task of social studies education.

However, what is new is the emphasis on human groups as a basis for organizing a single social studies discipline. Some questions are suggested concerning what should be investigated about groups, and what the students need to understand. 1) What causes human groups to form, to change, to disintegrate? 2) What holds groups together--ideas, beliefs, values? 3) How are these ideas expressed in groups --art, artifacts, rituals, myths? 4) How is group control acquired, exercised, maintained, or lost? 5) What is acceptable behavior within the group? 6) Who interacts with whom, why, and how? 7) How is the group affected by other groups or its environment? 8) What creates conflict and how is it  resolved? These are questions equally useful in the study of nations or neighborhoods, culture, or classroom cliques. Questions such as these require the student to use all the cognitive processes and lead him to discover powerful concepts. Critical thinking skills lead to understanding and creative generalizations about human behavior: observation, classification, measurement, inference, hypotheses making and verification, prediction, definition, interpretation, and the use of relationships. The objective, rational study of values and value differences are the essential ground for the content and process with first hand observation of social action as the most powerful learning tool.

As an introduction to economics, it is designed to provide a frame of reference for the study of contemporary economic problems. It is a careful study of such concepts as scarcity, wants, resources, and decision-making with respect to the various economic activities found in all economies, and how these activities are organized into economic systems. Economic concepts and their relationships to the other social sciences are stressed incorporating the basic strategy of problem-solving through inquiry. The seven chapter text includes general discussions by the principal author; twenty-eight readings, including some historical resources, others  from foreign countries, and several by the author, are keyed to most of the chapters. The programmed student workbook contains seven programs, criterion tests, and twelve exercises. An extensive use of graphs is continued in the revision, but the unit test is not repeated. Unit II is described in SO 001 701.

        "description":"This revision and expansion of the 1966 edition of the student materials, ED 040 101, is comprised of a student workbook and text for Unit II. It is a careful study of the structure and performance of the United States Market system including the aspects of how market competition between buyers and sellers affects resource allocation, what is produced, how goods and services are produced, how they are distributed, and how much is produced in total. The major objective is to help students learn enough to permit understanding and evaluation of the performance of the system in satisfying the desires and aspirations of the American people. The unit incorporates the basic strategy of problem-solving through inquiry. The nine chapter text includes general discussions by the principal  author; three readings are keyed to the chapters. The programmed student workbook contains twelve programs, criterion tests, and thirteen exercises. An extensive use of graphs is continued in the revision, but the unit test is not repeated. Unit I is described in SO 001 700. Other available related documents are: 1) the test editions of the Teacher's Materials for both Unit I and Unit II, ED 040 100; and, 2) the final report of the curriculum development project, ED 028 093. Addison Wesley Company will be publishing the future editions of the units. (SBE)",

        "description":"Based on students' generally shallow knowledge of geographic concepts on the one hand and a new and almost universal awareness of man in his milieu on the other, the author seeks to draw attention to the discipline of geography, and more specifically, political geography as an essential, fundamental component of international studies. The application of geography to international studies is interpreted through a summary of the major outlines of the discipline of geography, and an examination of the essential role of regional analysis, both to geographers, and other social scientists. The author points out that geography, by providing a spatial awareness, gives a dimension to education without which the study of man on earth is incomplete. There are a number of social/world issues  facing us (population, economic development, increasing involvement between nations) which demand understandings from the field of geography. Without this foundation of geographic-spatial concern there is grave danger that policy judgments might too often be made without important evidence. A short bibliography is appended. (Author/JLB)",

        "description":"This paper makes an informational analysis of teachers' verbal discourse. A behavioral analysis is also made in terms of &quot;tacts&quot; and &quot;mands,&quot; as defined by Skinner. These behavioral components of a message may be quantified in terms of &quot;originality,&quot;&quot;redundancy,&quot; and &quot;complexity.&quot; But the most important problem is to find what effects the teacher's verbal behavior has on pupil behavior. A conceptual model using student mathemagenic behaviors as intervening variables is described. This concept is useful in describing the kinds of hypotheses that need to be formulated to guide empirical study. Mathemagenic behaviors--defined by Rothkopf as behaviors that produce learning--are the critical empirical concept linking teacher and student behavior. Thus, using the simplified behavioral  and mathematical conception of teacher behavior and mathemagenic behaviors as intervening variables, a research strategy is envisaged. The utility of this approach is suggested by current experimental work on verbal learning. These concepts can also be used to integrate the research of several investigators on classroom discourse.

Results showed that science student teachers, when exposed to models of laboratory situations, were able, through feedback which  consisted of an analysis of these laboratory situations by the Small Group Interaction System, to not only duplicate the model but to improve upon it significantly at the .05 level.

International education offers teachers an opportunity to assist students in the development of a broader repertoire of structuring processes. Two teaching strategies were employed--unit planning to present information in such a way that the parts form an interrelated and interdependent whole, and the use of written behavioral objectives to provide teachers with an opportunity to determine learning goals clearly. The  construction of objectives is explained in detail, as is the selection of content for the teaching unit. Various kinds of direct and indirect learning experiences are considered, and methods of evaluation based on the use of the behavioral objectives. Six sample units are included: 1) \"Vocational Agriculture,\" 2) \"Argentina: The Land and the People,\" 3) \"Physical Education Rhythms,\" 4) \"Our Mexican Neighbors,\" 5) \"World Literature,\" and 6) \"Indians of Central America.\" (Related document is ED 038 349.)

Six examples of simulation in preservice and inservice teacher education are described. Each description includes information on the purpose and form of the simulation, how to use it, its specific advantages and drawbacks, and whom to contact for further information. The six examples are 1) classroom simulator, 2) teaching problems laboratory, 3) Project Insite, 4) low-cost instructional simulation, 5) human relations: one dimension of teaching, and 6) inner-city simulation laboratory. The booklet discusses the general advantages of simulation and the specific advantages of using it in conjunction with student teaching,  as part of the college-based teacher education program, and in inservice and graduate education. The report also outlines briefly several questions which should be considered in deciding whether or not to use a particular simulation. (RT)",

The program has had two primary objectives: to assist in the development of a charter which would legally establish an intermediate level of school administration, and to train Liberian educators to administer and staff this intermediate unit. An on-going program of inservice education and instructional materials development  has also been set up. Funds for the project were provided by USAID.

Specific information about the purposes, means, and outcomes of clustering is presented, as is information about the organization of clusters and the extent of parity in TTT. The data was obtained from observations of meetings by evaluation staff, completed questionnaires of cluster meeting participants, completed interviews of project directors, and communications of the evaluation staff with persons involved in the national TTT program. The data indicated that participants generally agreed with the purpose of the cluster activity. The specific purposes of stimulating exchange and interaction and disseminating information among program components were rated highest in  personal importance. The geographic basis of clustering was regarded by many as unsatisfactory, and the usefulness of cluster meetings as a clustering activity was inconclusive. Questionnaire respondents felt that parity seemed to be more extensive at the project than the cluster level, and that at the project level more occurred in planning than in operational aspects. The amount of parity at the project level was viewed with confidence as likely to increase significantly in the future. (MBM)",

The 113 respondents were divided into two categories--\"old institutions\" and \"new institutions.\" The first referred to those which were in the original study; the latter referred to those which had begun offering the doctorate in education since that time. The report presents detailed information on characteristics of the institutions, recent production of doctoral graduates in education, admission requirements, curricular  requirements, and related conditions such as housing and finance. Comparisons are made between old and new institutions and between Ph.D. and Ed.D. programs. The report finds that as the Ph.D. has begun to drop the foreign language requirement and made other changes toward similarity with the Ed.D., it has become the more popular degree. Few differences were found between old and new institutions. The report also noted that the four areas which produced the greatest numbers of doctorates were school administration, guidance and counseling, educational psychology, and higher education. The final chapter includes other conclusions and recommendations and outlines of \"typical\" Ed.D. and Ph.D. programs. (SP 005 145 reports a similar study of Canadian institutions.) (RT)",

Data obtained from the TPES were factor analyzed resulting in six subscales: 1)  personality traits, 2) warmth of teacher behavior, 3) general classroom atmosphers, 4) lesson usefulness, 5) teacher interest in pupils, and 6) teacher interest in student achievement. Results from analysis of variance showed that subjects with microteaching experience received significantly higher ratings on the first five factors.

In support of this position, two examples are cited of differentiated staffing programs developed AFT locals. The first program, Career in the Classroom, was developed by the New York City union and funded under the USOE School Personnel Utilization Program of the Bureau of Educational Personnel Development. The program calls for the creation of a wide range of  positions, from paraprofessional to adjunct professor. The second program, at a high school in suburban Minneapolis, has also developed a horizontally differentiated staff which includes clerical teacher aides, teacher interns and assistants, teachers, and team leaders.

Group A spent three semesters in on-site experiences which included observation/participation activities and weekly on-site seminars. Participation activities were increased throughout the program. Group B spent the first semester in on-campus activities which included seminars, microteaching, using audiovisual materials, group dynamics, set induction  theory, lesson plans, and interaction analysis. Group B's second and third semester experiences paralleled those of Group A. During the last semester, two 45-minute live classroom observations were made on each participant using the Instrument for the Observation of Teaching Activities (IOTA). Data were analyzed by computing t ratios for each of the 14 observation scales based on the mean scores of the two observations. Since there was no difference in performance between the groups, it was recommended that Sequence B be adopted for logistical reasons, and that a longitudinal follow-up study be conducted on participants.

It traces the developing role of the school in society since 1900, noting a reversal of roles which is now occurring. Rather than sublimating the needs of the individual to those of society, the school must now serve the individual. A consideration of the implications of this new role for curriculum development yields a list of twelve practices which are necessary for schools to fulfill their new role. These include student participation in curriculum planning, community and citizen involvement in education, expansion of the curriculum to include the study of man as a social being and the study of individual self-awareness, increased emphasis on  literature and the arts, and student participation in the real world in the form of productive work. Where possible, examples are given of schools which are presently using these practices. A final word addressed to the individual teacher or administrator points out several specific things that each can do within the present system to move toward the development of a humane school.

The three main ingredients to be considered are curriculum, teachers, and organization and management. The two kinds of problems needing research and development are 1) those of a general character which relate to the design and structure of the program and 2) those which are more specific and technical dealing with the skills and knowledge required for teachers. The major emphasis in the next decade probably ought to  be upon developmental work. New programs should be used only for those who are committed to teaching, with the major effort devoted to the first few formative years in teaching. The last two years in training and the first years on the job need to be looked at as a whole, and the distinction between pre- and inservice education needs to be erased. The needed reform in teacher education is dependent on reform in the schools and on the treatment of teachers during their first few years in the school. (MBM)",

The approach recommended by the author is termed \"systems-evaluative\" or \"inquiry-oriented.\" This approach evaluates the effectiveness of educational systems and their goals in relation to certain defined values, but does not attempt to judge the values. The rationale developed to support this approach includes a short study of the history of scientific method and an explanation of the interdependence of systems. The author  concludes with the hope that it is not too late for the foundational studies to become embracive and majestic in support of a national educational and social policy of the future. (RT)",

He deplores the inability of young people to function independently in their personal and professional lives and blames the dependent nature of their education for this phenomenon. A curriculum in the foundations of education which would help future teachers to break through the circle of \"teaching as they are taught\" would emphasize sensitivity training and critical and analytical thinking. In this type of program, the role of the teacher educator would change to include continuing experiences in the public schools. He would function as a unique communication link between the university and the  schools. The author concludes by pointing up the need for continuing inservice education to keep the teacher abreast of the latest developments in educational theory and practice. (RT)",

It would be inefficient for each local school system to attempt this process on its own.

Program officials said that manpower and resources were insufficient and that they had not evaluated the activities to identify those that were successful. Officials believed that the program had benefited individual students by reducing the student-to-teacher ratio, and by exposing the children to interns from a variety of backgrounds. Although the program's influence on the regular teaching staff was limited, it was  believed that some of the teachers had changed their methods of instruction. Few interns remained permanently in the area because of its isolation, the low salary levels, and the small number of teacher vacancies.

The section on programs of study includes the categories of course work, examinations, committees, internships, research dissertations, program length, and foreign language requirements.

Initially, 1,600 individuals were surveyed regarding their inservice activities. The data were then evaluated using \"Filep's intersect theory of assessment\" which employs an analysis of consensus as well as disagreement overlap. The model that emerged was constructed utilizing both the survey data and the assistance of a task force representing the 13 participating counties. The model involves establishing 1) a \"people network\" of individuals responsible for inservice programs at all levels; 2) a communication and utilization system to unite these individuals and a means for developing, conducting, and evaluating inservice programs; and 3) a basic  plan or schedule that provides for inservice activities and their sequencing. Two versions of the model have been developed, the first including a school year plus a summer program and the second directed solely to the academic year. The report suggests methods by which local school districts can finance initial phases of the model, but shared resources at local, county, and state levels would be required for wide-scale, effective implementation. The model could enable research, development, application, and evaluation of new state curricula frameworks in any subject area to be undertaken rapidly. (Author/MBM)",

Carbon County School District provided a program for 19 teacher aides which included college courses and assignment to experienced classroom teachers. The Granite School District project was designed to obtain teachers and paraprofessional staff for special education programs. Each participant was able to work in an actual classroom situation, and workshops were conducted by university and district administrative staff, teachers, and consultants. The Millard County School District program had 33 participants who were trained as clerical, service, and classroom aides. The Ogden School District  program to select and train teaching personnel was designed for two phases, one to develop a new training program and new materials and the second to recruit, select, and train 30 people using this program. The report deals only with the first phase involving the development of self-instructional units called WILKITS (Weber Individualized Learning Kits). The Provo School District program involved the design of a curriculum for teachers and paraprofessionals. Tooele School District provided a workshop for instructional and clerical aides.

In the first analysis, a correlation of .64 (p<.01) between the words in this language corpus and those in the Thorndike-Lorge and Rinsland listings was found, indicating a high degree of overlap in the oral and written language to which these children are expected to respond. With reference to verbal reinforcement, analysis of the nature of the communications conveyed by the teachers' language revealed a number of interesting differences across ethnic and SES groups. White teachers of both high SES black children and low SES white children used a great  deal more verbal reinforcement than white teachers of high SES white children or black teachers of low SES black children. However, the statements of the white teachers in the first group were primarily punitive, whereas the reinforcement messages of the black teachers of low SES black children were overwhelmingly positive, warm, and supportive. Only white teachers were observed in high SES schools, with neither white teachers of low SES black children nor black teachers of high SES black children or low SES white children. Therefore broad generalizations should not be drawn from this incomplete sample. (Author)",

Forty-eight students preparing for secondary school teaching were randomly selected and further randomized into four groups containing equal numbers of men and women. Groups were assigned to one of the following programs: 1) traditional preparation, no student teaching; 2) traditional preparation, solo student teaching; 3) individualized preparation, solo student teaching; 4) individualized preparation, team teaching. The data were gathered in three categories: 1)  performance in nine areas, recorded in videotaped lessons; 2) classroom interaction; and 3) self and cooperating teacher ratings on questionnaires. The data were subjected to analysis of variance and the mean scores adjusted for differences so that the pretest could be employed as a convariate in analyzing posttest data. Results indicated that team trainees from experimental programs were significantly more successful than traditional solo trainees in several areas. In the comparison of sex attitudes, men perceived their growth as being significantly greater than did their cooperating teachers. (MBM)",

The returns showed that the pressure of censorship is a prominent part of school life in this state. Censorship is defined as the use of nonprofessional standards for accepting or rejecting a book. Some teachers are discontented with school policy that seems to favor bowing to community standards and tastes. However, the information accumulated by this study does not permit more than certain qualified observations concerning the impact of censorship on the schools.

The teacher's ability to read understandingly and enrich the student's understanding of what he reads presupposes some knowledge of the political and social history which constituted the background against which are read the great works of literature. Words reveal the changes in the manners, the customs, the thoughts and attitudes, the very life of man, as they have taken place over the course of time. What the teacher of English should realize and make full use of in the classroom is that some of the rules of grammar that run counter to the student's habits and instincts rest not upon linguistic but upon social sanctions. In sum, the value of historical  linguistics to the teacher of English falls under three heads: as an element in his or her cultural equipment, as a tool in the understanding and interpretation of earlier literature, and as the basis for sound judgment in matters concerning the language today.

Virtually all of the research studies of the effects of grammar on writing have been error-oriented studies. The findings of 15 important studies make clear that oral drills on right and wrong forms are superior to whole-class grammar and usage study.

Measures included class inclusion, conservation of substance and weight, a sorting test, and a test of comprehension of active and passive sentences. Class inclusion was not strongly related to syntactical comprehension, but conservation was. Syntax was more strongly correlated with conservation than with another language measure. Logic may be related in different ways to vocabulary, syntax, and verbal fluency. Syntax, the organization of elements in a sentence, seems to have an appreciable relationship with logic during this period of development. (Author)",

It is also true that the closer a school is to the center of racial turbulence the more attention it pays to units in black literature and black culture.

The most plausible explanation of the auditory  discrimination deficit of the disadvantaged is simply that the categorizations (same vs. different) which are expected on the testing instruments are those of standard English and do not correspond to the social dialect of blacks and/or lower socioeconomic status groups. The difference in auditory discrimination between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged tends to disappear as children progress through school. (CK)",

The English teacher is faced with a combination of the two tasks of enculturation and acculturation. The effective teacher must clearly understand what she is doing in terms of the cultural milieu of the educational system and the cultural composition of the class, and the concept of culture should be made an explicit part of the English curriculum.

The resulting dialogues were coded and grouped for analysis as follows: Total Sample; Sub-Sample of 500 Consecutive Utterances; Longer than Average Dialogues; and Adult Child Dialogues. A j test was used to gauge the significance of the difference between group means. An adult from each family was interviewed, and each family was treated in individual case studies. The majority of the findings indicate that adult-focal child dialogues are pivotally related to the verbal ability of the focal child. Above average verbal ability seems to be associated with a situation in which  the mother initiates but then assumes a secondary conversational role. In school terms, the standard dialect teacher should interact directly with the student rather than the whole class; and the student should be encouraged to use the dialect he is learning in a school setting.

In the first phase, individual teachers from inner city schools were interviewed according to a procedure whereby selected samples of tapes of various dialects were played and the teacher was asked to describe her impressions of the child. Adjectives from these free-responses formed the basis for the development of rating scales that were eventually used to obtain quantitiative data on teachers' attitudes. In subsequent phases of the research, sample groups of teachers from the same population were administered selected tapes from the above materials, which they then rated on scales like the one above. Another series of studies used videotapes of childrens' speech samples. The tapes included samples of children from Anglo, Black,  and Mexican-American families and within each of these groups, children from low or middle status families. The adjectives used by small samples of teachers who viewed and described their impressions of the children in the videotapes were again used as a basis for developing rating scales. Just as the present studies imply a bias in teachers' attitudes toward nonstandardness, they also suggest ways to measure such bias and still more to gauge the effects of teacher training. (CK)",

Each school system will provide, at the 9th or 10th grade level, and for a minimum of one semester, a basic speech course designed for all students. The principal objective will be student understanding of the process of communication as well as ability to incorporate these skills in every oral language situation. Each school will provide a minimum of one  semester of instruction in speech for those students experiencing difficulty in school because of language patterns. Each school will provide advanced elective courses for oral language development. Cocurricular programs will also be offered. Courses in both speech and drama should be taught by individuals holding majors in speech from accredited universities and colleges. For the speech courses, the following facilities should be available: (1) a large classroom, (2) an auditorium and stage area, and (3) an oral communication laboratory. (CK)",

The earliest slaves in the New York area may have used Pidgin English, Pidgin Portuguese, or Pidgin French along with their own dialects for a language of wider communication. There are many reasons why Pidgin English would have been the most useful of these closely related languages. Dutch Creoles were very prominent in this early period, and their patois bears a strong resemblance to Pidgin English. Except for a few writers, no one had looked at the language of Black people in Northern cities until the 1960's.

The freshman course in which the research was performed was the USAF Academy Fourth Class English course. The text for the course identifies, explains, and illustrates five components of expository writing: purpose, organization, content, sentences, and diction. Effectiveness of the techniques was measured by comparing skill in using these five components on their initial and final themes. Each of three instructors was asked  to teach his four classes in four different ways: teach one class using one technique; one using the other; one using both; and one using neither. Data for the experiment were grades on four of the six out-of-class themes. Four readers were employed to grade the themes according to the following criteria: (1) purpose and organization, (2) content, and (3) sentences and diction. The scores were analyzed using standard product-moment correlational analyses and analyses of covariance. No reliable evidence was found to indicate that the two techniques, used singly or in combination, were superior to instruction which offered students no guidance for improving their writing. (CK)",

Procedures of data generation for simulation purposes are also delineated and computationally demonstrated. The logistic model basic to the Bayesian estimation procedures is shown to be explicit with respect to the probability distribution from which one is sampling. This feature allows for an assessment or evaluation of its capabilities without empirical data. The fit of the model to empirical data is discussed as an issue independent of considerations as to model capabilities. Three item banks are used to simulate Bayesian estimation procedures. Two are idealized--though reasonably possible--examples; whereas, the third consists of items specified according to other  parameter estimates reported. Results indicate that with test validity held constant, Bayesian tailored testing of the Verbal Scholastic Aptitude Test (VSAT) could result in a savings of 65% of testing time for the average examinee. However, more savings in testing time is seen as possible through the use of item banks developed specifically for the purpose of tailored testing. The present investigation did not utilize prior information. Further assessments of model capabilities should explore such usage. While present results appear favorable, the full potentialities of the model have yet to be assessed. (Author/AE)",

A wide variety of environmental measures for 95 colleges were included. The method computed within-school regression lines, then colleges were clustered on regression lines, using a taxonomic technique, and multiple group discriminant functions using college descriptive variables were computed. It was found that in all three achievement areas one group or cluster of colleges could be identified as being more effective than the remaining groups of colleges. In the humanities areas the most effective group was characterized by a higher proportion of faculty with doctorates, greater selectivity, and a larger budget. In  social sciences and the natural sciences, emphasis on subject matter area as measured by the proportion of majors in the appropriate fields of study was the only variable which demonstrated some discrimination between the most and least effective groups.

Specifically, it deals with the identification of valid and reliable psychometric measures of student attitudes toward Air Force technical training. Two critique form prototypes were developed using a Likert-type and Guttman-type configuration. These were administered in a counterbalanced order to samples of officers, NCO, and airmen enrolled in an ATC technical school. Multiple-factor analyses and multiple discriminant function analyses were performed for the scored responses of the subjects to these critique forms. Test-retest reliability and factorial and discriminative validities were established for each of the prototypes. On the  basis of the statistical analyses of the two forms, the Likert configuration was recommended for further development. Eight Likert factors, or unidimensional scales, were defined: Instructor Competence, Training Management, Specialty Training, Training Impressions, Training Facilities, Repetitious Instruction, Intelligible Media, and Textbook Utility. Because of demonstrated differences between rater groups, it was also recommended that group-specific forms be developed. (Author)",

The participants were 18 elementary classroom teachers, 22 college students, 1 Miller-Unruh teacher, 1 Title I teacher, 4 special education teachers, and a principal. The college students were assigned to one elementary (K-8) school for one semester all day, every school day. They were enrolled for a 3 unit curriculum course. One of the main objectives of the project was to demonstrate that curriculum study and improvement can be effectively accomplished by intensive introspection on the part of a staff for the purpose of explaining and instructing teacher training candidates. Conversely, it was held that the college students in pre-service training would be effectively  trained if their experiences were comprehensive and genuinely related to and included actual teaching. Pre and post evaluations were done using standardized and informal instruments. Results were significant. Other, more subjective evaluations were done on proficiency in the teaching of subjects and skills. These results were also highly positive. It is concluded that institutions that participate in teacher training must be responsible for the exploration and initiation of options for more involved, comprehensive programs. (Author/CK)",

Results indicate that quantity of teacher's verbalization did have a significant  effect on children's test scores. Quality of verbalization appeared to have no effect.

CAM has advantages over typical classroom testing of having well-organized tests, providing course evaluation through pretesting, posttesting, and retention measurement; producing data for continuous classroom instructional management; and being based on a curriculum of behavioral objectives. The systematic gathering of comprehensive performance data permits a means of establishing a dollar-and-cents cost analysis for various instructional and curricular alternatives. The costs of typical classroom testing and CAM are compared. (Author)",

        "description":"The current emphasis on objectives and test item banks for constructing more effective tests is being augmented by increasingly sophisticated computer software. Items can be catalogued in numerous ways for retrieval. The items as well as instructional objectives can be stored and test forms can be selected and printed by the computer. It is also possible to select and retrieve objectives from which a curriculum can be created tailored to personal choice. This paper describes a very flexible item banking computer program and its use with a longitudinal, criterion-referenced testing program called Comprehensive Achievement Monitoring (CAM), capable of both classroom management and curriculum evaluation. The CAM model includes item sampling techniques and several parallel test forms  which would be particularly difficult to develop without the item banking computer programs. (Author)",

Twenty-six of the 38 children were in a total of 12 different classes at these two grade levels. At the conclusion of the program, transported first graders displayed significantly higher average gains than did counterparts who remained in the city school in reading, mathematics, and listening skills. Among second graders, achievement mean gains for the transported group did not differ significantly from those of the counterpart group. Suburban children in classes containing city youngsters displayed no measured detrimental effects on achievement, when compared to similar classes without city children. In  general, year-end affective measures indicated that most groups of students preferred integrated classes that were mostly white, and they also felt these classes were among the smartest.

Comparisons were made in relation to the instructors' employment situation--tenured and non-tenured; to their professional rank--assistant, associate or full professor; and to a combination of both. It was concluded that: 1) Student ratings of instruction seem to be correlated with instructors' academic rank. Associate professors were consistently favored as compared with assistants and full professors; 2) The variable tenure appears to increase differences between academic ranks. When tenured associates were compared with tenured professors, differences between the ranks were greater than when tenured and  non-tenured associates, as a single group, were compared with tenured full professors; 3) The variable non-tenure appears to weaken differences between academic ranks. When assistants (both tenured and non-tenured) were compared with associate professors (both tenured and non-tenured), differences found between the two groups were greater than when only the non-tenured assistant and the non-tenured associate professors were compared; 4) The variable tenure, as compared with academic rank, may contribute more to discrimination between instructors, as rated by students.

The effects of ability grouping on the interaction in the classroom was measured with use of Flanders Interaction Analysis. Two history teachers with identical grades and phases were used in this study which began in the Fall of 1970 and ended that January. Each teacher's ability groups were observed twice during the semester, once at the beginning of the year and once near the end of the term. Darwin's Chi Square and graphic representations of frequency counts were used to measure differences between the two teachers and within their own ability groups. Preliminary results show that the upper phases tend to receive more empathy, praise and use of  their ideas and less direction and criticism than the lower phases according to the Flanders Interaction Analysis system. The two teachers also tend to teach their lower phases in a similar manner. (Author/AG)",

The verbal and nonverbal batteries of an I.Q. test were administered to 860 sixth graders on three occasions with two-month and four-month intervals between testing sessions. Some students received the same form of the test each time they were tested while others received alternate forms of the test. The results indicated that the subjects did experience an increase in verbal mean I.Q. In the nonverbal results, only groups retested with the same form of the test experienced significant mean gains. The verbal mean gains appeared to result from a practice  effect while the nonverbal results appeared to result from students remembering specific items from one testing session to the next.

This paper extends earlier work on parallel curves to curves with the same shape. Some examples are given more or less explicitly. A generalization is used to show that the theory is ordinal and to show how the theory may be applied to measure sensation. The problem of actually transforming curves into curves with the same shape is reduced to the problem of rendering another set of curves parallel. Connections with groups and rings are developed to place the work in a familiar context. These connections and the earlier work on parallel curves are used to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of transformations, to study the uniqueness of  transformations and to show how transformations can be calculated.

First, exact probabilities of success conditional upon a certain brief history of stimulation are determined. Second, possible states of the organism during the experiment are defined and a transition matrix for those states determined, permitting prediction over all possible numbers of trials. Third, Fisher's generalizations and corrections of the Trabasso and Bower focus sample theory are examined. A general solution for the conditional probability of success is derived from Fisher's equation for the probability of n successes between any two errors. One very strong implication of the theory is given in Section 5. (Author)",

Results of the analysis show: (1) the test is somewhat more speeded for fee-free candidates than for regular candidates, (2) reducing the amount of speededness produces higher scores for both regular (22 scaled score points) and fee-free (33 scaled score points) center candidates, and (3) reducing speededness is not more beneficial (in terms of increasing the number of items answered correctly) to fee-free than  to regular center candidates.

Standard scores, percentiles, norms, standard deviations and other elements of measurement can assist the educative process or degenerate into mechanical crutches. There is general consensus among most educators that learning is a multifactor experience involving, among other elements, the factor of environmental influences. Various studies have illustrated the effect of environment upon the academic achievement of youth and adults from racial minorities, especially those who reside in poverty communities. Educators who depend upon so-called measures of academic aptitude perform a disservice to students from racial minorities. Not only do these students become educationally crippled by this kind of  single-factor decision making, but society also loses the talents of individuals whose potentials are too complex to accurately determine by scores obtained on tests of academic aptitude and achievement. Students from racial minorities could benefit more from diagnostic examinations which will assist them in analyzing and eliminating their learning difficulties. Instruments of this nature could become significant factors in the educational and career progress of people who have been economically and culturally deprived. (Author/CK)",

One group of judges then educed rules to discriminate between the more stable and the less stable items, and a second group judged the conformity of each item to the seven educed rules. Intercorrelations were computed among the rule conformity indices, Probable Response Stability scale ratings, and the obtained stability indices. Although three of the rules were significantly related to item stability, using them to compute multiple correlations did not enhance prediction of stability compared with  application of the ratings alone. Practical implications for optimizing biographical item stability and improving a priori prediction of response stability in future research are discussed. (Author/AG)",

On both tasks the individual decisions of the Ugandans were more conservative, supporting the premise that Ugandan students are less favorably disposed to risk taking than are the U. S. students. For the Ugandan sample, group discussions produced no evidence of a risky shift. For the U. S. sample, there was evidence of a risky shift, but not to the extent reported by other investigators.

Three basic steps were proposed to analyze data from approximately200 Black children. These steps were: l) operational (content) analysis of two free response measures, resulting in a coder's manual, 2) tests of reliability of the measure, 3) tests of the validity of the measure. Procedures included establishment of coder reliability, test homogeneity and stability; determination of discriminant validity, predictive validity, and experimental validity of the new test. Results indicate that the measure meets criteria which make it useful for experimental purposes and has comparable reliability and validity to other free  response measures of motivation. It is significantly related to verbal measures of academic achievement independent of intelligence. The amount of significant variance accounted for is small. Classroom motivation training units were strikingly reflected in the measure demonstrating its validity experimentally. (Author/CK)",

The dropout count carried out revealed a rate of 71.2 percent for Puerto Rican pupils who had received a substantial portion of their education in the North American continent. Eighth graders, freshmen, and seniors still in school who were examined for motivations too, demonstrated that they had problems of self concept caused by discrimination, difficulty in relating to their parents, and a progressive estrangement of pupil from school. Schools were found to have very little influence in increasing the stay-in rate: they did little to improve student self image or cultural identity.  Further, students' reading habits, commitment to doing homework, and future aspirations decreased the longer they stayed in school. Knowledge of English was greater among dropouts than among seniors staying in school; these seniors knew more Spanish than dropouts. All groups lacked courses in Puerto Rican culture, and 80 percent of them desired such courses. Families played no role in the running of schools, nor were there many spanish teachers in the schools. Both these factors when present and operant were proven to substantially reduce the dropout rate. (Author/RJ)",

The ninth  graders had significantly higher IQ scores; they were also found to be higher than seventh graders in playing hooky, hooky being not associated with dropping out. Among the findings were: (1) an association of demographic characteristics of the mother with aspects of masculine identification and cognitive style, while father-related characteristics were tied up with social status; (2) self concept seemed to be significantly related to variables indicative of lack of ability or desire to change; and, (3) first job choices are more likely to be related to aspirations rather than to &quot;real&quot; expectations.

All proposed programs were reviewed by a summer planning committee and assigned different levels of priority. Programs determined to be of first priority were approved for funding. These programs were directed by the following operating departments: Elementary Education, Junior-Senior High School, Vocational Education, Model School Division, Pupil Personnel Services, and Urban Service Corps. In order to carry out the evaluation,  data were gathered within the framework of a non-statistical model. This information included: background and demographic data; purpose of program; objectives; description and procedures; results; major strengths; problems encountered; and, recommendations. Virtually all Project Directors reported serious limitations in recruitment of students and staff and problems in over-all program planning and design. The delay in the initial approval of the programs was a result of the time at which the funds became available. Every effort should be made to move the funding date to a point earlier in the school year. (Author/JM)",

The project filled the need for a youth organization, a youth clearinghouse, and more aid to delinquent and predelinquent youth to redirect them into ways of thinking and acting beneficial both to themselves and to the community. The objectives of the program were to provide supplemental effort in attacking conditions which interfere with a child's educational growth--those conditions being underachievement, social, cultural, and nutritional disadvantagement, and health deficiencies. Program areas included were music, arts and crafts, sports, health, cosmotology, business, hobbies, field trips, and parties. Both professionals and volunteers comprised the staff including members of the East Chicago  police and fire departments. Those working with the program submit that the Junior Police members have been involved in fewer incidents of delinquency than non-members. (Author/CB)",

The Institute sought to further its education program to meet the increasing demand for materials, activities, and resources dealing with the cultural and historical backgrounds of the Afro-American people in Africa and America. The goal was to replace myths and misconceptions of the past with accurate information. A one-week seminar approach was used, consisting of: (1) lectures by the Museum/Institute staff at four high schools; and, (2) an experimental curriculum in English and social studies at one high school by classroom teachers. The Title III component of the 1969-70 program concentrated on  staff development. Through the use of interviews and questionnaires, the members of the evaluation team presented nineteen findings concerning methods, procedures, and effects on the teachers and students. Three major problems were reported: objectives were not fully met for lack of prior teacher training and time for curriculum presentation; an attempt was made to cover too much subject matter and material beyond the Institute's focus; and, there was lack of objectivity in lecturers' presentations. Recommendations were made in light of these problems. The evaluators suggest further expansion of the project. (Author/CB)",

Manpower needs for more than 150 occupational categories were computed by making estimates by industry and occupation for 1960 and 1968 and projections for 1975. Over the 7-year period from 1968-1975, 1.4 million new jobs will be created and 1.3 million will be open because of individuals leaving the labor force in California. About 60 percent of the State's total manpower needs will be for white collar workers. There will be openings for 535,000 professional and technical workers, 580,000 clerical workers, 325,000 craftsmen, and 390,000 service workers. White collar and service jobs will increase at a faster rate than  blue collar jobs, and by 1975, it is anticipated that professional and technical, clerical, and service jobs will account for one-half of the State's employment. The guide contains 79 occupational briefs of the numerically largest categories (representing 95 percent of the State's manpower needs), each listing a job outlook, representative job titles from the &quot;Dictionary of Occupational Titles,&quot; opportunities for special worker groups, and titles of any related &quot;California Occupational Guides.&quot; (BC)",

The basic conceptual tool used to measure skill demands was the skill profile, a study of the distribution of total manhours required to produce a unit product (or service) along a scale of the least to the most highly skilled labor. The study found that there was little or no net overall tendency for the mean skill level of the workforce to increase with technological change. Small changes in mean skill were largely offset by larger overall productivity increases, and thus, decreases in absolute  demand measured in manhours per unit of production for specific skill brackets were more prevalent than increases. Declines in absolute labor demand were greatest for semiskilled workers and the next greatest declines were for laborers. Skilled workers were the least affected. A bibliography, charts, and tables used to develop the skill profiles are appended. (BC)",

Most teenage students worked at part-time jobs; 80 percent worked less than 35 hours a week, and 40 percent less than 15 hours. The typical nonstudent worked a full 40-hour week. Three quarters of the males were employed in blue collar jobs, and over half the nonstudent women were in clerical and sales jobs. Striking occupational progress was made by out-of-school nonwhite girls 16 to 21 years old during the years 1964-1968, when the proportion of nonwhite girls in white collar work doubled. The number of school age workers made up  a greater proportion of the unemployed than in 1960. In October 1968, half of the 2.5 million unemployed were under 25 years of age compared with 40 percent of the 2.8 million unemployed in 1960. Thus, in spite of numerous employment programs for youth, unemployment rates only declined from 9.5 percent in 1960 to 8 percent in 1968. (BC)",

In 1955, the Household Food Consumption Survey found that all families spent one-third of their annual income on food, regardless of place of residence and income level, and farmers produced about 40 percent of the food consumed on their farms. On this basis, the poverty income level for farm families was designated at $1,800. In 1969, this was adjusted to 30 percent, and the farm poverty income cutoff was $2,100. This method for setting the poverty level tends to discriminate against the poor, and many are above poverty level by definition only. The 30 percent farm differential is outdated because other costs besides food  are likely to be the same as or greater than in the city. Using the 70 percent level, 29.9 million people in both farm and nonfarm areas were in the poverty category. If this level were shifted to 85 percent, an additional 700,000 rural people in poverty would be included in the national total. (BC)",

In the three-dimensional framework, total output (Y) of all final goods and services produced in the economy during one specified time period is treated as a function of three inputs, capital (K), labor (L), and natural resources (R). Because the framework contains only four variables, an entire economy can be theoretically analyzed. Thus, to demonstrate how the need for human skill and knowledge is generated, an analysis of economic development reveals that as more complex forms of non-human capital are required, more  human capital is also required. The demand for human skill and knowledge is largely a function of factor disproportions among the basic inputs, K, L, and R which generate certain basic forces. (SB)",

The rationale for this study was: (1) identification of specific tasks is vital to effective training, (2) the decision-making function is critical, (3) it is possible to construct job aids and training which will allow the repairman to rely primarily on the decision-making mechanism of identification, and (4) troubleshooting information can be separated for storage in a job aid or in the individual. An analysis of existing electronic communication equipment was conducted, then the information was placed in job aids and used to develop a training program. The course was developed for 420 academic hours as compared to the  standard of 856 hours for the conventional course. After 22 hours of testing over a 6-day period, it was concluded that there was no significant difference between the two groups and that the training and job aids provide an effective program method.

This amount was sufficient for states to keep their Research Coordinating Units (RCU's) functioning, but provided very little for new research. The main activities of the RCU's were to disseminate results of research, answer inquiries, assist in the use of ERIC materials, assist in the preparation of proposals, assist in state program planning and development, and conduct research studies when monies were available. Evaluation studies were conducted by 13 RCU's. Thirteen states reported studies for the implementation of guidance systems or curriculum development, and 10 states reported research projects directed at problems of the  disadvantaged and handicapped. Seminars and educational personnel development were frequently noted as research-related activities. This document contains summaries of quarterly reports from all 50 states. (GEB)",

This study finds evidence that labor market adjustments and population changes are major factors. The labor market distortions of World War II induced the northward migration of many unskilled blacks, who were later displaced by white farm workers when technological change forced many workers out of agriculture. Decentralization of manufacturing and migration to the suburbs further isolated urban blacks from employment opportunities. Compounded by a Negro population explosion, the employment problems of young blacks are expected to continue or even  worsen. A review of existing poverty and employment programs points out the need for a comprehensive policy of manpower development without reliance on any single policy. (BH)",

Some findings were: (1) Married women are less likely to be in the labor force as their level of family income goes up, (2) The presence of a pre-school child is a very strong deterrent to the mother's labor force participation, (3) For the youngest group of married women the region  of residence is not a significant influence, but for older women it becomes increasingly significant, and (4) A wife is much more likely to be in the labor force if the husband is unemployed than if he is employed.

The barriers are still high against employing women in professions other than those traditionally associated with women, and many of the myths regarding women's ability to hold administrative and managerial positions still prevail. The growing share of jobs held by women in the lower paying occupations in recent years is reflected in the gap between the median earnings of women and men. In 1957, the median wage or salary income of women who worked 35 hours or more a  week for 50 to 52 weeks was 64 percent of that received by men.
