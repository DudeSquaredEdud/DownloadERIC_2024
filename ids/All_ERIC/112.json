        "description":"The interaction between changing student populations and the study-lounge facilities provided for their extracurricular higher educational experiences is considered. Trends indicate that increasing numbers of students are commuting to the college campus and that: the commuting student lifestyle can be characterized by multiplicity of roles; commuting students can best be characterized by their heterogeneity, a factor that mandates a multi-faceted approach to planning; time on campus and for higher education is limited; and the commuting student experience of the college or university has some common elements, including the food service, library, and bookstore. Two important considerations in planning for public space are the apparent need for personal space and individual  territory. Research has indicated characteristics of study space that are important to student comfort and concentration. It is suggested that the study-lounge serves a multiplicity of functions for the commuting students, a factor that has implications for the design of multiple use space. The commuting student frequently needs space (for study, conversation, quick meals) in close proximity to classrooms; therefore, the study-lounge should be located on an established traffic pattern. In design preparation, three types of data need to be gathered: identifying the most frequently occurring activities, the relationships among the activities, and the requirements for their performance. Two examples of the application of this design process are described. (SW)",

        "description":"Views on sources of stress on college faculty and strategies for its management were obtained at small-group sessions in the 1980 faculty orientation at Prince George's Community College, Maryland. Sixteen faculty groups generated 218 responses expressing sources of job stress, a complete listing of which is appended. The responses were aggregated into the following four categories: academic affairs or faculty-associated problems, student affairs or student-associated problems, business affairs or fiscally-related problems, and college-wide or miscellaneous problems. Concerns included the following: time pressures or constraints related to the functioning of the college bureaucracy (nonteaching duties, the evaluation process); dissatisfaction with support for the faculty  (marketing and retention pressures, not enforcing prerequisites); concerns about wages and contracts and physical plant operations; and not being involved in college decision-making. Stress management responses were also analyzed in the same four categories, and the distribution of problem-solving perceptions among groups was also checked. A list of the strategies is appended. Additionally, possible organizational responses to professional burnout were classified into the following four approaches: the authoritarian-moral approach, the clinical approach, the training approach, and the systems approach. It is suggested that a useful approach to analyzing organizational behavior is the diagnostic matrix, which is appended. This approach permits analysis into who is contributing to what  (membership and institutional product), and how they are doing it (control). (SW)",

Management of research, grants, and contracts is a process that involves the review and approval of proposals; project coordination; the implementation matters of facilities and equipment, personnel, and overhead; and matters related to the monitoring and evaluation of contract obligations. Sponsored research includes all forms of organized inquiry that are separately budgeted with the financial accounting system of the institution. Faculty research grants are awards usually made and/or administered by an institution's research committee, and the intent is to  serve as a stimulus for the development of a sponsored research proposal. Three prevalent forms of administrative organization for research, grants, and contracts are: separate foundation or corporation, decentralization, and centralized services. A list of suggested activities for an office of sponsored programs, and a list of matters that could be addressed in policy statements to guide research, grants, and contracts activities are presented.

        "description":"Faculty consistency is defined as a faculty member's educational background and professional activity being in the same department as the department of teaching appointment. Data on full-time teaching faculty at research and doctoral-granting universities holding a single appointment in the departments of chemistry, physics, political science, and sociology from the 1972-73 American Council on Education faculty survey were analyzed for this factor. A total of 2560 faculty members were included. Sixteen measures relating to undergraduate teaching goals and six relating to research activity were extracted from the data. It was found that consistent faculty have teaching goals primarily concerned with discipline (subject-area) matters; inconsistent faculty have goals more closely  related to general preparation for life. Consistent faculty tended to have greater research productivity. Further research on the concept and existence of faculty consistency as a distinguishing faculty characteristic is recommended, especially as it relates to departmental prestige, job satisfaction, perceptions of departmental goals, and promotion and tenure decisions.

        "author":["Smith, Donald H."],
        "description":"A study of admission and retention problems for black undergraduate students in seven predominantly white universities was commissioned to identify the principal problems, propose program alternatives to promote retention and graduation, and make recommendations about the responsibilities of the institutions in assuring access and graduation opportunities. Private and public universities were chosen in four major U.S. regions: South, East, Midwest, and West. Administrators, faculty, and black students (including leaders of black organizations) were interviewed. Interviews covered such areas as admissions and attrition, the social and academic milieus, race relations, and relations with black faculty and administrators. Results of interviews and questionnaire responses indicate  that poor academic preparation in secondary schools is the main barrier to access to higher education in these institutions, yet several of them are considering raising entrance requirements. A tendency was found in two private universities to accept only the most \"socially acceptable\" black students, excluding the economically disadvantaged. Attrition rates vary significantly among the institutions studied, but at all of them attrition appears to be rooted in the poor quality of black student life, characterized by hostility toward blacks. Conflicting messages from policy and practice are felt by these students, and similar conflicts are felt among black students themselves. Students feel black administrators are not sufficiently concerned with their welfare. Substantial changes in  admission, recruitment, financial aid, academic assistance, orientation, counseling, and student life policies and practices are recommended to support the black student community and interactions with whites. Appended is a list of further resources. (MSE)",

A stratified sample of 760 insitutions was used, excluding major research universities. Information was requested on basic finance data, dormitory occupancy rates, occurrence of institutional loan defaults or moratoria, and selected faculty and student information. The response rate was 68 percent. Responses were statistically adjusted to represent the eligible national population of 2,508 institutions. Data are for the academic years 1974-75, 1976-77, and 1978-79. A series of financial indicators (ratios) were developed to use these and other data. They treat two basic types of resources: financial (relating to the value of  available assets), and nonfinancial (faculty, students, administrators, and physical plant). The trends assessed are in current fund ratios, ratio of available fund balance to operating expenses, ratio of fixed commitments to revenues, and ratio of salaries and wages to total expenditures. Trends are shown for institution type and sector. Appended are the survey instrument, methodology notes, and notes on survey estimate reliability. (MSE)",

It is shown that what progress had been made for this population in graduate and professional education had run its course by 1975. In recent years the proportions, and in some cases the numbers, of black graduate students have fallen considerably, continuing into the academic year 1979-80. In master's degrees the drop in awards has been more severe than for the rest of the population. High-growth fields were agriculture, business and management, computer science, health professions, and public affairs. In doctorates there was slight progress for blacks nationally. High growth fields were architecture, fine arts, health professions, public affairs, theology, and  interdisciplinary studies. Data on first-professional degrees, not available by field, show a net increase in awards for blacks of only half the national figure. The data are analyzed in detail and arrayed in tables in the final report.

        "description":"The sharing of authority after collective bargaining is initiated in higher education institutions is addressed. Seven issues at the center of power struggle within organized institutions are looked at: long-range planning, retrenchment, promotion, appointment, nonrenewal, tenure, and management rights. An analysis of two-thirds of the bargaining contracts negotiated in American colleges and universities as of July 1979 was undertaken, for a total of 205 contracts. Some interviews were done to check and support the information derived from the contracts. Only modest inroads were found into administrative and personnel decisions and assertion of management rights by faculty. Faculty had difficulty moving beyond the traditional concerns of their craft through bargaining. Size and  region of the institution were found to be associated with strong assertion of rights. Differing reputations of bargaining agents seem to mask considerable variation in actual performance. Relationships in the two-year sector seemed more polarized than in the four-year colleges. Special sections are devoted to the more complex issues of states with extensive higher education bargaining and of managerial attitudes and strategies toward sharing authority. Faculty collective bargaining is likened to the craft union model of bargaining, and the implications of this model for the future of faculty bargaining are outlined. Appended are notes on the variables and statistical analyses, a list of institutions, a list of bargaining agents, and a bibliography. (MSE)",

Activities range from early identification of promising students to provision of continuing education for practicing professionals. A committee developed the University of Missouri at Kansas City (UMKC) School of Medicine's Summer Scholars Program, focusing on two priorities: student identification and selection, and curriculum development. Five program objectives were determined: (1) to help students solidify decisions to enter the health professions; (2) where  appropriate, to encourage students to pursue careers at the UMKC School of Health Sciences; (3) to help develop academic study skills, interpersonal and communication skills, and interview skills needed to enroll in and successfully complete educational programs; (4) to provide realistic information about education requirements; and (5) to provide experiences to clarify perceptions of career roles. The curriculum includes learning and interview skills and introductions to the fields of nutrition, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, child health care, dentistry, the emergency room, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, radiology, support services, and surgery. The program was introduced in July 1980. Student reactions to the program, recorded in student logs and by survey, were very positive, although  some felt that certain program elements were repetitive and could have been more tightly scheduled or focused.

An underlying assumption was that high school counselors may be discouraging students from choosing business majors, in favor of liberal arts preparation for college. The hypothesis that high school accounting majors are underachievers was rejected; in the analysis, these students were found to perform better in college accounting. Recommendations for the high school and college include these: (1) that additional materials be used to stimulate self-paced learning; (2) that high school counselors be made aware of these results and aware that they should not discourage high school business  majors; (3) that college accounting faculty do more to accommodate different student capabilities and backgrounds; and (4) that college students be given more experience in self-paced instruction.

        "description":"The history of instructional television, the development of the telecourse concept, current uses of instructional television, economic factors, and cooperative arrangements are considered. After the initial approach of presenting a professor lecturing as if before a class, producers of instructional television began to dramatize the subject, adopt a documentary format, and eventually, develop the telecourse concept. Telecourses combine often-sophisticated television programs with related printed materials. Telecourses are either produced for instruction or produced originally for a general audience but have suitable content and quality for instructional purposes. Currently, colleges and universities make extensive use of on-campus, closed-circuit television systems for  instruction; however, few direct substantial effort to broadcasting instructional television to off-campus audiences. Some barriers to greater use of instructional television by four-year institutions are identified. The following developments in video technology are covered: satellite transmission systems, cable television systems, narrowcast technology, instructional television fixed service, and videocassettes and videodiscs. It is suggested that 70 percent of the costs of instructional television are associated with acquiring and modifying the instructional materials and providing programs, while 30 percent of the total costs are for institutional support services. Consortia are a means to produce high-quality programs or to arrange for more efficient use of available telecourses.

        "description":"Literature concerning the relationship between higher education and politics is reviewed. Attention is directed to federal, state, and local levels of government and to institutional politics. Federal involvement in higher education, governmental regulation, higher education lobbying, and the emergence of the new Department of Education are addressed, along with statewide coordination, accountability and autonomy, budgeting, interinstitutional relationships, and institutional politics and the community college. Although the review encompasses essentially the decade of the 1970s, it extends to several earlier and significant efforts. The politics of higher education as a field of inquiry is also considered by highlighting theoretical and empirical works that are part of the  literature; by identifying concepts and theories from political science and public administration, other social sciences, and the general politics of education literature; and by suggesting future avenues for conceptual development as well as needed research. It is suggested that the involvement of the federal government in higher education has been indirect, occurring primarily through fiscal support to students, specific programs, and academic research. The federal interest in higher education is both fiscal and regulatory. In contrast, the state governments have a direct, multifaceted relationship with colleges and universities. Coordinating agencies, which conduct statewide planning, occupy a critical position in the relationship between government and higher education. The literature  reflects increased recognition of academic institutions as political organizations. A bibliography is included. (SW)",

        "description":"The applicability of a factor analytic approach to explore the nature of a complex job performance criterion for nursing practice and to determine the dimensions of this criterion was investigated. A national sample of 1,038 nurse educators from 85 randomly selected programs judged performance criteria contained in the Clinical Nursing Rating Scale and the Nurses' Professional Orientation Scale. A common factor analysis was conducted to identify dimensions of nursing practice underlying the scales. Internal consistency estimates and item-total subscale score correlations were calculated to examine stability of item groupings across a sample from the same population. A nested design multiple analysis of variance was used to investigate whether the mean subscale scores differed  among faculty members from the three types of nursing educational programs (diploma, associate degree, and baccalaureate). Four stable factors emerged. Factor I represented an interpersonal dimension. Misconceptions and myths about nursing loaded on Factor II. Factor III represented a cognitive-leadership component, and Factor IV represented dependent nursing functions. Internal consistency for these subscales using coefficient alpha ranged from .81 to .91. Item-subscale correlations consistently were highest for the subscale on which the item loaded. Faculty from the three types of nursing educational programs did not differ. Appended materials include a bibliography, sample items from the rating scales, and information on characteristics of participating nursing faculty members.  (Author/SW)",

        "description":"Equity in the institutional choices of enrolling college students was assessed. The focus of study was whether students similar in educationally relevant characteristics, but dissimilar in ascriptive or socioeconomic background characteristics, attend similar institutions at similar rates. The study was based on multiple regression analysis of comprehensive student survey and college attendance data. A random sample of 5,211 students from a nationally representative sample of 1975 college freshmen was studied. The results suggest that aside from the predictable role of the educationally relevant factors (ability, achievement, involvement, and aspirations) a significant limiting role in the nature of institutional choice is played by socioeconomic background factors. Specifically,  lower parental education, lower parental income, and greater family size all tended to limit the student body quality (selectivity), opportunity structure (prestige), resource availability, and cost of the institutions chosen by the 1975 student sample. The net influences of the ascriptive factors of race, ethnicity, and sex were more mixed. The results suggest that the inequity in the college choice process, from a meritocratic perspective, lies largely in class-related factors rather than in ascriptive factors. Lower parental social and economic resources appear to limit significantly the nature of the college experiences of offspring. A bibliography is appended. (SW)",

        "description":"The extent to which college-related changes in personality functioning persisted between college graduation and 10 years later was studied, and developmental patterns common to 18- and 32-year-old college-educated persons were identified. The relationship between various demographic characteristics linked either empirically or theoretically to personality development in the young adult years was also addressed. An Alumni Questionnaire (AQ) and the Omnibus Personality Inventory (OPI) were administered to a sample of 1970 graduates of Luther College. The 200 respondents had completed the OPI prior to the freshman year and in the senior year. The findings seemed to indicate that many of the changes in personality functioning associated with college tend to backslide 10 years after  graduation, and that the developmental patterns of young adults differ appreciably. The results indicate that not all of the respondents evidenced increases of those dimensions on which development is expected to occur during college (e.g., aestheticism, integrative maturity). The degree to which college-related changes in personality functioning are maintained seem to be related to the post-college environment. Respondents who were working in the professions were less likely to backslide following graduation. The differences among respondents' patterns of personality functioning during and after college were not easily explained by biographical variables. The results support the premise that development occurs in various dimensions at differential rates over the life span.  (SW)",

The first activity was designed to help students shift from conversational language to formal speech by means of an oral book report. When the students reached the second course, they could compose with smoothness and self-confidence. The second activity was designed to help students \"engage\" with the text by analyzing a troublesome workbook page and then composing a letter to the publisher explaining the problems and suggesting improvements. The students became more critical readers and  thinkers about their reading strategies. The third activity was designed to help students learn summary skills in reading. The students read articles from a reading journal, summarized the article from the persona of the author, then wrote expository letters to the author. Students became more knowledgeable about the skills needed for better comprehension, and about their specific reading problems. (HTH)",

The difference was not significant at the sixth grade level, but was highly significant at the twelfth grade level. The majority of students disagreed with the statement that there is nothing to be gained from reading books. There was stronger disagreement for girls than for boys at the twelfth grade level, but not at the sixth. Thus, there is a trend toward thinking that  something can be gained from reading books and this is more prevalent among girls than boys. Girls consistently had a more positive attitude toward using their spare time to read than boys, and the difference is greater at the twelfth grade level than at the sixth. Overall, the sex difference was greater at the twelfth grade level than at the sixth grade level, indicating that boys' attitudes become more negative and girls' become more positive. (HTH)",

Because of the dominance of deliberate memory strategies in training research, the paper begins with a brief consideration of such literature, then proceeds to discuss training aimed at bringing students to understand the significance of learning strategies, particularly in relation to school tasks such as studying texts. Reviewing studies on learning strategies, the paper points out that strategies that do not appraise the utility of their action fail to inculcate necessary student self-awareness, whereas students informed of the outcome of their action and instructed in self-corrective  procedures have been much more successful at securing desirable effects of training. The paper notes that effective learning involves a tetrahedral model with four main considerations: (1) the activities engaged in by the learner; (2) characteristics of the learner, including capacity and state of prior knowledge; (3) the nature of the materials to be learned (pictures, stories, expository texts, maps); and (4) the criterial task (rote recall, gist recall, noting inconsistencies, following instructions). The paper concludes that attending to these considerations will make students more effective learners. (RL)",

The results revealed that recall of story information was enhanced by the use of the story structure questioning strategy. (FL)",

        "description":"A study examined the efficacy of using various types of worksheets (representative of those typically used in instruction) that had been specifically designed to elicit differing achievement effects and to promote cognitive processing at the semantic level. Fifth grade students from five classrooms were divided into groups of high, middle, and low reading levels and were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups, each based on worksheet type. The worksheet types were intended to reflect levels within various taxonomies of cognitive skills. Specifically, they were (1) those designed to elicit recall of factual information or details (\"drill\"); (2) those designed to promote application, analysis, synthesis, or evaluation of factual lesson material (\"comprehension\"); and  (3) those requiring the student to locate and write main ideas appearing in the text (\"structuring\"). Following a week of instruction, the students were administered an achievement posttest. Results showed that high level readers in the drill and comprehension groups performed better on recall test items than did high level readers in the structuring group, high level readers in the drill group outperformed high level readers in the comprehension and structuring groups on comprehension items, and low level readers in the drill and comprehension groups performed better on recall items than did low level readers in the comprehension group. Overall, the findings for treatment were nonsignificant. (FL)",

The study involved 14 classes, 39 reading groups, and 277 students. The number of reading groups in each class varied from two to four, and the number of students in each reading group varied from four to thirteen. Classroom observers recorded academic interactions between teacher and student that were initiated by the teacher. The results showed that teachers used more nonvolunteer selection, preselection, and volunteer selection in lower ability reading groups than in higher ability groups. In addition, even  though students in lower ability groups were reading on a lower level and answering more questions incorrectly than their peers in higher achieving groups, teachers praised them more often. Overall, teachers appeared to accommodate their behavior to the ability level of the reading group; however no significant relationship was found between teacher behaviors and student achievement.

The tapes were coded using the Feedback to Oral Reading Miscue Analysis System (FORMAS) taxonomy. After the tapes had been coded, each teacher was administered the TORP and the PI instruments. Interviews were also conducted with 14 of the teachers, during which each was asked to view and comment  on his or her taped performance. The findings suggest that for most teachers there was no strong relationship between beliefs and behaviors. The results also brought into question the notion that teacher beliefs can be assessed through a paper and pencil task. Teachers' responses to interview questions suggested that their beliefs were situational and related in complex ways to the context of instruction. (FL)",

When comparisons were based on summary profiles of the two types of observations, there was overall agreement between the two data sources, especially with regard to the teachers' tendency to deal with different units of students (individuals, small groups, and whole classrooms) and how much  observed time was spent on academic versus behavioral matters. Slight elevations in such affective behaviors as criticism or punishment were found to affect the narrative data much more heavily than the quantitative data. In general, when the teacher's behavior in the classroom was consistent, the qualitative and quantitative profiles showed good agreement. When the pattern of teacher behavior was less clear, the narrative data provided invaluable information regarding the presence of unusual classroom activities or the absence of expected ones. (RL)",

Four classes totaling 58 students were randomly divided into an experimental and a control group. The experimental group used the talk-write method, a prewriting activity in which pairs of students talk over their writing plans with one another, while the control group received instruction in grammar, punctuation, and outlining. All students then wrote narrative, descriptive, expository, and argumentative essays, which were independently evaluated to find differences in the mean scores for each group. The papers were  judged on 12 measures falling into the areas of general merit, mechanics, and total evaluation. The results revealed significant differences favoring the experimental group. The talk-write method produced statistically significant positive effects on students' performance in writing for eight out of the twelve measures considered, with the area of general merit benefiting the most.

Because a review of the literature revealed that previous studies on the subject had been inconclusive regarding the effect of particular comments on student writing, the case study method was used to explore the effect of comments on the writing of four college freshmen enrolled in a required, year-long, expository writing course. Teacher comments were identified as two major types, explicit and implicit, with each type operating at four levels--structural, conceptual, lexical, and sequential. Students' reactions to comments on their papers were tape  recorded and categorized, and their actions in rewriting their final drafts were classified. Patterns of student responses and reactions to particular categories of comments were charted and analyzed. Results indicated that students responded favorably to explicit comments on conceptual and structural levels and unfavorably to implicit comments on lexical and sentential levels. The findings suggest that teachers should try to write comments in a positive and empathic manner, to be aware of the intentions of student writers, ascertain the effects of their comments, and move away from the role of evaluator and toward establishing a dialogue with their student writers.

First, the curriculum was a logical development springing from deep roots in educational history and English teaching (life adjustment education, the Progressive era, and the academic model of English). Second, the elective curriculum provided a springboard from which the English profession could examine and act upon many basic issues in secondary school learning and teaching such as change and variety, relevance, the viability of the core curriculum concept, and student and teacher interests.  Third, the elective curriculum gave the teacher and student a powerful impetus for instruction and learning--control. Fourth, it was genuinely innovative in that it restructured the traditional curriculum and also paid serious attention to new subjects related to English. Fifth and sixth, while its decline is the \"zeitgeist\" of the times, the curriculum will probably influence English teaching in the future. (A case study of the elective program at Fort Hunt High School, Fairfax County, Virginia, is used as an example of the philosophy used in most elective programs and of the development and decline of elective programs.)

Probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant exists where circumstances, as reported in an underlying affidavit, would cause a reasonably prudent person to believe that the property to be searched is likely to contain the items sought in connection with the related criminal act. However, an affidavit for a search warrant need not  prove guilt in order to establish probable cause. The legal analysis of the &quot;Zurcher v. Stanford Daily&quot; ruling of the Supreme Court suggests that the legal effectiveness of the &quot;Privacy Protection Act of 1980&quot; may be impeded by a magistrate's broad, case-by-case interpretation of probable cause. Probable cause is an element that should be more definitively addressed in federal statutes aimed at providing additional search warrant protection. (HOD)",

This interpretation is based on the assumption that the essential characteristics of the press are thorough, fast, accurate news reporting; enlightened, effective presentation of opinion; entertainment; and press independence and responsibility. It holds that journalism history has been developing continually and inevitably to this ultimate condition. This confidence in developmental progress has accounted for the lack of diversity among historians and has been responsible for most of the major interpretative fallacies. Because of the dominance of the progress interpretation, the study of journalism history has grown stagnant, and because it attempts to explain  journalism history by contemporary conditions, it has created a narrow, superficial, and distorted picture. This view needs to be corrected, and one way to do this is to adopt an interpretation of journalism history that is based on the fact that the press at different periods has served different purposes and that those purposes were a result of the philosophies that have dominated American intellect and culture at different times. Approaching the history of journalism from the perspective of press purposes should help create an understanding of the essential nature of the press, provide new insights, and encourage fresh explanations.

Research questions examined the effect of several variables on local television news prices (advertising rates), including type of ownership, network affiliation/signal type, market size, cable network penetration, market concentration, and market prosperity. It was expected that higher levels of market concentration (making the market less competitive) should lead to higher news prices. Data for the study came from 297 commercial television stations in 105 television markets. The results conformed to theoretical expectations. Specifically, ownership type (group or cross media) had little effect on television news advertising prices; cable network  penetration had a significant negative effect on such prices; and market concentration had a significant positive impact on price. The primary policy recommendations suggested by these results are that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) should continue to pursue procompetitive policies that are most likely to increase the number of television channels from which consumers can choose; and that regulation of the commercial television industry with respect to the FCC's scheme of taxation by regulation (public interest program requirements) must be discontinued as competition is increased.

The system was designed around the toll-free telephone number given in the advertisement, with the receiving operator recording the time of day the order was received, and where the customer had seen the subscription offer. A second data base contained time of day, program environment, and whether the program was local, syndicated, or network. The original application of the system considered the variables of creative execution of the commercial, the length of the subscription term, a bonus gift for incentive, and the effectiveness of other promotional efforts. The  analysis of a ten-week campaign showed that the late morning to prime time period was the best daytime advertising period, and sports programs and movies were the best advertising environments. The smaller though less expensive markets were not cost effective, as were the larger initially more costly ones. The strategy indicated by the system, a fast-paced, hard-hitting commercial for the longer subscription period, was the one adopted by the magazine for its campaign. (HTH)",

        "description":"The impact of news film on children's learning was investigated by presenting 193 fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh grade students with one of two versions of a newscast. The children viewed a videotape of a newscaster introducing film reports of six stories or listened to the newscaster reading the news stories. The children provided responses to questions about their general television exposure, news exposure, how they rated media credibility, why they watched the news, and what they could remember about the stories in the newscast. The results showed that a number of factors were associated with children's learning from a television newscast. The use of film in the one version helped children in both their aided and their unaided recall of the stories, and students  understood more of the stories presented with film than those presented without film. There was a grade-by-film interaction so that film helped understanding in the higher grades more than it did in the lower grades. Despite the advantages of film, large percentages of children, even in the eleventh grade, did not remember or understand important hard news stories presented in the newscast, an indication that news programs for young people need to be presented in a clear and simple manner. The data also indicated that even young children understood the structure of newscasts, realizing that the most important stories were presented first, though they differentiated between importance and their own liking of the stories.

        "description":"A study was conducted at two major midwestern newspapers to ascertain the effects of video display terminal (VDT) use on the work and perceptions of copy editors. The methodology consisted of observation of one full day of copy desk work at a VDT by a single local news desk copy editor and one full day of work at VDTs by a regular weekday shift of copy editors on the national/international news desk, as well as interviews with various editors. Data obtained through the interviews were validated by means of a content analysis of published material from two years before and two years after installation of the electronic system. The major conclusions drawn from the case study were as follows: (1) copy editing was done much the same way with a VDT as with pencil and paper; (2)  adaptation and adjustment time to VDT editing systems by copy editors need not be lengthy; (3) the electronic editing system has contributed to the editing process by reducing routine tasks such as headline and story counting; (4) except during the adjustment period, the electronic editing system did not appear to be a factor in news judgments and decision making behavior for editors; and (5) while accuracy seemed to be enhanced by electronic editing systems, the issue of editing speed remained unresolved.

        "description":"Noting that the success of the Bay Area Writing Project and the National Writing Project derives largely from their involvement of classroom teachers and from collaboration between university professors and those teachers, this paper discusses recent California legislation that places significant power in the hands of teachers in determining staff development programs. The paper views this phenomenon as part of a nationwide shift of responsibility for teacher education from the colleges and universities to the schools themselves. While noting that this change is laudable in many respects, the paper contends that it effectively cuts off teachers from theoretical and research perspectives and from the philosophical, psychological, and historical insights that college professors can  provide. The paper proposes a new model for inservice education based on the ideas of British educator Michael Eraut. It then discusses the model, which identifies the school rather than the school district or the individual teacher as the focal point for educational change and calls for an outside consultant, possibly a college professor, to work in a nondirective way with teachers in identifying needs, setting objectives, delineating resources that can be used for problem solving, determining solutions, implementing them, and evaluating their effectiveness. The paper provides an example in which this model was successfully implemented. (Author/FL)",

        "description":"The Nancy Drew adventure series, a classic girls' favorite for over 50 years, offers less sex role stereotyping and sexist cultural indoctrination than the majority of reading textbooks now used in the elementary school classroom. Textbooks were excluded from the Title IX regulations of the 1972 Education Amendments, and a review of studies conducted since 1969 of elementary school readers reveals the continuation of a strong male sex bias in textbooks. The Nancy Drew series, on the other hand, presents a different perspective. The heroine is a paradox, appearing strong, resourceful, independent, and bold, while at the same time using traditional feminine wiles, relying on her instincts and charm. Although further study of the adventure series identifies a reduction over the  years in the quality of characterization, description, and plot structure, as well as in vocabulary level, the female image in Nancy Drew is preferable to the stereotype found in most classroom reading texts.

Noting that the service is designed for the country's black majority population, the paper points out that it is nonetheless controlled by the white-dominated South African Broadcasting Corporation. Following a brief outline of the history of television in South Africa, the paper discusses the unique problems underlying TV2, such as the possible role it can play as a propaganda vehicle for the existing political order of the nation and the difficulties of broadcasting to a multilingual audience. The paper then examines four possible effects TV2 might have on black society: (1) a complex, differential effect; (2) no effect; (3) the effect of accelerating existing  trends in society and opening new ones; and (4) the effect of narcotizing and then mobilizing society. Of these four effects, the paper holds that the complex, differential effect is the most likely predictor of TV2's impact on black South Africans. (FL)",

        "description":"Patterned after a 1976 study, a study examined voters' decision making during the 1980 campaign for the presidency of the United States. Data from a survey of 183 registered voters indicated that partisan voters were likely to be precommitted to a candidate choice and thus relatively immune to mass mediated campaign effects. However, those voters who made their voting decisions during the campaign varied in communication behaviors, candidate issue and image discrimination, and social structural variables. These voters were of three distinct types--campaign deciders, post-debate deciders (after the Carter/Reagan television debate), and last-minute deciders. Some of the differences across groups of voters, based on the time of their decisions, reflected similarities between this  study and the 1976 study: ideological strength diminishes rapidly by time of decision; people with strong ideological stance, whether liberal or conservative, made up their minds early; and voters with below-average degree of ideological strength made up their minds just before election day. On the other hand, features of the campaign environment in 1980--most notably the candidacy of John Anderson and the timing and presence of a televised debate between the two major candidates--exerted substantial influence on the electorate, thereby distinguishing this study from the 1976 study.

Although differences in the studies' findings were slight, one variation was  noteworthy: while the Columbus study found that the viewing of local television news was negatively related to media knowledge, the Champaign study found no such relationship.

A survey of 784 adolescents was conducted in a southern state to examine the anticipatory consumer socialization effects of such factors as the mass media, school, family, race, and social class on perceptions such as consumer role, occupational aspirations, deferment of consumption gratification, and sex roles. The results suggested that television contributed to the adolescent's development of traditional sex role perceptions regarding household decision making. The data suggested that social class affects youth's occupational aspirations, indicating that upper social class  adolescents have higher aspirations than lower class adolescents. Race was a rather weak predictor of anticipatory consumer socialization, although black adolescents appeared to be less likely to defer consumption gratification that did their white counterparts. The relationship between communication with family about consumption matters and the adolescent's career decision was significant, suggesting that intra-family interactions may provide opportunities for occupational socialization, and lead to the development of expectations regarding the purchase of consumer products.

Almost 42% of the respondents indicated that television was their major source of information about local events and issues, while only 29% preferred newspapers. More women than men used television and more men than women used newspapers as their major source for local information. In the general newscast content categories, the respondents ranked issues first, followed by unexpected events, entertainment, weather, sports,  and banter. The issues category was ranked significantly higher, and banter was ranked significantly lower than the rest. Of those who expressed a preference, the majority preferred a male rather than a female newscaster.

Since 1975, however, the Supreme Court has repeatedly expanded the First Amendment protection accorded to &quot;commercial speech.&quot; The early decisions focused on the rights of individual consumers to receive information on controversial products and services. Subsequent rulings permitted advertising for prescription drugs and professional and legal services. In 1978, the Court specifically affirmed the right of corporations to speak out on controversial  public issues and set down strict guidelines to be used in evaluating any state law or regulation used to restrict corporate freedom of speech. In three rulings, the court recognized the difference between purely commercial speech such as advertising and noncommercial corporate speech such as that used by public relations practitioners. It may still, however, require years of additional court decisions to clearly spell out the rights of corporations under the new rules. (HTH)",

Although 26 states have statutory shield laws enabling reporters to conceal their confidential news sources, even in these states reporters are sometimes called upon to reveal confidential information. On the other hand, in some states without shield laws, the courts have judicially recognized a limited privilege for reporters. The courts in a few states have flatly refused to take even that step. On the federal level, a number of courts have recognized a qualified privilege as a matter of federal common law if not Constitutional law in the years since the United States Supreme Court's &quot;Branzburg&quot; decision in 1972. Although a  comprehensive federal shield law would seem the best way to protect journalists' sources, the Congress has consistently declined to enact such a law. In the meantime, the growing judicial trend is to recognize at least a limited privilege for reporters. While better than no privilege at all, this leaves much to be desired. (RL)",

        "description":"A study explored the relationships between public relations practitioners' organizational roles and the type of evaluation methods they used on the job. Based on factor analysis of role data obtained from an earlier study, four organizational roles were defined and ranked: communication manager, media relations specialist, communication liaison, and communication technician. Twelve measures of evaluation activities were developed from a conceptual model involving scientific (systematic, quantitative) versus \"seat-of-the-pants\" (subjective, individualistic) evaluation methodologies. Data were then collected on the organizational roles and evaluation activities of 169 public relations practitioners in San Diego, California. The communication manager, media relations, and  communication liaison role scores correlated signficiantly with both scientific and \"seat-of-the-pants\" evaluation method scores. The communication technician role score, however, correlated with neither the scientific nor the seat-of-the-pants evaluation method scores. The correlation between income and evaluation activities was significant. It was interpreted that the media relations specialists, who were at the middle management rank, used both evaluation methodologies, but tended to confine scientific evaluation methods to dissemination evaluation.

The first chapter presents an account of the origins and development of the competency testing movement, while the second chapter provides a comprehensive review of the best current research and theory on the acquisition, development, and use of language. The third chapter examines the limitations of various approaches to testing reading ability and then proposes a four-part competency test composed of several test formats. Chapter four outlines a  theory-based procedure for assessing competence, and chapter five explores the problems of assessing media competency. The last chapter discusses the politics of minimum competency. (HTH)",

        "description":"L. L. Guttman's scaling procedures were used to analyze United States Supreme Court decisions concerning the press for the period 1971-1981. Guttman scaling is essentially a means of determining whether a given set of responses is unidimensional, meaning that the responses are part of a single hierarchical continuum. The 44 press cases during the period were arranged from those most favorable to those least favorable to the press, while justices were ranked according to their favorability to the press (their overall record in the 44 cases). The resulting grid formed by the justices' votes on individual cases was 95% within the idealized triangular grid that Guttman scaling is supposed to produce when unidimensionality is evident. The fact that Supreme Court Justices' votes on  press cases can be ordered on a Guttman scale above the 90% criterian is an indication that the decision making process on the Court is somewhat simpler than many analysts have suggested, possibly an indication that the Supreme Court decisions are politically motivated along liberal-conservative dimensions. Coupled with individual justices' voting trends and the increasing trend toward more decisions unfavorable to the press, the scaling data indicate that an antipress bloc on the Supreme Court is gaining strength.

Noting that according to the sociology of occupations professionalism is not a singular concept, the paper posits a model of journalistic professionalization consisting of three dimensions: knowledge, orientation, and structure/organization. It then discusses briefly the knowledge and orientation dimensions and offers an indepth presentation of the structure/organization dimension. The paper concludes that it is essential that journalism should progress on all three dimensions  toward a more complete form of professionalism. (FL)",

        "description":"A study examined the accountability systems for student written work set up and cased by twelve junior high school mathematics teachers. The five dimensions of accountability observed (1) clarity of overall work assignments, (2) procedures for communicating assignments and instructions to students, (3) teacher monitoring of work in progress, (4) routines for checking and turning in work, and (5) regular academic feedback to students. The characteristics of the effective teachers were then compared to those of effective junior high English teachers. Effective math and English teachers were in accord in their treatment of assignment due dates and were remarkably consistent in enforcing their own individual rules. Both effective math and English teachers varied in their methods for  communicating assignments to students, but they were extremely consistent in efficient student monitoring techniques. Effective teachers from both disciplines were also consistent in checking assignments regularly. Two key actions on the part of the more effective teachers in both math and English classes followed the checking period: teachers asked students for their grades and recorded them immediately, and they always collected papers to check themselves, thus holding students accountable for the assignment. (Summaries of accountability systems used by two effective math teachers are appended.) (HTH)",

        "description":"An increasingly popular form of mass media persuasion is the &quot;docudrama,&quot; a hybrid of the informative documentary and the dramatic film. The docudrama format presents viewers with a purposive viewpoint or value-laden interpretation of reality and contains some degree of historical accuracy and factual authenticity. The docudrama also draws heavily from motion picture production techniques, such as narrative structure, camera angle, and sound. A comparison of the television docudrama &quot;Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones&quot; with the dramatic motion picture &quot;Guyana--Cult of the Damned&quot; highlights the differences between these two genres. Docudrama is a form of de-rhetorical speech in that it alters viewers' perceptions of reality, but its distortion of history for dramatic effect  does not observe the ethics of rhetoric. The following question is posed by this evolving genre: At what point does a critic draw the line between &quot;dramatic license&quot; and &quot;historical distortion&quot;? (HTH)",

The first half of the report discusses the background of the study and the development of a computerized language analysis technique--DICTION--and describes the selection of 266 rhetorical samples from the seven presidents and a comparison sample of 389 speeches delivered by corporation executives, social activists, political candidates, and religious leaders. In the second half of the report, the personal aspects of each president's linguistic style are first summarized, then analyzed developmentally through their years in office and situationally according to their political  party, topic, and audience. Preliminary findings reported are that (1) presidential discourse is a somewhat unique rhetorical entity, (2) individual presidents vary considerably from one another on the dimensions studied, and (3) some presidents alter their linguistic styles to accommodate changes in time or rhetorical circumstances, while the linguistic style of others is more habitual. Comparisons of the data are presented in four tables. (AEA)",

A study was undertaken to incorporate a wider range of variables pertinent to both kinds of political communication behaviors to redefine the key processes involved and their effects on political orientations. Data used in the study were derived from a larger study of influences in the 1972 presidential campaign in the United States, including personal interviews conducted with approximately 2,000 adults before the election and more than 200 voters after the election. The results suggested that it might be useful to consider a four-fold typology of political opinion  giving and seeking, one that distinguishes among opinion givers, seekers, sharers, and nondiscussants. The findings showed that opinion sharers exhibited the highest levels of political interest and activity typically associated with opinion leaders, and that mass media served as important sources of information and influence over all of the groups.

        "description":"A study tested the effect of three levels of context (positive, neutral, and negative) on subjects' accuracy in identifying facial expressions of emotion (fear, disgust, anger, sadness, happiness, and surprise). The subjects were 277 female and 69 male teachers enrolled in graduate communication courses. After reading a positive, neutral, or negative context description and then viewing photographs of actors displaying four different negative facial expressions, the subjects selected one of six choices as identifying the portrayed emotion. The positive and negative contextual cues resulted in poorer accuracy for identifying facial expressions. Contrary to expectations, a neutral emotional context proved better than a negative context in facilitating the identification of negative  facial expressions. Apparently, facial expressions are best identified out of context and any contextual cues confuse the meaning of the expression. Thus contextual cues may not act as choice-narrowing cues, as previous researchers have hypothesized, but as choice-widening cues in the interpretation of facial expressions. The results also provided additional support for previously identified male/female differences in identifying nonverbal facial expressions; the female subjects in this study were found to be significantly more accurate than the male subjects in identifying facial expressions.

        "description":"The extent to which human facial expressions are universal and cross-culturally recognizable has been the subject of considerable debate. Two approaches have been used in studies of facial expressions: the judgment approach entails showing examples of facial expressions to various cultures or groups of people and determining whether they interpret a facial expression as signifying the same or a different emotion; the components approach studies whether the actual components of facial expressions shown in two or more cultures are the same or different. Two studies were conducted to determine if accuracy in decoding facial expressions was a function of the number of possible choices provided to the receiver. It was hypothesized that the number of alternative choices of emotions  provided to receivers was inversely related to the accuracy of identifying facial expressions. One hundred eighty-five undergraduate college students were presented with still black-and-white photographs displaying various facial expressions and asked to score them according to five forms that differed in the number of alternative emotions presented to the subjects. Results from both studies supported the hypothesis and suggested that facial expressions are not inherently identifiable but are a function of the choices available to receivers. (HOD)",

Social style was defined as a two-dimensional construct of assertiveness and responsiveness, which combined to reflect four social styles. Five hypotheses predicted that differences in social style would result in different perceptions of versatility, trust, power, credibility, and attraction. Two scales were used and factor analyzed to determine the best factors, which turned out to be supportiveness, sociability, task, and physical attraction. Based on this information, 400 college students were asked to fill out scales tapping the five factors while making references to a friend, an acquaintance, or a coworker. Factor analyses of the  resultant data supported the use of all scales except the sociability dimension of credibility, and all resulting factors achieved acceptable reliability. With type of relationship and social style as independent variables and person perceptions as dependent variables, analyses of variance indicated that social style had a significant impact on all dimensions of person perception and attraction except physical attraction (which was anticipated).

        "description":"The use of many public school facilities now closed due to declining enrollment could generate substantial savings for new federal construction projects. Responses to a questionnaire sent to all 50 states by the General Accounting Office (GAO) show that there were 2,493 vacant schools in 19 of the 23 responding states at the beginning of the 1978-79 school year. Over one third of these were in good condition and located in areas making them suitable for continued use. Enrollment decline projected for the next five years will result in more school closings. While state and local authorities are not required to consider using vacant schools in lieu of new construction when requesting federal grants, use of these facilities is permitted when requirements are met. The GAO believes  that consideration of the use of vacant buildings should be required of grantees requesting construction funds. (Author/PGD)",

        "description":"Awareness of the three analytical perspectives on educational innovation leads to better understanding of educational change processes and better innovation strategies and policies. The three perspectives--technological, political, and cultural--are &quot;screens&quot; of facts, values, and presuppositions through which analysts view innovation. From the technological perspective innovation is conceived of as a mechanistic process based on rational analysis and empirical research. From the political perspective innovation is seen as a set of conflicts and compromises among groups or factions. From the cultural perspective innovation is viewed as interaction among cultures or subcultures, and events are explained in terms of cultural relativism, evolution, or multiculturalism. Analyses  based on these three perspectives differ sharply in their fundamental assumptions about change, in their underlying images of change processes, in their values and ethics, and hence in their focal points for study. The technological perspective focuses on the innovation itself, while the political focuses on the innovation in its power context and the cultural focuses on all aspects of the context. The three perspectives can be combined, however, to explain events (such as resistance to modernization) for which a single perspective is inadequate, permitting formation of more conprehensive and effective innovation policies.

Based on existing definitions, the author identifies the external agent as an individual or group outside the client system whose objective is to help the clients enhance their own functions. An external agent's role depends on the knowledge utilization context, including the location of knowledge generation, the type of knowledge (research or craft), and whether clients use it for decision making, enlightenment, or capacity building. Several factors may affect the agent's impact, among them the agent's personal characteristics, expertise, scope of activity, similarity of status with the client, and  initiative and intensity of outreach, as well as whether the agent consists of a team or an individual. Besides an improved theoretical framework, future research needs include investigation of the contexts, costs, and benefits of external agent use; clients' needs and wants; and agents' skills, characteristics, and strategies.

In a one-year experimental project, MSDE and RBS staff attempted three tasks: identification of common priorities, implementation of pilot activities based on these priorities, and development of long-range plans. Anticipated barriers to collaboration involved resources, external and internal pressures, and motivation and support. Using strategies derived from research findings, the two agencies overcame the barriers and completed the tasks. Successful strategies included task restructuring, flexible planning, control sharing, teaming, participation  of staff from all levels, tapping of individual motivation, and ongoing communication both within and between agencies. A model of interagency collaboration based on the project highlights the interaction of six dimensions, including tasks, resources, interdependence, multidirectional communication, goals, and commitment.

The median voter model assumes that district expenditures are based on the median voter's demand for spending. The agenda control model predicts expenditures on the basis of the budget proposed by the &quot;agenda setter&quot; (usually the school board) and the &quot;reversion level&quot; to which spending falls if a school budget fails. Both these factors interact with voter turnout and income, community size, and the number of elections allowed on one budget. The fiscal illusion model predicts that, insofar as voters lack information on state  or federal grant income to the district, they will not reduce spending in reaction to grand levels. Tests on the Oregon data confirm, first, that school district spending was unaffected by grant levels, indicating much voter illusion; and, second, that school boards or other agenda setters seemed to be using the threat of reversion-level closures to increase expenditures beyond the voters' desires.

One model focuses upon the differences between effective and ineffective schools and the other provides a basis for examining alternative policies for transforming ineffective schools into effective ones. Effective schools provide instruction that is appropriate and increasingly intense for low-achieving students in order to improve academic achievement. In ineffective schools, instruction is most appropriate and intense for students already achieving at or above their grade level. The first-stage  model, which supports the notion that as a school improves achievement through improved instruction, it can also, over time, improve student motivation, provides a basis for developing a second-stage model intended to examine the interactions and feedback patterns affecting the expectations that in turn affect instructional responses to low achievement. Schools that are moving toward effectiveness are characterized by rising expectations for low achievers, strong leadership, an orderly, disciplined environment, and the ability to attract new staff committed to an effective school philosophy.

Data were collected both before and after British Columbia instituted its program of public aid to private schools in August, 1978. Over 20 private schools receiving public aid participated in the two surveys, taken in the spring of 1978 and the spring of 1980. Parents were asked in each survey to assess the schools' financial jeopardy, need of parental help, degree of social cohesion, level of teacher commitment, responsiveness to parents, and academic effectiveness. Differences between the responses to the two surveys indicated that parents felt the  levels of all these factors had decreased. Teachers found increases in social cohesion and teacher commitment, a slight decline in teacher autonomy, and no significant change in parent commitment, parent involvement, special school mission, and teacher work rewards. Responses by students indicated shifts toward greater student engagement in work, and decreases in perceptions of school justice, the specialness of the school, student enthusiasm for school work, and the attractiveness of the teacher and the class.

        "description":"Two studies were conducted to determine educator, student, and parent perceptions regarding school discipline in Tennessee. Nearly 4,000 educators and 3,000 students responded to instruments designed to ascertain existing discipline problems, related influences, and appropriate corrective actions. Various demographic characteristics were used in data analysis. Educators, students, and parents identified apathy and inattention as two of the leading discipline problems. Out-of-school influences were seen as most important, with differences in specific factors mentioned. Conferences with students or parents were consistently recommended to handle problems, but their widespread use was not evident. (Author)",

        "description":"A test of the effects of school organization, the school environment, and the larger community context on school attendance showed that environmental and contextual factors have the strongest impact. Using a model based on organizational theory, researchers hypothesized that, within the community context, environmental factors would affect school organization which would in turn affect school effectiveness (indicated by attendance). Environmental variables consisted of school size, expenditure per pupil, and overall student poverty level; organizational variables included pupil-teacher and pupil-paraprofessional ratios; and contextual variables comprised the school district's poverty level and the stability of its student population. Path analysis was used to correlate data from  a sample of 93 public elementary schools in Chicago. The results indicated that school organization was strongly affected by school environment but had little direct influence on attendance once environmental factors were controlled for. Attendance can be most strongly correlated with the school's and the district's poverty levels and with the district's student stability. Future research should use better indicators of school organization (such as tracking) to test its relationship to attendance. (RW)",

        "description":"Collective bargaining contracts with teachers unions have reduced principals' autonomy but have still left them opportunities for effective administration of their schools. Interviews with 289 educators in six diverse school districts across the country show that contracts have limited principals' powers both from above, by centralizing labor relations at the district level, and from below, by expanding teachers' rights in areas like job security and grievances. Many principals understand, however, that three organizational factors help them maintain much control. These include the necessary interdependence between teachers and principals; teachers' desires that are not covered by the contract, such as student discipline or public and parental support; and teachers' ambivalence  toward unionism. The most effective principals are those who respond best to teachers' concerns, whether included in the contract or not. Both effective and ineffective principals cope with contractual limitations through one of three strategies: an aggressive one, which meets the letter, but not always the spirit, of the contract; a defensive one, which strives only to avoid contract violations; or a reciprocal one, which wins cooperation by trading favors or fostering convictions of interdependence.

Interviews with 189 teachers and 100 administrators, conducted in 18 schools in six diverse districts in as many states, indicate that implementation of contract provisions varies according to their enforceability and their importance to teachers. Fully implemented provisions, dealing with job security, class size, and duty-free lunch periods, were both easily enforceable and highly significant to teachers. Some important teacher concerns, however, such as student discipline and adequate materials and facilities, could only be partially enforced. Finally, some provisions that were enforceable but not highly  important to teachers were variably implemented. Teachers and principals either ignored, enforced, or informally renegotiated such provisions, which included teachers' use of preparation periods, supervisory duties outside class, and meeting length and frequency. Implementation of these provisions could vary from school to school even in the same district, depending on the principal's administrative style and relationship to the faculty. (Author/RW)",

The factors examined included social class, income, occupation, education, religion, number of schools considered, sources of information, amount of thought given to the choice, degree of involvement of various family members in the decision, and reasons for the selection made. Among the findings were that social class affected the type of school chosen, the family members involved, and other factors, but did not affect the reasons for the choice or the number of schools considered. Reasons for  choosing private schools centered on religion, discipline, and academic quality, while those for choosing public schools tended to involve convenience or school location. A small, but significant, number of parents, of low social status and educated in public schools, gave little thought to school selection and tended to choose public schools for their children. The new aid program had little effect on parent choice, as it had just begun at the time of the survey. (Author/RW)",

Findings from educational research on ability grouping, commentary from law review journals, and the texts of cases themselves are included as a part of the inquiry into the direction such legal challenges might take. Three approaches are followed in the analyses of the legal literature. First, those concepts likely to influence both the character of a legal challenge to ability grouping and the direction of the court's responses to such a challenge are identified. Second, those cases in which tracking has already been considered by the courts are examined to determine legal precedents for  future court action. Third, cases which might be considered analogous--those dealing with related issues--are reviewed to identify legal approaches which might be adopted in a challenge to ability grouping and tracking.

The schools evidenced a considerable differentiation of authority among subunits, which led to sporadic coordination of instructional activities and isolation of subunits. Hence, comprehensive instructional change was difficult, primarily because such change assumes the presence of integrative mechanisms that did not exist in this sample. However, there were several tightly structured areas in the schools and these were more amenable to broad change.  (Author/MLF)",

The field agents performed several functions in addition to the technical ones they had anticipated. These included expanding their technical responsibilities, adjusting the change process, seeking endorsements, mediating interpersonal tensions, and providing clerical services. The additional functions were necessitated by a scarcity of school resources, tension among school staff, and organizational instability. Moreover, school staff expectations for &quot;linker&quot;  behavior tended to maintain the expanded role once assumed. The first section of the paper provides background for the study; the second section contains a description of the research procedures; the third section examines the functions that linkers had to perform at the school sites; and the fourth section identifies factors which made these functions necessary.

Also reported are rankings of teacher factors in selectinq a site for student integration (attitude toward behavioral problems and behavioral expectations rated as most important); and classroom factors (apparent empathy/tolerance of students and degree of classroom structure rated as most important). It is reported that nearly 70% of the special class teachers indicated they had received training in reintegrating students while only 25%  of the regular class teachers who will receive reintegrated students received training. Confusion over responsibilities in reintegration and lack of written procedures for reintegration are also noted. (CL)",

The second task's distraction condition was designed to make it more discriminating than the neutral condition and a differential distraction effect was found.

Eligibility, classification, prognostic, and placement decisions then were made for the child. Each S also indicated the extent to  which various factors influenced decisions made, and answered questions about the efficacy of the computer simulation approach to the study for each research question; analyses of the findings as a function of referral information, professional role, and assessment knowledge are presented.

Teachers were asked to provide information regarding the children in their classes and some of their program activities; equal numbers of each type of teacher were sampled on two occasions. An analysis of the results indicated many similarities and some differences among the teacher responses. Similarities included the importance of affective needs and the need to reduce inappropriate behaviors. Differences tended to relate to service delivery and included seeing LD children for more time than EMR or ED children. (Author/DB)",

The mentally retarded child is seen to develop maladaptive ego functions including an inability to control drives, delayed or deficient autonomous functioning, poor reality testing, impaired development of object relationships, primitive defense mechanisms, and inability to synthesize major ego functions. Six case studies are discussed to show the way that art therapy can help the retarded child develop appropriate ego functions.  (DB)",

Highlights of previous research on the relationship of sex and race to performance and treatment differences in elementary school classrooms were reviewed. The evaluation unit of the Learning Research and Development Center studied reading instruction in an urban school district's elementary classrooms for the learning disabled for 2 years. To assess the relative efficacy of specific practices, Ss  were pretested in the fall using the Level I Reading Subtest of the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) and Spache Diagnostic Reading Scales and were posttested in the spring of the following year using the WRAT, the Spache, and the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills. Results of the analysis regarding differential placement suggested that there is a race and sex relationship to placement. It appeared that Black girls, while they are less likely to be placed overall, are more likely to be placed correctly. The level of achievement, teacher instructional behaviors, and student behaviors were remarkably similar for all student groups although there was a significant sex by race interaction for oral reading (White girls read aloud more), a significant race effect for off task (Whites were off  task more), and a significant sex effect for rewards and waiting/managing materials (girls got more rewards and waited/managed more).

Noted among the shortcomings of testing minority students are that standardized tests are not appropriate and do not interest and motivate the examinee. Current definitions of giftedness and their utility for identification and selection are reviewed, and the contribution of Guilford's Structure of Intellect model in expanding the definition of giftedness is pointed out. Stressed is the importance of using culture based definitions of giftedness for identification and selection in a minority population. The author advocates  inclusionism in identification (i.e., if a child manifests giftedness prima facie or gifted potential on one or more indicators of the trait, the child should be identified as gifted and a candidate for selection).

The emphasis is on the determination of systems and structure of non-segmental lectal variability in the children's speech without primary reference to function. The primary data consisted of selected episodes of connected speech from six Tyneside (England) children, three boys and three girls, aged 4.7 to 5.9 years. The episodes are all taken from tape-recordings in naturalistic settings in the children's homes. The system of analysis that was used treats prosodic features organized into independent, but interacting systems. The discussion of the research treats: (1) some of the similarities in the children's speech by examining details of the tone units  which they realize; (2) some of the more important differences between the frequency distributions of nuclear tones in localized Tyneside and non-localized speech; and (3) overlapping representations of tonic frequency distributions among the children. The study showed that it is possible to establish significant patterns of variation in the non-segmental systems of a number of children. It has shown patterns of development towards localized intonational systems and indicated some important non-linguistic co-variates of intonational structure. (AMH)",

The discussion is developed in three parts: (1) the legislative history of the capacity building mandate in Title VII and the federal statutory provisions shaping this mandate's implementation; (2) findings of earlier studies by the Rand Corporation and the NTS Research Corporation on efforts to institutionalize educational improvements through federal programs; and (3) the issue of capacity building within the specific context of the Title VII program. On the issue of capacity building, the study considers key issues which should be addressed by a department in designing and implementing procedures  for application approval, technical assistance, monitoring, and evaluation. It discusses concerns related to building effective local bilingual programs and the programs. Finally, some suggestions from research on institutionalizing educational change are given to provide guidance on fostering legitimacy in local bilingual programming. (AMH)",

        "description":"Information on language use patterns in bilingual classrooms is presented and analyzed in relation to the types of grouping decisions commonly made by teachers. The data were collected from two bilingual elementary classrooms and obtained through audio-recording and observation. Group setting contrasts of group size and instructional mode were established. The variables selected to measure language use were amount of talk, complexity of speech, and language functions, for which a speech act category system was adapted. It was concluded that group setting affects language use. Findings include: (1) the effect of group setting on language use is mediated by teaching style; (2) small group settings provide a highly favorable context for language use, (3) the range of speech acts was  broader during individual work than during teacher-directed instruction, (4) the weaker language of all students was infrequently used in the classroom for natural communication, and (5) the weaker language fulfilled a variety of different functions. Tables present types and examples of speech act categories and quantitative analyses of amount of talk in the dominant and weaker language, the different speech acts performed in the dominant language, and the distribution of language functions in the weaker language.

Two underlying assumptions of this paper are that all Americans should have the opportunity to develop an ability to speak, read and write English well, and that all Americans should be encouraged to maintain or acquire a second language. Recent research has revealed the enriching effects that bilingualism can bring to an individual and a society. The International Education Division of ED has supported research and materials development efforts for certain of the less commonly taught languages. It is argued that a great deal more work needs to be done on less commonly taught languages, effective second language learning and teaching, the retention or reinforcement  of language skills once acquired, and language loss. Eight major foci for research and materials development are identified. Of those, three are considered to be of immediate concern and of high priority for NIE: (1) a continuing examination of factors associated with second language learning in diverse pedagogical or social settings; (2) the development of a new set of testing devices; and (3) an examination of language skill attrition involving basic psycholinguistic research directly concerned with language skill loss.

It is found that the overall picture is one of useful fragments, and of a general failure to develop rigorous measures to compare learning paradigms or to provide an understanding of the ways in which students form ideas about global problems and become motivated to be part of their solution.

Data from &quot;Statistics Canada&quot; for the academic years 1972-73, 1975-76, and 1977-78 were used in the comparative analysis. Between 1972-73 and 1977-78, women remained a minority population, 13 to 14 percent of the full-time teaching staff. Throughout the 1970s women continued to be concentrated in the assistant and lecturer rank and men continued to be found disproportionately in the full and associate professorship ranks. Regardless of the year, the modal degree for women was a master's degree, whereas for men it was the Ph.D. degree. Even when sex differences in highest earned degree were taken into account, women, as compared to  men, were still absent from full professorship ranks and were primarily found in the lower ranks. Women were conspicuously absent from the engineering and applied sciences and from mathematics and the physical sciences. They were more likely to be found in education, fine arts, humanities, and the health sciences (primarily nursing teaching positions). In 1972-73, the median salary of male full-time teachers was 25 percent higher than the median salary of women. In 1975-76, and in 1977-78, the male median salary was 22 percent higher. Sex differences in rank account for much of the observed male and female differentials in median salaries. Additionally, differences in male-female salaries remain even when sex differences in factors known to influence salaries are taken into account (i.e.,  rank, highest earned degree, age, years since highest degree, and field of study). An explanation of the analytic techniques employed in the comparison and a bibliography are appended. (SW)",

        "description":"Trends in college enrollment patterns, along with reference to the historical development of the university, are considered, and the university's response to population shifts and the role of life-span development in that response are addressed. It is proposed that the response of higher education to declining number of youth should not be simple or superficial (e.g., to attempt to recruit larger numbers of young adults for part-time enrollments, or to attempt to reorient emphases toward more research and service and less teaching). It is suggested that these types of changes do not alter the university's fundamental age-segmented mentality, a concept with pervasive theoretical and methodological implications. It is proposed that the current momentum may become the opportunity  for a basic reorientation toward life-span development. This reorientation would help resolve some of the enrollment problems because of the greater growth of the numbers of older (35 or 40 and older) adults; but, more importantly, would supplant the existent normative, universal, age-segmented model of development with one sensitive to differential processes of development, characterized by interindividual and intraindividual variability, multidimensionality, and multidirectionality of expression. It is claimed that the life-span development model could vitalize university research, service and education, especially among those units most vulnerable to budgetary cuts. Among the areas in need of interdisciplinary investigation by educators, physical educators and recreators, and  behavioral and social scientists are the following: normative adult transitions, time and leisure, life-span learning, learning and memory, individual counseling, and industrial counseling.

        "description":"Perspectives on the evaluation of college teaching are considered. Some of the conditions that are needed generally include the following: the existence of an evaluation system that has a process for evaluating research and service, a clear definition of the difference between the evaluation of worth and the evaluation of merit, and a separate support system to assist faculty in improvement efforts. The following are not recommended for evaluating teaching: classroom visits by colleagues, focusing only on measuring the amount learned, and checking on the relative number of further courses in the same subject matter in which the instructor's former students enroll. It is suggested that the key component in the evaluation process is the student questionnaire, which should allow for  an overall judgment of the merit of the instructor as an instructor. Other possible questions concern ethical or professional obligations of the instructor and components of instruction, such as ratings of the text, quizzes, and the grading system. It is suggested that instructional materials, tests, student grading, and the student's role in grading should be examined in terms of comprehensiveness, correctness, and currency. Other ways that teaching can be evaluated include assessment of actual learning gains and faculty self-development and self-improvement efforts. The use of faculty evaluation in a faculty development process, integrating and disseminating the results of faculty evaluations, and the key ethical/legal constraints on data gathering are also addressed.

        "description":"The opinions of nearly 17,000 college-bound and noncollege-bound high school seniors concerning a wide range of issues of both personal and social significance were surveyed in 1979 at the end of the senior year. Developing successful personal relationships, particularly a good marriage and family life, ranked at the top of freshman goals in life, and satisfaciton and success in work were also central concerns. In large proportions they preferred marriage, wanted children, and seemed willing to accommodate the needs of those children. Students' ratings of very important aspects in a job and of the desirability of different work settings are considered. Highest ratings were assigned to jobs that are interesting and make use of a person's skills. The most preferred work settings  are those that provide the greatest independence and involve the least external control. The majority of the high school student respondents were employed and most were making fairly good money. While the students had positive expectations for their own future, they were considerably more pessimistic about how things will go for the country and the world over the next five years. Specific problems they are worrying about are summarized. The national issue that has been of greatest concern to recent high school classes has been crime and violence, and an issue that historically has been of less worry, the energy shortage, has reached a level of comparable concern. Drug abuse, pollution, and economic problems rank next among student concerns. Slightly less often on the minds of seniors are  the issues of possible nuclear conflict, race relations, hunger and poverty, and population growth. Their views on national defense and the military, politics and the system, and their ratings of institutions in society are also addressed. (SW)",

        "description":"The relationship between reputational ratings of graduate-level chemistry, history, and psychology departments and their faculties' scholarly productivity was examined using data from a national sample of departments in each field. Faculty reported the number of their professional articles in journals, chapters in books, scholarly book reviews, books, and monographs. This information was requested separately for the entire career and for the last three years. Among other ratings, faculty were asked to rate the quality of the faculty in the other departments in their field. Additionally, graduate students and alumni from the program were surveyed, using various measures. Departments were divided into three groups based on their reputational ratings, and the productivity of faculty  in these departments was assessed. For measures covering the entire career, the high-rated departments produced aPproximately twice as much per faculty member as the low rated departments; however, this trend was not evidenced for the measures over the last three years. Correlations of departmental mean publication indices with the mean reputational ratings generally suggest a moderate relationship between reputation and productivity. Scatterplots demonstrated that the ratings were not good indicators of the productivity of individual departments. The results also indicate that any particular publication measure should not be used as a measure of overall departmental quality (some departments that were high on book production were low on journal production). Additionally, both  reputational ratings and publication figures were found to be unrelated to the quality of teaching as reported by students, alumni ratings, and chemistry and history faculties' concern for students.

Such recognition is linked to the determination of eligibility for federal funds. Additionally, a system of state approval agencies funded by the federal government has approved courses of study for enrollment of veterans and evaluated unaccredited programs of study. Policies developed in 1969 that affected the character of the Commissioner of Education's list of reliable authorities provided that each accrediting agency on the  list will be reevaluated by the Commissioner at least once every four years and that the Commissioner will specifically define the accrediting agency's scope (i.e., the level and type of educational programs that they accredit). The original Criteria for Recognition (1952) were revised in 1969 to include additional provisions, including due process in considering applicants for accreditation. The 1974 revision of the Criteria added a criterion that reflects the quasi-public nature of accreditation. The following aspects of the Criteria are addressed: the functional aspects of accrediting agencies, their responsibility, their reliability, and their autonomy. The Division of Eligibility and Agency Evaluation of OE has assisted both federal and state agencies in developing an understanding  of the accreditation process. OE has also funded research projects that can be directly beneficial to the accreditation community, and has sponsored or cosponsored conferences and forums on the topic. (SW)",

        "description":"The comparative effects of large and traditional-sized remedial mathematics classes on college student aptitude and attitude were studied. Two large pre-algebra classes of 129 and 121 students and traditional-sized classes ranging in size from 30 to 40 students were assessed by informal observations and two instruments: a department-developed placement tool and an attitude measure developed by Grayson Wheatley. Additionally, post-test information concerning student characteristics, educational background, and other data were obtained. For both the 135 students in the large classes and the 85 students in the traditional-sized classes, there was a positive change in aptitude, which was significant at the .05 level. For the students in the large classes, there was a significant  negative change in attitude. Although some negative change in attitude occurred for students in the traditional-sized classes, there was a significant difference in negativity between the two study groups. Factors in addition to size that may have contributed to the more negative attitudes of students in the large classes include the instructional facilities, not having laboratory experiences as part of the regular class, and being assigned to a large class because of a situation that arose at the department. Additionally, there were more upper level students in the large classes than in the small classes. Additional information obtained after class completion and aptitude/attitude testing are considered as follows: student grade expectation, reasons for taking the course, study habits,  preference for multiple choice versus scantron testing, perceived clarity of course objective, class attendance, and withdrawal.

        "description":"The laws, regulations, and rulings that are common to all cooperative education programs and that frequently present problems to coordinators, faculty, administrators, and employers are briefly explained. The objective is to provide coordinators of cooperative programs in education, business, industry, and government with a discussion of the current interpretation of these laws by the various government agencies involved. Contents are as follows: Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedure, unpaid cooperative assignments, unemployment compensation, discrimination against aliens, workmen's compensation, social security benefits, employment of foreign students, V.A. benefits, and reciprocity for motor vehicles licenses. The federal government and the courts have both defined  the college placement function as an employment agency or service within the Title VII definition. The fundamental principle underlying the employee selection guidelines is that employer policies or procedures that have an adverse impact on employment opportunities of any race, sex, or ethnic group are illegal under Title VII unless justified by business necessity. The guidelines adopt a rule of thumb known as the \"80 percent rule\" for determining adverse impact for use in enforcement proceedings. The guidelines apply to selection procedures that are used as a basis for any employment decision, including referral. Unpaid cooperative assignments are covered either by the Fair Labor Standards Act, state statutes, or federal Department of Labor regulations. Some cases have to be handled on  an individual basis. Cooperative students are not eligible for unemployment compensation but in most states are covered by the employer's workmen's compensation for injuries. (SW)",

The Subcommittee will be considering legislation, during the 96th Congress, to extend and modify Titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act, which authorize federal programs affecting the training and deployment of health personnel. State financial aid to selected health professions education from 1975 through 1980 is assessed, including three separate fiscal periods, and the relationship between federal capitation, state institutional aid, and tuition revenues is explored. Based on a survey of the states and site visits, information is also presented on state  scholarships and loans, and on growth and changes in states' efforts to tie student financial assistance to future service payback principally in underserved communities. Trends in state commitments to the following health professions are analyzed: medicine; osteopathy; dentistry; optometry; pharmacy; podiatry; veterinary medicine; and diploma, associate-level, and baccalaureate-level nursing. Appended materials include: state financial aid program descriptions and statistical data for the 50 states and the District of Columbia; information on the health professions federal student assistant programs, 1979-80; and a description of the study methodology.

Part I offers an introduction and overview of GMENAC's project. Part II describes the &quot;adjusted needs-based model&quot; and the process of estimating its parameters using delphi panels. Part III summarizes the requirements estimates for each specialty. Part IV discusses supply projections,  including a description of the &quot;GME Model,&quot; a model of the graduate medical education adopted by GMENAC. Part V discusses the disparity between supply and requirements and makes recommendations for the future direction of graduate medical education. Among the recommendations cited are: no new allopathic or osteopathic medical schools should be established beyond those with first-year students in place in 1980-1981; the ability to read, write and speak English should remain a requirement for all alien physicians; and in view of the projected oversupply of physicians, the need to train non-physician health care providers at current rates should be studied. Members of the Graduate Medical Education Advisory Committee Model Panel and the Physician Specialty Delphi Panels are listed, and  tabular statistical data and summaries are included. (Author/LC)",

        "description":"Illinois Central College's Development of Operational Reasoning Skills (DOORS) project, which is based on Piaget's developmental theory and learning cycle strategy, is described. The project provides a multidisciplinary freshman core program focusing on the improvement of student reasoning abilities. For each of the six DOORS courses--English, mathematics, physics, history, sociology, and social science--several major thinking skills were identified, and all the classes emphasize the same skill at the same time in the semester. Pretesting and posttesting of students to assess changes in cognitive skills and other defined parameters were undertaken. The initial assessment was based on collected high school grade point averages, graduating class rank, and reported American College  Testing Program scores. Using a test developed to assess cognitives skills, evidence was found that DOORS students were less academically prepared than the typical entering freshman at ICC. To evaluate the success of the DOORS program in altering the normal attrition of students from college during their first semester, comparisons were made of grades and attrition frequencies for specific courses. Despite several problems in the evaluation process, the results seem to suggest that DOORS students make as much intellectual progress as a typical group of community college students, and do so with significantly lower attrition. The program has allowed six instructors the opportunity to investigate thoroughly the use of experiential learning techniques. Student evaluation of the program was  undertaken by administration of a questionnaire and through written descriptions of student impressions, some of which are appended. (SW)",

        "description":"The Philadelphia Regional Introduction for Minorities to Engineering (PRIME) program, a nonprofit consortium of colleges, public schools, business/industry, government, and community agencies, is described. The pre-engineering program begins in the seventh grade and continues to track students through their college years. At the middle schools, information, motivation, and enrichment activities are stressed, while at the senior high schools, skill development in mathematics, science, and communication are emphasized. To bridge the gap between the theory of the classroom and work world, each PRIME school is adopted by a business or government office that provides field trips, speakers, role models, audiovisual presentations, and demonstrations. Generally, each designated school  has a PRIME team composed of a science, mathematics, and English teacher. Classroom visits by an industry representative, preferably a working engineer, introduce students to the work of the company, to engineering in general, or to a particular engineering specialty. The representative may also confer with PRIME teachers regarding engineering concepts, to assist in judging student engineering projects, or to plan the two field trips. Each summer a select group of post-eighth graders spends a month on one of the four university campuses, rotating each year. Students receive a sequqntial set of skill building activities that involve both hands-on and simulated projects. Lessons in computer science begin in the eighth grade. At the end of the 12th grade, students who elect to attend  engineering school are placed in industrial internships or are enrolled in a prefreshman collegiate program. Information on program enrollment and organization is included. (SW)",

        "description":"Four student-rated qualities of affective meaning associated with getting a grade of \"C\" in selected college courses were analyzed for their relation to student academic self-esteem and their sensitivity to two course-related context factors: course content and its intended audience. A total of 106 students in two sections of an introductory psychology class were the subjects. The typical subject was a second-semester freshman with a B average, and a broad range of academic interests was represented. Semantic differential scales were used as an instrument type. Affective meaning indexing the amount of positive feeling associated with the grade, the extent of ownership of the grade, the importance of the grade, and effort required by the grade were related to generalized  expectations for success in college courses. In addition, context factors were found to influence the importance and effort dimensions directly. It is concluded that students and instructors have discrepant views of the value and meaning of various grades, and that such discrepancies create potentially serious opportunities for miscommunication between instructor and student. Further research is suggested in two areas: (1) what are the continuities and discontinuities in instructor-student perceptions of various specific grades? and (2) what actions, instructions, or activities by instructors and students can eliminate such discontinuities?

One hundred six students in two sections of an introductory psychology course comprised the sample. The average student was a second-semester sophomore with a B average, and a broad range of majors was represented. Students were asked to predict a grade in four hypothetical situations as a preliminary step, and then were administered nine different forms of a survey. The survey asked for descriptions of the students' feelings about receiving a C grade in each of two situations involving specifically identified and described courses, both major courses and general education courses.  Responses were made from supplied adjective pairs. The results generally supported previous research done with a more homogeneous group regarding sex and college major. They also show that there are at least four relatively independent dimensions to the psychological meaning of specific grades: (1) whether the grade is good or bad; (2) whether the grade seems a likely or unlikely description of the work done; (3) how complicated or simple it is to understand the grade; and (4) how important or unimportant the grade is to the student. These qualities seem to be conceptually related to certain student characteristics, and to this extent, it is concluded that grades should be considered educationally meaningful. Further research is suggested into means for teachers to assure congruence  between the intended and psychologically effective meaning of the grades. (MSE)",

        "description":"The Biglan model, a theoretical framework for empirically examining the differences among subject areas, classifies according to three dimensions: adherence to common set of paradigms (hard or soft), application orientation (pure or applied), and emphasis on living systems (life or nonlife). Tests of the model are reviewed, and a further test is applied that addresses a noted deficiency in the model: its applicability to postsecondary education institutions other than research or doctorate-granting schools, specifically the comprehensive colleges. In the latter study, almost 9,000 faculty in 158 institutions were surveyed; equal proportions of respondents represented each of the five major institution types in the Carnegie classification. Response rate was 51.7 percent. The  survey consisted of 128 questions coded into 781 variables. The study used the respondents' primary fields of research, scholarship, and creativity as the dependent variable. The results indicate that the model can be generalized to the comprehensive colleges and research-doctoral institutions in a limited way. Of the three dimensions in the model, differences were found only between the hard-soft groups on both types of campuses. The research-oriented variables contributing to this difference are the number of journal articles vs. the number of books or monographs produced by the faculty members, and may be explained more by the faculty's prior research training than by institutional affiliation. Several limitations are noted: (1) independent variables other than those used in the study  may discriminate between Biglan groups; (2) the small number of respondents used in each cell was relatively small; and (3) this test used the &quot;augmented&quot; model composed of 78 departments, yet relatively untested. Future research is recommended into the model's use with institutional types. A list of references, a table of Biglan model tests, and tables of variables and results are appended. (MSE)",

These highlights are extracted: (1) the GSL program has expanded rapidly, with over half the states' guarantee agencies coming into existence since 1976, although a number of states had agencies even before the federal program began; (2) there are nearly as many state arrangements (financial and organizational) as there are states, implying great program diversity; and (3) several of the new agencies have had dramatic growth in the volume of loans guaranteed, presaging a more widely-established, broad-based student loan program with a truly national consistency. It is noted that factors not surveyed here, including state banking laws and agency regulations,  historical development, state postsecondary financing patterns, industrial activity, and competing credit demands, also contribute to diversity in the GSL program and the national student loan situation.

        "description":"Recent theories of professional work satisfaction are reviewed and applied to the college or university professor. Additionally, the professional satisfactions available to the academic person are compared with those of professionals in other occupations. The following theories of job satisfaction are examined: job facets theory, expectancy theory, equity theory, need and need deficiency theory, and two-factor theory. Proponents of job facets theory generally reject the notion that there exists some overall feeling of job satisfaction but posit that workers tend to be satisfied or dissatisfied with particular aspects of their jobs. The use of facet theory in studies of college faculty employs questionnaires with long lists of job characteristics. Expectancy theory is probably  particularly useful in separating the contingencies that affect effort-performance and performance reward. While equity theory can be of considerable value in understanding some of the sources of faculty dissatisfaction with teaching, it does not reveal, for example, the qualitative natures of satisfactions received at varying levels of input. Whereas expectancy theory predicts that workers will be able cognitively to appraise their situations and adjustments, need theory assumes that most workers will be driven by basic human forces that may not be fully understood through introspective analysis. Therefore, under this perspective, primary responsibility for the improvement of satisfaction would lie in formal authorities external to the individual. When the literature on need, two-factor,  or need deficiency theory in the field of higher education is examined, surprisingly little is found. A bibliography is appended. (SW)",

The percentage of variance that was explained was 14.4 percent for blacks, 4.9 precent for whites, and 7.4 percent for blacks and whites. Discriminant analyses yielded correct predictions for 64.5 percent of the blacks, 57.65 percent of the whites, and 64.78 percent of both races.

        "description":"The effectiveness of open admissions and delivery of educational services at a distance in serving adult learners enrolled at Athabasca University, Alberta, Canada, was studied in 1979-80 through an analysis of demographic and geographic information on 2,491 students. Information was gathered on the following characteristics: sex, age, number of people in the household, educational preparation, occupations, reason(s) for pursuing a university education, geographic location, preference for various learning situations, and reason(s) for studying at Athabasca University. The majority of the university's students were 25 to 44 years old; 63 percent of its students were female and 37 percent were male. It was found that approximately 50 percent of the students attending the university  benefited from the open admission policy. Eighteen percent of the students applied for advanced credits toward an undergraduate degree based on credit earned elsewhere. Less than one percent were able to take advantage of the absence of a residency requirement and earned enough credits through advanced credit assessment to be granted a bachelor of general studies degree. Thirty percent of the students were from geographically isolated regions. The fact that many of the students reside in large cities and big towns indicates that adult learners prefer the convenience of taking home study courses. The data suggest that distance education with new media and methods serves a new student population, including women and working people. A bibliography is appended. (SW)",

        "author":["Bragg, Ann Kieffer"],
        "description":"The way that department heads learn the chair role was studied through interviews with 39 department heads randomly selected from nine colleges within a single university. Four types of roles were identified. Faculty-oriented department heads described their primary responsibilities as recruiting, developing, and evaluating faculty members; facilitating the work of the faculty; and reducing intradepartmental conflict. Externally-oriented department heads described their primary responsibilities as representers, brokers, negotiators, or grantsmen, and their goals were to increase both the number and funding level of research grants and contracts, to obtain additional space and equipment, and to enhance the department's image. Program-oriented department heads described their  primary responsibility as program development. Among their goals were to increase the number of student-credit-hours generated and the number of undergraduate majors and graduate students in their departments. Management-oriented department heads described their primary responsibilities as leadership, facilitator, or coordinator to indicate that their job was to procure and allocate departmental resources and to effectively run the department. Perceived sources of stress, important extradepartmental involvement, and patterns of socialization were also identified for each type of department head. Among the responses are the following: externally-oriented department heads derived their role expectations from experience as successful grantsmen or as leaders in professional associations,  while program-oriented department heads reported that their experience as practicing professionals or as academic administrators influenced their role expectations. Implications for the selection and training of department heads are considered. (SW)",

        "description":"The college designations of over 5,800 recent graduates of 60 private secondary schools and the relationships between characteristics of these schools and the average selectivity of the colleges attended for each school were investigated. Aggregating all graduates, the data show considerable success in gaining admission to selective, prestigious private colleges and universities. Over 81 percent attended private institutions (religious and nonsectarian), and 69 percent attended colleges identified by Astin as either very highly or highly selective. The colleges attended compensate their full professors better than average and they enroll students from families of generally higher social status than other colleges. Approximately 19 percent of the students were admitted into the  top 25 colleges attended by major business leaders. Almost 40 percent attended one of the top 100 sources of the bachelor's degree of the Ph.D's for the period 1958-1966. Finally, the colleges attended had many alumni listed in &quot;Who's Who&quot; and the &quot;Social Register.&quot; Two school variables, the size of the average scholarship offered by the secondary school (the best predictor) and the size of the faculty, together account for about 34 percent of the variance in average selectivity. Other variables that were assessed include the size of endowment; size and worth of facilities; status indicators (date of founding and whether the school has been identified as traditional among the elite of private boarding schools); student body diversity (as indicated by number of scholarships offered and the  amounts of scholarships); school enrollment; number of graduates; and student-faculty ratio.

        "description":"The management strategy of calling attention to problems and labeling them as crises is discussed as a method of coping with prolonged periods of shrinking resources. Part I, &quot;Entering the Realm of Crisis,&quot; discusses the importance of defining a crisis, the crisis as an organizational good, and when to declare a crisis. Two types of crises are identified: (1) the manifest crisis, which is one readily apparent and whose menacing nature speaks for itself and commands attention and (2) the opaque crisis, which barely is visible, if at all, and often reflects a chronic problem which, while weighty, does not dramatize itself. Part II, &quot;Six Cases of Response to Organizational Adversity,&quot; examines the experiences of the following: Flagship University; Rockroad Community College;  Industrial City High School District; State Board of Higher Education; and Hillside State College. Part III, &quot;The Rules of Crisis Management,&quot; offers five conclusions: (1) effective declaration of a crisis is contingent on the credibility of an institution's management and perception; (2) a declaration of a crisis, to be successful, must lead to substantial benefit to the organization; (3) the declaration of a crisis should be highly visible and unequivocable; (4) after the crisis is declared it must be managed conspicuously; and (5) the crisis needs to be terminated. Several management tactics employable for crisis termination are illustrated in the case examples, such as: deriving strength from weakness by binding oneself to a future that would be distasteful to the institution if  allowed to take place; to make use of an interviewing outside party to dramatize the seriousness of the problem; and to make use of a crisis council.

The students, at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, have primarily technical and scientific interests, and the goal of the sociology courses offered is to promote awareness of the social world they will live and work in. Students are given access to a file of Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) programs that they can easily modify to suit their own purposes. Using data from the General Social Survey stored in the computer, they can test hypotheses on current data reflecting their interests. Students write short papers on their projects. In one semester the average student used about $59 worth of computer time. It was found that while students complained  of the heavy workload, they also found working with real data very interesting, and no student had difficulty with the computer work, which was simplified for the purposes of the course. It is felt that helping students in such a technological setting realize that sociological data can be useful for making decisions and solving problems is valuable. Appended to the report are: descriptive materials about the General Social Survey and its coverage, a listing of SPSS programs, procedures for using the General Social Survey, class exercises, and a copy of the survey form.

The Copyright Act of 1976 creates a statutory definition of fair use and prescribes a test to be used in determining when a use is &quot;fair&quot; and when it is infringement. Central to this test is &quot;impact of potential market value&quot; of the material. Biomedical communication involves material with a very high unit cost which is not offset by anything approaching mass distribution. There is no special exemption for, or understanding of, biomedical communication in the new law, with the result that the potential for a restrictive impact is great. Five references are cited.

        "description":"After discussing several issues related to the disproportionately large number of minority students who initiate baccalaureate studies at two-year colleges, this paper urges minority community colleges to strengthen the college transfer function. The paper first summarizes the problems and characteristics of today's community college transfer student; statistically demonstrates the disproportionate concentration of minority students at two-year colleges; and points out that while community colleges have increased minority access to education, they have not succeeded in reducing minority attrition. The underrepresentation of Hispanics in higher education is then examined, as are the socioeconomic barriers to educational success faced by Hispanic students and the need to address  these barriers in college articulation agreements. Finally, the paper presents ten recommendations for minority transfer education: (1) make transfer education a top institutional priority; (2) aggressively recruit minorities; (3) complete articulation agreements with high schools and universities; (4) place an individual in charge of the transfer process; (5) assess minority students' educational needs; (6) study retention/attrition factors; (7) conduct follow-up studies of transfer students; (8) establish a retention program; (9) provide counseling and support services; and (10) conduct relevant institutional research.

During the study, the administrators were asked to respond to two instruments: a six-item questionnaire soliciting information on management practices that are indicative of systematic planning and the Community College Goals Inventory, which requires respondents to rate, on a five-point scale, the importance of 90 goals as they exist  at the college and as the administrators would like them to exist. The study revealed that the administrators at the two community colleges exhibiting more systematic planning efforts felt that there was less of a discrepancy between actual and ideal college goals than administrators at the colleges using less systematic planning. The study report reviews planning literature, describes planning efforts at six community colleges, details study methodology and procedures, and reports findings and conclusions.

The paper first summarizes probable causes of this underrepresentation and then discusses the survey findings, focusing particularly on the characteristics of the 99 science instructors and their responses to questions related to: (1) their activities to recruit more students, particularly handicapped, women, and minority students, into their classes; (2) the importance of 14 activities and skills in terms of students' success in their courses; (3) the kinds of support services that  were and should be promoted by their colleges; (4) the percentage of students needing seven specified support services, whether teachers' would recommend these services, and reasons why students do not take advantage of these services; (5) the emphasis given to nine student activities in their classes; and (6) reasons why women, minorities, and the handicapped are underrepresented in science programs. Finally, the paper presents summary conclusions, indicating that science instructors are aware of their students' limitations; are not greatly concerned with the student mix; and are continuing to use traditional modes of instruction.

After introductory material explaining study methodology, Chapter I points to two sets of factors upon which model linkages are based; seven of these are the shared responsibility of the college and sponsor (e.g., choosing effective liaisons) and five are more likely to be achieved within the college (e.g., the development of manpower-related courses). Chapter II first reviews principles of adult learning and then discusses the division of  responsibility between CETA and the college for program functions, including student and program evaluation, basic skills instruction, provision of support services, technical skills training, and job placement and follow-up. While unable to identify an optimal model for fiscal linkages, Chapter III does indicate that both the colleges and the sponsors should improve budgeting, become familiar with each other's fiscal regulations, recognize grant monies awarded to CETA students, and evaluate the merits of class instruction vs. individual referrals.

A review of the literature and a panel of experts were used to identify seven characteristics and 22 conditions associated with a successful foundation, and presidents and development officers from colleges with successful foundations were asked to rank order these characteristics and conditions. The top-ranked characteristics were strong public relations, involvement of community leaders and potential donors as members of the foundation, and the use of the foundation as a vehicle for community involvement in the college. The top-ranked conditions that foster success were organized and defined planning efforts, a  governing board that is aware of its roles and responsibilities, and a clear statement of purpose for the foundation. Three themes summarize the conditions proposed by the panel of experts and validated by the community college administrators: planning, communication, and motivation. The study report reviews the history of foundations, shows the rank-orderings of the conditions and characteristics, and outlines conclusions and recommendations for further study. (JP)",

        "description":"As part of a student flow project designed to monitor new and transfer students who entered Kapiolani Community College in Fall 1980 for five consecutive semesters, this report summarizes data indicative of the students' academic progress and status as of Spring 1981. Specifically, the report presents a series of five discussions which examine: (1) Spring 1981 registration rates by comparing the number of Spring 1981 registrants with the total number of Fall 1980 entering students who had not completed their degrees; (2) the number of students who registered on a full-time basis; (3) the number of credits attempted and earned during Fall 1980; (4) the number of students who changed their majors during Fall 1980 and the cumulative impact of these changes on program enrollment; and  (5) the number of students who graduated at the end of Fall 1980. Each of these discussions is accompanied by tables which break down data according to students' program major, sex, academic status (passing or probationary), financial aid classification, and math and English placement test scores. Major findings indicate that 67% of the students entering in Fall 1980 re-enrolled in Spring 1981 and that 62% enrolled on a full-time basis. The students attempted an average of 9.8 credit hours and completed an average of 68% of the credits attempted. The study report compares selected findings with Fall 1975 and Fall 1979 data. (JP)",

The survey instrument asked respondents to: (1) indicate their main reason for not returning to KCC; (2) specify their current activities; and (3) rate their degree of satisfaction with their experiences at KCC in terms of instruction, faculty-student relations, course availability, intellectual environment, orientation, counseling services, financial aid, student employment services, friendships with other students, and facilities and equipment. Major findings, based on a 29% response rate, reveal that the reason  most often cited for leaving was \"transferred to another school\" (cited by 18.7% of the respondents), followed by \"preferred to work\" (cited by 16.8% of the respondents). Most of the respondents (66.7%) were working, and 20% were attending another school. While the majority rated each of the specified college experiences highly, 42% were not satisfied with the variety of courses available. The study report discusses methodology, examines the representativeness of the sample, and details findings by program area. In addition, it compares the KCC ratings of returning and non-returning students and contrasts data with the findings of a Fall 1975 study. (JP)",

        "description":"While health services personnel in the United States receive the best technical training available, they are rarely exposed to a holistic health science curriculum which would enable them to develop the interpersonal competence needed in the delivery of health services. Indeed, the primary task of health services personnel is teaching patients to assume proper therapeutic behaviors. This requires understanding a patient's behavior patterns, the psychology of motivation, the patient's personal and cultural background, and the importance of including the patient in his/her diagnosis and treatment. In addition, health care personnel must learn the skills required of any organization member and be aware of the need to economize in a non-profit hospital setting, racial caste systems  within job classifications, burn-out and other job-related problems, the inadvisability of socializing on the job, and management policies. Health personnel are also called upon to interact with people who are neither patients nor co-workers, for example, with patients' friends and family. They often need to teach families to assist with patient care and to deal with the sensitive topic of mortality. Clearly these interpersonal competencies cannot all be addressed within the short timeframe of formal study, but colleges have an obligation to incorporate general education into the curriculum to instill a spirit of critical observation and to motivate independent investigation.

The monograph first discusses the purposes of staff development evaluation and then considers three prerequisites for the development of an evaluation plan: institutional goals and objectives, staff needs assessment, and a plan delineating program objectives and guidelines. The proposed systems model for program evaluation is then presented, in which the evaluator measures both the effect of staff development on participants and the impact of acquired skills on the work setting. The monograph then delineates guidelines and problems in gathering data at four levels of evaluation:  participant reaction to activities, amount of participant learning, changes in behavior through application of this learning, and results. A matrix is then presented, detailing the questions to be asked in gathering and assessing information at each level. The monograph concludes with a discussion of summative vs. formative evaluation, securing needed resources, the politics of evaluation, and the extent and timing of staff development evaluation activities. A staff development program evaluation form, a pre-/post-test for self-assessment of learning, and an annotated bibliography are included. (JP)",

Eaton discussing the challenges faced by women in positions of authority at community colleges, this monograph presents eight essays dealing with women in the community college movement. Emily Taylor discusses the backgrounds, attitudes, and characteristics of the small, but growing number of women presidents of community colleges and describes a project undertaken by the American Council on Education to identify talented women administrators. A. Rae Price documents the unequal status of women faculty members and suggests actions for improvement. Lloyd Averill argues that women will best be able to strengthen the humanities by affirming and employing the positive, stereotypically feminine characteristics of the humanist. Carol Eliason  examines the critical support role played by women's studies programs in meeting counseling, occupational, and educational needs. Emily B. Kirby examines the role of the community college in helping women overcome stereotypes which block them from non-traditional careers. Joyce A. Smith discusses the role of the trustee, the special responsibilities of women trustees, behaviors that contribute to a new member's success, and the selection of a college president. Linda L. Moore examines the special problems faced by women in management in both the public and private sectors and proposes a method of constructive self-analysis. An ERIC literature review concludes the monograph. (JP)",

Instructors can foster good relations with students by balancing criticism with praise and striving to bolster students' self-esteem through patient encouragement. Instructors should avoid the temptation to cover all chemistry topics and should use individualized, non-threatening instructional methods to achieve realistic course goals. Such methods include  informing students of specific learning objectives, encouraging them to organize materials by preparing a \"legalized crib sheet\" for use during exams, and providing for retesting on the sections of an exam with which students had trouble. Grade consciousness should be further diminished by convincing students of the importance of studying chemistry in today's world. Finally, remediation efforts should be centered around improving reading speed, reading comprehension, study habits, and mathematical skills. To assist in these efforts, instructors should direct students to remediation experts and emphasize a quantitative approach to laboratory exercises to apply math skills. (JP)",

In utilizing this approach, several factors must be considered. First, a clear distinction should be made between cognitive style and ability or achievement. Cognitive style is a matter of behavior and preference which cannot be measured quantitatively on a norm-referenced basis, as can ability or achievement. Second, while at least 30 models have been identified in the literature for the implementation of cognitive style approaches, they are all based on four precepts: individuals prefer to learn differently; individual learning styles are identifiable; institutions  have a responsibility to consider cognitive style in instructional delivery; and students have a responsibility to structure their learning environment in accordance with their cognitive style. Fourth, an understanding of cognitive style theory is valuable in both academic and non-academic settings and is useful for all learners. Fifth, it is not always desirable or possible to match students' cognitive style with instructional styles. Finally, a recognition of his/her cognitive style can help the student make individual decisions about his/her approach to study and, thus, is useful even when alternative learning methods are not available.

During the 1960's, for example, increasing enrollments were often cited as evidence of public support for community colleges--without reference to the social and demographic factors that caused the enrollment boom. Similarly, claims that community colleges do a better job of teaching than research-oriented universities are not substantiated by evidence of actual student learning. Critics should not, however, confuse institutional intentions with actual outcomes by asserting that because community colleges have not eliminated the social class structure, they are part of a  conspiracy to maintain it. Indeed, the community colleges have provided higher education with a means of accommodating the increased demand for educational access that emerged in the 1960's without compromising the quality of the universities. The two-year college provided access to students who could not otherwise participate in higher education, assured a mechanism of social mobility, and helped the country avoid the problems faced by European nations who have no alternative means of dealing with students who are not admitted by universities. While the critic should expose rhetorical aberrations, s/he should do so to protect the real virtues of the community college. (JP)",

An introductory essay by Fred F. Harcleroad summarizes Schultz's contributions to community college education. John E. Roueche then discusses the provision of equal educational opportunity to non-traditional, high-risk students. Arguing that equal access must be coupled with equal opportunities for success, Roueche identifies barriers to student success in teacher attitudes, traditional curricula, and conventional instructional methods. Next, Apolonio Coronado notes the success of community colleges in providing access for minority students and discusses concomitant trends and problems in the areas of student financial aid, the cycle  of failure experienced by many minority students, the increased diversity of the minority student population, the maintenance of developmental studies programs, and the threat of impending fiscal cutbacks. Donald T.

        "description":"Common to the sentiments that led to the establishment of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the community college movement is the conviction that humanities education is vital to the everyday lives of all citizens and should not remain the province of only specialized scholars. Indeed, this conviction is expressed in the language of the legislation creating the NEH, an organization which has, despite the continual insistance of critics that the humanities are not for everyone, encouraged the provision of humanities instruction for all citizens who seek such learning. Such populist ideas are certainly not foreign to the community college movement which has its roots in the belief that the educational needs of the total society are not adequately served by large,  established universities, which, as Abraham Flexner argued over 70 years ago, emphasize research at the expense of teaching. Although the community colleges eventually developed a strong commitment to vocational training, their populist heritage is currently emerging in growing demands for general education to help citizens cope with cultural pluralism, the loss of a sense of common good, and other perplexities of modern society. Thus the community colleges are now doing what the NEH had hoped that universities would do: democratizing knowledge through general education curricula which address ideals and values in addition to employable skills.

The study involved: (1) a semester-by-semester analysis of the grade point averages (GPA's), academic status, and retention and graduation rates of the three student groups; (2) a comparison of the GPA's earned by the student groups during the study period in 12 academic areas; and (3) an analysis of the differences in academic achievement registered during the study period by students from each of the  community colleges transferring five or more students to UIUC. In addition, a statistical analysis was used to determine predictive equations correlating pre-transfer GPA's with subsequent academic achievement at UIUC. The study report details procedures and limitations; reviews related research; contrasts pre- and post-transfer GPA's; compares the first, second, and third term academic progress of the three study groups; presents subject area and institutional comparisons; and discusses the implications of the study for UIUC policy.

The monograph first reviews recent literature pointing to an erosion of the colleges' transfer, vocational, and general education functions and then discusses the following concerns: (1) overcoming the image of &quot;two-year colleges&quot; and assuming the role of lifelong learning centers; (2) improving the implementation of open-admissions policies through student assessment, screening, and placement in courses and programs appropriate to their skills and abilities; (3) improving articulation with high schools and utilizing newly created high school graduation proficiency exams as competency  standards for entering freshmen; (4) allocating affirmative action funds to programs to recruit minority students into transfer programs and programs for severely disadvantaged minority adults; (5) determining the extent to which colleges should provide remediation; and (6) maintaining the transfer function in light of the declining number of transfer students and the efforts of public four-year colleges to raise academic standards. The report concludes with a discussion of the growing number of nontraditional students in the CCC system since 1960 and is appended by a bibliography and a classification scheme of instructional and community services.

Students were given the option of answering questions about their age, sex, and employment status. Selected findings, based on 222 responses, reveal that most of the students (56.8%) learned about the courses through LCC mailings, and that 44.1% of the respondents took the course to earn credit, 33.3% had a general interest in the subject, and 14% viewed the courses for professional improvement.

First, six concerns related to planning are discussed: obtaining administrative and departmental support; securing funds from various internal and external sources; obtaining furniture, supplies, and instructional materials; locating a facility to house the center; employing faculty and peer tutors; and hiring a receptionist. Three administrative factors are then considered: providing release time for the faculty member who is to act as the director of the writing center; meeting the training needs of student tutors; and choosing between referral and walk-in systems of operation. Next, six housekeeping and publicity considerations are examined: the various forms  needed by the center; the types of data that must be collected; the filing system needed to organize this data; methods of scheduling student conferences; hours of service; campus advertising; and the provision of workshops and other extension services. Finally, the possibility and benefits of using these guidelines for the establishment of a campus learning center, providing learning support for math and other disciplines, are discussed. (JP)",

        "description":"A study was conducted by Los Angeles City College (LACC) to measure the academic achievement of 103 day and 34 evening students enrolled during Fall 1980 in Developmental Communication 20, a course in basic reading and writing skills. During the study, five measures of academic achievement were recorded for each student: first- and last-week scores on the Stanford Test of Academic Skills (TASK), Level 1-A; first- and last-week scores on an LACC developed vocabulary test; and final course grade. In addition, statistical analyses were conducted to determine the correlation between these variables and to assess the statistical value of enrollment status (i.e., day or evening) and the test scores as predictors of the final course grade. Major findings reveal that first- and last-week  mean raw scores earned by the students were 44.1 and 51.1 respectively for the TASK exam and 70.8 and 112.2 respectively for the vocabulary test. Though there were no significant differences between the test scores of the day and evening students, the evening students average course grade of 2.76 was higher than the day students average grade of 2.20. Of the variables, post-test vocabulary scores showed the highest correlation with the final grade. The study report presents data tables which compare test score distributions and grades among day and evening students and detail statistical findings. (JP)",

Introductory remarks indicate (1) the extent to which divorced parents are denied consistent and positive support from legal and counseling institutions, schools and the work-place, and (2) the archaic institutionalized attitudes toward divorced parents which impair adjustment for the families. The first presentation discusses experiences faced by single parents in coming to terms with their past and managing the present. Subsequently, experiences of mothers without custody of their children are reported and reflected upon. Problems of adjustment of women who have chosen to live separately from their children are also discussed. The following  presentation reports on the visiting role experienced by men who wish to remain engaged in the lives of their children. The next topic describes the family forum--a form of therapy for families of divorce. Ways in which the therapist helps to create a setting safe for productive discussion are indicated. Next, several aspects of joint custody are discussed and ways of reducing parental conflict are indicated. The final presentation explores the phenomenon of minifamilies within the stepfamily.

Group 1 consisted of 24 infants and Group 2 of 16 infants. The auditory stimuli was the mother's voice. Infants in both groups were initially positioned by their mothers behind a screen in a room with two doorways. Once the mothers had surreptitiously left the room, the infants were lured out from behind the screen by two toys placed in the center of the room. Thirty seconds after the infants reached the toys, their mothers called out to them. In Group 1, the mothers called every 30 seconds until the infants began to crawl to one of the two doorways. In Group 2, the mothers called only once. Results from the first trial  indicate that infants are capable of using maternal sound cues in guiding their search behavior. There was, however, a significant decline in successful search behavior in the second trial in which the mothers departed through the doorway not used in trial one. The infants' visual behavior--amount of time spent looking at the two open onset of crawling--was also briefly studied. (Author/JA)",

Thirty-two low-socioeconomic status (SES) black and 25 middle-SES white children (all 4th graders) served as subjects. The children were read nine short stories, each comprised of two premise statements and a filler sentence. The children were then tested by a recognition procedure involving 36 randomly presented test sentences. Four sentences (presenting true premise, false premise, true inference, and false inference) were associated with each story. Following a 60-second distractor task, subjects in the first experiment were asked to make yes/no recognition decisions based on whether the test sentence was identical to a sentence presented during the original  reading of the stories. Consistent with the constructive (integrative) view oF memory, middle-SES white children made few errors, except for true inference test sentences. Low-SES black children also had a high error rate for true inference items. It was suggested, however, that this outcome may not reflect integrative memory because they also had a high error rate for false inference items. Subjects in the second experiment were asked to make yes/no recognition decisions based on whether the test sentence was semantically congruent with original story content. Analysis of corrected recognition scores indicated that middle-SES white children retained more premise information than low-SES black children. However, the populations were equivalent in their retention of inference information.  (Author/RH)",

Part II, Topics in Parent Education, requested respondents to indicate the extent to which their planned program activities dealt  with a selected range of topics. Part III, Program Description, asked respondents to describe aspects of their programs. Part IV, Participant Description, requested that respondents provide demographic information about the clients they serve according to four main variables: (1) family type; (2) employment pattern; (3) racial group; and (4) income level.

Subjects were 64 middle class preschool children (32 boys and 32 girls). The children's ages ranged from 3.6 years to 5.7 years. In the goal-contingency conditions, completion of a given quantity of active work was promised to decrease waiting time for the preferred reward, implying that the child's active work would be instrumental in shortening the delay period. In the response feedback conditions, the child was provided with immediate and continuous feedback on the quantity of active work done. Sex-of-subject was the third independent variable in the 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design. The  dependent variables were delay time and active work total (the quantity of active work completed during the period measured by delay time). Age-of-subject was investigated for its effects as a concommitant variable. As predicted, response feedback and the goal-contingency effectively increased delay time and active work total, while sex-of-subject did not. Significant statistical effects were found for age-of-subject. There were no significant statistical interactions. The findings were discussed in light of prior literature on performance goals, response feedback, outcome expectancy, outcome attribution, intrinsic motivation, behavioral differences of the sexes, and developmental differences in self-verbalization.

The question is explored through a reanalysis of data gathered in a previous 6-year study that varied English and Tagalog instruction across grades one through six in 18 Philippino classrooms. It was concluded that (1) proficiency in English is directly related to the number of years in which it is used as the medium of classroom instruction, and (2) the average level of literacy in Tagalog is not closely related to the number of years in which it has been used as a medium of classroom instruction. Throughout the reanalysis of the Philippino data, methodological considerations which should be applied  when choosing the unit of analysis, covariates, and variables for use in a multivariate analysis of covariance procedure are demonstrated. The conclusions of the original study were supported by the reanalysis of the data. On the basis of these results, it is recommended that English be used as the language of instruction for non-native speakers of English and that such instruction be accompanied by appropriate instruction in native language arts and culture.

Responses of the mothers to their infants' prosocial behavior were also analyzed. Subjects were twenty 1-year-old infants and their mothers. On the basis of the infants' neonatal history each pair was assigned to one of two groups: Intensive Care Nursery (ICN) group and non-ICN group. After completing the Bayley Mental Scale, mother-infant pairs were seated in an observation room in which four toys were arranged on the floor. A videotape of each pair was scored for the frequency of seven infant behaviors: pointing to toys in the room; showing toys to mother; bringing toys to mother; giving toys  to mother; playing with toys in mother's lap or hands; vocalizing to mother while playing with a toy; and smiling at mother while playing with a toy. Three maternal behaviors were scored: vocal responses to infant behaviors; physical responses to infant behaviors; and posture. Examination of the data indicated that ICN infants displayed sharing behaviors less frequently than non-ICN infants. ICN infants exhibited fewer proximal behaviors (such as giving) than non-ICN infants. However, the more distal behaviors (such as pointing, vocalizing) were equally frequent in the two groups. Mothers of ICN infants were not as responsive to their children's behaviors as were non-ICN mothers. (Author/JA)",

In addition, young mothers seldom have any educational preparation for childbearing and parenthood, since many schools do not offer courses in this area. However, preparation for parenthood and comprehensive prenatal care can prevent most of the serious risk factors in adolescent childbearing. (Author/JA)",

        "description":"The interactional teaching patterns of 36 fathers and mothers with their 6-year-old sons and daughters were studied. Parents were asked to play (in parent-child dyads) with their child on a jigsaw puzzle and to teach the child to remember 25 picture cards that could be divided into conceptual categories. It was found that parents' instructional behaviors did not differ as a function of their own sex but rather on the basis of their child's gender. Parents attempted to teach their sons more general problem-solving strategies, and were both more directive and more approving or disapproving of sons than of daughters. Female children, by contrast, were interacted with in a more cooperative, concrete, and specific fashion than were male children and were given more feedback about  their performance. In addition, the teaching interaction was found to be effective in terms of helping the child remember more items than were recalled without training. Several explanations for these sex of child effects are proposed. (Autnor/RH)",

Parts I and II focus on (1) single parents and issues in paternal deprivation and (2) sex stereotyping and issues in maternal deprivation, respectively. More particularly, Part I discusses the effects of divorce and death on children and the problem of providing for nurturance by fathers in modern society. Cross-cultural variability in fathering patterns is accented and paternal influence on child development in terms of sex role stereotyping and intellectual development is discussed. Feminization of behavior and cognitive skills in sons, and effects of father absence on daughters are considered. Part II deals with the issues of sex stereotyping as personality deprivation. The relationship  of paternal and maternal deprivation to school phobia, and the issues of schizophrenia, rejection of children and child abuse are explored. Part II explores the issue of maternal employment in terms of sex stereotyping, mother's morale, delinquency, and academic performance. In conclusion, emotional, social and intellectual effects of day care are noted. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Adults must understand the development of the child's concept of death to comprehend children's questions about death and answer them appropriately. Children under 5 years of age view death as reversible and not final and may believe that the dead can breathe, feel, talk and continue to grow. While young children may believe in the reversibility of death, separation by death is a painful experience for them. At the age of 5, children become very curious about death and may believe that they and other children do not die. By 7 or 8 years of age, children begin to develop a realistic concept of death and to come to terms with their own mortality. At the concrete level of thinking, death may be personified. Children who have lost a parent through death may exhibit symptoms of  bereavement which may be more intense if the child has been lied to and/or has not been permitted to mourn sufficiently. However, even under the best of conditions, bereaved children may commit anti-social acts, be depressed or become extremely good. Bereaved children should be helped to regain feelings of security through love and acceptance and may need the assistance of a substitute comforter. (Author/RH)",

It identifies statistical patterns and characteristics common to rural areas, both within regions and those that cut across regions. It discusses: (1) characteristics of rural school districts that define and delimit their current delivery systems and their capacity for providing education; (2) demographic characteristics of the population to be served and the ability of rural communities to provide services; (3) rural poverty and deprivation that affect the need for services and the choice of criteria by which services are targeted; (4) geographic features that  influence the delivery of services; and (5) labor market characteristics that affect the programs to be offered in the curriculum and the targeting of funds. The monograph also stresses that, while people in rural communities tend to be more alike than people in large cities, rural communities across the country tend to be more unlike each other than large cities across the country; therefore, local conditions need to be carefully considered in all State and Federal policies.

There are short sections on student selection, state regulations, program funding, and program evaluation. A section on program development includes items under needs assessment, community/parent involvement, program design and development, curriculum and classroom materials, staff requirements, and program/student evaluation.

State priorities were met through implementation of approximately 60 projects conducted through local educational agencies. Program continuity was implemented through various strategies, including efforts to coordinate the North Carolina program with those in other states. Approximately 14,000 migrant students were served in more that 100 schools during the regular school term; 31 summer programs were offered for migrant students. Each project used teachers or paraprofessionals for supplementary individual or small group instruction in areas of deficiency. More  children were served in 1980 than in previous years, and 15 new projects were initiated. Numerous staff development activities contributed to the success of local projects. Lack of suitable instructional space was the most common program weakness reported. Other problems included lack of trained personnel, lack of parental interest and involvement, and laxity in following requirements of the Migrant Student Record Transfer System. Project strengths included favorable teacher-pupil ratios, individualized instruction, and cooperation of other agencies in providing needs of migrant families. Tabular data and recommendations for state and local program management are included. (CM)",

Transportation problems encountered were attributed to environmental/geographic factors, inadequate funding coupled with high costs, lack of public transportation, parental inability to provide transportation, and difficulty in securing cooperation and support from other agencies. Strategies and suggestions for coping with transportation problems included: (1) maintaining contact with families through the mail, telephone, and CB or ham radios; (2) efficient scheduling and teaming to cut down on the number of trips required and to  reduce boredom/fatigue factors; (3) scheduling visits to families on a biweekly rather than weekly basis; (4) using staff vehicles for reaching and/or transporting families; (5) encouraging parents to carpool to center-based programs; and (6) coordinating efforts with social service agencies and educational systems. Respondents offered fewer strategies for dealing with the lack of public transportation than for any other identified problem. Almost all projects responding to the transportation surveys reported that they had not found long-term solutions to their transportation problems; however, a number of short-term solutions were identified.

The book begins with a discussion of values, describing Maslow's hierarchy of needs and examining a Sioux value system. The book lists six goals of career education (favorable attitudes, work appreciation, decision making skills, career choice, planning action, job knowledge and skills) and explains 10 career education objectives (awareness of self, others, culture, education, careers, and economics; decision making; beginning competency; skill development; attitudes and appreciation). The book describes a 4-step process of career education which includes  development of self-concept and self-awareness, decision making skills, environmental understanding and awareness, and a relationship with the world. The elements of a career education program are explained: curriculum; information bank; information, media, and resource system; observation; guidance and counseling; educational and occupational placement; and research and evaluation. Roles and responsibilities of administrators, teachers, career education specialists, parents, and students are described. A program checklist is included. (SB)",

        "description":"Education service requirements mandated by Public Law 94-142 and Section 504 of the 1973 Vocational Rehabilitation Act emphasize the need for interorganizational relationships in rural schools. A survey of 43 special education cooperatives and 32 districts in 17 states indicates that by the 1979-80 academic year 97% had developed interagency agreements to facilitate a free, appropriate public education for rural handicapped students. While regionalized rural service delivery allows a greater range of special services to be provided at greater cost effectiveness by fewer personnel, regionalized special education often results in arguments over locus of decision-making control, the location of the unit, personnel choices, loss of community pride and ownership in programs, and  higher transportation costs. Data on interagency collaboration gathered during 1980-81 by a telephone survey of representatives of 100 federal agencies, national professional organizations and federally funded handicapped regional projects reveal that role clarification is essential among all involved agencies, &quot;turf&quot; issues must be resolved at national levels, internal agency plans as well as a systematic national plan and central leadership are needed, and resource constraints and lack of communication between local and federal agencies are concerns.

Part II presents numerous strategies which are available and should be explored, together with examples and indications of where they might be appropriate. It discusses strategies within the school system, strategies in cooperation with other school districts, and strategies using educational and community institutions outside the school system. Part III explores issues and concerns which are common to many school districts considering  decline and strategies from the perspective of different constituents. It covers the role of the high school as a community institution, the comprehensive high school, high school faculty, high school space and facilities, scheduling, transportation, working with neighboring districts or other institutions, program costs, and roles of the states. Part IV offers concrete advice on how to plan for decline. It discusses planning, defining problems and goals, setting priorities, exploring and evaluating options, and developing a plan of action.

The results discussed are those of a feasibility study conducted in fall 1978, which involved 3,835 students. Among the findings, the data revealed that all students in third grade have difficulty in differentiating between the concept of fraction and the concept of ratio when in a parts to whole context. It was also found that students at the sixth-grade level  have difficulty adding and subtracting fractions or multiplying a whole or mixed number by a fraction. Performance patterns are identified for both groups in fractional number skills and suggestions for improving instruction are advanced. (MP)",

Broad focus techniques were used, which include both a survey of 201 CAUSE project directors and the content analysis of 273 funded CAUSE proposals. The content analysis of CAUSE proposals provides an overview of the way projects were described before they were implemented; the survey of CAUSE directors portrays the projects as seen by project directors either during implementation or after project completion. Numerous tables list directors' responses to individual items on the survey questionnaire. (CS)",

Some common errors and/or &quot;sloppiness&quot; in the typical textbook presentations are noted, and suggestions are made that these problems could lead to pupil difficulties in understanding mathematics. The ambiguity of interpretation of number sentences of the forms &quot;a+b=c&quot; and &quot;a-b=c&quot; leads into a comparison of the familiar use of binary operations with a unary-operator interpretation of such sentences. The second half of this document focuses on points of view that promote varying approaches to the development of mathematical skills and abilities within  young children. The importance of meaning and understanding, particularly among young pupils, is promoted. An interpretation of symbolic notation within the domain of natural or whole numbers is emphasized which stresses &quot;change-of-state&quot; and is thought to be a neglected and potentially useful approach to number operations for young children. Investigations are called for to test instructional methods that focus on states and operators rather than operations per se, to see if the proposed change is indeed fruitful. (MP)",

The underlying phenomenon which defines the individual's cognitive limits is termed the hypothetical cognitive structure (HCS). The second phenomenon, which is a function of not only the HCS but also of experience in a content area, learning opportunities, and a person's past and present motivation, is termed the structure of the learned outcome (SOLO). The report looks at the optimum achievement of the HCS at the different developmental levels, then relates these to the SOLO levels. The reponse model is applied and summarized in a profile of response characteristics. Examples of pupils' responses in two particular  elementary mathematical items are presented with commentary.

Significant differences between an experimental group which was exposed to this instructional strategy, and the control group which was not, are explained in terms of a conceptual change model. This paradigm emphasizes: (1) different ways in which a person's conceptions may be modified; (2) characteristics of a given conception that determine whether or not it will change; and (3) how a particular conception can change. The experimental strategy was effective because it directly addressed students' misconceptions and demonstrated the fruitfulness of the  accepted science concept. It is thus important to reconcile the scientific view with each student's existing knowledge. (Author/WB)",

The findings cited investigate the relationship between grade point average, language proficiency, and performance on various mathematical tasks for a group of 60 Hispanic bilingual undergraduates majoring in technical subjects.

        "description":"This final study in a series reports the investigation in detail of the sex-related differences in the mathematics achievement of sixth grade students. Students were stratified in four intelligence levels with 91.5, 101.5, and 111.5 IQ as cutpoints. Twenty computation scores and eight contemporary mathematics scores were derived from the California Arithmetic Test and the California Mathematics Test administered to 951 students in three programs: 1965 traditional, 1965 new math (SMSG), and 1975 modern. A summary of results indicates that sex-related differences were least likely to occur at the highest intelligence level and most likely to occur at mid-intelligence levels. Many small but statistically significant differences favored the girls almost exclusively in computation.  The few statistically significant differences favoring the boys occurred in fraction division and in two contemporary mathematics variables: number-systems-and-properties, and graphs. Cross-program sex comparisons suggested the influence of the program in emphasizing or counteracting the expected (within program pattern) as sex-related differences. (Author)",

The model was designed to guide the implementation and evaluation of the goals and activities of a National Science Foundation-sponsored Academic Year Institute for middle grade (grades 4-8) teachers who teach one or more classes of science. The model accounts for three major dimensions of the curriculum development process: (1) specification of learner objectives; (2) implementation of instructional and learner activities; and (3) formative and summative evaluation. Results of the Institute in terms of the three dimensions of curriculum development are presented. Recommendations are  offered regarding the efficacy of governance for science teacher education at the pre-college level. A selected bibliography is appended. (Author/CS)",

Articles are presented in two major sections. In section one, the three papers are entitled, &quot;Socialization Perspectives for School Governance and Classroom Climates,&quot;&quot;The Rights of Children: Challenges in Today's World,&quot; and &quot;The School Environment and Citizen Education.&quot; In section two, &quot;Implications for Citizen Education&quot;, 12 articles present reflections on and responses to articles in section one, information on political education research, data regarding educational implications of various child development models, a discussion of  the relation of psychological and sociological research to education, and recommendations regarding what practitioners and researchers can do in the immediate future to improve citizen education. Recommendations, included in a paper entitled &quot;Seeking Recommendations for Practice: A Conclusion,&quot; suggest that citizen education should be supported by the whole range of educational professionals, can be encouraged by providing students with a group identity within the school, should transcend a narrow social studies approach, should concentrate on developing skills and knowledge for effective citizenship, and should foster the awareness that concepts such as justice and equality should be based on a concern for everyone's welfare.

        "description":"This paper examines the controversy over the status and objectives of the social studies and suggests ways in which educators can resolve the controversy. In addition, it offers critical comments on several recent overviews of the field of social studies, including the \"SPAN Report,\" by Irving Morrissett, Sharryl Hawke, and Douglas Superka, and \"Defining the Social Studies,\" by Robert Barr, James Barth, and Sam Shermis. The major groups holding conflicting views which have to such a large degree fragmented the field of social studies are identified as advocates of back-to-basics, the psuedo-social science specialists, and the single-minded humanists. Arguments advanced by the first group recommend that schooling consist mainly of the basic subjects such as reading, writing, and  arithmetic; the second group favors a heavy concentration of courses in history, geography, and civics/government; and people believing in the humanistic approach advocate basing the social studies curriculum on the humanities without proper regard for the social sciences. The conclusion is that the field of social studies will be improved if educators concentrate on a professional study of the foundations of social studies. The implication is that social studies would benefit if educators and, in particular, people who write about improving the field of social studies, would take the history of social studies into account and, specifically, if they would realize that social studies is a distinct field built on a tradition that borrows fully from social sciences and humanities.

        "description":"The document stresses that planning is essential to introduce arts programs into the schools and provides suggestions for the planning process. Elements of a good planning process include clearly stated goals and objectives, efficient use of existing resources, a survey of local conditions, involvement of influential school officials and community citizens, and clear rationales for fund raising. Five stages comprise the planning process. Stage one, getting started, involves establishing an organizing committee which considers key issues, decides on the scope of the committee, and establishes a planning committee. The planning committee establishes a resource group, engages consultants, defines goals, appoints a planning director, and arranges for support services and funds. Stage  two consists of gathering information and determining needs. In stage three the plan is developed by testing and revising goals and objectives, ranking recommendations, developing an administrative structure to carry out recommendations, preparing a budget, and establishing an implementation committee. In stage four the plan is tested through interviews with those affected by the plan and through public meetings. Stage five, implementation, involves fund raising, installing a permanent administrative structure, hiring staff, providing programs, and designating an ongoing committee to monitor results and keep sponsors informed. Successful planning processes in Brookline, Massachusetts; South Orange/Maplewood, New Jersey; and Santa Cruz County, California are described. (KC)",

The document not only lists appropriate agencies but also discusses how they can assist in an arts program. General suggestions for contacting the sources involve cataloging motivations, skills, and available resources, preparing a succinct program description, researching the organization to whom the proposal is submitted, beginning with modest  resource needs and expanding the program step-by-step, networking, letting the program speak for itself, and looking for ways to match resources with other resources.

        "description":"Goals and rationales for designating arts education as fundamental to the educational process are presented. The document is organized into three sections. The first two sections examine goals for schooling in the United States (as analyzed by Goodlad and others) and existing rationales advanced on behalf of the centrality of the arts to education. Of the 12 educational goals listed, the majority either fall into the domain of visual and performing arts or are goals to which the arts have a potential for contributing. Rationales advanced by some educators and artists suggest that aesthetic literacy is a singular purpose for art education. Other rationales concern ways in which fine arts education directly affects educational practice through enculturation, basic skills,  creativity, expressiveness, and communication. The third section refines the rationales discussed in the first two sections and places them within one of three categories. The first category, developing aesthetic literacy and creativity, suggests that only by learning in and about the arts can students acquire a basis for the development and refinement of aesthetic preferences. The second category, using the arts for general education purposes, lists contributions of the arts to other academic goals and to personal and social growth. The third category involves using the arts for specialized educational purposes such as education for the handicapped, gifted, and bilingual. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"A sample of 1,373 museums was selected to represent the total sample of 4,408 nonprofit museums in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Museums in the sample were surveyed in 1979 by means of a survey questionnaire and informal interviews to provide data in five areas--finance, program, facilities, personnel, and museum priorities. For the purposes of the survey, a museum was defined as an institution organized on a permanent basis for essentially educational or aesthetic purposes that utilizes a staff, owns or uses tangible objects, and cares for these objects and exhibits them to the public on a regular basis. Highlights from survey findings include that approximately one-half of all nonprofit museums were primarily history museums, one-fifth were science museums, and an  additional 14% were art museums. Findings also show that museums were fairly uniformly spread throughout the country; slightly over one-half of all museums had a membership program; almost half of museum operating income was earned and an estimated 14% of total operating income came from the Federal government; approximately two-thirds of all institutions had library facilities; slightly over one-half of all institutions had facilities for the physically handicapped; and approximately two-thirds of all museums had increasing educational roles, although the percentage of personnel devoted to educational responsibilities has remained substantially unchanged (approximately 9%) in recent years. As a priority, education ranked first, followed by exhibits, conservation, and research,  respectively. The document concludes with a copy of the survey questionnaire and tables of data. (DB)",

        "description":"Researchers working in foreign settings are often influenced by a number of factors which are quite different from factors which influence research activities in one's own culture. The hypothesis is that these cultural differences can influence research in a positive or negative way depending, at least partially, on the degree of sensitivity shown by the researcher to the unique cultural characteristics of the society in which he/she is attempting to carry out research activities. Data are based on experience and interviews gathered while working in community development in Bolivia. Factors deemed particularly influential with regard to research efforts in Bolivia and in developing nations generally include educational level and literacy, attitudes toward government within the  host country, feelings of efficacy in social and political interactions, the organizational milieu, geographical considerations (such as arranging activities/interviews to coincide with the work/leisure cycles of an agricultural calendar), and the influence of cultural differences on the interpretation of data and findings. The conclusion is that difficulties pursuant to conducting research in a foreign setting can be alleviated if researchers make every attempt to be sensitive to the cultural setting. One way of increasing cultural sensitivity is to rely upon host-country personnel to assist in the research activity. (DB)",

It is intended as a guideline for developing local curriculum and for designing instructional strategies. Students are taught to learn to manage, to buy wisely, to save and invest, to protect themselves from unscrupulous practice, and to understand the responsibilities of being a tax-paying citizen. Section I identifies the specific concepts, competencies, and learner outcomes which are the target of the middle school consumer education curriculum. Section II, which comprises the major portion of the document, describes learning activities, resources, and methods of evaluation which teachers may use in developing learner competencies. Some examples of the kinds of activities included  follow. Students compare budget plans; conduct a bake sale; use a daily newspaper to plan a grocery trip; write a weekly budget for managing their money; and visit bankers, stockbrokers, and real estate brokers to discuss various forms of investment. Also included in the document is an overview of consumer concepts K-12, a consumer code of ethics, and a case study. (Author/RM)",

Human service situations yield research results that are tentative descriptions or generalizations due to continuous change. An action research paradigm should reflect the ongoing need of the subjects to act without waiting for research results. Action research has the following characteristics which make it suited for the nature and requirements of the human services professions: (1) ongoing tentativeness; (2) recursions, or infinite revisions; (3) empirical evidence and intersubjectivity; (4) connotative definitions; and (5) collegial sharing. Appropriate fields for action research include macroeconomics, diffusion research, and clinical medicine. In all three fields,  there are areas where certainty dissipates, or where the human element intrudes. To relegate education research to the hazy realm of \"art\" denies the possibility of alternate methods of inquiry, such as action research. (FG)",

Those who write guidelines should be aware of four central questions, all of which address the communications gap between outsiders and practitioners: (1) What does it mean to say that a written guide can guide practice? Just as a travel guide decribes the surroundings, the new meaning and directions for an action should be detailed; (2) How can effective guides be written? An example of a well-intentioned but unsuccessful curriculum guide shows the uselessness of exhortation, and reveals the need for concerned background research; (3) How is the guide writer understood? The terminology and inference of words and phrases must be  clear and within the context of the beliefs of the intended audience; and (4) How can we appreciate the classroom context? An approach called \"constructive alternativism\" can help outsiders learn the substance of classroom life and can foster a language capable of allowing communication between those inside and outside the school.

In the second paper, inservice programs in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries are examined, and, in particular, the use of professional tutors in England is studied. Creative methods of developing and nurturing a natural style of teaching to counteract teacher burnout were presented in the third paper. A panel discussion on local  and regional inservice programs dealt with the implementation of inservice in the United States and from the viewpoint of the universities. The final paper focused on creating a hospitable environment for inservice at the school level. The task force reports covered the following topics, each with recommendations for future inservice practices: (1) purposes and functions; (2) large scale systems and responsibilities for inservice education in British Columbia; (3) research and evaluation; (4) the teacher and the school; and (5) delivery systems.

Comparisons are made among the directors' expectations in each category, the actual amount of time spent in each, and their frustrations and problems.

Issues which have been raised by laws  designed to protect the handicapped and selected cases which have been brought to court are examined in the third paper. The fourth paper presents an overview of safe and convenient school facilities to accommodate the handicapped. Selected books for students from kindergarten through the sixth grade that deal with the handicaps of mainstreamed children are reviewed in the fifth paper.

The study involved tracking the students registered in Options A and B, a sample of students from traditional developmental courses, and a random sample of nondevelopmental students. The study report describes the size and selection of the study sample; describes the nationally normed tests, questionnaires, and survey instruments used to place the students and to assess their ability and achievement; describes how the data were analyzed; discusses  study limitations; and presents the research questions. The study results are presented with respect to the following research questions: (1) how effective are the assessment instruments; (2) which assessment instruments are most predictive of success; (3) was the Self Assessment Checklist developed by DCC correlated to nationally normed scores; (4) did students and faculty agree on placement decisions; (5 and 6) how successful were students who followed the placement recommendations and those who did not; and (7 and 8) how important are affective skills and student goals with respect to academic success.

        "description":"Recurrent education may be defined as formal education provided outside of the traditional academic context for the purposes of: (1) continuing education in professional and vocational fields; (2) part-time instruction toward an academic or vocational degree; and (3) personal or social development. In California, while state policy encourages recurrent education, the University of California and the California State University and College system offer only student-fee-supported continuing education. Only the community college system has offered state-supported continuing education. Since 1978, post-Proposition 13 funding reductions have caused significant declines in the provision of community services by the community colleges, causing many to forecast a bleak future for  recurrent education. However, when considered in its entirety, recurrent education is rapidly expanding. Most large corporations, all levels of government, and the military are all increasingly providing educational opportunities for their employees. In addition, there are numerous examples of voluntary and informal associations and educational brokering services facilitating recurrent education. Therefore, the major challenges for the 1980's are how to inform individuals of these opportunities, how to meet their schedules and needs, and who will pay for what kinds of recurrent education--the student, the state, the private sector, or social service agencies.

        "description":"Beginning with the premise that postsecondary institutions in most states will suffer some sort of fiscal crisis in the 1980's, this paper discusses the strategies a state can use in contending with financial problems and turns to California's experiences after Proposition 13 for specific examples. After describing the two probable types of financial crisis, the paper focuses on the problems occurring when falling state revenues or tax and expenditure limitations force the reduction of institutional budgets without reference to enrollment. The paper then considers the different requirements of long- and short-term reductions and lists those budget areas and sources of revenue that are most readily available for state legislative action. Next, the paper suggests that states  consider at least three options: (1) establish a discretionary fund for unanticipated emergencies; (2) consult with all concerned parties before making final decisions; and (3) require extensive reports on the effects of reductions. Part II focuses on California's post-Proposition 13 experiences. It begins by describing the bill, its effects on the revenue base of the community colleges, the state's immediate target budget, &quot;bail out&quot; approach, and the restrictions imposed by the Legislature on institutional budgeting. The paper then reviews the state's reductions for its college and university systems. Finally, conclusions are presented for states facing similar revenue shortfalls. (AYC)",

Of the 15,297 students surveyed during registration for day classes, 9,295 (62.8%) responded; and unduplicated responses were obtained from 7,044 (65.7%) of the 10,718 students registered for evening classes. The survey instrument solicited information on students' major, sex, age, race, citizenship, veteran status, means of transportation, residence, highest degree obtained, college choice, educational goal, course load, previous CCSF attendance, educational plans, employment status, intended use of student services, rating of instruction, and family income. The study revealed that there was a continuing increase in the percentage  of females, a slight increase in student age, and a continuing increase in minority group representation. Transferring to a four-year school remained the primary goal among students, and the absence of tuition was more than ever the dominant variable in their decision to attend CCSF. More students were working full-time while pursuing their education, and, as a consequence, were carrying lighter unit loads. Career guidance and educational planning were the two student services that students most frequently intended to use. The study report illustrates trends in the responses to each questionnaire item, looking at responses of day and evening students to 1976, 1978, and 1980 surveys. The questionnaire is appended.

Selected findings, based upon a comparison of the three years, indicate that the precentage of females transferring to the universities increased between 1978 and 1979, but remained constant between 1979 and 1980. The percentage of Blacks decreased  between 1978 and 1980, while the percentage of Hispanics decreased from 1978 to 1979, but increased between 1979 and 1981. Most students earned more than 90 quarter hours before transferring to the university. While at the university, 85% of the transfer students earned a GPA of 2.0 or higher. University GPA varied from major to major, but was consistently higher for those transferring after earning 90 quarter hours than for those transferring with fewer credit hours. The total mean GPA of the transfer students decreased only slightly from 1978 to 1980, while the standard deviation remained constant.

After a statement of purpose and a delineation of participant objectives, the booklet describes how the workshop is to be conducted (i.e., using a lecture, discussion, and question-and-answer format) and evaluated. The booklet then defines community relations as the composite of all those on-going processes undertaken to gain, nurture, and maintain the support, respect, interest, and awareness of the community being served. Next, nine factors which inhibit positive community relations are enumerated, and general strategies and information instructors can use to overcome each of these factors are suggested. These factors  are: (1) concern over the quality of education; (2) parental bias toward the institution they attended; (3) unjustified fears of failing and of time and job conflicts; (4) ineffective high school counseling; (5) competition from other public and private schools; (6) difficult enrollment and admissions procedures; (7) class scheduling problems; (8) the rising cost of education; and (9) lack of awareness about the college.

After Suzanne Fletcher's introduction to the monograph, Holly Jellison reviews the activities and summarizes the roundtable discussions of the Center for Community Education. The next article, \"The Mycelium of Community Education: An Ideological Definition\" by Robert J. Shoop, offers observations and reflections about the concept of community education and suggests that definitions of community education should focus on goals and objectives rather than on programs or strategies. Clyde LeTarte's article, \"Community Education and the Community College: Problems and Promises,\" looks at the  new place of community education in the community college mission, the factors which will influence this role, and the resulting needs in the areas of needs assessment, quality control and management, research and development, and financial support. Next, James F. Gollattscheck, in his essay, \"Improving the Body Politic,\" envisions the community as a complex living organism and submits that learning to work with the various elements which comprise the total community should be a foremost priority for community colleges.

        "description":"A study was conducted in 1980-81 at Santa Ana College (SAC) to collect data on the English communication skills of non-native English speakers and to determine if a relationship existed between these skills and student's educational success. A sample of 22 classes, with an enrollment of at least 50% non-native English speakers and representing a variety of disciplines and instructional methods, was selected. The Nelson-Denny vocabulary and comprehension tests and the Comprehensive English Language Test (CELT) of listening were used to measure English ability. Study findings, based on test scores and grades of 53% of all students enrolled in the sample classes at census week (N=503), included the following: (1) Vietnamese and Spanish were the most commonly spoken non-English  languages; (2) overall, fewer A's and more B's, C's, and D's were earned in the sample classes than at SAC as a whole, however, these classes had lower withdrawal rates; (3) Anthropology 101 and Sociology 100 showed significant positive correlations between test scores and grades, while Chemistry 219, Math 180, and Music 161 showed consistently negative coefficients; (4) as a whole the grades of English and non-native English speakers were comparable; and (5) success rates tended to favor students who had completed English courses. The study report discusses methodology, statistical findings, and limitations and is appended by statistical data tables. (KL)",

        "description":"The findings of nine studies comparing the symbolic play of middle-class and lower-class children are summarized and examined in detail. Related research problems are discussed and directions for future research are indicated. Examination of the studies indicated that few general conclusions can be drawn from them about the relative quality of symbolic play among lower-class and middle-class children. However, there is agreement among studies that the content of play themes and roles is the same among middle-class and lower-class children, and that the amount of verbalization is greater among middle-class than lower-class children. More investigators report that group play is more prevalent among middle-class than lower-class children; more report that &quot;persig&quot; play (often called  role-differentiation and similar to what Piaget called collective symbolism) is more prevalent among middle-class than lower-class children; and more report that middle-class children are more likely to use semi- and non-representative as well as imaginary signifiers than lower-class children, while lower-class children are more likely to use representative signifiers than middle-class children. Concerning the relative cognitive maturity of the play of the two populations, no general conclusions can be drawn. Other factors which may have affected the studies' results are suggested and the need for a more holistic, integrative, and qualitative approach is indicated. (Author/RH)",

Froebel's approach to kindergarten education is described and the introduction of kindergarten programs in the United States by various sponsors such as the Women's Temperance Union, churches, and settlement houses is depicted. Programmatic change from Froebel's theologically oriented rationale to the concepts and practices of progressive education to the prescriptive kindergarten programs of the present as well as changes in the number of children attending kindergarten are delineated. Subsequently, continuities and discontinuities in curriculum development are identified and changes in developmental theories used to justify early  childhood education are pointed out. Concluding sections discuss pressures for early instruction in academic skills, the increased use of standardized tests to assess kindergarten achievement, and the presently inadequate preparation of kindergarten teachers. Suggestions are made for influencing future directions of kindergarten education. (Author/RH)",

Topics addressed include social influences on language acquisition, code-switching in bilingual communities, and the relationship of enculturation and acculturation to the development of bicultural competence. In addition, children's development of metalinguistic awareness in their second year, the influence of first language acquisition on second language acquisition for children 2 years of age or older, vocabulary acquisition, peer influence on language learning, and children's language use in the context of social interaction are explored. Four hypotheses that have been proposed to account for observed differences  in children's ability to become bilingual in educational contexts are reviewed. Concluding sections of the paper offer three basic principles which underlie the teaching of a second language to young children and 10 guidelines for teaching second language learners.

The discussion begins by defining and illustrating the motivational states of intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, and amotivation. Problems of structuring interaction between teachers and students to promote intrinsically motivated learning are considered. Next, lines of research revealing the human need to understand reward contingencies as well as research indicating factors (such as extrinsic rewards, externally imposed controls, and negative feedback) that diminish intrinsic motivation are reviewed. Factors such as choice and positive competence feedback that tend to foster intrinsic motivation are also  discussed. Special emphasis is subsequently given to additional studies revealing (1) effect of rewards and communications on intrinsic motivation to be dependent on whether they are interpreted by recipients as primarily informational or controlling, and (2) differences in achievement and motivation between active and passive learners. In conclusion, problems such as the work conditions in schools that undermine teacher's intrinsic motivation and the curriculum standardized for accountability associated with creating classroom programs characterized by intrinsic motivation, informational contingencies, and autonomous learning are pointed out.

        "description":"The prosocial behavior of 52 preschool children was assessed using three different approaches: naturalistic observation, laboratory measures, and teacher ratings. During the naturalistic observation, an observer, either male or female, focused on one child at a time and recorded any examples of prosocial behavior demonstrated by the child as well as the antecedents (whether a request preceded the behavior and, if so, which type of request) and the consequences of this behavior (whether the recipient expressed gratitude or reciprocated). Each child was observed for an average of 79 minutes over a period of 5 months. During the last month of the observation, laboratory measures of perspective taking, prosocial behavior, and empathy were taken. Three teachers then rated the  children's prosocial behavior under different eliciting situations: explicit request from the teacher, explicit request from another child, or spontaneous behavior without a request. Analysis of the antecedents and consequences of the prosocial behavior, the structured measures of perspective taking, and the components of empathy suggest the relative importance of various contextual and motivational influences on each type of prosocial behavior. Preschool children demonstrate a sensitivity to the needs and feelings of their peers, and this capacity, though not tapped by traditional measures of perspective taking, may mediate prosocial behavior in the natural setting. Methodological implications are also presented. (Author/MP)",

A short questionnaire, intended to provide a global picture of early identification work being carried out was sent to all elementary school boards in Ontario. In order to provide a more developed analysis, a second, more detailed, questionnaire was sent to a sample of 27 boards; representatives from this group were then given an extensive interview. School boards were requested to provide information about: (1) rationales for programs, including goals and reasons for inception; (2) the existing programs and procedures used in both identification and intervention work;  and (3) the maintenance of programs, including such topics as money, time, and type of personnel involved in the programs, program evaluation, and in-service training. In general, it was found that a wide variety of practices, perceptions, and attitudes exist among school boards regarding early identification and intervention. Lack of clarity and lack of consistency with regard to purpose, goals, procedures, and techniques were frequently apparent within and between school boards. Recommendations emphasize the need of the Ministry of Education to take a strong leadership role in advocating the concepts and practices of identification and intervention programs. (Author/MP)",

First, caregivers should be familiar with Eriksonian and Piagetian developmental theory. Second, caregivers should be aware of the guidelines for practice provided by empirical research. (Secure attachment, for instance, has been found important for the mental health of infants and toddlers, and is associated with successful learning, obedience and compliance, sociability and altruism, and competence. Research findings also indicate the significance of adult language transactions for infant language development and the importance of body contact and emotional responsiveness between caregivers and infants.) Third, topics  for caregiver training should include infant development, interpersonal skills in the process of reciprocal interactions with infants, logistical and practical skills, and ways to encourage parent-caregiver partnership. In conclusion, the paper recommends 10 personal and contextual ways of fostering competence in caregivers being open to such as modeling desired behaviors, clarifying values, and providing praise.

        "description":"Parents of handicapped children can provide valuable assistance to child caregivers and should be encouraged to become involved in the observation and education of their handicapped child. However, obstacles to optimal parent-caregiver cooperation may exist. Parents and caregivers may have different views of the infant and differ in knowledge of child growth and development; parents may be distressed by the birth of a handicapped child, and some parents may not immediately be able to respond to the emerging needs of the newborn and those of their spouse. Providers' attitudes may also reduce parent-caregiver cooperation if they reflect the disillusionment of caregivers, rigidity in use of materials, and disapproval of parents' lifestyle. Providers can improve communication with  parents by (1) starting the relationship with parents as early as possible, (2) providing reliable support, (3) sharing knowledge about child development, (4) improving observation skills, (5) holding discussions with parents, (6) encouraging parents to think about the consequences of their behaviors, (7) encouraging parents to be positive, (8) sharing joy in small developmental advances, (9) praising specific achievements of parent and child, (10) treating the parent as an expert on details of the child's experiences, (11) using parent involvement techniques consistent with family needs, (12) marshaling community resources to serve parents, and (13) providing support for caregivers working with parents.

        "description":"The major purpose of this study was to assess the degree to which cognitive style, as indexed by the Matching Familiar Figures Test (MFFT), is related to the way in which children respond to problems with social or interpersonal content. Fifty-two reflective and 64 impulsive first- and second-grade boys were presented with a number of stories in which one of the characters was faced with a decision as to how to react to other people in a variety of conflict situations. A number of different types of responses were presented to each child who was required to select the one he considered most appropriate. To further examine the relationship between cognitive style and various social behaviors and personality characteristics, a teacher-rating scale was completed by the subjects'  teachers (N=13). Each child was rated on six different dimensions of classroom behavior: aggression, need achievement, anxiety, academic disability, isolation, and extraversion. Results indicated that the impulsive boys consistently responded more quickly than did the reflectives. Also, the impulsives considered yielding to be an appropriate response to social conflict more frequently than did the reflectives, while the reflectives viewed assertive behavior or direct confrontation to be more appropriate than did the impulsives. Teacher ratings on Miller's (1972) School Behavior Checklist yielded no differences between the two cognitive style groups on any of the six classroom behavior measures. (Author/MP)",

The first booklet describes potential user groups--the types of children who are expected to use the playground, activities that are suggested for each user group, and special features needed in the playground. (The groups expected to use the playground include able-bodied children, children with neuromuscular and orthopedic disabilities, children with mental retardation and brain injuries, children with visual and hearing impairments, children with arthritis, and children with chronic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, epilepsy,  and hemophilia.) The comprehensive research studies that underlie the project, including site analysis and criteria, are also described. The second booklet deals with the design competition program, devised by the city of New York to encourage the widest variety of approaches and solutions to the unique problem this kind of playground presents. The program specifies the various safety requirements, special recreation needs, duration and maintenance of the playground, rules of the competition, and evaluation criteria to be used in judging the entries. In addition, an appendix indicates wheelchair dimensions for different age groups; specifies clearances and dimensions for ramps, steps, handrails and doorways; and suggests layouts for changing areas, toilet rooms, and several other  playground components.

        "description":"In the Soviet theory of cognitive development, originated by Vygotsky and elaborated by Leont'ev, acts occur at three levels of abstraction: activities, actions, and operations. According to this theory, an activity has an associated motive and may function directively as a motive. While many activities are possible, one activity tends to predominate at any particular time and &quot;leads&quot; in the sense of being at the top of a hierarchy of possible activities, which varies across cultures and age levels. Within the framework of this developmental theory, an action can be performed efficiently only if it is uncomplicated or if the component operations are performed in a coordinated way, without conscious effort. The theory refers to motoric as well as to verbal behavior and is  reconcilable with the findings of animal behavior studies. The apparent reconcilability of the theory with behaviorism is illusory because, in the Soviet theory, thought refracts as well as reflects reality. According to Soviet philosophers, reflection and refraction are properties of all matter, and their quality depends on the nature of the matter. In the human, reflection and refraction are properties of the brain. In this form, they are called consciousness. Thus, consciousness becomes an extraordinarily potent factor in altering the nature of reality. (Author/RH)",

Data were gathered from individuals associated with colleges and universities, organizations, and agencies located in the six-state region encompassing Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. All three studies were done by survey questionnaire or by a combination of paper-and-pencil instruments, questionnaires, and structured interviews. For the study of parent involvement training in pre-service education, 575 teachers of elementary  education courses completed the survey questionnaire. The study of influences on parent models of child socialization obtained data from members of two parent organizations: Mothers Incorporated and Mothers of Twins. The study of the relevance of parent education programs surveyed the directors of parent education programs of any type and decision makers in other agencies, such as the Junior League and the American Red Cross in the six-state region. Results are discussed.

The primary purpose of this conceptual framework was to define the scope of activities appropriate to the consortium. Following the first section's brief introductory overview of CFMCS's purpose, section two briefly discusses the social services environment in which monitoring takes place in terms of state differences in scope of approach, terminology used, and organization of monitoring and related activities. The third section sets forth a definition of monitoring as a management control  process. The definition clarifies what is included in monitoring, sets boundaries to exclude certain activities, and suggests looking at monitoring as a process that seeks to increase both program quality and management efficiency on an ongoing basis. A general monitoring classification framework, reflecting what is happening in day care monitoring in the five consortium states, is presented in section four. The final section discusses issues related to the extension of the monitoring concepts to other children's services. (Author/MP)",

Additionally, possible determinants of variation in rate and style of language development at home were sought, and antecedents of differential progress in the early stages of learning to read were investigated. The sample included 128 children, half 15 months old and half 39 months old, selected from a random sample to give equal representation to both sexes, to four classes of family background, and to birth at each of the four seasons. Results pointed to the importance of preschool experience for children's  progress in the early years of schooling and in particular suggested that it was the quality of parent-child interaction that differentially equipped the children to benefit from school. Subsequently, observations of naturally occurring linguistic interaction in the early years of schooling were conducted to address questions about social class similarities and differences between mothers' and teachers' language usage. This third phase of the longitudinal study compared children's language experiences at home and at school, described the teaching styles of parents and teachers, and discussed antecedents of school attainment for children at 7 years of age.

It has often been suggested that parents' links with kin, neighbors, friends, and local and non-local organizations are likely to have many effects on their children's development. These effects, however, have never been systematically investigated or demonstrated. In the present study, independent interviews were held with 9- to 11-year-old children and their parents living in high, medium, and low social risk areas of Sydney, Australia. The presence and number of parents' regularly seen dependable friends (&quot;that you can call on in a crisis&quot;) emerged as a pervasive influence on child outcomes. The children's own social networks; their choice of role models; degree of  socialization; happiness with their families; and level of negative emotions were significantly related to this aspect of their parents' lives. On measures of adjustment to school, it was the nature of parents' local friendships that emerged as the main predictor, but dependable friends also had an influence, these two friendship variables being related in a complex way. A separate pattern of relationships was found in respect of availability of child care supports, with parental ties to various formal organizations as the salient predictor. The findings suggest leads in many directions, some of which are briefly discussed. (Author/MP)",

Two faceless, 30-inch unisex dolls were designed to represent the child. Depending on the situation, the dolls were dressed as either male or female or as black or white. Parents, after completing the Jourards's Self-Disclosure Questionnaire (SDQ), were asked to demonstrate nonverbally how the situation made him/her feel toward the child (i.e. the doll), and to indicate nonverbally specific feeling evoked by that situation. Using the Nonverbal Emotional Response Test (NERT), designed for this study, parents' nonverbal responses to the stimulus situations were recorded and scored.  Results indicated a positive relationship between the amount of information disclosed on the SDQ by parents and their expression of nonverbal feeling. As an implication of this study, the suggestion is made that as spouses reveal their inner thoughts and values more openly to each other they will in turn provide a similar, open relationship between themselves and their children.

Interviews during 1969 with 1,202 fifth and sixth graders and their mothers in 6 southern states, and again during 1975 with 78.6% of the original sample of students (945) and 57.8% of mothers (546) provided two-wave panel data. Contrary to extant literature, socioeconomic origins, parental child-rearing techniques or other specific influences, academic ability, or pre-adolescent aspirations were not determinants of transition to parent or spouse. A small-magnitude dependence existed between early career decision-making/academic performance and  dropping-out of school. Only three social origin variables (sex, race, maternal fatalism) had statistically significant influences on teenage marriage. Most acute correspondence of early marriage and school exodus occurred among white females; two-thirds of those married were dropouts. Black and white females were at least three times more likely to be dropouts and parents than their male peers. Parents seemed to introduce early role-transitory children to the normative structure which indicates that socioeconomic careers are supposed to be depressed by early timing of marriage and procreation, especially for females.

Nearly 6,000 small schools were scattered throughout the country with the following distributions: Northeast, 5.7%; Southeast, 5.9%; North Central, 6.1%; West, 22.5%; and Plains, 59.8%. From each region and each school type, 60 randomly selected schools were sent 3 different questionnaires, directed to: teachers, who returned 41.6%; administrators, who returned 41.6%; and school board members, who returned 29.6%; total response rate was 38%. Communities surveyed reported their schools were meeting their objectives for:  training in basic academic skills; preparation for work, parenthood, and citizenship; and service as a community institution. The profile provides statistical information concerning characteristics and attitudes of teachers, school board members, administrators, schools, and communities; and a report on the sample check which randomly sampled 62 non-responding principals by telephone to ascertain whether there were any significant differences between responding and non-responding schools.

        "description":"A 28-day visit to the People's Republic of China during June and July 1978 by the Rural Health Systems Delegation from the United States, sponsored by the Committee on Scholarly Communication with the People's Republic of China, resulted in an exchange of information about rural health policy and planning. Specific areas of emphasis included: common disease patterns; community health; financing of medical care; ambulatory and hospital care; barefoot and traditional doctors; traditional medicine; training and education of nurses and doctors; surveillance and antiepidemic work; birth planning, diffusion of health and birth planning innovations; and mental illness. Achievements noted were preventive work and antiepidemic services. However, medical records and statistics lacked  standardization. Barefoot doctors, paraprofessionals with varied but limited medical training who perform certain health duties, evoked mixed reactions. Blending the old and traditional methods with new and scientific medical techniques produced puzzling aspects. Practitioners of traditional medicine seemed to accept biomedical orientations of Western medicine, yet often employed contradictory approaches. Generally, China was judged as achieving a momentous triumph in caring for its vast rural population. Appendices give the itinerary and hosts in China, contents of medical kits of barefoot doctors, and sample medical forms. (AW)",

        "description":"A consortium was organized in 1977 to assist 16 school districts, covering 5,100 square miles and including 19,000 students in a largely rural part of Oregon, to comply with Public Law 94-142 which requires provision for appropriate public education for the estimated 12% of the school population who are handicapped. Problems making it difficult for small districts to provide services were typical of other rural areas and included: (1) large areas comprising small districts; (2) undeveloped special education services; (3) unserved and unidentified handicapped children; (4) lack of qualified staff; and (5) uneven distribution of federal funds. Out of this dilemma evolved support for pooling federal funds under an Education Service District plan. In order to provide special  education and related services, 10 steps which a local district must follow to comply with federal and state regulations were identified (screening; referral, prior notice, and parental consent for evaluation; evaluation; multidisciplinary staffing; noneligibility reporting; parent notification of Inservice Education Program (IEP) meeting; IEP meeting; parent notification of IEP review meeting; reevaluation; and prior notice for change in special education placement), and persons responsible for each step were delineated. Background information on development of the model and the consortium program are included. (AW)",

Part I of the evaluation provides an overview of the Family Farm Program structure and components, and the methodology and sources of data gathered for the report. Part II deals with the background, goals, and functions of the Family Farm Council. Part  III discusses the Central Information Service. Parts IV and V are in-depth reports and assessments of activities at the two Family Farm Resource Centers at Kings River College and Hartnell College, respectively. Part IV presents a general summary for each program component and concludes that although it is necessary to continue to question the efficacy of the Family Farm Program, it should be recognized that the program is experimental.

Twenty-six mathematics teachers in 11 junior high schools were observed in two classes. The major purpose of this paper is to describe the classroom procedures and behaviors of teachers identified as effective classroom managers. First, the correlations of management variables and the achievement and attitude variables are considered. Next the extent to which teachers affect the classes' achievement gains is reviewed, followed by a description of the process of selecting subsamples for further analysis and description. A model of appropriate and inappropriate teacher management methods is outlined, and further illustrated by two case studies  excerpted from narrative scripts that describe a poor manager and a highly capable one. The study indicates that effective classroom management throughout the year is facilitated by several facets. Among these, the good manager made a clear set of expectations for appropriate student behavior in a wide variety of class activities, and were characterized by good monitoring and prompt handling of inappropriate behavior.

This project was undertaken by the Training Analysis and Evaluation Group (TAEG) and Academic Remedial Training (ART), Recruit Training Command, Orlando, as part of a larger project tasked by the Chief of Naval Education and Training in the area of improving basic academic skills. Of 293 recruits bound for Apprentice Training, more than 100 failed to pass a basic test of Navy numerical skills. Deficiencies were in the area of &quot;application&quot; of mathematics skills  rather than in the basic numerical operations. When selected ASVAB scores were analyzed, an effective formula was derived to predict a numerical skills deficit. The ASVAB subtest score for Arithmetic Reasoning (AR), combined with Paragraph Comprehension (PC) and Numerical Operations (NO) scores, was found to be the best predictor. (Author/MP)",

        "description":"An analysis of classroom discourse is reported in which the use of questions by science teachers is assessed in terms of arguments to establish knowledge claims. Questions are analyzed not for their form or frequency but for their function in the development of arguments which establish claims rationally. Seen in the context of rational argument, question sequences may be assessed as consistent with or distorting of the nature of scientific authority. The study seeks to develop and demonstrate a plausible conceptual linkage between a science teacher's use of questions to develop student understanding and the associated provision for students to understand scientific authority. Excerpts from three high school science lessons are analyzed in detail in the study, revealing three  different and subtle ways in which the use of questions to develop a knowledge claim has failed to establish a rational argument. The study demonstrates that it is possible and informative to analyze science classroom discourse in terms of suggested attitudes toward authority. Use of the analytical scheme by science teachers wishing to review the use of questions in personal teaching behavior is also discussed. (Author/CS)",

The general objective of the study was to provide information to policy makers on public opinion regarding the relative merits of &quot;elitist activities&quot; (high cultural activities such as attending operas and art galleries), and &quot;popular activities&quot; (a broader range of art and leisure-related activities such as camping) to development of policy on the arts. Data regarding current and likely future arts/leisure activities were collected in a self-administered mail survey of a probability sample for 13 southern states. A total of 3,196 questionnaires was delivered to potential respondents and 1,684  questionnaires were returned completed. This summary of leisure participation in the South is presented in four major sections. In Section I, the research study is introduced and the objectives and methodology are discussed. In Section II, results are summarized pertaining to various propositions about the patterns of leisure behavior and the desire to increase participation in various types of leisure/arts activities. Section III offers a summary of analyses of the structure of leisure participation in the South. The final section presents tables of data on the proportion and average of individuals participating in various leisure activites during a 12 month period, strength of desire to increase participation in various activities, reasons for increasing or not increasing activity, and  participation clusters. Major conclusions of the study were that the demand for increased participation in each activity generally follows current participation patterns and that historical participation levels are the best predictors of future participation. The document concludes with an appendix which contains a table of contents, a list of tables, and a sample of the questionnaire. (DB)",

Support systems for such programs are also discussed. Properly conceived, the arts constitute a great integrating force in the curriculum. To achieve such an end they must be viewed as a component of every discipline. The arts are the responsibility of all teachers. Examples of how the arts are being infused into the curriculum in various schools are included. For example, at the Grover Elementary School in Marblehead, Massachusetts, the harpsicord and its music are studied in physics, shop, social studies, and language arts courses. The science and shop teacher demonstrates how the  harpsichord sound is produced. Relating the discussion to the basic principles of sound, a study unit in physics is introduced. In shop, students make their own monochords. They learn how design affects change in tone and how materials affect the quality of sound. In social studies, students learn about the composers Bach, Handel, and Scarlatti, social conditions, musical taste, and articistic decoration of the 17th and 18th centuries. The monograph concludes with a discussion of support systems including, regional, districtwide, and statewide systems. (Author/RM)",

Creative collaboration between artists and the schools can take many forms. The artists involved may be professionals, amateurs, parents or community members, local university or high school students, or members of touring companies. Their level of involvement at the school can range from a single performance to a long term residency, or a situation between the two extremes - adjunct faculty member, para-professional, consultant, resource team member, featured artist, or short term resident. Some examples of the programs described in the monograph include the following. Two programs - one in San Francisco and one in Chicago - were  started by parents who felt their children were not receiving adequate exposure to the arts in the public schools there. As a result of the Alvarado Art Workshop and Network in San Francisco, murals now appear in hallways and classrooms, flowers flourish in 25 schools and in housing projects, and model arts programs now exist in the schools. In Chicago, the &quot;Urban Gateways&quot; program provides a variety of arts resources and courses for K-12 teachers and students. The monograph concludes with guidelines for effective artist/student/teacher partnership. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"This monograph, one in a series, describes ways in which elementary teachers have brought arts to the classroom. Descriptions of what teachers are doing are organized by themes. The first theme is the use of the arts in basic skill development. One teacher in Casper, Wyoming, produces rebus books for her students. These books offer a means of expressing words by using drawings or pictures which the children can identify using the correct word for the visual cue. Another teacher in a low income neighborhood of Washington, D.C. developed a very successful creative writing and dramatic arts program to provide remedial reading and language development assistance. The second theme is the value of the arts for their own sake. In one elementary school in Indiana, students  enthusiastically produce a literary magazine \"Harmony Times.\" The third theme focused on how some teachers use the arts to nurture self expression and individual achievement. Through one teacher's use of the arts in the classroom, students who had not previously experienced the satisfaction of achievement in traditional subject areas blossomed. The remaining themes of the monograph include the use of the arts to overcome community isolation, introduce and reinforce cultural and ethnic pride, and meet the needs of special students; the integration of the arts throughout the course of study; and the demonstration of professional leadership.

The objective is to help to counteract the scarcity of available teaching materials on the role and scope of the United Nations and its specialized agencies in the contemporary world. The guide is presented in five sections. Section I deals with students' preconceptions about the United Nations and the media's role in shaping those perceptions. It provides an overview of two concepts--interdependence and development. Section II provides an overview of the United Nations' purpose as stated in its Charter. It also discusses the organizational structure of the United Nations and identifies some of the major substantive issues on the UN  agenda. Section III offers an historical perspective on the United Nations. Section IV presents an outline which students can follow when conducting case studies of the work of the United Nations in various countries. The final section contains appendices, including rules for a global energy game, the agenda of the General Assembly, and a listing of UN conferences and special sessions. Within each section, information is organized in an expanded outline format. Outline headings vary slightly from section to section but generally include background, overview, discussion questions, activities, vocabulary, and a summary of the main points. A wide variety of activities is suggested, including analyzing selected readings related to the United Nations, administering world affairs questionnaires  to classmates, collecting and analyzing news clippings, keeping daily accounts reflecting how and when the world impacts on daily life, playing educational games, and doing research projects on a variety of UN-related subjects.

        "description":"This paper reviews ranking studies of graduate level college and university departments of sociology in &quot;The American Sociologist&quot; from its inception in 1965 through 1980. &quot;The American Sociologist&quot; was selected as the source of ranking studies because of its function &quot;as an organ of information and discussion for the professional concerns of sociologists as a social collectivity,&quot; and, specifically, because it has presented a large number of articles on prestige within the discipline. Studies reviewed in the paper are limited to those which deal with the prestige or quality rankings of departments, the changing methods of ranking studies in sociology, divergent results of the various methodologies used in the ratings, and mobility of departments over time. Most of the studies  date from 1965 through 1975 because editorial policy during this period favored rating studies whereas editorial policy after this time discouraged them. Ranking studies discussed include four which rate the faculty of graduate sociology department b total productivity (Knudsen-Vaughan, 1969; Glenn-Villemez, 1970; Oromaner, 1972; and Doering, 1972), and four which rate graduates by total productivity (Wanderer, 1966; Knudsen-Vaughn, 1969; Larson, Petronsky, and Vandiver, 1972; and Sturgis and Clemente, 1973). Findings from analysis of tabular and expository departmental rating data indicate that there exists a generally agreed-upon elite among graduate sociology depatments (Harvard, UC Berkeley, Columbia, Chicago, and Michigan), editors of prestigious journals tend to be concentrated in  these same elite departments, and the status of the institution is often a good predictor of departmental prestige.

        "description":"This paper examines the changing concept of charisma with the aim of distilling some useful meaning that may be applied to current political organizations and leaders. The author begins by exploring the different meanings of charisma and briefly overviewing how it has historically been applied. Charisma is of Greek origin literally meaning a gift, and was originally identified as a gift of grace or a divinely inspired calling to service, office, or leadership. Today the term has entered common usage in a variety of forms and is widely applied to virtually every situation in which a popular public or political personality is involved. There are three ways charisma is normally defined today. First is the Classic Weberian idea of supernatural endowment in which a leader derives his  charisma from divine gifts and maintains this power as long as his followers believe in his extraordinary qualities. Second, the term is expanded by Weber and others to refer to the sacred or awe inspiring property of groups, offices, and even objects. Third, charisma is popularly used to refer to the personal qualities or to the political presence of a leader in politics. The author then examines some of the important interpretations of charisma. In particular the interpretations of Max Weber, Carl Friedrich, K.J. Ratnam, Dorothy Willner, Robert Tucker, Arthur Schweitzer, and Bensman and Givant are discussed. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"This publication examines reading instruction techniques that can be used by teachers to diagnose and remedy students' weaknesses in reading social studies materials. There are four chapters. Chapter one discusses issues, including trends related to reading in the social studies and problems presented by social studies textbooks. Chapters two and three focus on prereading exercises that can be used to prepare students for social studies materials and active reading behaviors that can make students fuller participants in the educational exchange between text and reader. Methods to assess students (the cloze procedure, informal reading inventories, and teacher observations); techniques for assessing materials; and ways to set the stage for reading (attending to study skills and  vocabulary) are examined. Chapter three discusses active reading behaviors. There are observed behaviors that take place during and after the reading of assigned materials and really entail a holistic approach to communication involving listening, speaking, and writing, as well as reading. Chapter four focuses on implementation. Issues discussed here include education of the handicapped, individualized instruction, the reluctant reader, teacher's role, and inservice and professional growth. (Author/RM)",

It is anticipated that the foreign student population in this country, currently numbering 286,000, will triple in the 1980s. The booklet begins with general information for the foreign student. Reference works providing information about U.S. colleges and universities and guides to financial planning and scholarship support are cited. The booklet then goes on to describe organizations and agencies which can provide students with general assistance and with assistance in particular fields of study. Also  described are organizations administering foreign student exchange programs in the United States and foreign student services. The booklet concludes with a listing of U.S. embassies and other overseas posts, binational education foundations and commissions, and student counseling centers. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"This paper describes techniques for bringing the elderly and topics related to aging to children into school settings. Through the participation of older adults in the schools and the inclusion of materials on aging in school curricula, students can develop positive and accurate views of aging and the aged. The first technique discussed is curriculum activities, specifically classroom discussions, role playing, and simulations. A second approach aimed at changing the image of aging involves utilizing the talents of retired persons as volunteers or paid employees in the schools. Older adults can have part-time positions as teacher aides, tutors, visiting teachers, library aides, and playground supervisors. A third approach involves giving students course credit or wages for  participation with older adults in home, nursing home, work, or community settings. The author points out that there is a need to evaluate these techniques and programs. Often it is taken for granted that whenever such materials or opportunities are presented, they automatically result in an improved image of the elderly in the minds of young people. However, some research shows that this is not warranted. (Author/RM)",

Four topics are considered: the beginning of the school year, selecting and arranging activities, monitoring and timing activities in the classroom, and stopping misbehavior. Examples are offered of effective procedures for dealing with each of these topics. Descriptions are given of successful ways to pace activities to minimize possibilities for misbehavior, selecting occasions for intervention, sequencing classroom activities, and handling transitions from one activity to another. Recommendations are made for dealing with \"hard core\" disruptive students, punishment, and behavior modification. It is  pointed out that effective management requires: (1) extensive knowledge of what is likely to happen in classrooms; (2) ability to process a large amount of information rapidly; and (3) skill in carrying out effective actions over a long period of time.

In a paper on the implications of competency assessment for historically black colleges and minority students, positive and cautious points are made, and  steps for pursuing excellence in minority teacher education are noted. The final article is a futuristic view for assessing competence in teaching in the 1980s written for an imaginary 1990 teacher education journal.

What kinds of jobs do graduates newly qualified to teach get when they aren't teaching? and, What is the outlook for teaching jobs over the next several years? These questions are examined for bachelor's degree recipients who were graduated between July 1, 1976, and June 30, 1977. Their job status is that which existed in February 1978. In certain cases, comparisons are made with those who were graduated during the same period two years  earlier. The statistics show that there were fewer graduates newly qualified to teach in 1976-77 than in 1974-75, and that data group fared somewhat better than their peers two years earlier.

An Exercise Behavior Model was developed for the purpose of explaining exercise behavior. The model assumes that a person has four major predispositions or inclinations, which influence a readiness to exercise: (1) locus of control (perceiving one's actions to be internal or influenced by external forces); (2) attitude toward physical activities; (3) individual self concept, and (4) physical fitness, appearance, and health values. Adult women who were students in a university evening course were the subjects of the study. The following findings are reported: (1) The more favorable a person's attitude toward physical activity, the more she exercised; (2) If a  person expressed the belief that change factors such as luck or fate controlled her exercise behavior, the lower her exercise score; (3) For younger women, the more negative attitudes toward physical activity and perceived barriers to exercise (lack of time, children, etc.), the lower her exercise score; and (4) For older women, attitudes toward physical activities and chance beliefs on the Exercise Locus of Control Measure were the best predictors of exercise behavior.

Although current writings on elaboration theory agree with the research on cognition, some criticisms can be made: (1) The writings often lack clarity and specificity; (2) Empirical support is needed, especially in the area of elaboration techniques; and (3) Elaborationists should focus on the learner rather than on the learning stimulus. Elaboration theorists can use relevant elements of assimilation theory as  guidelines for developing their general learning theory, particularly in describing the effects of elaboration techniques and the roles of epitomes and advance organizers.

If teachers are taught self-control techniques where they learn to monitor their own behavior, set goals for themselves, and arrange their own environmental conditions, inservice will not only become more personalized, but will also be likely to have a more permanent influence.

Helping behavior, as distinguished from social or cooperative behavior, was most frequently observed in biology classrooms, predictably in laboratory work. Students apparently interpreted the laboratory situation as legitimate for helping or working with each other. Helping instances centered mainly on requests for  information such as definitions of terms or clarification of the assignment. Cooperation and interaction between students was rarely found during lectures, although social interactions did occur during these periods.

        "description":"A model is outlined for translating validated instructional principles into effective educational practices. Thirty-seven resource room teachers attended two three-hour workshops which were designed to train them to use an instructional program for teaching ten sight words to remedial readers. Teachers' reactions to the program were gathered as data for testing experimental modifications to the program. The first workshop began with an orientation to the principles of remedial teaching, forming the basis of the sight word program. This was followed by training in the specific program methods. Three program modifications were used for one week by three groups of teachers. The methods varied the number of words introduced at one time and the use of reduced response competition  (RRC--temporarily dropping words from list practice as they are learned). At the second workshop session, separate group meetings were held to gather data on each teaching method and to discuss teacher reactions to the program. This was followed by a general session in which the specific research was discussed. The data and the teachers' reactions indicate that teaching in five-word units using RRC was the best of the three methods. The workshop/applied research method was found to be beneficial to both practitioners and researchers. (Authors/FG)",

Performance data were collected prior to, midway through, and following training and were analyzed: (1) within treatment groups to determine if learning was evident; and (2) across treatment groups to examine the relative effectiveness of the three styles. Social skill patterns were obtained by observing learner-to-learner verbal interactions in which dyads of learners were asked to \"help\" each other learn the task. All three groups learned the task comparably well. It can be concluded that the three styles are all effective in  facilitating learning on the type of algorithmic psychomotor task studied. Style C, in which learners work in dyads, one performing the task while being provided with feedback by the other, was found not only to produce comparable task learning, but also to enhance significantly social skill development.

The handbook is written from the standpoint that, once physical education personnel and governance officials are aware of Title IX, they will wish to take the suggested action steps so that program improvement will result. The first section gives background material on the effects of the law and on beliefs and attitudes about equal opportunity in physical education. The status of current programs and new program developments are summarized. The second section presents excerpts of Title IX that are related to physical education and athletics and lists possible effects on programs and personnel with suggested actions for compliance. In the third section, case examples of  situations in physical education programs and athletic programs provide opportunities to develop skills in recognizing discriminatory or biased behavior. These skills are put to use in a step-by-step model for change in elementary secondary physical education and athletics programs. A comparison is made between steps taken to comply with the spirit versus the letter of the law. Appendices provide references, resources, sample surveys, and implementation evaluation instruments.

After an acceptant, supportive classroom environment has been achieved, personal and group goals are considered so that class activities can be shaped in a familiar context. While lists of student goals and interests can give a certain amount of impetus to instruction, if the teacher is unwilling or afraid to listen carefully to students, student interest  and commitment will not be sustained.

Recently, however, the decline in enrollment in teacher education programs and in school-age children poses pervasive and serious problems, leading to the curtailment of programs and the retrenchment of faculty. A lack of understanding of the issues facing the teacher education field may explain some current disillusions. Contrary to popular belief, all education students do not intend to become public school teachers, and, in fact, schools of education have a long tradition of providing the kind of training valuable in other, noneducation jobs. Although national, state, and individual certification procedures have been implemented to  monitor quality in teacher education, other problems remain: (1) Both enrollment and teacher demographics are in a period of change, making planning difficult; (2) Federal programs have become such a substantial part of teacher education that termination of these funds jeopardizes many activities and services; and (3) The talent pool of perspective teachers has decreased in both size and quality. It is recommended that Congress stimulate and support teacher education programs through fellowships, loan programs, and federal incentives for research and dissemination of new teaching practices.

This  structure has materialized and is now functioning. The four Academic Councils are responsible for studying, evaluating, and making recommendations on: learning management systems; course planning teams; departmental confederations; and academic assessment.

        "description":"The Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM) for staff development is an empirically-based conceptual framework which outlines the developmental process that individuals experience as they implement a new innovation. The model is based on the assumption that, when persons responsible for implementing change via inservice programs have relevant information about the people experiencing the process, they are better able to provide appropriate and effective support. In diagnosing the individual needs of participants in an educational innovation, two critical concepts are used: the stages of concerns teachers have about the innovation (awareness, informational, personal, management, consequence, collaboration, and refocusing), and the level at which they actually use the innovation in  their classrooms. Another concept deemed important in the CBAM focuses upon the innovation itself and the changes it may undergo while being implemented. Interventions possible through the planning of staff development and through the detection of individual needs are also described. A discussion is given of the way in which the CBAM model may be successfully applied in developing an inservice program. (JD)",

During one school year, the fieldwork method of research was used to discover the decisions teachers made and to describe how these decisions were reflected in their classroom practice. The four teachers made decisions on testing, grouping, materials, and management within the first month of school. After observing and reflecting on the decision-making process and through discussion with the teachers, it was concluded that the underlying purpose of decision making was not to instruct students but to manage them effectively.

To help teacher education institutions plan for and implement the standards, data on existing conditions were collected and analyzed. Information in the areas of curricula, faculty, students, management, and research and development was collected from 387 institutional members of the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education. Over half of the responding institutions (78.8 percent) indicated that they had, as part of their education programs, activities that are supportive of the multicultural education concept as described in the NCATE Standards. These institutions were  more likely to have courses or departments in ethnic and women's studies, to provide inservice training in bilingual and multicultural education, and to have a higher percentage of minority group faculty members. An analysis of institutional characteristics found significant differences based on: (1) public and private institutions; (2) NCATE-accredited and non-accredited institutions; (3) geographic distribution; (4) rural or urban setting; and (5) size of student population.

Among the findings were that thirty-four states address multicultural education through legislation, regulation, guidelines, or policies. Most states indicated that activities related to multicultural education are undertaken by units that are usually federally supported in the SEA, such as those responsible for equal  education opportunity, teacher certification and education, and bilingual education. It was also found that the approach to multicultural education taken by SEAs often excludes people who are not members of specific categories of eligibility while the state provisions focus on teaching about cultural diversity to all students.

In this study these criteria are compared with two other procedures--an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model and confirmatory factor analysis--for analyzing multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) data. The principle advantage of the ANOVA model is a convenient summary and test of convergent, divergent and method/halo effects. However, the limitations of this approach are even more numerous than those encountered with the Campbell-Fiske criteria, and so the ANOVA approach should only be used to supplement other procedures. Confirmatory factor analysis provides a direct test of the statistical significance and importance of various trait and  method factors. The size of factor loadings provide a convenient description of the magnitude of method and trait effects. By constraining various parameters the researcher may formulate and test alternative configurations of method and trait factors. Consequently, confirmatory factor analysis offers the advantages of both the other approaches without many of their limitations, and is the recommended procedure for analyzing MTMM data.

Research results related to these issues are also documented in an attempt to provide a rational basis for model selection. The application of the latent trait models is evaluated in terms of: (1) the assistance they can lend to test construction; (2) their use in the vertical equating of test scores; and (3) their use in comparing score scales. It is suggested that the target information function of the latent trait models can give control over test construction and precision, especially with the three-parameter model; but, there appears to be no acceptable way to select test items  using the one-parameter model. The latter model is criticized for perpetuating the idea that all items are equal. Even when the test battery is sorted into unidimensional subtests, it is reported that neither the one- nor the three-parameter model is adequate for vertical equating purposes. It is concluded that both models have advantages and disadvantages. The recommendation that both models be used in conjunction with traditional procedures is suggested. (AEF)",

In this method, students' relationship judgments between concept pairs are examined directly rather than by means of multidimensional scaling analysis (a common alternative to essay testing). The similarity between student and instructor judgments, and the reliability of students' judgments as predictors of structural understanding as measured by essay examinations, are investigated. Data were collected over three separate examinations in each of two experiments. In the first experiment, numerical judgments of the strength of relationships between concepts were obtained from students  in three units of undergraduate general psychology. The second experiment demonstrated that restricting relationship judgments to high reliability concept pairs increases the accuracy of essay score predicitions from predictor measures derived from reliability judgments. Reliability and correlation measures are obtained by means of multiple regression analysis. Results indicated that students' relationship judgments do not need to be analyzed through multidimensional scaling in order for them to be useful in evaluating structural understanding, and that this sample correlational approach is a valid and objective alternative to essay testing.

Score for 200 cases across 40 trials were generated to examine the behavior of aggregate stability coefficients for data with known stability characteristics. Forty replications were performed of seven studies, each study varying in the degree of stability characteristics of the scores. Aggregate stability coefficients were computed by correlating the average of even-trial scores with  the average of odd-trial scores according to the recommendations of Epstein. Since high stability coefficients were found when only a small percentage of the cases exhibited score stability, the use of aggregate stability coefficients as evidence of stable behavioral dispositions was questioned.

Encoding refers to the way in which material is learned. Four experiments were performed to evaluate these effects. Undergraduate students of educational psychology were trained and tested in one or several strategies for learning paired associates, word recognition, or free recall of words. The strategies employed differed in the depth, spread, or congruence of the encoding required. Those strategies assumed to emphasize depth or congruence of encoding were found to facilitate  recall. Self-reported strategies were most likely to facilitate recall when they involved congruent encoding or were few in number. Results were interpreted as providing support for the view that depth and congruence of encoding facilitates retention, but there was no evidence for a beneficial effect of spread of encoding. Postexperimental questionnaire data indicated, however, that this strategy was not widely used by participants. In view of this finding, a case for spread of encoding is still possible.

After undergoing two pilot tests, the final version of the LAQ was administered to individuals at five different educational levels: graduate; community college; and three groups of Army trainees--high school graduates; general equivalency diploma holders and trainees who had not completed high school. In ten of the fifteen major comparisons conducted, graduate students used each learning strategy significantly more than other groups. With the exception of rote methods, the three non-college groups of Army trainees  reported the lowest use of learning strategies. Rote strategies appeared to be used frequently by all groups of respondents. However, graduate students supplemented rote strategies with additional learning strategies. This was also true, to a lesser extent, for community college students. It appears that learners at lower educational levels may not have developed a broad repertoire of learning strategies and largely depend on rote strategies. This suggests the need for training programs designed to modify learning strategies of students and trainees at lower educational levels. Statistics, tasks, and inventories are included.

Field research was conducted over a period of five months by an evaluator in two phases; the first phase was one of observation and the second, one of participant observation. Data, collected via observation and structured and unstructured interviews, was analyzed qualitatively using methods of content, constant comparative, matrix and forcefield analyses. Analyses revealed that seven activity  categories operationally defined the linking process: engagement, context specification; diagnosis; collection; translation; presentation and disengagement. Four decision areas facing linkers were identified: scheduling and coordination of services to be delivered; and service interaction style and role. Personal, interpersonal, client, organizational, and policy factors were found to influence performance. Results supported a client-centered, linker/time referenced interpersonal communications view of the dissemination process. The results have implications for the practice and evaluation of linker activities. (Author/AEF)",

Undergraduate students enrolled in educational psychology courses were trained in the use of imagery, elaboration, and grouping strategies, and then tested on free recall, reading comprehension and paired associate tasks. Training that emphasized the process of creating learning strategies as well as the product (the strategy itself) demonstrated equivalent or superior results when compared to a program that emphasized only the product. Training that included practice using the strategies was found to be more  effective than training without such practice. However, when practice included guided discussion of the strategies generated, performance on posttest tasks was adversely affected, possibly due to trainees modeling the products presented in the discussion rather than the processes.

With these methods, it is possible for NAEP researchers to make relatively precise statements about population characteristics on the basis of fairly small samples. The purpose of this monograph is to describe what is meant by relatively precise statements about population characteristics and to show how NAEP sample data are being used to gauge the accuracy of reported results. The levels of precision for Year 01 and 02 were compared, and the overall precision was improved in Year 02. The sampling error methodology  developed for the Year 02 sample was applied to calculate Year 03 and 04 sampling errors. A major redesign of NAEP's primary sample was initiated for the Year 05 assessment. The Year 06 (1974-75) NAEP in-school primary sample was an independent replicate of the Year 05 sample selected from the deeply stratified primary unit frame developed for the 1973-74 survey.

Six hundred forty-four students, ranging between 6 and 21 years old and enrolled in 75 schools, participated in the program in two ways: (1) through direct service delivery format, whereby the student left the regular classroom setting for service; (2) by means of classroom and teacher contact, whereby the speech assistant visited the classroom for observational, needs assessment, and progress  reporting purposes. On a student group sample of 317 participants, 87% progressed at least one stage in a major selected speech/language goal, surpassing the 80% objective. Only the severe learning disabled group, with a success rate of 74%, fell below this objective. The need for citywide inservice to explain the program to pathologists and administrators was reported. Assistants had difficulties at local school level obtaining lists of Title I 89-313 student names; thus schools having accessible lists were more likely to have their students receive prompt, direct service.

Questions remain about the effects of age changes in cognition on work performance of older personnel. Changes in cognitive capacities over the adult working years are reviewed. Two major decrements are noted: a general deterioration of sensory functioning and a slowing of higher cognitive processes. The general effects of experience, combined with an increase in verbal intelligence throughout the working years, argues for increased competence of older individuals in many work situations. Because general physical health is related to the maintenance of cognitive performance throughout adult life, medical  and psychological research should be initiated to develop indices of an individual's functional age by individual differences in physical health and health-related behaviors. The goal would be the development of a reliable medical and psychological screening procedure to identify older personnel at risk for performance decline.

To illuminate the notion of competence, Chapter 1 presents: definitions of competence from the vantages of several disciplines; four basic principles underlying the development of competence; factors influencing competency; issues pertinent to program development and; a model of competence. Literature is reviewed in Chapter 2 in order to define CBE. The authors propose that CBE is essentially an instructional paradigm assuming different programmatic forms in different contexts. Appropriate instructional strategies are examined in Chapter 3. Guidelines herein suggested for planners also have implications for teachers. Thirteen CBE programs currently being implemented throughout the nation are presented in the following chapter. Concentrating on the evaluation issue of how competencies can be assessed, Chapter 5 discusses conditions affecting role based assessment. The final chapter notes that minimum competency testing constitutes a major component of secondary education and that few schools have realized the potential for development. Future implications are suggested. (Author/AEF)",

        "description":"What is the nature of value and how can one identify the value claims made in evaluation documents? What is the proper philosophic basis for the treatment of values in evaluation? These and related concerns are addressed in this report. It is suggested that evaluation documents have a structure of claims or a conceptual design, and that, by means of philosophic analysis the philosophical assumptions may be revealed and the philosophical grounds for evaluation understood. Part 1 provides a systematic method for analysis of claim structures. The method is QUEMAC Value. QUEMAC is an acronym of six elements related to evaluation documents: question; unquestioned assumptions; event/object; method; answer/claims; concept/conceptual structures. The method and the associated technique of  concept mapping are shown to be valuable in the construction of a document's philosophy and as aids to reveal the source and meaning of criteria of excellence. A Headstart program evaluation document is analyzed to illustrate the method. Philosophic questions growing from concern with the key concept of value are probed in Part II. Specific issues dealt with are: utilitarianism and evaluation; educational value; the distinction between &quot;value&quot; and &quot;having values&quot;; and the virtue/function claim.

Ways in which such cases are used in instruction are discussed. Types of information an evaluation case history might contain are then documented and the QUEMAC acronym is presented as a model of this. QUEMAC is comprised of a series of six points that should be incorporated in an evaluation: questions (issues); unquestioned assumptions (principles); event/object evaluated (case facts); answers/claims (decisions); concepts/conceptual structure (legal principles). Legal case history parallels appear in parenthesis. This model also requires the inclusion of procedural history for evaluation purposes. Three  essential devices of the case method of instruction are discussed in terms of how they might be applied to the education of evaluators: (1) case-book; (2) student class participation; (3) problem-type examination items. In conclusion, it is suggested that implementation of such an instructional method may prove difficult since no system exists whereby evaluation case histories are written up, and the exposition of the logic underlying an evaluation is rarely given in an evaluation report.

        "description":"One of a series of research reports examining objective principles successfully used in other fields which can lend integrity and legitimacy to evaluation, this report presents an overview of operations research (OR) as a potential source of evaluation methodology. The nature of the methods common to this discipline are summarized and the possibility of employing these methods in educational evaluation (EE) are investigated. The author points to the idea that OR is the science of evaluation since it directly addresses decision making. In demonstrating that EE is targeted on decision making, feasable alternatives, outcome predictions and probabilities for each alternative, and estimation of costs and benefits are identified as prerequisites of EE. Decision Analysis, a subfield of  OR, is then provided as a model wherein all the concerns of EE are made explicit, and an optimal solution located by organizing them into a single algorithmic structure known as a decision tree. Other transportation, network and simulation models are also applied to hypothetical EE problems. After reviewing some of the literature and the current situation in the fields of OR and EE, the author concludes that EE is one of the few fields not to have taken advantage of OR's potential.

        "description":"The performance of 9, 13, and 17 year old public and private school students, in reading and mathematics, was compared by analyzing data collected during the National Assessment of Educational Progress 1977-78 mathematics and 1979-80 reading assessments. Although results were averaged for the national population, separate data is available not only for the types of schools, but for region, race, sex, size and type of community. Mean national performance percentages indicate significant differences in favor of private schools in both reading and mathematics. After adjustment for the fact that schools serve unequal proportions of students from different socioeconomic background (by equating student populations for public and private schools), mean scores on the entire reading  assessment differed three percentage points at age 9 and 13, and four points at 17 in favor of private schools. Differences in mathematics scores were statistically insignificant. It appears that on a national level: private schools perform better than public schools in reading and mathematics; the advantage may vary in different regions and for different student groups; and a significant portion of the advantage is accounted for by the different socioeconomic make-up of students attending private schools.

        "description":"This document, one of a series of reports examining the possible contribution of other disciplines to evaluation methodology, describes the major elements of general systems theory (GST), cybernetics theory (CT) and management control theory (MCT). The author suggests that MCT encapsulates major concerns of evaluation since it reveals that provision of information to a decision-maker is a key process, and that the management function of controlling involves the utilization of information in the making of decisions regarding goals, and allocation and effective use of resources to accomplish these. Since GST and CT are closely related to MCT they are also discussed. The basic GST conceptual model, categories of systems and their properties, and the role of GST are outlined. Special  emphasis is laid upon the three related categories of artificial, temporary, and living systems because evaluation occurs within systems possessing structure, process and function: man made organizational settings; settings of an ephemeral nature; as well as within ongoing, but dynamic, &quot;living&quot; systems. CT is identified as the science of control and communication which enables systems to maintain activities towards prescribed goals; feedback constituting the mechanism for displacement of the system due to external factors.

Its intent is to make available practitioner statements so that further developmental work may be grounded in first-hand accounts. Practitioners were requested to include, where appropriate, material concerning: methodological problems and methods requiring improvement; proposals for new methods, and any problems involved in the development of such; materials and training needed to improve methods; personnel, management, planning, resource and interagency communication problems. The case descriptions are  varied both in style and the problem cases they divulge. Included are such wide-ranging topics as: SEA and school district autonomy; obtaining and allocating funds for evaluation purposes; the evaluation needs of different audiences; data collection problems and quality control; the maximization of evaluation utilization.

The kit models a product, and thus, aims to develop the knowledge and skills teachers will need to design similar materials for their own students. An introductory section details the kit's purpose and how it works. Following sections outline procedures for meeting the kit's objectives: writing instructional objectives;  incorporating materials already available to the teacher into the kit; developing learning activities keyed to objectives and learner characteristics; developing assessments and other kit components; managing the materials in the classroom. Teacher pretests and posttests are incorporated for each objective. The final section briefly suggest ways of obtaining the most effective use of materials in the classroom.

Stratification variables include region, size of community and socioeconomic status. The three levels of sample selection are Primary Sampling Units (PSUs), schools and students. In general, two and sometimes three PSUs are selected from each stratum for variance estimation. The stratification variables are assumed fixed and not subject to change; therefore, the problem of finding the optimal design is reduced to finding the number of PSUs, schools and students per stratum that will minimize cost for a given variance. Following a brief overview of the sample drawn for Year 11, presented in Section 2, the cost model developed for the purpose of the present study is  outlined in Section 3. Section 4 describes the statistics which were selected for analysis, and Section 5 derives the corresponding variance and covariance component models. Finally, Section 6 describes the optimization procedure used, and Section 7 provides a summary of the results. Primary type of information provided by report: Procedures (Sampling). (Author/BW)",

An eight-nation team defined three sets of components of effective behavior: a sequence of coping actions; feelings and attitudes that facilitate effectiveness; and the intensity and particular kinds of motives for performing effectively. These elements are attained separately, though interactively, in five areas of behavior: achievement, peer relations, authority relations, and managing anxiety and coping with aggression. Projective, self-report, and peer rating instruments were developed  with semantically equivalent editions in English, German, Japanese, Brazilian Portuguese, Slovenian and Mexican Spanish; and were given to boys and girls, age 10 and 14, in Sao Paulo, London, Milano, Tokyo, Mexico City, Austin, Texas, Chicago, Illinois, Ljubljana, Hanover, Heidelberg and Koblenz, West Germany. The conceptual system was supported. Coping skills did significantly affect achievement; and skill in the other areas of behavior also affected achievement. Strength of motivation proved a powerful, universal predictor of achievement. The kinds of motives for working significantly predicted achievement, but idiosyncratically in each country.

Definitions are given of continuum and state models, and traditional and normative standard setting procedures. Since continuum models are considered more appropriate for criterion referenced testing purposes, they are examined in greater depth. The continuum models are subdivided into three categories: judgmental methods; empirical methods; combinations of judgment and empirical methods. For the purpose of viewing a test as an entity and not in relation to other variables, the Angoff and Nedelsky judgmental methods are considered useful; however, when empirical data is available, the empirical methods delineated in  Berk's method of the Contrasting Groups method are recommended as being appropriate. Discussed in the final section of the paper are procedures for setting standards to accomplish three primary uses of criterion referenced testing: classroom testing; basic skills testing for annual promotion and high school graduation; professional licensing and certification testing. However, further research is recommended before the latter procedures are implemented. (Author/AEF)",

The standard setting models considered are continuum models, of which the major assumption is that mastery is a continuously distributed ability. These models are further subdivided, for descriptive and comparative purposes, into judgmental, empirical, and combination models. The characteristics of the nineteen models thus categorized are then discussed.

The Bayesian tailored testing procedure selected items so as to minimize the posterior variance of the ability estimate distribution, while the maximum likelihood tailored testing procedure selected items so as to maximize the item information for the current ability estimate. Results of the analyses for the two procedures indicated that the optimal test length of Bayesian procedure was 14 items, while the optimal test length of the maximum likelihood procedure was 12 items. No difference was found between the procedures in terms of the reliability of the ability estimates. The Bayesian procedure yielded greater  mean total test information than the maximum likelihood. The goodness of fit comparison indicated that the Bayesian procedure yielded poorer fit of the 3PL model to the data than did the maximum likelihood procedure. It was concluded that for large scale tailored testing, a maximum likelihood tailored testing procedure with item selection based on information is the procedure of choice. (Author/GK)",

        "description":"This paper examines the effect of a formal evaluation process upon educational change--specifically, the adoption of innovative reading programs and practices--at different organizational levels of implementation. Because of the size of the project (62 school systems, 142 designated schools, three sets of categorical funded projects), the evaluation design is very simple. SPUR's organization as perceived by participants, self-reports of teacher reading instruction practices, and general professional development and teacher inservice activities were measured through survey instruments. The evaluation describes SPUR in terms of the above data and correlates student reading gains with these data plus other indicators of the degree to which the school has followed SPUR-recommended  standards and practices. The evaluation had three positive uses in the SPUR program to date: bookkeeping, self-definition, and program change. Acceptance of the evaluation process and use of it or its measures appears to depend upon the extent to which the person or group has participated in developing and conducting the evaluation. Outcomes suggest there are benefits to be gained from involving clients in evaluation activities to the fullest extent. (Author/GK)",

The 39 sample forms and questionnaires included in this document represent pupil personnel services which are delivered through a variety of educational systems. The Illinois State Board of Education cannot endorse any of the instruments; they are being provided strictly as resource material. Priorities in programming should develop from identified needs of students, staff, administrators, and parents, ordered according to rational and defensible criteria. Decisions relating to what services are offered, who provides them, how they are delivered, and for whom they are designed should be based on objective data, systematically obtained. The  following steps suggest basic guidelines for conducting a systematic needs assessment: (1) organize a planning group; (2) identify goals and the target group(s) to be surveyed; (3) determine the methodology to be used; (4) decide on followup procedures to be used if initial response rate is inadequate; (5) develop procedures for summarizing and interpreting needs assessment results; (6) plan how and to whom results should be disseminated; and (7) determine how needs assessment data are to be translated into programmatic goals and objectives.

        "description":"The Ralph Nader report on the Educational Testing Service (ETS), entitled The Reign of ETS, the Corporation That Makes Up Minds, explicitly and implicitly raises serious issues concerning the testing enterprise. Major themes include the role of testing in the educational selection system, the validity of existing tests, and the corporate power of ETS. This paper explores and evaluates charges from the perspectives of social and educational policy and of psychometric theory and practice. The currently polarized controversy over testing is reflected: advocates of testing believing in the validity and social utility of both the science and technology of mental measurement, and critics proclaiming that technical inadequacies and social harms make the enterprise inherently vicious and  invidiously midleading. The paper concludes that the tests are central to the sorting of individuals into successive types of education. It advocates a more open procedure for specifying the content of selection tests, and concludes that current psychometric conceptions are inadequate for a meaningful assessment of the validity of tests.

        "description":"Four different methods for attending to a lecture were studied: listening, listening with an outline, note-taking, and note-taking with an outline. Each method was designed to influence the learner's level of processing and, therefore, to effect the encoding and retrieval of information from a lecture. In addition, the effects of no review or review after a lecture and no review or review before a test were also studied. The experiment used an intentional learning paradigm. Comprehension was measured by multiple choice recognition and short-answer recall tests given three weeks after lecture instruction. Statistically significant findings provide evidence that the level of processing is an important variable in learning from lecture. Other findings, though not statistically  significant, lend support to both the external storage hypothesis and the encoding specificity hypothesis, which are the two major theories that are used to explain why lecture notes or outlines may be advantageous. Implications of these findings are discussed. (Author/GK)",

Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. Feedback was experimentally manipulated by presenting knowledge of results simultaneously with each frame, only after the response had been made, or not at all. Pretest scores measured prior familiarity, and posttest scores were used as the dependent achievement measure. Regression analysis indicated a number of main effects on achievement for prior achievement and for treatment. The No Feedback group  scored slightly higher than the Feedback group, and the Simultaneous Feedback group scored lowest.

The current state of teacher personnel policies is that they are reasonably fair to teachers and extremely unfair to students, parents, and taxpayers. They protect all teachers, but they excessively protect the incompetent teacher. A system of strict performance evaluation must be developed that replaces the system of teacher evaluation based on classroom observations by an administrator. Such a new system would not make use of observations because they represent a small, unrepresentative sample from a biased observer. The new system would only use facts about the teacher that demonstrably bear on validated job requirements: (1) some estimate of the amount learned by the students;  (2) a reliable judgement of its quality; and (3) a guarantee of the legitimacy of the teaching process. Teacher performance in the elementary grades would be measured by pre/post testing, and in the secondary grades by similar testing and/or student evaluations. Teachers who are consistently about two standard deviations off the norm would be subject to a warning and eventual dismissal. This system insures fair treatment and good teaching. (Author/APM)",

A distinction is made between inmigration and outmigration from within a specified field, or population area. It is shown that the very largest metropolitan areas contributed to nonmetropolitan population turnaround in the 1960s because of their early arrival at a net outmigration state, although smaller metropolitan areas also played a role in outward redistribution of population.

The research presented was drawn from a study which altered a high school's reward structure, and then tested its effects on student attitudes toward academic achievement. The results of the study indicated that the working class black youth who participated in the research overwhelmingly held positive attitudes toward academic achievement. However, in the year the attitude survey was taken, these students scored below the 10th pencentile in both verbal and quantitative measures on California statewide examinations. The paper concludes that the study effects two different frames of reference, which Frank Parkin has  called dominant and subordinate value septems. Further elaboration brings in the research of John Ogbu and Raymond Boudon, and suggests that, since the students are members of the working class and a subordinate racial group, they perceive members of their class/race as not adequately rewarded for academic achievement. Thus, their actual behavior, according to the paper, reflects the subordinate value septem. (ML)",

Since 1976, the Board has executed a policy of supporting instructional rather than administrative services. When cuts were necessary, administrative or ancillary units were more frequently targeted than were instructional services. Budget and payroll data indicate that administrative staff has declined 16 percent while instructional staff has grown slightly since 1976. In the report, difficulties involved in obtaining accurate data from payroll and budget materials are detailed in an outline of the panel's methodology. Particular attention is paid to the  development of the Board's 1980 budget; it is pointed out that there are discrepancies between the number of budgeted positions and the number of payroll positions. The report states, however, that the EPP feels more confident than it did in 1976 that the largest portions of allocated funds will benefit children in the classroom. (Author/APM)",

The study demonstrated that ghetto teachers vary greatly in their perceptions and appraisals of their shared teaching environment, and that the differences are somewhat related to race and sex. The stories of black teachers were found to contain more student and group directed negative judgements than those of white teachers. In addition, the stories of female teachers were found to contain more negative statements than did those of the male teachers. (Author/APM)",

In addition, New York State's allocation of funds for special education is analyzed and suggestions are offered concerning changes in the finance structure which would benefit New York City's handicapped students. Recommendations for New York City include how additional revenues for special education might be obtained. A survey of 11 large cities in this report, which focuses on the fiscal impact of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (PL 94-142), demonstrates that New York City is  not unique in its dilemma.

The BTU Program includes four components: (1) a normalized school setting; (2) a concretized credit system; (3) a focused discipline policy; and (4) a responsive services approach. A rationale for the program is developed in this paper by demonstrating how each of the four components is intended to achieve three important outcomes: (1) increased likelihood of school completion; (2) enhanced self esteem; and (3) diminished alienation. Finally, the paper discusses some of the issues which might be faced by educators interested in implementing this alternative educational model in other communities.

The program's goals, activities and structure are described, and the texts used for each language group are listed. Program objectives which are evaluated include progress in oral language proficiency in English, native language proficiency, and mathematics, science, and social studies proficiency. It was expected that 60 percent of the students would progress beyond what could be expected without the program. Test scores show student achievement met these objectives. The report provides  analysis of classroom environment in a section devoted to on-site observations. In addition, various staff development efforts are outlined, and the involvement of parents in language workshops and general school activities is discussed. The report judges the district's program to be highly successful and states that all proposed goals have been achieved. Several recommendations for program improvement conclude the evaluation.

        "description":"Adult education and the economic development of the countries of Asia and the Pacific was discussed at a UNESCO conference held in Bangkok in November-December, 1980. The conference was opened by Raja Roy Singh, who emphasized the crucial significance of adult education in national development. He said that development is no longer construed only in economic terms but is increasingly seen also in the light of political, moral, social, and cultural advancement. Conference delegates discussed the state of adult education in each of the countries represented. During the conference, delegates reached the following conclusions: (1) to play an effective role in the process of development, adult education requires realistic aims, top-level support, clear planning and strategies,  integration and extension into all levels of government and life; (2) adult education's importance must be more widely realized or economic development will fail; (3) recently, there has been a trend among the countries of the region to enhance the quality and quantity of adult education; (4) adult education must develop programs to reduce the differences between the haves and the have-nots in society, making available the skills and knowledge that enable people to become active partners in development and to improve their circumstances. Recommendations flowing from the conference included there be more research on how adult education can aid development; that countries make education public policy and give it resources; that education be not solely for literacy; that formal education and  adult education be complementary.

        "description":"The Senior Adult Education Program (SAEP) for Monroe County, Michigan, conducted a documentation and analysis of the program component that provides high school completion classes in two local nursing homes. Three general research questions were (1) benefits to nursing home residents from the programs, (2) design of classes in nursing homes comparable to traditional high school programs, and (3) demonstration of validity of screening and assessment instruments. One task force developed a screening instrument to evaluate prospective students, adapted the San Diego Quick Assessment Test, and developed the Individualized Learning Plan to effectively chart students' progress. Another task force identified differences between SAEP and the local high school program and integrated that  knowledge into training materials for traditional high school teachers to help them become competent educators of institutionalized older adults. Inservice sessions and a statewide workshop were then held. Analysis included interim evaluation techniques and pre- and post-measurements. Results indicated that students benefited by receiving the cognitive and therapeutic effects of education. Instructors benefited by public adult education moving closer to development of replicable standards. This 58-page report narrative concludes with 19 specific recommendations. Appendixes provide a detailed collection of the documentation process and final products (instruments, forms, training manual). (YLB)",

        "description":"Illinois-funded Project IMPACT was designed to identify and develop procedures for complying with the impact requirement of Public Law 94-482, with regard to the effect of vocational education research and development on vocational education programs. The study addressed itself to three problem areas: (1) how to define impact, (2) how to assess impact, and (3) how to show a cause-and-effect relationship between project activities and changes in vocational education teaching-learning situations. The project also investigated how to predict the probability of impact, and how to manage ongoing contracts to increase impact probability. In this first volume of the phase 1 reports, Project IMPACT is defined, principles of assessing impact are determined, and methods of study are  decided through a review of literature and an analysis of case study methods. The review of literature on planned change and impact assessment showed that evidence of impact may be direct or indirect; that the time between cause and effect of impact is longer for intellectual products than for tangible products, and that it is desirable to assess impact of a project at the school district level rather than at higher administrative levels. It also showed that numerous characteristics which are associated with high versus low impact have been identified and that the degree to which these characteristics are present or absent may be useful in predicting actual impact. Through the analysis of case study methods, procedures for assessing impact of vocational education projects through case  studies were established. These procedures were followed in the case studies in volumes 2-8 of this series (see note). (KC)",

        "description":"As part of Project IMPACT's efforts to develop procedures for complying with the impact requirements of Public Law 94-482, a case study was made of the Illinois Occupational Curriculum Project (IOCP). The top-down study traced the IOCP from its developers to its users and documented measurable changes in the 1971 versus the 1979 curriculum development behaviors of community college administrators in Illinois. The purpose of IOCP was to develop workable process models that could be used as a guide for local education agencies and the state education agency in developing and evaluating curriculum in occupational education. The philosophy of IOCP was that educational administrators should follow a step-by-step procedure prior to making a decision. In order to aid administrators in  carrying out this model process, 12 products were created. The major products were five activity manuals containing learning activities which were introduced at workshops. Evaluation of the IOCP showed that three of the four intended consequences of using the IOCP manuals were realized: more systematic planning, more use of resource materials, and more writing of specific management objectives. The intended consequence that was not realized was more staff involvement. Findings of Project IMPACT's case study confirmed the project evaluation and elucidated factors that facilitated that impact. Probably the most significant finding regarding the actual measurement of impact had to do with the importance of collecting pre- and post-data on the project in the same fashion (open-ended  questions) and the observation that even when significant differences in behavior of administrators were observed, it would be impossible to ascribe the change solely to the influence of the IOCP.

        "description":"As part of Project IMPACT's efforts to develop procedures for complying with the impact requirements of Public Law 94-482, a case study was made of the Illinois Network of Exemplary Occupational Education Programs for Handicapped and Disadvantaged Students. The purpose of the Network was to expand the quantity and quality of special needs vocational education in the state of Illinois. In l978-79, the Network was comprised of nine demonstration sites and a dissemination site; in addition, the Network was also a source of materials, processes, consulting services, and inservice training appropriate for special needs vocational education. Incomplete evaluative data suggests that the Network's products have been fairly widely diffused, and that at least &quot;awareness&quot; of the Network was  possessed by all educators in Illinois. The most interesting and unique feature of the Network from the point of view of Project IMPACT was the quality and quantity of interaction between the Network and the Research and Development section of the Illinois Department of Adult, Vocational and Technical Education (DAVTE). This interaction was accomplished through annual funding proposals prepared by the Network that served as evaluative tools for changes implemented by DAVTE. Project IMPACT recommended the following investigations of the Network: documenting that the &quot;awareness&quot; focus of the project deserves as much attention as the &quot;expertise&quot; focus; study of the characteristics and activities that made the director of the dissemination site so effective; further study of product adoption;  more document analysis; and further study of the Research and Development Section's control of the Network for possible replication.

        "description":"As part of Project IMPACT's efforts to identify and develop procedures for complying with the impact requirements of Public Law 94-482, a case study was made of Illinois Career Education Projects at the awareness level. First, the Career Development for Children Project (CDCP), which produced career awareness curriculum materials for elementary and junior high school students in 1970-72, was assessed through interviews with elementary school teachers and administrators in eight schools in five districts in Illinois. There was no evidence that the teachers and administrators contacted were aware of the project or its materials or that CDCP had had any impact on the school districts studied. However, Project IMPACT learned through this study that it was impossible to generalize  about the huge elementary school population from such a small sample, and became aware of the need to monitor changes of the groups intended for impact. (The most significant group impact by the CDCP was not its intended audience but the U.S. Office of Education.) Second, the Career Orientation and Assessment Program, a prevocational course to expose new prisoners in Illinois correctional facilities to career possibilities, to assess their interests and skills, and to provide specific information about career choices, was assessed through pre- and posttests. Findings indicated increases in accuracy of self-concept in terms of prisoners' vocational abilities and vocational needs. Project IMPACT found that the impact of the program on prisoners' later employability is not known; and that  impact of career education programs for prisoners might be facilitated if program content were based more on students' inventoried vocational needs and less on their expressed vocational interests.

The purpose of the Occupational Survival Skills Project was to develop curriculum materials to help prepare high school students to understand the basic knowledge, competencies, and behaviors necessary to maintain an occupation. Occupational survival skills relate primarily to the human aspects of working in organizations. A package of 12 learning modules to teach these skills was developed after a survey that identified basic skills, determined which skills were most important, and devised teaching strategies which would be most likely to be used to teach these skills.  The package of learning modules developed in the project discusses the following topics: working in organizations; motivation for work; understanding self; interpersonal relations; effective communication; using creativity on the job; problem solving; authority and responsibility; leadership; coping with conflict; coping with change; and adapting and planning for the future. The Occupational Survival Skills package was selected by the National Center for Research in Vocational Education for nationwide distribution. Thus, Project IMPACT found that the project had wide distribution and use throughout the country; and the project elicited very favorable comments from teachers using the packages and from teacher educators.

It contains discussions of the following seven substantive areas of consumer and homemaking education: family life, child care and development, consumer education, home management, nutrition and food, textiles and clothing, and housing and home furnishings. Covered in each of these discussions are newer knowledge in the field (research and theory);  relevant social changes, including changes in family life; related technological developments; and predictions for the future related to given course content areas. A section on the social and educational context of consumer and homemaking education includes considerations in areas not covered elsewhere in the paper and attempts to bring together relevant information concerned with social conditions, projections, needs, and the educational program setting.

        "description":"A causal framework was used to explore factors that influence the enrollment of four-year college students in the hard and technical sciences (math, science, engineering) and the professions (pre-law, medicine, dentistry). The factors studied were family status, standardized test performance, high school rank, educational expectations, high school math and science preparation, college characteristics, and college grades. The National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972 was the data base used in a path analytic approach to evaluate determinants of college major field choice. Findings showed that sex and high school major field intentions were the two most important determinants. Being female exerted a large direct negative effect on majoring in hard and technical  sciences and the professions. The intention to major in these fields at the high school level was positively related to actually pursuing a college major in these fields. Findings from past studies regarding the importance of standardized test performance and high school math and science preparation were not strongly supported by the present data.

        "description":"A study examined the differences between women who choose traditional and nontraditional career options. A 78-item inventory, which solicited information concerning vocational goals, demography, study skills, attitudes, and activities, was administered to 530 incoming female freshmen at the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland. Of those surveyed, 42 percent had a nontraditional career goal, 14 percent chose a traditional career, and 27 percent had a neutral career goal. Data indicated that the nontraditional group had higher grades, better study habits, and more interest in graduate school and investigative occupations, while those in the traditional group were more interested in social occupations and felt that a college degree was the only way to enter their chosen  careers. Survey results supported the hypothesis that both encouragement to explore nontraditional career choices and exposure to role models in nontraditional fields are important factors in influencing women to make nontraditional career choices. Not supported were the hypotheses (1) that having a mother work outside the home was an important influence in making nontraditional choices; and (2) that women making nontraditional choices would more likely perceive the attitudes of significant others as being more favorable toward their nontraditional choices.

Information was collected from 214 mainstream and special vocational education instructors, cooperative education coordinators, and vocational directors in Vermont area vocational centers through on-site interviews and mailed questionnaires. It was found that over one-half of the mainstream vocational education teachers were involved in IEP development. The involvement was essentially through communication with special education personnel; the patterns of communication  between vocational and special education personnel were also found during the implementation and review/evaluation phases of the IEP process. Teachers without IEP students seemed to need more awareness-level training, while teachers with IEP students needed more skills-oriented training. DO lab instructors reported direct involvement in all phases of the IEP process. Their inservice needs focused on vocational curriculum and skill development activities and materials.

While CIP sites were, at times, plagued by such problems as low morale and poor attendance, evaluation of the actual implementation of CIP at four sites, assessment of the impact of CIP on participating interns, analysis of factors related to CIP's success, and examination of the effectiveness of CIP as opposed to other programs for the disadvantaged dropout indicate that CIP  has been quite effective in meeting its objectives and that it can be successfully replicated in new sites. Recommendations for improving CIP's design included increasing staff salary scales to decrease the high staff turnover rate, modifying the summer program to allow students more time for gainful employment and to alleviate transportation problems, and developing sanctions for unexcused absences.

To determine the replicability of CIP, three new sites were compared to the original site in Philadelphia. The comparison focused on whether the program, as implemented in the new sites, remains the same as the prototype program in terms of goals and practices;  whether any changes instituted at new sites are improvements; whether the new implementation system is more effective than the usual developer-public school linkages; and whether the overall dissemination/implementation process is efficient. After completing their investigation, evaluators concluded that implementation in the new sites demonstrates the replicability of the program.

Through coordination, CETA and vocational education agencies can eliminate duplication of effort in training and other service activities, can augment each other's strengths through pooling resources, and can realize greater impetus and innovation in their programs and policies. This guide is intended to encourage such linkages and to provide CETA and vocational education administrators with practical management tips for joint planning and implementation of programs. The first chapter introduces the concept of educational linkages and explains why they are beneficial to CETA and vocational  education. In chapter 2, an outline of the 1978 CETA legislation as it relates to coordination with vocational education is presented, along with a summary of the coordination references contained in the 1976 vocational education legislation. Chapter 3 contains an overview of the CETA and vocational education systems, including a discussion of barriers to effective partnership. The fourth chapter discusses planning for coordination, including not only the legislative mandate but also the steps that lead to program initiation and development. Chapter 5 presents information about the formal agreement for linkages--its purpose, function, and content. The final chapter examines various aspects of coordination once the linkage arrangement has been established, and offers suggestions for  dealing with further coordination problems that may arise.

The Proposed Educational Assistance Act is an updated GI Bill, which would provide the following educational benefits: 80 percent of college tuition up to $2500 plus a $250 living allowance for 36 months for three years' military service or two years' military service plus four years in the active Reserve or National Guard; a two-for-one savings plan for educational benefits for career military personnel; an educational leave-of-absence program; and transferability of educational benefits to a spouse or children for career military personnel with 16,  or in some cases 12, years of service. The benefits are structured with the goal of increasing military service enlistments of high school graduates and retention of experienced middle-level personnel. Pros and cons of H.R. 1400's provisions are discussed during the hearings by various Senators and Representatives, Defense Department representatives, and high ranking officers of the branches of military service. Their oral testimony, as well as their prepared statements, are included in the document. (KC)",

The proposed Educational Assistance Act, an updated GI Bill, would provide the following educational benefits: 80 percent of college tuition up to $2500 plus a $250 living allowance for 36 months for three years' military service or two years' military service plus four years in the Active Reserve or National Guard (and additional money for longer service); a two-for-one savings plan for educational benefits for career military personnel; an educational leave-of-absence program; and transferability of educational benefits to a spouse or children for  career military personnel with a certain number of years' service. The benefits are structured with the goal of increasing military service enlistments of high school graduates and retention of experienced middle-level personnel. In this round of hearings, held in Norfolk, Virginia, commissioned officers, noncommissioned officers, and enlisted personnel in the field from the Air Force, Navy, and Army voiced their opinions of the bill, and interpreted it as they saw its effects on recruiting, retention, and day-to-day concerns of military personnel. Most of the persons interviewed viewed the bill favorably as a whole, but had reservations about various provisions, and concerns about whether the lure of educational benefits would prompt more mid-career dropouts from the services. Others  expressed concern about the 1989 expiration date for use of benefits from the Vietnam-era GI bill, military pay, and living and working conditions. (KC)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the Targeted Jobs Tax Credit (TJTC) as observed between July 1980 and March 1981 in 25 areas throughout the United States. Findings include the following: (1) TJTC has not worked as envisioned as a self-marketing effort by vouchered individuals and new hires by employers; most employers are participating in TJTC through retroactive certifications of their current employees rather than by new TJTC hires; (2) vouchering activity and employer participation in TJTC have been increasing over time, although recently these activities have fallen as resources have declined; (3) vouchering and employer participation vary randomly from site to site; (4) four types of organizations have been most active in marketing TJTC employers:  Private Industry Councils, private firms assisting employers in obtaining certifications, National Alliance of Business metros, and state and local employment services offices; (5) about half of the participants in the TJTC program are cooperative education students, and about 90 percent of the vouchers go to the targeted groups--economically disadvantaged youth and cooperative education students. Some of the reasons found for TJTC performance problems include employers' beliefs that the tax savings are not worth the trouble of altering their hiring practice, and fear of government involvement; and problems with implementation and enthusiasm for the program by vouchering agencies. It was concluded that TJTC has not been implemented by the delivery system and used by employers in the way  intended by its designers, but that it would be premature to draw from this that targeted employment tax credits are in all cases ineffective means for increasing employment opportunities for targeted individuals.

        "description":"This series of 10 essays, written at various times since the mid-1960s, explores the U.S. economy's proneness to both high inflation and high unemployment during this period. The essays present ideas that the author believes could have reined in price increases in the early stages, and that presently could speed the reduction of inflation and reduce the pain of its accompanying unemployment. The first chapter sets the tone for the book with a brief description of the origin and development of the inflation-unemployment syndrome in light of the provisions of the Employment Act of 1946 and its 1978 amendments, the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act. It also considers the spectrum of authoritative prescriptions for disinflation of the economy. A major theme of  the essays is the desirability of complementing the standard fiscal and monetary approaches toward counterinflation with a special supply-side tax or income policy that gives workers an incentive to forego pay increases exeeding the prospective national rate of productivity advance. The second recurring theme is the improvement of statistics for use in the wage-price monitoring, another round of which should not be ruled out, according to the author, despite disappointing past experience. In this context, designs are offered for statistical systems in which hourly earnings, unit labor cost, productivity, and prices are treated symmetrically; and in which, alternatively, aggregates such as payrolls (or total factor income) and real output suffice and productivity estimates are not needed.

Cost-benefit analysis of the major CETA components (the job training, job corps, classroom training, public service employment, work experience, and summer youth employment) indicates that they are a good investment for society. In addition, such CETA components as nonoccupational training, youth school retention and work transition programs, and smaller pilot projects also seem to be cost effective. While both CETA's service components and delivery system have some serious  weaknesses, a number of options are available to remedy them. Current and anticipated international competition, technological changes, and economic problems in certain regions of the U.S. and such new labor force entrants as additional refugees, people delaying retirement, and displaced homemakers reinforce the need for a program to retrain workers and/or upgrade their skills.

(The SAS is a multi-component system designed for use in evaluating a wide variety of experimental and demonstration youth programs initiated the Youth Employment and Demonstration Projects Act--YEDPA--of 1977.) Following a brief brief description of the workings of the system, the major components of the system (including instruments to measure participant characteristics and a psychometric battery designed to assess career decision making, awareness, and capability; self-image; work attitudes; job search capacity; and occupational sex stereotyping) and their rationale are discussed. The validation of SAS instruments under current demonstration  projects is examined. Outlined next is the application of the measures, followed by an explanation of the basic analysis plan. Appended to the report are the following SAS instruments: the Individual Participant Profile; the Vocational Attitude Scale; a series of measures to assess job knowledge, job holding skills, job seeking skills, sex stereotypes of adult occupations, and self-esteem; the Work Relevant Attitudes Inventory; a program completion survey; and a program followup survey. Instructions for administering the instruments are included. (Related youth knowledge and development reports are available separately through ERIC--see note.) (MN)",

It is the second volume of an assessment of the Job Corps, which found that, overall, the Job Corps experience of training young men and women for employment has been beneficial to society, although there is room for program improvements. This volume of the assessment focuses on the vocational training offered by the Job Corps. The study used the Job Corps' FY 1977 data base to examine the relationship of vocational offerings at different centers to the subsequent labor market experience of male and female trainees. Some of the findings of the study include (1) only one in seven corpsmembers who enter a vocational training cluster ends  up completing and being placed in a job in the same cluster; those who do have the highest wages; (2) the overall job placement rate for male program completers (67.5 percent) was much higher than that for female completers (55.6 percent); (3) the average starting wage for males was higher than that for females; (4) for males, construction trades, clerical sales, and industrial production occupations provided the most success for completers, at least in the short run; (5) Civilian Conservation Centers had more success than contract centers with male completers; and (6) the four largest centers did relatively poorly in the rankings for male completers. The study has great implications for other types of training programs because of its large data base and the long duration of Job Corps  programs. (KC)",

It is a report of an assessment study designed to determine the status and results of the implementation of mixed income experiments at 47 Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) sites during fiscal years 1978 and 1979. Mixed income experiments are designed to test whether and/or to what extent income-eligible youth benefit from working with and being trained alongside nonincome-eligible youth, as opposed to receiving the same services in projects where all participants are income eligible. Data were collected from program plans and project reports, telephone inquiries to prime sponsors, and site visits. The  conduct of these mixed income experiments and their individual findings vary significantly, making any aggregate analysis difficult. Each of the tests in varying degrees failed to meet accepted practices in research methodology, and therefore the results of this knowledge effort are inconclusive. From what operational data were gathered, however, no conclusive evidence of benefit to youth participants was shown, and no change in low-income guidelines for participants is warranted. The mixed income hypothesis, however, does warrant further investigation. It is recommended that future experimental efforts follow stricter research guidelines.

This interim report describes the background and structure of the Educational Improvement Effort (EIE) of the Job Corps, as well as the preliminary findings for the first cohorts of participants and controls in the models of EIE implemented earliest. The EIE follows a logical sequence, beginning with a survey of the varying teaching methods and policies within Job Corps centers as well as a review of past evaluation literature. Cooperatively with the education community, exemplary education approaches outside Job Corps were assessed for applicability for disadvantaged youth in a center environment. The most promising  models were then implemented and Job Corps members were randomly assigned to the models and to traditional Job Corps offerings. Assessment of both types of programs yielded findings that are remarkable if they hold up over time. The tested gain rates of Corpsmembers in regular programs exceed both public school averages and the lower learning rates previously achieved by the Corpsmembers in school. The gain rates also exceed those documented for Job Corps in the past. The evidence on the relative effectiveness of traditional and innovative approaches is limited now, but it does appear that some alternatives are promising, particularly, computerized instruction. It is clear that the individualized, self-paced instructional approach used in Job Corps can positively affect learning rates of  even the most disadvantaged youth. (KC)",

The report focuses on the young school drop-out portion only of the supported work experiment, which also included offenders, ex-addicts, and welfare recipients. The goal of supported work is to aid groups of people with well-established employment difficulties to obtain and keep a regular job; in addition, it aims to reduce welfare dependence, drug use, and criminal activity. Between April 1975 and July 1977, five of the demonstration sites--Atlanta, Hartford, Jersey City, New York, and Philadelphia--participated in the supported work evaluation sample. They enrolled 1,244 unemployed 17- to 20-year-old high school  dropouts, offering a randomly selected subset of the enrollees employment in a supportive environment for up to 12 or 18 months, and assistance in finding other employment as their program eligibility ended. Data were gathered for 18 months for 861 youths, although only 153 youths who enrolled in the sample prior to April 1976 completed an interview at 36 months. Thus, longer-term impacts of supported work are uncertain. The general conclusions from this study are that the availability of a supported work job had short-run impacts on employment and, consequently, on dependence on public assistance, but that the program does not appear to have mitigated the long-run employment problems of these youths. Furthermore, the project had no impact on youths' drug use or their participation in  crime. Therefore, supported work does not appear to be well-suited to ameliorating the employment problems of young dropouts; and the net cost of the program is high. (KC)",

In the first chapter, the VICI model is explained and dissected and its successful elements and programatic components considered. Chapter 2 describes briefly four kinds  of VICI projects currently operating, explains how to form links among the model planners, and suggests kinds of training programs and sources of funds that might be tried. Chapter 3 discusses three important elements: fiscal planning, project links, and project management. In Chapter 4, an array of practical tips on start-up, fiscal management, payrolling, cost estimation, and other daily matters are offered; while in chapter 5 recruiting both staff and trainees is explained. Chapter 6 synthesizes from the previous material answers to the most frequently asked questions about VICI-type projects, while the appendixes to the manual include other information the planner and manager will need, such as sample forms and reports, purchase order forms and procedures, participant rules and  regulations, explanation of the VICI work valuation formula, and sample VICI placement strategies.

        "description":"Two studies were conducted to determine how nontraditional men and women of at least college education differed from same sex comparison groups more traditionally employed. Inferences were drawn from the studies about possible intervention strategies to encourage adolescents to enter nontraditional fields. It was found that for both nontraditional men and women, the deviant career choice appeared to be but one manifestation of their low adherence to conventional stereotypic sex roles. In contrast to their same sex comparison groups, the nontraditional men and women described themselves as less sex-typed both \"on the job\" and in social situations. The nontraditional persons also had less stereotyped marital and family roles. The nontraditional women were more career oriented while  the nontraditional men were less so. Background factors that foster broader sex roles were more frequent in the two nontraditional groups. Nontraditional women were often classified as tough-minded, and they had had support from male parents and teachers. Intervention to encourage adolescent girls to choose nontraditional careers should focus on making them more tough-skinned and fostering support by male peers and role models. Nontraditional men were more often of lower socioeconomic status or members of minority groups. It was felt that stressing the prestige and upward mobility of professional work, even in that usually chosen by women, to underprivileged groups would encourage them to choose nontraditional fields more often. It would also be helpful to expose male students to  sensitivity and the values of the affective domain. (KC)",

        "description":"The principal human factors engineering issue in robotics is the division of labor between automation (robots) and human beings. This issue reflects a prime human factors engineering consideration in systems design--what equipment should do and what operators and maintainers should do. Understanding of capabilities and limitations of robots and people is necessary to examine how their performances should be interrelated. Robots readily fit into the context of automation of equipment/product design and manufacturing management. Their capabilities fit into four major functional categories--manipulation, locomotion, sensing, and executive. Robots may be used in a variety of settings for a number of industrial operations. Criteria to be considered in deciding whether to use robots  are costs, production, parts, quality, reliability, space, safety, environment, and management. Human factors engineering issues in robotics other than the primary one of division of labor are design, procedurization, and protection. Investigations addressing human factors engineering in robotics have thus far focused on teleoperators, an Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing Program, and Adaptable-Programmable Assembly Systems. A need exists for more analysis and empirical studies directed at division of labor between humans and robots and their symbiosis. (YLB)",

The rapid increase in new labor market entrants with middle-level skills is not keeping pace with demand. Employers have the choice of hiring entry workers with these skills or upgrading employees through short training programs. In answer to a need to provide middle-level-skills training, colleges of applied arts and technology have been established; private vocational schools are an alternative. College programs provide a combination of general education and specialized skills. An important innovation has been the introduction of cooperative programs that  involve work terms. To be sensitive to the demand for skilled human resources, the college system has allowed for interaction in the structure of colleges and in curriculum development. A balance is achieved between centralization and decentralization of college governance by dividing responsibility among the Ministry of Colleges and Universities, Council of Regents, and boards of governors of individual colleges. As the rate of technological change accelerates, colleges must anticipate changes in demand for skills. (Eight tables are appended.) (YLB)",

The deterioration of the economic structures and perceived quality of social life in large metropolitan centers of the United States has stimulated the dispersal of population and economic resources throughout rural America. During the last decade almost three million more people moved out of metropolitan areas than moved in and three-fourths of all nonmetropolitan U.S. counties gained population. This growth in rural population and the accompanying technological and economic growth of rural America have led to severe difficulties for rural areas as they attempt to maintain the relative lack of pollution and the land availability of the rural environment. Rural America is characterized by an  increasing racial and ethnic variability. In addition, recent evidence indicates that the aspirations and values of rural people are, in general, as pluralistic as those of metropolitan people of the same region, ethnicity, and social class. Contemporary changes in the population and nature of rural America must be considered by social scientists and government policymakers and operatives.

Included among the sources of controversy relating to rural development are the following areas: (1) the relation between rural development and rural industrialization, (2) the distribution of benefits and costs associated with development strategies, (3) the distribution of costs and benefits among sectors of the population, (4) the urban causes and consequences of rural development, (5) the possibility of developing a common national strategy for rural development, and (6) the relation between incentives to location of a firm in a community and subsequent economic development. Plans for any program for rural development must take into account questions of the proper  scale of rural development, the special nature and extent of rural poverty, the effects of poverty on rural communities, existing experiences with rural development, the relationship between national economic revitalization and rural development, and the role of vocational education in rural economic growth.

Outlined next are the premises for private and public investment. Geographic/geopolitical concerns in the formation of investment priorities are described. The need for greater availability of investment capital for small business ventures is discussed. Covered next is the development of realistic incentives for public/private investment. Ways and means of effectively coordinating federal and state investment capital programs are presented, and a model for public/private partnership is provided. Discussed next is the provision and development of appropriate technical assistance for sustaining and developing local economic ventures (with special attention to  the role of education, business extension services, technical assistance entrepreneurs, and banks). Initiation of a national education training and technical assistance program for diversified rural finance development and management is considered.

There are, however, a number of new technologies, likely to impact on rural areas in the 1980s and beyond, that should level off the trend toward substitution of technology for labor in rural areas. These technologies include closed-environment production, energy self-sufficiency, municipal waste utilization, renewable fuels, telecommunications, alternative farming systems, and genetic improvements. Some of these technologies are related to energy constraints, including rising prices and the possibility of shortages and interruptions. Others respond to local  control concerns that have been developing in recent years. The possibilities for wide adoption, the likely impact on the number and kinds of jobs in existence, and new employment opportunities likely to result from each of these new technologies must be examined separately.

A number of issues related to rural land resources are likely to be of key importance to rural America during the coming decade. Included among these issues are farmland protection, soil stewardship, mining and energy development, water resources, and habitat and scenic values. Analysis of recent trends and specific problems in each of these areas indicates that much needs to be done to  make federal programs more responsive to the new realities of rural land use. Federal help in protecting rural America is essential to the national interest in ensuring the continued productivity of the country's working landscape.

Included among the areas in which a need for improved rural support services are needed are the following: adequate health care, water and other sanitary systems, child care, transportation, communications, energy, housing facilities, and capacity building. In the past, rural communities have been grossly discriminated against in federal government funding policies. The recent migration to rural areas has created an urgent need for improved rural support services. To fill this need and help rural  communities realize their full potential, three priorities must be addressed by all levels of government. These priorities are (1) helping rural communities make maximum use of existing financial, material, and human resources; (2) helping rural areas truly gain equitable funding allocations for support services and other kinds of development; and (3) helping develop more flexible programming initiatives and allocation mechanisms that are genuinely responsive to individual community determinations of need.

        "description":"Rural work-education councils are free-standing voluntary associations of community leaders averaging around 21 to 25 voting members who are organized by task-specific action committees working to improve and expand educational and economic development options and thus ease the education-to-work transition in rural America. There are currently three principal successful rural work-education councils organizational models. These are the local nexus, the state nexus, and the national nexus. Included among the factors affecting collaborative education/economic development are parallel human resource development, collaboration at all levels within and without the community, formation of manageable objectives and initiatives, attention to the energy needs and directions of rural  economics, and reappraisal of values by rural communities. Several distinguishing elements are critical in determining the appropriate council model, including indices of economic well-being, community socio-economic stratification, institutional development, and the nature and types of educational and training resources. While different rural conditions and needs may require different organizational models, all rural work-education councils need the involvement and support of a broad cross-section of community residents. In addition, there are several functions that most rural work-education councils should undertake. Among these are information and data retrieval, development, dissemination, and utilization; maintenance of a support role for existing institutions and groups; minimizing  replication of services; and maintenance of a mutually beneficial relationship between process and outcomes.

This interest in linkages has resulted in a variety of intermediary mechanisms for collaboration. Included among the elements or activities necessary for linking education and economic development are the following: a solid base of information about available resources; keeping the community informed and involved in economic development plans to ensure community support; identification and involvement of both the formal and informal leadership structures of the community; collaboration at all levels and with all sectors of the community and with state, regional, and national organizations and agencies; development of supportive services that enhance the work environment  and the community; and thoughtful consideration of the community's values, population makeup, and political environment. Programs containing these elements have been identified at all levels of government and in both the public and private sectors. With this base of knowledge, cooperation, and support, the community can decide which strategy is most appropriate for their effort: concentration on providing educational opportunities, direct job creation, overall community development, or a combination of all three strategies.

The sample for the study was 160 Elderhostel participants at the University of New Mexico and the College of Santa Fe during the summer of 1981. Most participants had a college degree or postsecondary education. The Educational Participation Scale was administered to this sample, with a 75 percent return rate. Four scales consisting of 31 items were used to rank participants' reasons for enrolling in terms of escape/stimulation,  social welfare, social relationships, and cognitive interest. (Items from earlier versions of the instrument pertaining to professional advancement were deleted.) It was found that the Educational Participation Scale yielded factor patterns similar to earlier studies by Boshier and Riddle, and that this form of the EPS would be a useful instrument for adult educators and program planners in planning programs for adults. The results from the study further indicate that cognitive interest was the most powerful motivator of the population, with social relationships the next most powerful motivator. No differences in motivation were found by age and sex. (A list of recommendations and practical tips for conducting programs for elderly persons is given at the end of this paper.)  (KC)",

The GAIT procedure, in which each person spends five minutes in a client role and five minutes in a helping role, is described in depth. The manual considers the theoretical basis of the GAIT scale in relation to the intimacy of the discussion topic, the importance of the self-disclosure, and the individual's level of experiencing. The prediction of therapeutic talent from the helper-as-client's level of openness is discussed.  Finally, the training technique and the rating procedure are described in detail, including many ratings examples to define scale points. (Author/NRB)",

The fears involved in demonstrating counseling arise from: (1) irrational beliefs concerning \"the perfect response;\" (2) academic coursework which seems to equate psychological illness with poor counseling skills; (3) uncertainty about necessary skills; and (4) anxiety engendered by the change process. Research on the effects of practicum anxiety indicates that highly anxious students are less effective in counseling with clients and that anxious counselors often have reduced levels of recall. Defensive expressions of resistance used by beginning counselors to counteract their fears of criticism and evaluation have been investigated; each response to anxiety represents an attempt to avoid  responsibility for counseling session process and outcome. A catalog of typical, anxiety-initiated, inappropriate responses of trainees with clients would help practicum supervisors to identify, understand, and empathize with students. Supervisors of beginning counseling students should recall their initial experiences as counselors, should not make assumptions without confirmation, and should trust and respect supervisors as developing professionals.

A description of the research is provided in the introduction, followed by an overview of key findings from 1980 data, e.g., a decline in the use of cigarettes, marijuana, PCP, inhalants, and barbituates, and stability in the use of cocaine and heroin. An increase in the use of stimulants and methaqualone is reported, accompanied by an increase in the proportion of seniors who use illicit drugs  other than marijuana. The conclusion reflects the continued trend of widespread drug use among high school students. (NRB)",

Women's studies courses may also achieve similar goals. Female students (N=32) enrolled in a psychology of women course were tested to assess changes in their loci of control, sex role orientation, and level of conceptual complexity. In the two testing sessions, conducted eight weeks apart, students completed the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI), the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale for Adults (ANS-IE), and the Paragraph Completion Test (PCT). Results showed that subjects exhibited a shift toward greater internality on the ANS-IE and greater masculinity on the BSRI;  no change occurred in conceptual complexity as indicated by PCT scores. Results suggest that exposure to the course elicits changes in the content of students' cognitions about themselves, rather than in the structure of their cognitive processes. (NRB)",

Data from the California's Early Childhood Education (ECE) program was analyzed to examine the relationships between various aspects of parent involvement and their effects on parent satisfaction, teacher satisfaction, and student achievement. The principals, teachers, and parents of students in two second-grade and two third-grade classrooms in each ECE school were the subjects for the study. In 72 schools chosen for more intensive study, criterion-referenced reading and mathematics tests were also administered to students. Parent involvement variables investigated the parents' communications with the school, awareness of  school operations, participation in school activities, influence in school decision-making, and relationships with teachers. Results indicated that parent involvement in schools was beneficial; the degree of parent interest and participation in school activities was positively related to student achievement. Parents' perceptions of their influence in decision-making and the perceived quality of parent-teacher relationships were positively related to parent satisfaction. A negative relationship was found between the amount of school-home communication and student achievement. (NRB)",

Womens' experience includes basic cooperation, nurturance, empathy, and egalitarian morality. Logical positivist psychology discriminates against women by excluding inner experiencing as a subject matter for study and phenomenological exploration as a method of inquiry. Concepts from existential/phenomenology philosophy which are basic ways of being for humans include: (1) &quot;existence precedes essence&quot;; (2) the human's &quot;being-in-the-world&quot; as essentially relational and interactional; (3) &quot;process&quot; vs. &quot;content&quot; variables (Gendlin); and (4) the phenomenological methodology of grounding theoretical concepts in felt  experiencing rather than logical deduction or empirical observation. Existential/phenomenological philosophy taps into variables basic to women's experience of the world and is a valid starting point for future theoretical work. (Author/RC)",

        "description":"Frustration has been primarily investigated in relation to aggressive behaviors, but may elicit other behaviors depending on the responses available to the individual. To test the effects of task frustration and task success on subsequent group behavior, college women (N=80) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: task success, task frustration, task and personal frustration, and no task control. Subjects in the three experimental conditions completed individual performance tasks followed by a group task using Madsen's Cooperation Board. Subjects in the success condition were more cooperative in the group activity than subjects in the two frustration conditions. Results suggest that frustration can lead to increased competitiveness and decreased cooperation. Individuals  under pressure to achieve in a competitive environment may become competitive in social interactions if they experience intellectual failures, even though such competition is non-rewarding. Success in intellectual tasks may promote social cooperation. (Author/JAC)",

        "description":"A topic of increasing interest in social cognition is the manner in which individuals organize information about others in their memories and then access the information when making a decision. In the first study, subjects made both negatively and positively phrased judgments; trait set size was then varied as a within-subjects factor while decision type (success or failure) was varied as a between-subjects factor. Results suggest that people search their memory for disconfirming evidence when making memory-based judgments. A second experiment manipulated the type of judgment subjects had to make as a within-subjects factor. When subjects did not know what kind of judgment they would have to make, the congruency hypothesis was not supported. The opportunity to functionally encode  information as potentially incongruent with a future decision may determine whether a search for disconfirming evidence will occur. Only in those relatively infrequent cases when individuals clearly know what future judgment is needed will information be encoded as potentially incongruent and be examined for disconfirming evidence prior to reaching a decision.

A systematic relationship between self-report and perceived sexuality ratings was more characteristic of male than of female subjects. Females' self-report and perceived sexuality ratings were generally unrelated.

Feelings of social contribution and potential efficacy comprise a basic need to feel uniquely important to humanity. This notion of self-esteem is inherent in the particular social, historical, and ideological conditions which have constricted women's realm of perceived influence and responsibility. Although women are asked to predicate their work on its benefits to others, their perceived realm of influence and responsibility has been, in general, narrowly circumscribed to husband and family. If women's self-esteem is based on a limited vision of influence, career choices, and social responsibility,  then women will continue to choose occupations and perform tasks that are not very professionalized.

        "description":"Underrepresentation of women in higher status, traditionally male occupations has been attributed to sex-role socialization and to discrimination. Female students entering traditionally male professions may suffer many of the same pressures that have prevented other women from entering these fields. Undergraduate women (N=64) and men (N=21) in engineering, management, and pre-medicine programs completed a questionnaire which included measures of personality variables and external factors related to achievement and measures of current achievement. Also included were measures of expectations of future success, aspirations, and five stress/health measures. The means for women and for men were similar on all measures; but correlations with expectations, aspirations, and the  stress/health measures appeared to differ by sex. Prediction equations for these variables for women were also tested. Current achievement was the best predictor for expectations and aspirations. Personality measures were more important and external factors slightly less important for aspirations than for expectations. The combined predictors accounted for a significant amount of the variance in each of the predicted variables. Many of the predictors that were related to one of the stress/health measures were unrelated or inversely related to another, indicating different underlying processes. (Author/NRB)",

        "description":"Researchers in the area of depression, aware that women are more likely than men to be depressed, have examined women's marital and employment status to explain this phenomenon. However, the meanings, perceptions, and situations encountered within marital and work roles also contribute to emotional distress. The traditional sex role explanation of depression is insufficient for full-time working mothers, because these women experience the most intense role conflict between work and family; therefore, clarification of their stress is valuable. Research on dual career marriages has generally investigated the mother and her conflicts, as well as the effects of mothering and work on her children or husband. Research about the father's role in dual career marriages is needed. An  exploration of the husband's and the wife's roles in work and family spheres and the relationship of these roles to mental health is essential to understanding married women's greater susceptibility to depression. Only by defining the conditions and meanings of women's roles within the family, and the effect of their husbands' support, can a view of emotional distress that solely emphasizes women's internal conflicts be transcended.

A study of drug abusers' characteristics found a significantly higher history of non-medical psychotherapeutic drug use for females than for males; however, males had a higher prevalence of illicit drug use. Females in traditional treatment tended to be under 21 years old, but over 30 years old in emergency rooms and crisis center facilities. Females entering treatment were less likely than males to have been arrested, to be employed, and to have entered treatment voluntarily; they were more likely than males to be or to have been married. The data suggest that current long-term opiate-oriented treatment programs may not be appropriate for a large  segment of the female drug abusing population. (JAC)",

In spite of this, many colleges have devised courses in content area vocabulary development, even though the relevance and transfer effects of such courses have not been verified. In addition, most vocabulary textbooks seem to emphasize a structural analysis approach to vocabulary and if they include references to content area vocabulary at all, these references are haphazard. To remedy this problem, a data collecting process was developed at California State University (Fullerton), where approximately 600 students are enrolled each semester in  developmental vocabulary courses. Each semester, these students select words used in their academic courses. To date, these data include roughly 3,000 entries, which have been coded and categorized according to a number of criteria. The data are now available for use in vocabulary classes for relevant study and as a service to various departments on the campus. (FL)",

        "description":"Visual compositions can be used in the content areas to address comprehension problems posed by implicit factors in any content theme. The importance of a visual presentation for writing is that it can instantly portray the theme to be learned and act as a catalyst to elicit words and sentences to help explain that content theme. Stages of visual/verbal understanding achieved through visual compositions include (1) viewing a content area theme (nonverbal receptive input); (2) composing the explicit and implicit information seen in that theme (visualizing holistic meaning and coupling visual meaning with language); (3) writing the theme's information in one's own words (expressing style and organization by applying written language code); and (4) reading the content assignment  (comprehending style and organization through previous visual/verbal input). The more that teachers use picture arrangement to complement the writing styles in content areas, the more they can achieve the four stages of communication development. Essentially visual compositions provide stimuli for developing language skill while motivating students to read and write. Moreover, since patterns of written organization are unique to particular content fields, students can learn the structure of content area organization by viewing the visual composition organized in the same way. Visual composition encourages students to deal with explicit and implicit text factors, promoting a more global understanding of content themes. (HOD)",

A short story was used for obtaining objective rate and comprehension scores for each subject. Two questionnaires designed for the study were used to obtain readers' self reports of their reading processes and attitudes. Contrary to hypotheses, the correlation between rate and comprehension was low (they shared only 7% of the variance), and what readers reported doing in general was related only in a limited way to their specific self reports. As predicted, rate and comprehension were mutually related to attitude, motivation, and interest, but only in a very limited way. The  relationships among the independent variables were low to very moderate. These correlations indicated little interrelatedness, which may point to a lack of reader awareness of the reading processes. (Author/RL)",

Subjects were 48 third and fifth grade students. Although the results indicated no effects of pictures, grade level, or text type on recall of text, there were significant reading level differences in free recall and in certain eye movement patterns. The rated importance of a syntactic text unit was significantly related to free and probed recall as well as to eye movement patterns, and interacted significantly with  reading level and text type. The second experiment was conducted in a classroom setting with 185 fourth grade students. To further examine picture-text interactions, the original three picture conditions were compared using expository texts that were easy to read and similar texts rated more difficult. Written free recall protocols were analyzed in terms of relative importance of different text units. Again there were no main effects of pictures, but significant interactions were found among reading level, importance level, and picture condition. (Author/RL)",

Based on this premise, two experiments were conducted with children to assess individual and developmental differences in speed of word recognition and how these differences related to performance on a variety of memory tasks. One unexpected finding was that although rapidity of word recognition increased sharply and continuously from grade one to grade nine, development was independent of this increase. An important implication of the two experiments is that developmental gains in rapidity of word recognition may have no necessary relation to memory improvement, but that individual differences may go hand in hand with differences among the same individuals  in memory skills. Two other experiments with school-aged children revealed that certain effects studied extensively in sentence verification (the negation and comparator effects) replicated well in sentence completion, that stable differences among individual children did exist, and that the differences probably derived from variation in the efficiency with which different children executed elementary cognitive processes.

So far three separate studies have been conducted to test Lix with French and English texts, with German and English texts, and with Greek and English texts. In all three cases high correlations were found between the Lix scores across languages. The steps for computing Lix scores are as follows: (1) count the total number of words, the number of long words (more than six letters), and the number of sentences in the text; (2) compute the percentage of long words in the text; (3) compute the average words per sentence; and (4) add the two values for 2 and 3 and round to the nearest whole number. Scores usually range from 20  (&quot;very easy&quot;) to 60 (&quot;very difficult&quot;). Although the research base for Lix is preliminary and certain language variations necessitate establishing norms for Lix scores across languages, the Lix formula appears to be easy to compute (assuring intercoder reliability) and useful for examining texts at a variety of levels, from young children's materials through secondary level and adult texts.

        "description":"The multicultural pattern in recent Australian immigration poses a pressing issue for reading instruction. Students coming from homes where only English is spoken, or English and a Northern European language are spoken, perform better on reading tests than do students from homes where other languages are spoken. There is also little reflection among the homogeneous teachers of the cultural diversity of their students, and this mismatch between teachers and students is perpetuated by reading curriculum materials. There are, however, several promising developments in the assessment of reading comprehension and linguistic competence of English-as-a-second-language (ESL) and migrant students. The Cloze Reading Comprehension Test uses a modified form of cloze procedure and--rather  than compare ESL students with a standardized group of peers--compares them against a high level of reading competence, measuring how far readers have yet to go for reading competence. &quot;Origins&quot; is a language/history kit, designed to aid language development in non-English background students while introducing them to Australian history. Australian reading books have recently been published in several different languages (Greek, Turkish, Italian) to increase literacy in students' native language and facilitate the transfer of literacy to English. Finally, a Swedish readability formula (Lix) may be useful in multicultural classrooms when applied to texts in foreign languages. (HTH)",

The eight small cluster settings allow intensive counseling, individualized instruction, and integrated cultural and educational activities, as well as a series of student run and staff directed projects. In the project's sixteenth year, HH 100 operates a ninth grade team at each of Hartford's high schools, a tenth grade team at one high school, and two teams at each of the middle schools, with Funding from Title I. Each team is staffed by five or six teachers, a  counselor, and a project aid. When recent fall-to-spring Metropolitan Achievement Test data were analyzed by team and by grade level, all gains were highly significant, exceeding the projected standard. The upgraded percentile gain standard was reached by all but one team in reading, one grade level with a team in mathematics, and both grade levels within one team in language arts. At least 90% attendance was attained by all teams. Students reported a realistic and positive attitude toward themselves and school, on a self-rating measure similar to those used in previous years.

        "description":"Reading times can be a valuable source of data on comprehension processes, especially in the case of recording reading times on individual sentences in a passage. To overcome the methodological problems encountered in other research efforts concerning reading times, a multiple regression method was used to compare an ordinary language processing simulation model to single sentence reading times by fitting a linear equation to the reading times. Approximately 90 undergraduate college students read simple passages one sentence at a time, with the order of sentences in the passage varied from subject to subject. Three different reading tasks were studied: an immediate free recall task, a topic identification task, and a free reading task. The results revealed that (1) the multiple  regression method of fitting the simulation model to reading time worked; (2) the reading times on individual sentences could be broken down into the times required for each process in the simulation--parsing, representation building, memorizing for recall, topic identification, and topic pointer maintenance; (3) reading times appeared to be determined mostly by representation building and memorization; and (4) the reading tasks differed substantially and in meaningful ways as to how much and what kind of processing was required on individual sentences.

Since the greatest percentage of class time is allocated to seatwork, with worksheets being the most frequently used activity, a study investigated the effects of using three types of worksheet tasks on engaged learning time (ELT) for fifth grade students of three levels of reading ability (high, middle, low). The 134 subjects were assigned to one of three treatment groups: (1) drill, consisting of worksheets composed of multiple choice, true/false, and fill-in-the-blank questions; (2) comprehension, consisting of worksheets designed to promote comprehension of subordinate lesson concepts by requiring analysis, evaluation, or application  of the lesson material; and (3) structuring, consisting of worksheets requiring students to locate and write main ideas appearing in the text. The results indicated that low level readers in the drill treatment spent a significantly greater amount of their time on-task than did high level readers in the same treatment. In addition, high and middle level readers assigned to the structuring treatment had a significantly higher engagement rate than did high level readers in the drill treatment. Finally, subjects at each of the three reading levels in the comprehension treatment spent significantly more time on-task than did high level readers in the drill treatment. (FL)",

Idioms such as \"bury the hatchet\" were presented to 48 college students in sentential contexts that either biased the subject toward a literal or a figurative interpretation or left the interpretation ambiguous. In control sentences, the final words of the idiom were used in nonidiomatic expressions. Subjects monitored the sentences for specified targets. In all cases, the target words were the final words of the idiomatic phrases. The subjects were instructed to detect words that were identical to a cue word, that rhymed with a cue word, or that were members of semantic categories specified by cue words. Reaction times were recorded from the onset of the  targets to the subjects' responses. Subjects detected identity, rhyme, and category matches more rapidly in all three idiomatic contexts than in the nonidiomatic control contexts. However, for literal and ambiguous idioms, category decisions were slower than rhyme decisions, while category matches were made as rapidly as rhyme matches for the control sentences. The results suggest that idioms are automatically processed as discrete lexical entries. (Author/FL)",

The first experiment was a pilot study designed specifically to explicate legitimacy by factor analysis. The second experiment was designed to validate the factor analysis performed in the pilot study, to expand the number of independent variables manipulated, and to test specific hypotheses for the factors. The factor analysis of 20 measures in the first experiment yielded four factors: evaluation, legality, viability, and stability. The results of this pilot study partially supported the hypothesis that negative, ridiculing media coverage of a deviant political group could decrease its perceived legitimacy. In the second experiment, 178 business  and journalism students responded to measures delineating the four factors that resulted from the first experiment. The results of this second experiment found support among all four factors for the hypothesis that negative, ridiculing media treatments could cause a deviant political party to be perceived as less legitimate. But interactions between media treatment and political party on three of the four factors emphasized the need for studying legitimacy as four separate dimensions--evaluation, legality, viability, and stability.

The analysis revealed an overt theme of a world view of individual determination, initiative, self-confidence and self-reliance, and gratification. The covert or unobtrusive theme presents a world view of external determination in which standards are established, consumption is encouraged, and the status quo is accepted and maintained. These two themes appeared to be at odds with each other. One interpretation for this divergence is the gap between the middle-class ideology and the level of consumers in relation to that ideology. A second interpretation is that both  themes are attempts to persuade, one as propaganda of agitation and the other as propaganda of integration. Still a third interpretation suggests that advertising be viewed as ritual rather than as persuasion, and as such, the overt theme is of symbolic action while the covert theme is of ritual action. Each of these interpretations suggests that television advertising is not so much a hidden persuader of culture as it is a reflection of culture. (HTH)",

In addition, the management and marketing techniques of newspapers have changed. Most metropolitan area  newspapers now utilize market research as an integral decision-making tool in the daily management of their newspapers. Others have established internal autonomous research departments to monitor the change taking place in the communities that they serve. The marketing of newspapers has also changed as owners seek the best possible position for their product in a fiercely competitive media environment. Most of these changes have occurred within the past three to five years. (HOD)",

In one area, public health, preventive journalism could be used to emphasize ways to prevent ill health, causes of various health problems, and ways to prevent the costs of dealing with these problems after they become crises. To determine if this preventive approach to health news coverage was being used, a content analysis was conducted of nine issues of a large daily Texas newspaper. The results showed that health news stories usually dealt with the odd, the spectacular, and conflict and  controversy.

Teachers emerged from that week's activities with an outline of their own theories of development in writing abilities to be refined under further examination and to be tested by classroom application. This involved the preparation of writing activities designed to lead to specific kinds of finished written products, the teaching of these activities, analyses of the writing that resulted, the monitoring of progress in  the writing of a number of selected students, the further refinement of these teaching units, and their publication for trial in other classrooms.

The results indicated a slight correlation between the grades and the number of clauses per t-unit and the number of t-units per sentence, suggesting that the teachers were influenced somewhat in their grading by the writer's ability to build compound sentences. The second portion of the study was an analysis  of the difference between each of the three grade groups. Here, the number of words per sentence was found to be the most significant factor. The significant difference between the A and the C papers was possibly due to the fact that the A students connected independent clauses with semicolons more frequently than did the other students and thus produced much longer sentences and more t-units per sentence. While the results infer that sentence combining exercises may help increase the quality of a student's writing, factors of syntactic maturity overall had only a low correlation with the quality of writing.

        "description":"Noting that while much has been said about privacy and the defense of newsworthiness in legal cases involving the unauthorized publication of true but embarrassing facts, this paper points out that there appear to be only three broadly distinguishable--and largely disparate--theories of privacy and newsworthiness, none of them in circulation long enough to have influenced the courts. In an effort to examine these theories critically, the paper begins with a brief overview of the conflict between privacy and a free press, with an emphasis on the legal and moral tension created by an individual's desire to conceal embarrassing facts and the journalist's proclivity to disclose them. The next sections of the paper delineate the three existing theories of newsworthiness, which include  (1) the doctrine of Supreme Court Justices Hugo Black and William O. Douglas, giving almost exclusive weight to First Amendment concerns; (2) Thomas Emerson's definitional approach, which calls for full protection of privacy, even when privacy runs counter to a free press; and (3) the standard set forth by Alexander Meikeljohn, refined by Edward Bloustein and operationalized by Randall Bezanson, which defines newsworthiness in terms of the purpose of self-government. The concluding section offers an appraisal of each theory in terms of its contribution to legal theory and, more pragmatically, each theory's contribution to a workable compromise between newsworthiness and invasion of privacy.

        "description":"Over a three-year period, researchers at Harvard Project Zero investigated metaphoric abilities in children, documenting the development of their metaphoric production, comprehension, and preference, as well as the interrelationships among these skills. Two other areas of literary skills that were investigated were the child's understanding of nonliteral &quot;tropes,&quot; such as irony and understatement, and the child's understanding of the role of fantasy and imagination in the construction of a fictional world. This report discusses the researchers' principal findings, placed in the context of previous work conducted in these areas of study. The first section of the report explores the development of metaphoric production including first metaphors, the decline of metaphor production  in the elementary school years, and the production of analogies during the elementary school years. The second section discusses the development of metaphoric comprehension, with emphasis given to the ways children interpret metaphors and the misunderstanding of the metaphor as a problem of competence or performance. The three remaining sections explore the development of metaphoric preferences, understanding other kinds of figurative language, and understanding the role of imagination in constructing a story. Attached is a two-page reference list, along with examples of student responses to such metaphors as magical, metonymic, primitive, genuine, inappropriate, and incomplete. (HOD)",

        "description":"Based on a pattern of interaction, in which the interactants fulfill the roles of victim, persecutor, or rescuer, a study of ten Harlequin romantic novels was undertaken to determine what factors provided for the readers' identification with the Harlequin characters. It was found that Harlequin heroines manifested their status as victims by suffering from inferiority complexes and a lack of control over their emotions, and that the majority performed low status, traditionally female jobs, waiting for a man to rescue them, all of which reinforce the notion that for a woman, fulfillment comes from having a man rather than a career. It was also found that the Harlequin hero alternated between being a persecutor and being a rescuer. All were handsome, wealthy, powerful, single,  older, sexually experienced, and in control of their emotions. The heroes often failed to notice the heroines' efforts to please them and tended to be condescending and insulting, preying on the heroines' inferiority complexes. Inevitably, the hero rescued the heroine from some accident or disaster, usually of the heroine's making. The hero never doubted that he would capture and tame the heroine's heart. The study concluded that the major issue in these stories was one of power and control, and that the roles of victim, persecutor, and rescuer exist in real life and are reinforced by the role models provided in the Harlequin stories.

        "description":"A review of the literature on reciprocal self-disclosure indicates that scholars have limited their investigations to one aspect of disclosure--intimacy--while recent research suggests that disclosure is a multidimensional phenomenon. A study was conducted to assess the possibility of reciprocation of intimacy, amount, and valence (positive or negative nature) of disclosure. From this assessment, six combinations emerged: (1) intimacy/intimacy, (2) intimacy/amount, (3) amount/amount, (4) intimacy/valence, (5) amount/valence, and (6) valence/valence. The relationship between these forms of reciprocity and evaluations of personality and communication competence as well as uncertainty reduction were then investigated using 126 college students. The subjects were asked to get  acquainted with a new classmate and then to complete self-report measures of disclosure and evaluation. The results of a canonical correlation indicated that two forms of reciprocity resulted in positive evaluations of communicative competence: intimacy/amount and intimacy/valence. (FL)",

        "author":["Gentile, John Samuel"],
        "description":"Charles Dickens was not only a master novelist but was also a master in the art of performance. His distinctive reading style was in marked contrast to the standard practices of mid-nineteenth century elocution, but his unique readings and performance philosophy closely resemble the text-centered approach of modern oral interpretation. Considered by many of his contemporaries to be the outstanding solo reader, Dickens aspired to be an actor, which enabled him to create the many memorable characters in his writing. When he read his works, it was his characterization that won the critics' acclaim. His physical gestures were accentuated by gaslight and an unobtrusive backdrop. He also employed vocal variations in pitch, regional dialects, and even the imitation of speech impediments  to present his characters as faithfully as conceived in print. In Dickens's time, elocution, or the study of articulation, modulation, and inflection, was prescribed in instituted lessons and exercises. The omission of characterization in elocutionist texts makes Dickens a pioneer in the history of interpretation. His innovations are now common practice in the field of interpretation: the recent movement toward greater physicality makes interpretation actually closer to Dickens's style than was true earlier in this century.

The first part of the essay is organized around Elwood Murray's model of a discipline and employs the typologies suggested by G. Goldhaber in 1974 and F. Kast and J. Rosenzweig in 1970. It examines (1) the internal/external, formal/informal, verbal/nonverbal, dyad/small group/public, and network domains of organizational communication research; and (2) the organizational units that have been studied, which include goals, structure, technology, psycho-social systems, and management. This first section concludes with the observation that organizational communication  research is a maturing area of study that has not yet satisfied the criteria for calling it a discipline. The second half of the essay reviews salient features of the classical study of speech communication--including domain, theory, research methods, application, and ethics--and notes that the emerging discipline of organizational communication has much to gain by employing these features of the classical model.

        "description":"Several conclusions about child language were drawn from the data collected during the Bristol longitudinal study, &quot;Language at Home and at School&quot;: (1) the amount of speech that adults address to their children is significantly associated with the children's rate of progress; (2) although many topics are introduced by parents, an equal if not greater number of sequences is initiated by their children; (3) the child contributes few utterances with propositional content that can be extended and, conversely, the child who frequently initiates topics that interest the adult will be more likely to elicit speech from which the child can learn; (4) the form of the conversation depends not only on the topic but also on the purpose of the participants; and (5) the presence of other  children has an effect on the content and structure of the conversations. It was also determined that those children who already have some understanding of the purpose and organization of written language upon entering school are likely to have achieved a higher level of attainment two years later. This tended to be associated with the place and value of literacy in the everyday lives of the parents, which in turn is associated with their own educational and occupational status. Where this familiarity is absent, children are at a disadvantage, both because they lack skills that are important for learning in school and because this lack affects the ways in which their teachers interact with them.

These courses are prototypes that can provide educators with some criteria for deciding the kind of course best suited to their own curriculum. The first consideration must be the students. For example, if the students are viewed as prospective employees unable to conduct the employment interview, the B and P course should be considered. Or, if the students will be managers or supervisors, the  introductory course would be more appropriate. Careful consideration should also be given to the selection of textbooks and the educational background of the instructor. The B and P course could be added to most curricula without major risk, although additional courses, such as the introductory course, lead to the emergence of several factors that can be either opportunities or problems. Before adding the introductory course, the department needs to determine the extent to which the course should be centered around speech communication, how it will fit into the departmental and university curriculum, the effort it will take to teach the material fairly, and the qualifications of the faculty.

        "description":"A study was conducted to examine the ways individuals in organizations interpreted and responded to ambiguous messages. Using Karl Weick's model of organizing, investigators measured the number of rules (criteria for taking action), the number of people, and the frequencies of message categories generated in two simulated organizations comprised of 51 college students. The students acted in company positions at three organizational levels--upper management, middle management, and work groups (foremen and workers)--and responded individually and collectively to high, medium, and low ambiguous organizational messages. The results showed that the subjects used more rules and more people to process high ambiguous messages than they did to process low ambiguous messages. Analysis of  group interaction revealed that most groups spent their talk time reducing equivocality. Workers and foremen reduced ambiguity by adding interpretations while managers proposed specific action steps. Overall, the study indicated that misunderstandings in organizations might evolve from divergent approaches to the management of equivocality. Since some degree of equivocality is present in all organizational input, the way individuals interpret and process this ambiguity is a key to understanding how organizations make sense of their activities.

        "description":"Research on the retention or promotion of failing students has been unable to demonstrate the superiority of either method, concludes the author of this review. Furthermore, research shows that neither method by itself solves the educational problems of low-achieving students, since both retained and promoted students continue to achieve at levels below the class average. Jackson's earlier review of research found that most studies were invalid because they did not control for differences in ability or achievement among failing students. Thus studies comparing students retained or promoted under normal school policies are biased toward promotion policies, says the author, since the students promoted are doing better than those retained anyway. One study attempted to control for  ability differences but failed to control for all of them. Research on individual students suggests that some student characteristics can favor retention or promotion, including the student's rate of progress before retention, the amount of lag behind the class, social maturity, and other factors related to the child, the child's family, and school personnel. These research findings imply that meeting the needs of failing students through programs adjusted to students' ability levels is more important than policies of retention or promotion. (Author/RW)",

It is based on the idea that policy-makers can profit from the learning experiences of other states. The first and longest section of the booklet consists of a three-part overview. The first part of the overview summarizes the characteristics of the school finance reforms passed in the 1970s and identifies six major themes: expanded general aid, increased equity, expanded measures of fiscal capacity, special pupil needs, special district needs, tax and spending limitations, and school finance litigation. The second part of the overview discusses the status of all the states in 1977 on a variety of school finance equity goals. The final part  reviews major events in 1980 and likely state legislative activities in 1981. The next section of the booklet reviews three general topics associated with school financing: the general fiscal condition of public schools, changing public opinion on schools and taxes, and demographic and enrollment trends. The final section of the report examines recent research findings regarding school finance and provides an overview of issues likely to be of interest to policy-makers in the near future.

Suggestions concerning energy conservation in school facilities are drawn from several published sources. These suggestions include forming an energy management team of representatives from the school and community and preparing detailed energy use reports, energy miniaudits by energy team members in each facility, and maxiaudits conducted by hired experts. Sources for the funding of energy projects are suggested. Maintenance and measures requiring capital investment are discussed. A brief section regarding  energy-saving in transportation systems cites suggestions from a U.S. Department of Transportation publication. The final section of the paper presents a program to save money in a school transportation system used in Mercer County, West Virginia. This program used rerouting and rescheduling to cut its l02 buses to 94, conducted a bus driver training course on techniques to promote school economy, and instituted a maintenance program designed to save fuel. The paper concludes that a successful district-wide energy conservation program requires participation and commitment. (Author/JM)",

These include the &quot;Six by Six&quot; technique, in which a large group breaks up into six small groups for six minute discussions; the &quot;PNT Approach,&quot; in which the length of each discussion period increases as positions become solidified; and scenario development, in which possible future situations are developed and analyzed. When discussing scenario development, the author describes in detail the Cross Impact Matrix Analysis on Transparencies (CIMAT) technique. The author then presents the use of case studies for problem solving, a technique he considers useful because the problems presented seem real and relevant and may require complex  problem-solving approaches. He also describes role playing, in which participants act through a problem situation; the Delphi technique, in which questionnaires are used to order priorities or to get a consensus of opinion about when future events will occur; and futures games, for which he recommends that group leaders use those on the market rather than develop their own. Two techniques developed by the author, &quot;Brainstorming-on-Microfiche,&quot; and &quot;Brainstorming-in-Football Stadiums,&quot; are briefly mentioned. (Author/JM)",

First the number of school districts, public and private schools, and colleges of several types is looked at and compared with previous years. Enrollment in public and private schools, colleges, and universities is then examined and trends identified. The report briefly notes the number of teachers at all levels and pinpoints recent reversals of long-term trends. The number of high school and college degrees awarded is the subject of one section in which degrees in five areas--management, education, engineering,  foreign language, mathematics, and statistics--are highlighted. The report also reviews educational revenues and expenditures, including sources and amounts of funds, proportion of government funds spent on education, and comparison of expenditures for education with the gross national product for the past 50 years. School retention rates and level of attainment are examined, including attainment trends over the last 70 years, SAT test scores, and states using minimum competency testing. (JM)",

A brief questionnaire was sent to elementary and secondary schools, both public and private. The study revealed that the present use of computers in instruction is confined almost exclusively to secondary schools. Seventy-four percent of the responding secondary schools reported using computers for instructional purposes, though the percentage varies widely by region. Use of computers is highest in the most populous regions and is also related to school enrollment. The elementary schools reported using only micro computers, but at the secondary level all types of computers proved popular. A primary recommendation of the study is the establishment of  more uniform access to computers in secondary schools. Decisions about the type of computer provided must be based upon individual schools' needs and resources. Appended are a sample questionnaire and tables presenting survey results. (Author/WD)",

Limitations to the study include schools' differing definitions of early school leavers and uncertainty about the extent to which respondents were representative of the leavers who could not be reached.

This paper annotates 59 articles and reports dealing with the causes of, effects of, and solutions to student absenteeism. A brief glossary first defines l4 terms used in the literature. The author then surveys l4 publications on the causes of absenteeism, distinguishing student-level causes, such as personal characteristics or backgrounds, from school- and societal-level causes like school organization, teacher skills, peer pressure, or community values. Seven annotated publications on the effects of absenteeism show that it hurts both students' academic achievement and the school, where it can cause time loss and morale problems. Lastly, the author annotates 38 publications discussing six  kinds of solutions to absenteeism, including punitive plans, parental involvement programs, student-centered agreements, counseling approaches, community agency programs, and nontraditional methods like open campuses or special classes. The author concludes that absenteeism has many causes and effects, but that the solutions suggested yield mixed results, depending upon the specific circumstances and the educational philosophy used.

To help achieve such a theory, a general framework is presented along with testable propositions about the implementation of federal programs. Implementation is defined as including two components: the statutorily required actions must be carried out, and such actions must encompass both formal compliance and the necessary organizational routines. Previous implementation theory was not historically rooted and did not cover all relevant factors. The present propositions use as their framework a typology of federal programs into distributive policies, regulatory policies, and redistributive policies. Twenty propositions are discussed--six  each for distributive and regulatory programs and eight for redistributive programs. The propositions touch on the programs' support patterns, bureaucratic requirements, methods of implementation, corruption problems, target populations, goal ambiguity, and internal regulation. The propositions are middle range, bounded within history by contemporary U.S. culture and based on assumptions about American politics. Yet analysts can test them by predicting program consequences or suggesting changes in program strategies or management techniques. (Author/RW)",

Previously, the states had varied widely along the spectrum of centrist versus localist control; they had been strongest only in such traditional areas as attendance, accreditation, and school facilities regulation. The growth of state control in the 1970s resulted chiefly from increases in states' fiscal and institutional capacity to regulate education and from the activities of interstate &quot;policy issue networks.&quot; School finance reforms provide an example of the effects of one such network on state control. Non-profit organizations, lawyers, and technical assistance groups, linked and backed by the Ford Foundation and the National Institute of  Education, won numerous state court battles that forced state legislatures to fund programs for educational equity. Besides finance reform, increases in state control also affected special needs programs, bilingual education, and minimum competency requirements. State control may have become excessive in the 1970s; however, data are lacking to assess the effects of state influence. State control is unlikely to continue expanding in the 1980s, as tax revolts will limit state spending. (RW)",

        "description":"The panoply of possible factors contributing to the observed earnings differences between blacks and whites exceeds current analytical abilities. Thus, this paper concentrates on a limited range of factors: skill differences among workers, geographic location (or labor market), and race. Skill differences are measured by schooling and experience levels. The analysis allows for interactions with specific labor markets instead of averaging across different labor markets and uses data from the Public Use Samples of the 1970 census to estimate the three factors being examined. The study indicates that differences in regional geographic location of black and white workers have a rather modest effect on aggregate earnings differences. Differences in schooling and experience, when  isolated, could account for 11 to 14 percent of the earnings gap between races. However, if schooling and experience levels are held constant, 90 percent of the earnings gap would be closed if the groups were equally rewarded for their skills. Because of limited information about skill differences among workers, it is not possible to conclude that the earnings differences are caused solely by discrimination. A substantial portion of the measured differences could be explained by qualitative differences in schooling and experience. (Author/WD)",

The 25 schools' ability to solve these five problems was correlated with their inputs (expenditures per pupil), outputs (teacher job satisfaction and student scores on standardized tests), and structural characteristics (participative decision-making, vertical communication,  and high performance norms). Data was provided by the schools and, through interviews and questionnaires, by a sample of 200 of the schools' teachers. Results indicate positive relationships among the schools' expenditures, their problem-solving adequacy, and those structural variables involving communication and performance norms. Problem-solving ability was in turn positively related to student achievement and teacher job satisfaction. (RW)",

In this project, interviews are used to identify what an individual is doing, has done, or plans to do regarding an innovation. Interviews have been used to determine levels of use (LOU) of the innovation (whether and how the innovation is being used). Results of testing with three different raters demonstrated that reliability of these self-reports is high. Correlation of interview results with ethnographic observations also resulted in a high correlation. In the PAEI Project, interviews also are important for measuring  configurations (variations or modification) of an innovation. Because users will be reporting unique ways of using the innovation, the combination of a focused and open-ended interview is necessary. In order to determine which interventions have influenced the successful adoption of an innovation, an additional interview technique that combines the open-ended and the focused interview is being developed. PAEI researchers have concluded that the interview is a valuable research tool that can be an effective means of collecting needed data. (Author/JM)",

Employing the Concerns-Based Adoption Model, in which participants' behaviors are classified by interventions, stages of concern, and levels of use, the study concludes that different interventions are required at different parts in the change process. Further, the study suggests that change facilitators should identify various innovation configurations prior to implementation of change; that it is important to set criteria for what constitutes use of the innovation; that there  is a need to determine how much support is required for successful implementation to occur; that change facilitators need to make sure administrators have adequate training and understanding of the change process; and that it is important to choose a model for decision-making that fits the requirements and goals of the project.

Although requested to identify the characteristics of needed internal support structures (such as counseling or supplementary training for teachers), the authors instead describe how to establish an environment and set of procedures out of which needed support structures can emerge. The first section of the report analyzes the five-year plan Dutch officials have formulated for the development of autonomous schools. Several measures are recommended, including plans for responding to schools that do not become autonomous. The second section of the paper explains autonomous  schools and internal support structures and recommends the separation of the two, with an initial focus on developing autonomous schools in which staff are free to request the support structures they feel are necessary. The third section offers theoretical perspectives on change, with an emphasis on the Concerns-Based Adoption Model. It then deals with the steps necessary to implement the autonomous school in real sites. A short concluding section looks at Dutch education as a whole and poses questions about the role of the school. (JM)",

The Title XX Program provides funds to states to enable them to tailor social services programs to fit the needs of local communities. Such services are primarily for the elderly, such as home health aides or adult day care programs, but also include other services, such as child day care and delinquency prevention. The services are provided directly by public agencies or purchased from other agencies. Programs reviewed were offered in New York, Maryland, North Carolina, California, and New Mexico. The GAO found that most contracts awarded to purchase services under Title XX in four of the  states visited were stated in such general terms that the states did not know what contractors were committed to deliver or whether commitments were met. The GAO recommends that the Secretary of Health and Human Services improve state contracting by encouraging the use of contracts based on unit prices or specific levels of service and prompt states that authorize elderly persons to hire their own homemaker and chore service providers to monitor the quality of services and assure that the required hours are delivered.

A brief literature review relates studies examining the principalship of elements of the current study. Both elementary and secondary principals were found to spend most of their time in principal-initiated contacts with staff, faculty, and students. These principals affected their schools by balancing stabilization and enhancement, transforming attitudes that opposed school policy, and controlling the climate to foster uninterrupted learning. In the community, the principals had to diplomatically shape  parent expectations of the schools' capabilities. Principals' responses to their superiors ranged from ignoring orders to overt disobedience in order to protect staff morale. The principals often short-circuited the system and used superiors' indecision to their schools' advantage. They shaped their jobs to suit their personal preferences and work styles. They relied more on one-to-one, face-to-face communications in contrast to businessmen who depend more on group meetings and written memoranda. This study also describes ways principals obtained and utilized professional information. (MMJ)",

The three REAs are the Wayne County (Michigan) Intermediate School District (with 36 districts), the Educational Improvement Center-South in New Jersey (144 districts), and the Northern Colorado Educational Board of Cooperative Services (six districts). Each case study describes the REA and its knowledge utilization activities, the interorganizational arrangements for knowledge utilization services, the outcomes of the services, and the reasons why the services are used. The knowledge utilization services examined fall into four areas, including information  retrieval, linking agent assistance, staff development, and general organizational issues. Analysis of the services' levels of use indicates that the Michigan and New Jersey REAs are more successful that the Colorado REA. The reasons for this difference have more to do with service credibility, interpersonal ties, responsiveness to user needs, mutual exchanges, and external financial resources and less to do with compliance with state laws (except in New Jersey), formal interorganizational agreements, or conflict reduction among the participating organizations.

Researchers studied how knowledge utilization services in four areas--staff development, linking agent assistance, information retrieval, and broad organizational issues--were supplied to their school districts by the Wayne County (Michigan) Intermediate School District, the Northern Colorado Educational Board of Cooperative Services, and the Educational Improvement Center-South (New Jersey). For each case study, data were collected from REA documents, field observation, and field interviews with staffpersons from the REA, school districts, and the state education agency. Results showed that successful  interorganizational collaboration could be explained by six factors: (1) services were user-oriented; (2) services were supported by external resources; (3) REA and district staffs formed active interpersonal networks; (4) the state mandated collaboration; (5) collaboration yielded mutual benefits for REAs and school districts; and (6) federal and state regulations and policies facilitated cooperation. To test these explanations, further research is needed on other types of interorganizational arrangements and on knowledge utilization itself.

Twenty-six states were surveyed using two questionnaires, which were distributed between July and October in 1978. Data were analyzed according to nine categories and further broken down into three types of state networks--the special district ESAs, the regionalized ESAs, and the cooperative ESAs. The report is  divided into eleven chapters; each considers one of the nine principal characteristics studied. Chapter eleven presents a discussion of the findings. One important conclusion is that the large number of selected characteristics is useful in identifying the critical variables to be considered in the development of a meaningful taxonomy of types of ESAs. Such a taxonomy is an essential prerequisite to the design of evaluation strategies for comparing the effectiveness of different types of education service agencies. (Author/WD)",

        "description":"Kentucky's first education service agency (ESA) network was initiated in 1972. After expanding to cover most of the state, it was dissolved in 1976 for lack of funding. Using case study methodology, this paper discusses the historical background of Kentucky's educational system, the establishment and abolition of educational regions and of the ESA networks, the perceptions of ESA executive officers and of officials from the state education agency (SEA) concerning the ESAs, and post-mortem observations. A five-part questionnaire was used to measure perceptions of ESA and SEA officials. Findings are based on a sample of 12 respondents and indicate strong support for ESAs in the field (at the local level) but opposition to ESAs in the state superintendent's and governor's offices.  The report suggests that greater grass-roots involvement in planning the ESA network would have enhanced its chances for survival. Other factors contributing to the system's demise were the absence of a statutory basis and competition among different educational agencies. However, the political environment seems to have been the greatest determinant in the decision not to continue the ESAs. (Author/WD)",

The report describes the Texas educational system and the RESCs, lists the data sources, and presents the findings and observations. Results are discussed in detail according to 19 questions that the study sought to answer. The findings indicate that school district use of RESC services varies more according to size than to any other district variable, especially in the area of computer services. Smaller districts tend to use more media and technical assistance services. School district wealth was found to be a  significant factor in hiring substitute teachers to allow local staff to participate in RESC workshops: poorer districts participated less. With the exception of computer services, poor and wealthy districts availed themselves fairly equally of RESC services. Differences among the ESAs in Texas appear to be more dependent upon leadership than upon demographic characteristics. Recommendations include periodic performance reviews of RESC directors, improved accountability, and increases in base funding. Regional graphs and project instruments are appended. (WD)",

The paper concludes that there is no one best scenario for the management of decline. The authors anticipate a more pluralistic response to retrenchment, one that depends upon flexibility rather than standardization.

For instance, as the U.S. economy moved from agricultural through industrial to service bases, U.S. education moved from nonpublic schools to public schools to mass higher education. However, the relationship of education to workplace forms also has contradictions, such as the opposition between educational equal opportunity and workplace hierarchy. The major current contradiction is education's production of a workforce that is overeducated in relation to available job opportunities. Such workers are disgruntled and unproductive in factory jobs. These production problems are pushing workplaces toward greater  democratization, which will in turn create more democratic educational organization. Democratic educational forms have been suggested in the past, by Pestalozzi, Neef, and Dewey, but since they did not correspond to workplace forms, they were never implemented. Workplace democratization will precede educational democratization, so researchers must examine types of workplace democracy, such as team assembly in factories, to predict their consequences for education. Team assembly will push education toward four changes, emphasizing participatory decision-making, individual problem-solving, minimum competencies, and peer tutoring. (RW)",

U.S. evaluation programs, such as Florida's annual review of selected disciplines in its nine state institutions of higher education, are few in number and have spread only recently, in response to declining resources and increasing demands for accountability. In developing countries, however, there is a critical need for program evaluation, because of these countries' large number of problems, the consequent need for many higher education programs, the lack of models for comparison, the sharp limits on resources and funding, and the need to deal with political pressures for particular programs. An example of a  successful evaluation occurred in the Bahamas, where the College of the Bahamas assessed the need for and implementation and outcome of a new program to prepare secondary school dropouts for employment or higher education. The evaluation process included data collection and analysis as well as faculty training in evaluation methods. As expected, college and government officials were very receptive to the program evaluation process. (RW)",

Three case studies of New York City programs illustrate how the components interact in different situations. The city's School Improvement Project aims to make schools more effective in teaching poor children. It has not been successfully implemented, however, because politicians have not committed additional resources and because neither they nor the workers (teachers) believe the project can succeed. In the case of early childhood projects, the federally-funded Head Start and day care programs are successful but do not coordinate with similarly successful nursery and kindergarten programs in the city's public schools, chiefly because  of differing political origins and because of cleavages between the workers' two unions. Finally, the city's youth employment training projects are split between public secondary school programs and the city employment department's training programs. Because data are lacking on either program's content and performance, program decisions depend mostly on political and union factors. Hence, as with early childhood projects, parallel programs remain uncoordinated. (Author/RW)",

Further study is warranted in this area, both to determine the effects of the agreements on the way  families choose schools, and on the interacting effects of parental choice, the agreements, and school climate. The situation is also of interest to those concerned with voucher plans because, although not strictly speaking a voucher plan, the degree of freedom of choice present in Saskatoon mimics many such plans.

The researchers matched individual students with teachers for five-year periods during grades three through eight. Variables examined include students' testscores and race, school enrollment and attendance, pupil-teacher ratios, percentage of non-white students and teachers, ratings of teachers' baccalaureate and graduate institutions, and eight factors relating to achievement levels of students' classmates. The study found that previous achievment levels and student intelligence are excellent predictors of achievement; that teacher  experience is occasionally a factor in student achievement; and that the effect of teacher and school variables is larger for black students than for white students. The study concludes that school level variables explain virtually none of the variation in student achievement and that it is unlikely that such factors as administrator intensity, teacher and pupil attendance rates, and resource allocation will have much impact on student achievement.

The RDU evaluation study employs site visits, interviews,  surveys, and case studies to analyze the schools, linking agents, and projects involved and to address seven major policy issues. To ensure that the study is oriented toward user needs, researchers asked 25 educational policy makers to examine the program and rank the policy issues.

        "description":"Intended as a guide for educators in shared decision-making, this report summarizes the structures, procedures, and activities of local action teams in 49 schools involved in the National Institute of Education's Research and Development Utilization (RDU) program. Local action teams in the RDU program consisted of formal groups of teachers and administrators empowered to make decisions on local school improvement using decision-making models based on problem-solving and knowledge utilization. The guide discusses the consequences, organization, procedures, and leadership and communication factors involved in employing local action teams. To illustrate each of these aspects, the guide cites examples of successful local action teams in three of the 49 schools: a rural northeastern  elementary school, an urban southeastern elementary school, and a suburban West Coast middle school. Included in the report's discussion are the benefits and problems of shared decision-making, the local action team's function, size, representation, and training, the principal's role, involvement of non-team faculty, and problem-solving practices. The authors identify 11 factors contributing to a local action team's effectiveness, including strong leadership, assistance from external facilitators, and willingness to commit considerable energy to the project.

To assess the training and support provided these field agents by the seven RDU projects, researchers surveyed 49 linking agents, examined each project's training methods, content, and timing, and interviewed the 49 agents' direct supervisors. Linking agent training covered problem-solving, interpersonal and group dynamics, knowledge availability and use, and project administration. Training methods included group discussion, role-playing, one-on-one teaching, and lectures. The research data showed that (1) only minor  differences existed among the projects in the training provided; (2) linking agents would have preferred greater variety in training methods and content and greater emphasis on skill development rather than on information acquisition; (3) RDU projects and the agents' host agencies were both important sources of support; and (4) support activities had more impact on agents than training did. The authors recommend that the RDU Program enhance its support for linking agents by helping them interact more with each other and with more resource agencies. (Author/RW)",

The four legislative and ten executive interviewees also ranked the importance of the seven RDU study issues and suggested how to make the study report's executive summary most relevant to policy making. Both legislative and executive policy makers agreed substantially on the seven issues' relative importance but disagreed sharply with the 1978 opinions of 25 state and federal policy makers on the relevance of RDU efficiency and the impact of  educational research. Preliminary RDU findings indicated successful implementation of new practices, effective RDU intervention in schools, low RDU costs at the school level, and establishment of an RDU service delivery network. The policy makers saw 23 policy implications for these findings, in federal policy development, program development and refinement, directions for future research, and influence on federal legislation. They recommended that the executive summary be brief and target high educational decision-makers. (Author/RW)",

They also examined the relationship of RDU costs to the program's outcomes at the school level. Data were gathered on a sample of 22 schools through financial audits and interviews with teachers and administrators. The results showed that an average of 80 percent of the RDU program's total costs were &quot;inkind&quot; costs resulting from the provision of local resources, mostly donated staff time. Statistical analysis indicated that, while total program costs did not correlate with any measure of RDU success, the percentage of locally  contributed resources was positively associated with successful RDU outcomes, especially concerning the program's organizational impact on the schools, its developmental impact on school staff, and the school's incorporation of educational innovations.

        "description":"This brief report summarizes the staff development benefits that occurred as a result of teachers participating in the Research and Development Utilization Program (RDU). Surveys of 540 teachers revealed the five most frequently cited staff development benefits to be: (1) learning more about curriculum development; (2) learning more about the availability of research- and development-based materials and programs; (3) acquiring new resources for helping other staff members; (4) gaining in self-confidence; and (5) learning more about the problem-solving process. Features of the programs that aided staff development were the use of school-based &quot;local action teams&quot;; the focus of training and the program on actual problems facing teachers in their work; and the use of tested, high  quality materials. The report concludes that teachers who participated on a team benefited more than those who did not, and that providing expert training in implementing a new curriculum produced staff development benefits. The study suggests that merging inservice/staff development programs and planned change programs will create a more complimentary use of limited school funds. (Author/MLF)",

RDU was established in 1976 to disseminate educational materials and thereby help schools clarify and solve local problems. Seven projects were supported by the RDU program for three years, serving altogether more than 300 schools. An independent research organization evaluated the RDU program to learn more about the management of local school improvement and the effectiveness of RDU strategies. Data sources included interviews of RDU project staff and linking agents, case studies of 40 participating sites, and mailed surveys of principals and teachers. The study  revealed that a dissemination strategy can have benefits beyond the adoption and implementation on innovations, that relevant products of high quality (not necessarily locally developed) must be available for a dissemination-based approach to work, that external training and assistance must be consistently provided, and that high levels of faculty and administrator participation are crucial to successful adoption of innovations. Additional findings address funding, local self-sufficiency, educational equity, and the use of networks. An annotated bibliography of other RDU program reports is included. (Author/WD)",

The seven project sites included in the RDU program were first instructed to organize a knowledge base. All projects chose one or both of the recommended problem areas, basic skills and career education. Products were evaluated more rigorously at some project sites than at others and the process of product validation elicited substantial controversy during the program. The project sites then provided assistance to school sites in matching needs to specific  products and adopting such products. All schools finally did adopt some product, though 50 to 60 percent of all the adoptions may have involved nonvalidated materials. Because of the problem in quality control, it is suggested that a larger pool of acceptable educational products and clearer operational guidance are needed. The slippage from validated to nonvalidated products can also be partially attributed to the tension between the technology-oriented and user-oriented objectives of the RDU program. (Author/WD)",

Three sections each present, first, the results of agent and client surveys and, second, a case study  illuminating the issues explored by the surveys. The three sections discuss organizational influences on the agent role, including job design, training and support, and job attitudes; agent-client relations and agents' attitudes and strategies; and the effects of agent activities in program outcomes.

Chapter 1 provides a brief introduction to the physical education curriculum and the Teaching Research model with emphasis placed on the importance of individualized and data based instruction. Chapter 2 addresses the basic principles underlying the behavior modification approach that is utilized in the Data Based Gymnasium. Chapter 3 summarizes the principles of behavior programing in the Data Based Gymnasium and illustrates the forms used for tracking those behaviors. Some examples of how programming and tracking occurs are given. It is explained in a fourth chapter that gymnasium management,  like classroom management, includes the welding together by a teacher/manager of the curriculum containing complete scope and sequence, a data keeping system, materials and reinforcers, aides, volunteers, and parents. Chapter 6 describes the Game, Exercise, and Leisure Sport Curriculum; placement procedures in the curriculum; and the development of the physical education individualized education program. Chapter 6 covers ways of tracking a student's performance in the acquisition of a skill; while Chapter 7 outlines guidelines for volunteers. Chapter 8 considers small group activities for the severely and moderately handicapped. The utilization of medical support services is the focus of Chapter 9. A final chapter points out three ways in which parents can be involved in their children's  education, including the use of parents as volunteers. Appended are examples for the Game, Exercise, and Leisure Sport Curriculum. (SB)",

The Dallas evaluation model utilized a modification of the CIPP model which delineated four kinds of evaluation information: context (which describes the state of the world before intervention), input (which describes the intervention strategies), process (which describes the implementation of strategies), and product (which describes the impact of intervention). Forty-seven research studies conducted over an 8 year interval addressed research questions falling into seven categories: context/needs, student description, model description, functional quality, model effects, people reaction, and cost. Six major topical areas were  covered by research and evaluation efforts--mainstream programing 1972-1977, Child Find Project 1975-1980, early intervention 1975-1981, individualized education program (IEP) implementation 1972-1978, programing for emotionally disturbed children 1978-1981, and standardized testing 1976-1977 and 1980-1981. Some study outcomes were that more than half the IEPs sampled did not include annual goals in concert with short term objectives and test performance by special students was low. (SB)",

Five components of the program are briefly outlined: intervention in the classroom and in the home, parent involvement, support services, training and dissemination, and evaluation. Difficulties in evaluation are considered for four categories: resources for evaluation, framework for guiding evaluation efforts, suitability of existing measures, and appropriateness of available analytic designs. Among the solutions offered are the following: whenever possible, collect data which  have multiple purposes; after identifying the goals of the program, select instruments that reflect the program's emphasis; when no standard instruments are available that match program goals, define in clear behavioral terms what those goals are, then use those definitions as the basis for developing an assessment measure; and evaluate child progress using multiple indices and conditions when possible. Outlined is a plan for documenting child progress in the Preschool Program at the Center on Human Development. A plan is outlined for documenting child progress in terms of resources, framework, assessment measures, data analyses, data preparation, simple data description, and estimation of program effects. Tables and figures provide information on instruments used in the evaluation plan,  testing schedule, and training targets. Among the tables and figures provided are a description of instruments used in the evaluation plan, sample recording forms, and flow charts of important considerations in instrument selection, data preparation, and data analysis. Appended materials include descriptions of assessment instruments, a sample demographic form, and additional analytic strategies for assessing program impact. (SB)",

Section I includes reviews of research which demonstrates the effectiveness of intervention programs and their impact on the development of very young handicapped children and on infants and toddlers at risk. Early intervention research findings are reported in relation to motor development,  emotional and social development, language development, cognitive development, specific populations (such as the mentally retarded and severely/profoundly handicapped), and newborns. Section II describes the effect of services on the family, identified family service needs, and the rationale for the participation of families in programs for handicapped infants and toddlers. A third section shows data on the costs and cost effectiveness of intervention programs for children aged birth to 3 years, and the fourth section outlines the characteristics of a comprehensive service delivery system followed by specific recommendations for action at local, state, and federal levels.

        "description":"The paper reviews state categorical funding programs to serve special need populations among school age children (including handicapped, educationally disadvantaged, bilingual, and vocational education students); examines the literature on costs of categorical programs; and presents an alternative framework for addressing the problem. A cost based funding approach is advocated which would provide equal access to educational resources across local districts serving similar student populations. The model also makes provisions for systematic differences in access to resources to districts serving special populations. It is explained as an approach which gives policy makers a basis to examine cost savings in trade offs among resources and programs. Applications of the resource cost  model are presented along with a section on the step by step process of constructing a cost estimate in a hypothetical school district. A final section addresses equity and efficiency issues of the model. (CL)",

Part One is a discussion of the process of deciding on an education career, completing a teacher training program, and obtaining certification. It highlights specific barriers that disabled persons have faced in the process and suggests possible solutions. Part Two describes, by category of physical disability, the successful coping strategies used by disabled educators in the classroom. The categories are: blind and visually impaired; deaf and hard of hearing; amputees; those with neurological disabilities (spinal cord and cerebral), neuromuscular disabilities, organic disorders, and orthopedic handicaps; speech impaired; and the mentally  retarded. In Part Three, discussions are presented from a conference of disabled and non-disabled educators on barriers faced by disabled persons in education, and ways are suggested to eliminate or reduce them. Part Four is a directory of more than 900 educators with disabilities who agreed to be listed as resource persons. Part Five includes print, nonprint, and organizational resources relating to handicapped persons in education. (JD)",

        "description":"The first section of this monograph contains a report on a research study that investigated the induction of beginning teachers in Queensland, Australia. The first phase of the study collected the opinions of educational associations and organizations with respect to the responsibility of the profession for the induction of beginning teachers. In the second phase, beginning primary teachers' perceptions were sought on their preservice preparation and their induction into the teaching profession. Finally, desirable qualities of beginning primary teachers as perceived by experienced educators were identified. In the second section of this report, the proceedings of a conference organized to consider the implications of the study findings are reported. At the conference, viewpoints  of college personnel, school inspectors, principals, experienced teachers, and beginning teachers were presented on the findings of the study. Opinions based on personal experiences were also expressed. Recommendations arising out of the induction conference were that: (1) The major responsibility for planning and implementing induction for beginning teachers should be at the school level; and (2) The programs should be carefully conceived as a support system, and related as closely as possible to the training obtained in preservice education. Conclusions on policy, preservice preparation, initial placement, school climate, and future research are outlined. (JD)",

Opinions on student needs were gathered from liberal arts faculty, minority representatives, elementary and secondary school staff, teacher educators, and students in teacher education. The diverse background of pupils has influenced American educational development, spurred by pressure from special interest groups, legal actions, and the concerns of educators. The program acknowledges this diversity by seeking to develop knowledge, ability, and attitudes in prospective teachers in each phase of study. The initial required courses introduce basic cognitive information regarding multicultural education. In the sophomore year,  candidates officially request admission into the teacher education program, where courses are increasingly method-oriented. When the student teaching phase is approached, a further commitment and a reevaluation process is required. The final phase is one of renewal, where students reflect on the entire cycle and seek a synthesis of the knowledge gained. The entire process may be viewed as acculturating a student into a profession. (FG)",

Since most teachers have not had training in the museum's role in education, it is often the museum docents who perform the teaching role in museums. A descriptive study was conducted as a preliminary phase of research into museum teaching and learning prior to establishing the program. Questionnaires were developed for docent tour guides and teachers who visit museums with their students, each intended to elicit preferences and needs for students' tours. Responses revealed the following problems: (1) Docents are asked to lead tours for all ages of children from nursery school through high school and are rarely informed in advance of what age  group they may be addressing; (2) The group size determines the teaching techniques that will be used on a tour, and, for the most part, groups are too large for anything more than informed lecturing; (3) The amount of museum space that will be covered and the length of time available affect the amount of teaching that can take place; and (4) Communication between school and museum is often not enough to help docents understand what teachers expect of museum visits for their students. Particular emphasis is placed upon developing visual literacy in museum visitors. The need for collaborative programs between schools of education, museums, and the schools to develop effective training for teachers and docents in museum education is pointed out. (JD)",

The purpose of the study was to determine the relationship between the affective behavior of the teacher and the students' academic achievement and attitudes. Anecdotal information based on the classroom observers' summary descriptions are used to capture the salient characteristics and the overall tone of teacher behavior and classroom environment. High achievement-high attitude classes were characterized by good organization, a high proportion of time in instructional activity, and task-orientation. Low achievement-low attitude classes were chaotic, unstructured classrooms with less task-orientation.

Among the factors that educators must contend with are: (1) The birth rate has been increasing slowly since 1974; (2) The reduction in the number of teachers will not be as severe as the reductions in the number of school age persons; (3) Regional, state, and community enrollment patterns differ widely, with population declines in the suburbs becoming an enrollment factor for the metropolitan districts; and (4) A shortage of qualified teachers is possible in the late 1980s, particularly among elementary, math, science, special education, industrial arts, and agriculture  teachers unless teaching is made to appear more attractive.

The claim of educational ethnography is that it discovers and describes the ways that members of the school community create and share meaning. Ethnographers aim to discover the operating knowledge that enables educators and students to navigate everyday life in schools. To document classroom life with any measure of completeness or validity, the ethnographer must consider both the social life of the classroom and the mental activities occasioned by social interaction. Teachers, as the chief planners and purveyors of important occasions for learning in the classroom, are in a unique position to observe, monitor, and reflect  upon both social and academic change in the classroom. In this light, teachers are very special natives of the classroom community who can be important arbiters of the validity of educational ethnography and can even help to shape the course of ethnographic description.

The developmental approach is characterized by: (1) a focus on an end state (maturity); (2) the assumption that all individuals go through the same sequence of changes leading to that end state; and (3) the assumption that these changes are self-directed. This approach is clarified by using examples, and by contrasting it with a biological model of development and a socialization approach to the study of teacher change. A developmental theory of teacher change cannot provide a justification for particular educational goals; justification for adoption of a developmental stage as a goal must come from outside the theory. Developmental theories might help teacher educators  understand the mechanisms by which teachers change, but existing theories of teacher development are weak at this point. A description of the stages of teacher change may help teacher educators sequence their instruction. Seeing early stages from the perspective of the end state may also help teacher educators to appreciate teachers at early stages. The paper concludes with suggestions for those who would attempt a developmental approach to the construction of a theory of teacher change. (Authors)",

Teacher effectiveness findings are then presented in two major categories. The first examines direct instruction, classroom management, and psychological conditions as these contribute to opportunity to learn. The second examines the research on teacher planning and teacher decision making as these illustrate the prevalence of technical teacher behavior. Implications for the reading profession are presented in terms of teacher education, reading research, and possible cooperative ventures between research on reading and research  on teaching.

Selected studies of STI and ITI for tests other than the SAT-M and SAT-V, and of testwiseness (TW), were included in the survey if they were judged relevant to the question of special instruction for the SAT. The research studies were reviewed and interpreted within the framework of a score components model that posited four content-related and two TW scores components, as well as test-taking confidence and efficiency, that are theoretically subject to STI and ITS effects. In addition, examinee, item, and instructional characteristics were considered as  they relate to the score components model. Basic discrepancies between negative and positive findings were noted for both the SAT-M and the SAT-V. There were generally resolved in favor of recognizing meaningful STI effects for the SAT-M, but remain unresolved for the SAT-V. Recommendations were made for SAT-M and SAT-V research allowing STI effects to be partitioned according to examinee, item, and instructional characteristics as they apply to selected test score components.

The &quot;handicapped&quot; studied were not a homogeneous group: type of disability, severity and duration of the handicap, age at onset, progression of the disability, and the individual's adaptation all varied. One handicap, however, was common across many disabilities: the attitude of the public toward the handicapped. Almost half of the students had been tested in standard administration of the SAT, many because they were  unaware of Lhe availability of special administrations. Several problems with the SAT itself were identified, such as the answer sheet for those with visual impairment or the vocabulary level for deaf students. The recommendations made are designed to close the communication gap between ETS, handicapped students, counselors, and test administrators; develop a database for validity and reliability research for handicapped students; and solve some of the time and space problems through modularization of standardized tests.

Each testee responds to 25 items; at the conclusion of the test the computer calculates a verbal ability score for the individual. The test was designed to yield a verbal ability score from the fifth grade level to the graduate school level. Two forms of the BRTT were administered to 146 high school students. Analyses revealed that the BRTT was more reliable than the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test (PSAT) for a number of scores derived from the data, confirming theoretical expectations regarding the increased efficiency of adaptive, as compared to conventional tests. Of nine observed scores and score transformations, the most useful score was the expected proportion correct over the entire item pool. The  accuracy of the BRTT was in accord with theoretical expectation. Student response to the computerized testing procedure was generally quite favorable. Students found the human-computer interface easy to use and less fatiguing than a long pencil-and-paper test. These results suggest that computerized adaptive testing is ready to take the first steps out of the laboratory environment and find its place in the educational community. (Author/BW)",

If one accepts the proposition that different kinds of questions require different kinds of methodologies, then the question of methodological relevance can be asked as, &quot;Is this particular method (or model) appropriate to the questions that I am trying to answer?&quot; Methodological rigor is a determination of whether the method selected meets certain standards for a &quot;good&quot; or &quot;trustworthy&quot; method, a &quot;sound&quot; design, or an &quot;appropriate&quot; type of data analysis. It is frequently  argued that one must choose between rigorous and relevant methods. This argument demonstrates a confounding of the notions of methodological rigor and methodological relevence. Rigor and relevence are not necessarily inversely related. These issues are being discussed by vocational evaluators, and warrant additional investigation. (BW)",

Title I PAM is useful, timely, and efficient--in the sense of minimum interference with the educational program and modest cost. The Title I PAM system in reading comprises Achievement Monitors for the measurement of reading comprehension; Monitor Reports on teachers' reading classes or instructional groups; Program Analysis Reports (PAR); questionnaires for the collection of process information; and computer programs for test scoring and report generation. PAR (i.e.,: grade-level reports for the principal) are the heart of PAM and relate pupil achievement to the  distribution and use of classroom resources. If pupil achievement is substandard, then the principal has a legitimate need to intervene at the level of the classroom teacher. If pupil achievement is satisfactory, but resource utilization is more than, or less than, expected, the principal will want to confer with the teacher. In Title I PAM there are three variations on the PAR. Descriptions and illustrations of each type are appended. (RL)",

Congress has passed four laws: Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974; Freedom of Information Act, as amended; Privacy Act of 1974; and National Research Act of 1974. From 1971-1980, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (DHEW) and then the Department of Education and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) required that all prospective grantees of federal funds provide assurances to protect human subjects involved in research activities. Recent amendments to these regulations have exempted broad categories of research which normally present little or no risk of harm to subjects. Researchers have expressed concern over the conflict between the Freedom of Information  Act (when the person who paid for a study through taxes believes he or she has a right to the data that was collected), and the Privacy Act and DHEW/HHS regulations (when the person who provides data does so only under the condition that confidentiality is maintained). Investigation of current operating procedures of the federal government reveals nine areas which constitute an informal system for protection of human subjects. (BW)",

Further, it was shown that given any natural growth  situation, there is a value of K for which ANOVA of Index of Response is a potentially correct analysis strategy.

Degrees of participation include the extent of participation in family decisions, the extent of restriction on activities by formal rules at home, the extent of participation in classroom decisions, and the extent of self-direction in classroom instruction. The total population of students in selected grade levels at the elementary, middle, and senior high school levels were surveyed in the spring of 1973 and again in the spring of 1974. The two surveys yielded a longitudinal sample of 5,454 students for whom complete survey data were available. Results of  analyses suggested that sequential and steady change in the direction of increased participation by youngsters in decision-making at home and at school may be essential for continued progress in developing mature attitudes and behaviors. It was clear that change in student behavior can be more fully understood with concurrent consideration of change in the real environmental demands for growth.

All students were pre-tested in February 1978 in reading, language arts, math and social studies using the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills. A post-test was given in May, 1978. It was found that altering definitions of time-on-task to include momentary off-task behaviors affected the conclusions for the importance of time-on-task. Clear evidence was presented that sampling segments of instruction would tend to obscure the positive results for time-on-task. It was also shown that reducing the number of days of observation weakened the effects of  time-on-task. However, the timing of the observation was not very important for the noted effects. The effect of sampling fewer than six students was explored and, due to the effect on reliability, it was suggested that this approach would not be advisable. Results suggested that although there is an understandable urge to lessen the observation time in order to bolster the number of settings observed, such steps should only be taken cautiously.

Staff also reviewed the descriptive materials regarding the SAT which are provided to  students and schools each year by Educational Testing Service and CB.

        "description":"Hierarchial causal models are described as pictorial representations of multiple regression equations. These models are particularly helpful for three reasons: (1) the formulation of problems in a path analytic framework forces a degree of explicitness that is often not present in research reports that rely solely on regression; (2) they provide a powerful aid to the substantive interpretation of results; and (3) they aid in the interpretation of relationships between unmeasured variables. Though causal modeling techniques are very powerful, important prerequisites are a thorough knowledge of one's subject matter and a stylish appreciation of alternative explanations. (BW)",

The procedures include: factor analysis, nonmetric multidimensional scaling, cluster analysis, and latent trait analysis. Both simulated and real data sets of known structure were used to evaluate the procedures. The analysis of the one-factor data sets with varied levels of guessing showed the detrimental effects guessing could have on these techniques. Application of the procedures to the two- and nine-factor data sets showed that factor analysis and multidimensional scaling have promise. The analysis of the real test data showed that the factor analysis procedure was the only one which could do a reasonably good job of sorting  items into unidimensional sets under realistic conditions.

The replicable model for conducting mini-case studies and analyzing within and across school data illustrates that quantitative and qualitative data are integrative and serve a confirmatory purpose. Both qualitative and quantitative data have inherent limitations, however; integration of the two will extend the scope of the data  base. Integration of the two types can generate new variables.

The use of factor analyses to assess test dimensionality, examination of equating curves, examination of item parameter estimates for extremes, comparison of equating sample means and variances, and cross-validation analyses were recommended for use by testing programs contemplating a switch from traditional to item response theory equating. The three-parameter equating method produced unacceptable equating  results--possibly because only 200 examinees per equating form were used. The one-parameter (Rasch) method produced results which were as stable as those for the traditional methods. (Author)",

Variables selected for this analysis included students' self-concept of math ability, their perceptions of the usefulness and importance of math, and their perceptions of their socializers' attitudes and expectancies.

The approach developed argues that variation in evaluation unit directors' role conflict and ambiguity is a function of both school district and evaluation unit characteristics, since both sets of organizational features influence the social context within which the director functions. Three school district variables (formalization, size, and heterogeneity), and three evaluation unit variables (history, budget, and staff size) were used. Results showed school district variables as significantly related to ambiguity and conflict, while evaluation unit variables correlated with ambiguity but not conflict. The argument that the social resource  characteristics of the school district are key sources of information about the conflict and ambiguity confronted by directors was not resolved. It was concluded, however, that evaluation units must become involved in classroom activities if they are to affect school district functioning. (Author/GK)",

Results indicated that submittals contained measurable objectives, evaluation designs, and specified sample sizes. Using tests of significance, approved submittals significantly differed from rejections in that they used multiple testing measures; results were statistically significant; information was provided on salient features; and the narrative and tables  were clearly presented. Discriminant analysis demonstrated that approvals reported using quasi-experimental designs, multiple test procedures, more information on key features, clearer tables, and control of selection and regression effects. One variable, statistically significant test results, was inversely related. Based on these findings, JDRP submittals should include measurable objectives, quasi- or experimental designs, multiple testing measures, reliable and valid tests, statistically significant test results, a clearly described intervention, and replication information.

        "description":"Several definitions of giftedness have been used to identify culturally different gifted children. Traditional notions of giftedness have focused on high degrees of intellectual ability, special talent, or innate ability in a particular area. A more liberal definition would include any children identified by professionally qualified persons who, by virtue of outstanding abilities, are capable of high performance. Culture-based definitions of giftedness account for a diversity of patterns of intellectual ability and culturally unique learning styles. Likewise, a variety of approaches have been used to identify gifted students. These include group and individually administered intelligence tests, aptitude tests, and achievement tests; culture-based tests of cognitive ability; tests  of creativity; various types of nominations and related techniques; checklists and behavioral inventories; interviews, self-reports, and case histories; examination of a student's products; Piagetian tests; and language proficiency tests. These approaches are discussed in terms of their inherent advantages and disadvantages and their utility for identifying minority students. (Author/GK)",

Chapter 2 describes the concept of psychological healing and the interpersonal methodologies Unitas uses to promote healing: the therapeutic community modality and psychotherapy. A discussion of the specific therapeutic systems and techniques developed by Unitas to treat its children is found in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 traces the beginnings of Unitas to its roots in the history of the community mental health movement.  Chapter 5 discusses the justification for the creation of the symbolic family structure used by Unitas, clarifies its workings and hierarchical structure, and describes its impact on its teenage workers and children. The final chapter discusses the success of Unitas as a mental health program and the feasibility and desirability of replicating such a program. (Author/MK)",

        "description":"By examining the attitudes and perceptions of 1625 fifth grade students in North Carolina, this study tested the hypothesis that the way teachers treat their students can have an effect on their political attitudes. It was found that when teachers treat students fairly and show interest in their ideas and problems, students are less politically cynical. This effect is stronger for white children than for black children, although it exists for the latter. It was also found that black children are more cynical than white children and perceive themselves as being treated less fairly than white children do. While white childrens' parents' education and support for their schooling is negatively and linearly related to political cynicism, black children show a curvilinear relationship  between parents' education and support for schoolwork and their political cynicism. This cynicism occurs because high levels of parental education and support for schoolwork are associated with high levels of political knowledge regarding the low general status of blacks in this society.

The study produced five major findings: (1) increases in classroom mean achievement levels had a positive impact on black students' academic growth patterns; (2) moves to majority black classrooms improved academic growth rates, while moves to majority white classrooms depressed academic growth rates; (3) the optimal move for a black student originating in a majority black classroom was one in which the receiving classroom was between 50 percent and 95 percent black  and had a higher level of academic performance than the sending classroom; (4) high achieving students tended to experience larger academic gains in receiving schools than in their sending schools, while low achieving students has smaller gains in their receiving as opposed to their sending schools; and (5) changes in teachers' education and experience, and teacher pupil ratios did not appear to be strongly related to academic growth.

One study evaluated minority children's identification with minority characters in the \"Superfriends\" series. The second study focused on interracial attitude changes associated with exposure to a pilot for \"The New Americans,\" a multicultural series about Indochinese children. The study population consisted of several hundred elementary school children from different ethnic groups. Measurement instruments included a semantic differential tool, an adaptation of the Projective Prejudice Test, a social distance scale, and measures of intergroup similarity and knowledge of Indochinese people. In the first study, Black and American Indian children were  found to identify more with characters from their own racial group, while Hispanic and Asian children tended to identify more with Anglo characters. In the second study, positive changes in Anglo, Black and Hispanic children's attitudes toward Indochinese children were noted; among Indochinese children of different nationalities, however, a negative attitude change toward Vietnamese children occurred. The results show that: (1) it is possible to create minority television characters that will overcome minority children's tendency to identify more with Anglos than with models from their own group; and (2) mere exposure to minority portrayals will not invariably have a positive effect on interracial attitudes.

There are two possible explanations for these differences: (1) either the process of educational attainment varies across ethnic groups, or (2) if the process is invariant, whites start with social advantages not shared by blacks and Mexican Americans, and thus demonstrate higher educational outcomes. Using data from the 1972 National Longitudinal Study (NLS), and controlling for known differences in measurement errors across groups, statistically significant interactions in the attainment of blacks, Mexican Americans, and whites were found. These differences in structural parameters, however, were not large enough to account for the different educational outcomes across ethnic groups.  Differences in outcome appear to be primarily a function of differential levels of social background. Thus, equality of educational opportunity will not equalize outcome when groups are not equal to begin with. (Author/APM)",

Presented are the results of a survey on institutional policies and procedures relevant to Hispanics and an analysis of grant information in the 1977 and 1978 &quot;Foundation Grants Index.&quot; In the introduction problems associated with research in the area of foundation grants are reviewed. The second chapter provides a description of the study and an overall view of Hispanic control and participation in funded agencies. Chapter three presents data regarding the pattern of foundation giving including: (1) agencies receiving the largest total dollar amount; (2) geographical distribution of grants; and (3) fields of interest in which grants were awarded. The fourth  chapter presents additional information on surveyed foundations and their policies and procedures. A summary, conclusions and recommendations are contained in the final chapter. An appendix includes survey materials and tables showing survey results. One of the study's major findings is that only one percent of all foundation grant dollars studied directly benefited Hispanics in the United States. (Author/APM)",

The evaluation team members spent 10 months collecting and compiling data relevant to program proposals, observations, special programs, supervisor-specialists ratings, and student perceptions. (Each type of data collected was analyzed and is presented as a chapter in this report. Conclusions and recommendations are presented in each chapter, along with the findings.) Concerning program goals and objectives, an analysis was performed using descriptions that were submitted by local program administrators as their plans of action for ABE. The study also incorporated an evaluation of  perceptions of ABE instruction by adult learners as indicators. Self-assessment and observation data were used to make inferences about the instructional program and classroom procedures. These data, when analyzed using statistical techniques, provide a description of the teaching and learning process. The study indicates that ABE is providing individuals with educational skills. However, there is much work to be done. A challenge for all people associated with ABE is to identify creatively the means to attract new clients and to better serve those who have already chosen to return to school. To that end, specific recommendations are provided in the report. (KC)",

It is intended for use by graduate students in the three fields, teachers of consumer and economic education, material producers, education administrators, and other policymakers, including government, community, and consumer leaders. Following a brief introduction, the major section of the paper reviews the consumer movement for the time periods of varying lengths prior to 1900 and in the twentieth century. Historical conditions and developments are examined for the consumer movement descriptive of that particular era. A discussion of consumer education developments and then of developments in economic education for each time period  follows. The final section reviews issues revealed in the historical survey. These issues concern orientation and approach, content and definition, placement of concepts in the curriculum, mandates and directives, quality of student materials, teacher preparation, networks for educator communication, special needs, and new directions. There are 11 pages of references. (YLB)",

        "description":"One task of Project ACCESS was to try out a process that had been developed to assess the life experiences of women for entry into employment and for entry or advanced placement in vocational education programs. The process involved using an inventory of women's experiences and skills, the Experience Description Summary (EDS), and competency analysis for selected occupations and programs to match experiential learning with job or program requirements. Insufficient data were obtained to permit validation of the EDS scales for the vocational programs. In the occupational phase of the tryout, the EDS was administered to 155 women. Forty-nine of them later entered employment. After six months, employers rated their overall job performance and specific job competencies as  above-average in comparison with &quot;all women currently in this job.&quot; None of the women was rated as below average. Skill self-ratings of the type used in the tryout were considered to be good predictors of job success, but tended toward being underestimates. The process was found difficult to implement, especially in vocational education programs, some problems being inherent in the design itself. (Approximately 15 pages of tables are included. An appendix presents the Project ACCESS Process Design.) (YLB)",

They cover adaptation to meet specific needs, recruiting and orienting instructors, selecting participants, and obtaining instructional materials. The comprehensive curriculum is organized into 14 enforcement issues, including orientation (introduction, relationship of white-collar crime to other crime problems), investigative planning, detection (conducting searches for violations, intelligence  collection and analysis, handling of complaints), detection and investigation (locating sources of documentary information, employing financial investigation tools), investigation (interviewing victims and witnesses, interviewing suspects, computer-related fraud, using the computer as an investigative aid), and post-investigation (presentation of completed investigation to prosecutor, use of civil and administrative remedies).

The focus of the study is on the dynamic feedback between the expectations of youth and parental expectations for the youth. The impact of academic performance, mental ability, and socioeconomic background of the youth on this feedback process also is an essential part of the analysis. A differential-equation model is written to represent the dynamics of the process and direct the empirical inquiry. The model is used to generate forecasts of senior-year expectations of youth and their parents, using sophomore- and junior-year data as inputs. The data were collected with a three-wave longitudinal panel design, using trained  interviewers to deliver the questionnaires to the homes of students and wait until the youths and both parents had completed the questions. All analyses were carried out separately by race and sex. Findings included: career expectations of the youth were influenced by expectations held for them by their parents, but the parents were also influenced by their children; the influence of peers was much smaller than the influence of parents; and the development of career expectations remains stable over time. The study suggests some implications for career development. (KC)",

        "description":"Declining productivity is a major problem in the American economy. Gains in productivity, and finally, actual rates of productivity, have been declining since the late 1960s. Specific problems arising as a result of this decline in productivity are the inflationary pressures that we face as a nation, the increased regulatory environment under which we must live, and the growth in the size of the public sector that has been associated with the growth in regulatory activity. Some reasons for the decline of productivity in the United States include reduced investment, larger service sector, government regulations, environmental expenditures, labor restrictions, and work disincentives. Unless productivity improves in the U.S. in this decade, we will all suffer a decline in our  standard of living. There are certain challenges that need to be considered in addressing productivity: definition and measurement, politics, planning and behavior--\"What's in it for me?\" Unless an organization or a nation can answer that final challenge, productivity is not going to improve. Improvement pf productivity in any organization requires a structured productivity program. One recommended program has ten elements: awareness and acceptance, organization, goals, resource effectiveness, employee involvement, incentives and gain sharing, rewards and recognition, training, measurement, and leadership. This program can bring improvements in productivity. (KC)",

        "description":"A project was conducted to provide inservice education for university vocational education teachers and to develop a locally directed evaluation model. This locally directed evaluation plan was designed to help vocational education departments organize and conduct evaluation activities. The need for program evaluation has been articulated at all levels of vocational education. University units that use locally directed evaluation programs will be better able to demonstrate demand for their products and effectiveness of ongoing programs to federal agencies. This final report contains the locally directed evaluation model and an analysis of workshop activities conducted during its development. The model is organized in three parts: evaluation of instruction, evaluation of research,  and evaluation of service. Included within the evaluation of instruction are evaluation of content (needs of employer, needs of students), evaluation of inputs (personnel, facilities and equipment, instructional materials, and finances), evaluation of the process, and evaluation of the product (exit interview, student follow-up, and employer follow-up). An annotated reference list is also included in the project report. (KC)",

        "description":"A rapid feedback evaluation of the federal career education incentive program was conducted to compile readily available information regarding the implementation of career education under the Career Education Incentive Act (PL 95-207). Attention was directed toward the activities and accomplishments of the four major actors in the career education program that were named in the legislation: the Office (now Division) of Career Education (OCE), the National Advisory Council for Career Education, state education agencies, and intermediate and local education agencies. Information relating to the performance of each of these groups was obtained through analyses of program records and visits to selected states and locales. Although the data gathered in this manner was readily  obtainable, and in no way represents a total picture, it can be inferred that PL 95-207 funds are serving the purposes envisioned by Congress when it passed the Incentive Act. All but three states have become active participants in the federal career education program. OCE is providing advice and assistance to states as well as using discretionary funds to address needs common to several, if not all, of the states (such as information on exemplary programs, etc.). States are using the Incentive Act funds as prescribed by the Act. Thus, in spite of the relatively small amount of funds appropriated for career education, substantial progress appears to have been made at the national, state, and local levels in developing commitment to career education and in instilling career education into  the educational system at the K-12 levels.

This model is being implemented in order to attempt to meet the education and training needs of the hospital staff on a future-oriented basis, rather than as reaction to crises. Key to the implementation of such a model is the development of closer ties between the training department staff and the staff of the various units. To that goal, educational liaisons from the training staff are establishing relationships with the units in order to become familiar with the everyday operating procedures and  problems of the unit, and to be able to spot training needs and to develop programs to meet those needs from an &quot;inside&quot; base, rather than imposing programs from outside. The educational liaisons establish need for training, devise training strategies to meet those needs among the individual units, and receive feedback about the programs implemented. A constant effort is made to keep the education and training department apprised of new needs or needs that are being served inappropriately, so that new strategies can be implemented. In addition, an effort is being made to inform line managers of their needs and how the training function is serving them and increasing the productivity of their units. (KC)",

While off-job-site training (OJST) should prepare for or supplement OJT, coordination between OJT and OJST is often poor. Advantages of OJT include its low cost, realistic nature, and motivating force. However, it is usually unplanned and must take a secondary place to production. Most books on industrial training describe a four-step method of conducting OJT. Although military OJT is more structured, it has many of the same problems as civilian OJT. Social learning theory, which has been developed to describe and predict how people learn from observation of models, can yield a number of rules for optimal training conditions. However, use of social learning theory  as a technique for training and modifying behavior has been studied mostly outside of industrial settings. Social learning theory has been applied to industry in two ways: to teach managers to deal more effectively with human relations problems and to predict which subordinates will imitate the behavior of their supervisors. Social learning theory concepts and training methods appear feasible for application to OJT. (Twenty training principles derived from the theory, for use in structured OJT, are presented.) (MN)",

Chapter 1 reviews characteristics of older persons, including geographic distribution, labor force participation, employment distribution, and unemployment. Chapters 2-6 trace dimensions and explore implications that a &quot;graying America&quot; will have for vocational education. Chapter 2 discusses social and economic forces that affect opportunities for older adults to be productively employed. In chapter 3 the principal federal employment-related education and training programs are described. Chapter 4 focuses on older adults as learners and discusses necessary supportive services. Vocational education as training for  community service activities is addressed in chapter 5. Chapter 6 considers the role of vocational education in comprehensive service delivery. Chapter 7 focuses on the delineation of a role for vocational education through a series of recommendations directed at proposed changes in the structure and process of the delivery system. (YLB)",

        "description":"The purpose of a project was to identify and explain the issues involved in formulating a role for vocational education in serving the employment-related training needs of older persons. The overall goal was to identify, analyze, describe, and disseminate information concerning policy and planing issues, service needs, service providers, alternative service models, and programmatic service occupations. The information would (1) lead to improved opportunities for obtaining vocational skills training and (2) enable older adults to serve in a manner utilizing their accumulated knowledge, skills, and experience. Major tasks were developing an information dissemination plan, conducting a literature review that resulted in a summary of the state-of-the-art, preparation and  dissemination of a planning paper and program guide, production of an advocacy film, development of a promotional brochure, and conducting of four regional information dissemination workshops. (Appendixes, amounting to approximately one-half of the report, include participant lists and agendas for project meetings and workshops, project correspondence, and workshop materials.) (YLB)",

        "description":"Four regional workshops were held to develop diffusion strategies and activities for linking vocational education into a comprehensive delivery system for providing social services and skills to older persons. These information dissemination workshops in Atlanta, St. Louis, Los Angeles, and Philadephia were part of the project, Identification of Issues Relating to the Role of Vocational Education in Serving Older Persons. The workshop had two goals: promote joint collaborative action of three major agencies invited to participate in the workshops (vocational education, adult education, agencies for the aging) and focus upon major problems and issues in serving older adults. Six priority topics were discussed: (1) improving state-level planning to meet employment and training  needs of older adults, (2) identifying and facilitating roles of the three agencies, (3) coordinating agency functions and activities to meet employment and training needs, (4) creating alternative systems for delivery of services, (5) motivating and stimulating local interest and initiative, and (6) identifying educational implications of an increasing number of older persons being served by vocational education.

Under YEDPA's discretionary authority there have been a number of efforts to better measure the impact of services that facilitate the transition of youth from school to work. The research report provides the analytical foundation for these demonstrations, reviewing and synthesizing from a policy perspective the literature on school-to-work transition activities. The document focuses on six areas: (1) career information, guidance, and job-seeking skills; (2) academic credit for work experience; (3) youth participation; (4) private sector involvment; (5) special efforts for high risk youth; and (6)  school-to-work transition efforts for the handicapped. The volume contains literature reviews and syntheses around key policy issues for each of these focus areas. Additionally, it includes the results of special hearings conducted by Youthwork (a nonprofit intermediary jointly funded by the Departments of Labor and Education) on the needs of high risk youth and the handicapped.

In the first paper career education is discussed in terms of its role in developing employability/adaptability/promotability skills. The strong emphasis in 1979-80 on making career education a community effort rather than an effort of the education system alone is the focus of four papers dealing with service learning and career education, the National School Volunteer Program and career education, career education in urban settings, and linking guidance efforts with community organizations. Also discussed is the concept of career education as a vehicle for educational change (in a paper on career education and social studies). Career  education's concern for extending the concept of career education to all segments of the population is illustrated in papers on the career education of the visually handicapped, career education in community colleges, contributions of career education to reducing youth unemployment, and career education's role in combating bias and stereotyping.

Following the introductory remarks on the themes of the conference, five presentations were given. In the first speech, Theodore Conant, consultant on technology information, engineering, and technical development, provides an overview of technology assessment, particularly in terms of its effect on the American work force. He comments that the U.S. is increasingly not competitive compared to Japan and European countries, which have a pool of human resources with a higher level of technical education. In the second presentation, Bert Cowlan,  telecommunications consultant, outlines telecommunications technologies and their effect on future work and personnel. The third paper, by Larry Kamm, operating mechanical engineer and inventor of industrial robots, calls attention to the growing shortage of qualified maintenance engineers, and suggests that educators pay more attention to assessing the skills-learning potential of their students before directing them into high-technology fields. In the fourth presentation, Herbert Gerjuoy, futurologist, predicts the characteristics of the labor force in the year 2000 and the general technological trends and educational preconditions for changing work attitudes. Finally, Dr. Michael Hudson, consultant and technological forecaster, provides a macro-overview of how technology assessment  information can be used in occupational education and what education can do to solve problems of long-term unemployment.

Discussed next is the proposed treatment of these clientele categories. Various JSS employment services, including placement, labor market information, diagnostic and counseling,  training and vocational adjustment, and job creation and subsidized employment services are outlined.

It describes the Career Advancement Voucher Demonstration, which tests whether Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA)-eligible youth can be effectively served by support in a college or postsecondary setting, and whether the voucher is an effective delivery mechanism. The report describes the demonstration and the results in recruiting and enrolling youth, as well as their retention through the first semester. Periodic sampling of a randomly assigned control group will help determine whether among income-eligible youth interested in higher education, the provision of support through CETA makes a  difference. Selection of a comparison group from CETA participants will suggest whether employment and training programs are more or less effective options, as well as helping determine the numbers of youth currently in CETA who might be reached by this option. To date, the findings indicate that among economically disadvantaged youth randomly assigned into experimental and control groups after screening on the basis of interest and ability, the rate of college attendance in the first semester is twice as high among experimental as controls--i.e., suggesting that currently available support for college education may not be reaching all those in need; and assisting youth with college enrollment under CETA may prove to be an effective option.

The first part of the monograph introduces the international context of rehabilitation of the mentally ill and outlines the scope of the problem. In Part 2, two areas of interest to those working in rehabilitation of the mentally ill are surveyed: laws about mental illness and mental patients, rights and responsibilities, in various countries of the world; and rehabilitation procedures for treating the mentally ill in various cultures and countries. Part 3  suggests prospects for the future--collaborative efforts that could be made among nations and international organizations in disseminating information about rehabilitation procedures; and a summary of the needs of rehabilitation programs. A list of references is included. (KC)",

        "description":"A theory of vocational education would be a set of reasoned beliefs about the goals, policies, organization, curriculum, and methods of teaching and learning for a program designed to produce occupational competence. The well-worked-out theory would provide a consistent set of guiding principles that might result in a consistent policy for action. Need for a theory of vocational education depends on how much its policy requires the clarification of basic arguments for vocational education. Vocational education must be justified, and this can be accomplished by having vocational educators who explore the possibilities of rationalizing, standardizing, depersonalizing, and intellectualizing vocational occupations. A model for a theory of vocational education is virtually synonymous  with a curriculum for the preparation of teachers and other professional workers in the field. The model includes two major sections: the foundational studies presumably to be required of all and the specialty. (YLB)",

Nine programs, selected to represent programs of various sizes (small, medium, large), were studied, and student files of 1979 and 1980 were randomly selected from each program and analyzed for relationships of program characteristics to student retention and for differences in student characteristics from 1979 to 1980. The high risk student was defined in terms of the number of hours spent in the program. The more time spent in the program, the lower the risk for a student. Some findings include the following: (1)  students with lower reading, spelling, and mathematics scores spent more time in the ABE program; (2) adults who were receiving some form of support, such as a stipend or Social Security payments, spent more time in the program; (3) older adults and adults from homes with low standards of living spent more hours in the program; (4) program characteristics that related positively to more hours spent in the program include flexibility in class scheduling, staff communication, and short student intake procedures. Further study of ABE students' individual goals and their accomplishment was recommended. (KC)",

In Location Decisions, the specific content area taught to students is the process for choosing a location for a small business; the basic skills practiced are problem solving by analysis and logic, decision making, and constructive group interaction to achieve a common goal. It simulates the research, analysis, and decision making a person must do to select an appropriate business location. As game administrator, the teacher prepares the materials, introduces the simulation, monitors the use of time and materials, directs the scoring, and guides the discussion after the  simulation. All the materials needed to play the game are included in the guide. Following an overview of Location Decisions, the guide is divided into two parts. The first part contains detailed teacher's instructions for preparing for and managing the game, including pre-game necessities and instructions for each of the four to six periods required for the simulation. The second part of the guide contains the game materials, including student introduction, instructions for information gathering, scoresheet, administrator's tally sheet, and cost cards. (KC)",

Most have direct business content; a few are presented as &quot;games&quot; designed to promote skill development. The mini-problems are flexible; each can be completed in 10 minutes or a full class period, according to the preference of the  teacher and the class, and the time available. The educational format of each mini-problem is identified (e.g., small group discussion, role play, brainstorming exercise, written exercise, pencil-and-paper problem, verbal pantomime, individual exercise, etc.), although formats can be changed as desired.

        "description":"Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of using paraprofessional trainers in teaching students with tension headaches to relax, thus reducing the frequency of their headaches. A technique for automated self-instructed relaxation training was compared to a paraprofessionally trained group and a no-treatment control group over a 3-week period, using 15 college students as subjects. The results of a simple-main effects trend analysis showed that both paraprofessional and self-instructing groups were effective in reducing the frequency of their headaches with no similar changes in the control group. Follow-up evaluations were completed during final exam week, the second week of the following new semester, and after termination of the program. The frequency of headaches  for both experimental groups remained at rates below that of frequencies during the pretreatment week. Self-instruction and paraprofessional training appear to be effective and efficient alternatives to practitioners in view of the trend toward physiological monitoring. (Author/NRB)",

Attributional information presented during counseling may have therapeutically beneficial consequences. The effectiveness of attribution therapy was investigated in a factorial experiment which varied controllability and internality of causal factors. Pairs of subjects (N=82), who had previously completed Rotter's Internal-External Locus of Control Scale were given negative interpersonal evaluations followed by one of four types of therapy (internal/controllable, internal/uncontrollable, external/controllable, or external/uncontrollable) or no therapy at all. Results indicated that internal/controllable therapy  produced more positive affective reactions and performance evaluations for internal locus of control respondents; externals were more variable in their responses. Findings suggest that the negative effects of stressful life events may be reduced by modifying individuals' attributional inferences. (Author/NRB)",

Subjects completed, among other measures, the FRI and Loevinger's Sentence Completion Task. The FRI's family development stage scores, with a possible range of stage one (hierarchichal parent-child relationship) to stage six (peer-like relationship), ranged from stage two to a transition between stages four and five. Marital status was the most powerful predictor of stage scores for the mother and the father. Analyses also yielded a main effect  for age and an age by sex interaction effect for stage scores with the mother. Data from the 60 women subjects revealed a significant relationship between Loevinger's ego development stage scores and FRI stage scores. Subjects with higher FRI scores were more likely to give permission for the release of FRI questionnaires to their parents. Findings provided support for the validity of the FRI. (Author/NRB)",

The three phases of an autobiographical approach to one's present identity are discussed as the search for facts according to criteria, illustrated by the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes; the structuring of these facts by an ordering principle of time or content, explained by the ideas of John Locke; and the use of memory to discover new information about oneself, explored through the writings of David Hume. Activities to help students develop each phase of autobiographical recognition include: (1) the organization of life into phases; (2) the meshing of life facts into the conceptual  scheme of different psychologists; (3) a review of autobiographies in terms of time and content structures; (4) the writing of a semester-long journal to develop analogies between personal experiences and the experiences of the historical individuals; (5) the recall of past events; and (6) the review of self as a third person.

Predictions were either personal (based on personality tests) or impersonal (based on group norms). A control group of ten internals and ten externals was not informed of the predictions. All subjects then rated each card one at a time. The measure of compliance or defiance consisted of the mean ratings of the predicted cards minus the mean ratings of  the unpredicted cards.

The control students (N=9) received equivalent training time on relevant, but unrelated, materials. Two counseling sessions with coached clients served as the assessment of the developing skills. The first role-play occurred immediately following the six-hour treatment; the second assessment was two weeks later after both treatment and  control groups had received additional cognitive self-instructional training.

The feasibility of an intergenerational program in which non-center-based, low-cost child care could be provided while expanding employment and experiential opportunities for the elderly was explored. Individuals (N=65) in the fields of child care, aging, and intergenerational programs in the San Francisco Bay Area were interviewed; additionally, 15 individuals participated in a problem-solving meeting. The information generated by interviews, reactions to the project, and the problem-solving session were evaluated. Analysis of the data revealed that a sufficient demand for child care  services and a need for elderly employment expansion within the field of child care existed to merit the development of an intergenerational child care service program. Results indicated, however, that significant attitudinal issues needed to be addressed within the community before such a program could be successful.

        "description":"A study was conducted (1) to examine the development of comprehension and production in written language of two aspects of linguistic knowledge, knowledge of ambiguity and paraphrase; and (2) to examine the influences of reading ability as measured by currently used standardized reading tests and of sex on the development of this knowledge of ambiguity and paraphrase. Sixty-two fourth grade students were given eight sentences containing ambiguity and asked to provide two or more interpretations of each sentence. A second study was carried out with 24 good and poor readers from fourth, seventh, and tenth grades, and 16 good and poor adult readers. Results of the two studies showed that poorer readers made more than twice the number of errors than did better readers in each domain  of the task--syntax, morphology, semantics, and transcription. The findings also revealed that in the sentence task, the order of difficulty of the varying metalinguistic tasks was the same across modes of processing, but that there were sharper differences between good and poor fourth grade readers and in good and poor adult readers in certain tasks.

Among the positive findings reported for the program are that parents who participated were generally enthusiastic about the program and wanted to see it continued, were satisfied with the training they received, and did not report any major problems in finding assistance when necessary. Among the negative findings reported are: the program had no discernable impact on reading achievement as measured by standardized tests, many students were assigned materials that were either above or below their current level of reading  achievement, and first grade students were &quot;overselected&quot; for the program. The major portion of the report consists of appendixes that contain data gathering forms, tests, and other materials used in the program evaluation. (FL)",

The paper discusses two findings from the review--one regarding the complexities of teaching and the other concerning the apparent absence of reading instruction in the classroom.

The results showed that using descriptive schema to analyze unprompted retelling bore a reasonable relationship to standard methods of evaluating comprehension. The second study examined the difficulties of first and second language learners in the comprehension of six types of propositions as defined by P. D. Pearson and D.  D. Johnson. The study involved 160 seventh grade students, who were divided into groups according to their reading level and by whether they spoke English at home.

        "description":"Prepared as part of a continuing study of the instructional practices that make up the process of schooling, this paper concentrates on the practices that comprise reading comprehension instruction. The paper focuses on four skills commonly taught and assessed as part of many widely used reading comprehension instruction programs in the intermediate grades: (1) determining the main idea and details of written text, (2) understanding sequential information, (3) understanding cause-and-effect relationships, and (4) drawing conclusions. The paper presents a summary of the instructional practices commonly used to achieve student proficiency in each of these skill areas, along with specifications and some example items that schools could use to provide useful diagnostic data. The  paper concludes with a sketch of reading comprehension that is observed in instructional practice and that supports an information-processing model (schema theory) of reading comprehension.

The subjects completed three kinds of measurement instruments: (1) an experimental faceted vocabulary test, (2) reference ability tests, and (3) a verbal exposure instrument, which assessed frequency and time spent in reading, writing, doing homework, and viewing television. The results indicated that vocabulary item difficulty increased with word abstractness, word infrequency, when item format required more precise word knowledge, and when an item required definition as opposed to recognition of the word. The findings suggested that  partial concepts were prevalent in the young adult subjects and that word acquisition was a gradual process. The results also showed that verbal ability as represented by reading comprehension and reading vocabulary tests was best measured by frequent or medium-frequency words rather than by rare words. On the other hand, difficult recognition vocabulary tests such as advanced vocabulary tests seemed to measure mainly sources of difficulty due to infrequent words. (FL)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to analyze and compare the reading interests of adults from three educational levels. Fourteen adults in a community college reading center, 20 adults from various professional occupations, and 23 adults from a reading education class were given a reading interest inventory concerned with their reading habits and preferences and with the types of television and movies they watched. A comparison of the results from each group showed many similarities. Most adults tended to read between one and three magazine titles regularly and were interested in current events. A significant portion of each group--except the reading center group--read a newspaper every day, with each group favoring the front page. The reading class and professional group members had each  read approximately three books per person just prior to the study, while book reading was apparently not popular with the reading center group. Motion picture and television program preference appeared to be similar across the three groups, with most subjects attending movies regularly for entertainment, escape, and to watch a good story. Information and entertainment were listed as primary reasons for television viewing. As the educational level of the adults in this study increased, they read a greater quantity as well as a greater variety of material. (HTH)",

        "description":"Instead of merely correlating the amount of time a child is read to with gross measures of language development or reading achievement, researchers need to examine closely, through naturalistic studies, the underlying construction and organization of story book reading events between parent and child. The notion of scaffolding, in which the adult supplies a structure of supportive information that is gradually decreased as the child becomes less dependent, plays a large part in reading aloud to very young children. The pattern of interaction changes for older children, to one in which the adult expects the child to listen to particular segments of text, learn from the information contained in the material, and remember and convey the content to the adult in the questioning that  follows each segment. This interactional pattern helps socialize some preschool children for reading instruction in school. Longitudinal studies of the effects of variations in parent-child interactions during story book reading can do much to further children's literacy development. (AEA)",

        "author":["Sheridan, E. Marcia"],
        "description":"There are several reasons why Japan has one of the world's highest literacy rates. One reason is the nature of the Japanese written language, which employs a dual code of ideographs representing specific objects and a syllabary, in which each symbol represents a separate syllable. The syllable symbols are read consistently the same way, and beginning reading students are taught the syllabary before they learn the ideographs. Learning syllables as a unit of pronunciation appears to be easier than learning a phonetically based alphabet. Parental influence is another reason for the high literacy rate, as many parents begin to read to their children and give them their own books before they are one year of age. Consequently, Japanese children are ready to read by the time they enter  first grade. Properly taught in preschool, children can learn between 500 and 1,000 syllable characters before they begin first grade. Japan's cultural expectations are also responsible for high reading achievement; for example, in contrast to male reading attitudes in the United States, the majority of Japanese boys perceive reading to be an appropriate activity. Although there is some evidence that the syllabary may be easier to learn than the Roman alphabet, the most powerful influences on Japan's reading success appear to be the intervention of parents and preschool education.

To promote cross-population examination, the study focused on network news. Data collection was accomplished by telephone interviews conducted with 80 adults in each of two cities. Findings suggested that respondents generally intended to watch network evening news programs whenever possible. Among the attributes that were shown to be associated with increases in intentions to view network nightly news were (1) the impact of the news on a viewer's life, (2) the notion that the news made viewers more  knowledgeable about news events, (3) indepth coverage, (4) enjoyable newscasters, (5) variety of topics, (6) national news coverage, and (7) international news coverage. These results suggest that the viewing intention application provides a rather unique method for examining the crucial link between the importance a viewer accords a network television news attribute and how that viewer thinks the presence or absence of the attribute actually influences personal news viewing behavior.

Most of the comments generated by the subjects fell into four topic areas: political party convention coverage, rapid camera and  electronic news gathering procedures, why the subjects watched the specific station they did, and general criticism of television news.

After reporting for several newspapers across the country, Hickok became one of the first women hired by the Associated Press wire service (AP) in 1928. She was assigned to cover Eleanor Roosevelt during Franklin Roosevelt's first campaign for the presidency of the United States, at which time they became very good friends. Hickok later became the first reporter to conduct an on-the-record interview with a First Lady. However, when their friendship began to conflict with her loyalty to the AP, Hickok resigned from that organization in 1933. As an investigator for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, Hickok's reports from  her fact-finding tours contained information on unemployment and relief, but also captured the human side of the bitterness and heroism of Americans caught in economic disaster. In the 1950s Hickok and Mrs. Roosevelt coauthored a book on women in politics, and in 1962 Hickok wrote a biography of Mrs. Roosevelt. Before her death in 1968, Hickok lamented the loss of her notable newspaper career, saying it was the only thing she had done really well. (HTH)",

        "description":"An explanatory linguistic theory attempts to capture and explain the universal nature of human language, to choose among possible grammars of each human language, and to account for the linguistic constraints involved in language acquisition. Discourse theory, like linguistic theory, must be mentalistic in that it seeks to account for mental realities underlying the observed behaviors involved in creating or comprehending discourses. Part of the method of developing discourse generalization, categories, and rules and part of the method of testing them once formulated, is a frank reliance on the intuitions of native speakers about the properties of their discourse systems. Such a set of principles could be developed by at least three distinct routes: (1) philosophical--which  starts with an \"a priori\" notion of the function of particular types of language use and then tries to develop a set of canonical principles which account for how that function is or is not achieved; (2) naturalistic--which observes actual situations of language use with limited prestructuring or manipulation; and (3) experimental--which includes manipulating the listener's role in a conversation, seeing how speakers cope with interruption or noise and looking at revising strategies when a writer or speaker is given a new audience with which to communicate. Until discourse production is reconceptualized as mental processes based on discourse competency systems, it will not be possible to understand what is happening when people use language. (HOD)",

The conservative groups dominating the electronic church already have an extensive audience in the U. S., and the potential political influence of these broadcasters at a time when the country seems to be moving in a more conservative direction lies primarily in mobilizing conservative voters on political issues. The Federal Communication  Commission (FCC) has routinely exempted religious programing from the fairness doctrine's requirements because such programing is seen as being noncontroversial by definition. If the FCC is forced to draw a line between what constitutes religious and political programing, it has no clear legal precedents to follow that have involved broadcasters invoking the First Amendment's freedom of religion clause.

The model proposes that audience members bring to communications situations a set of learned cognitive processing strategies that produce cognitive structural representations of information in memory to facilitate the meeting of the various goals or needs that motivate media exposure. Among these strategies are imagery usage, total or partial avoidance, cross-contextual recoding, making inferences, active repetition, and memorizing. The model also proposes that an individual's exposure goals in a given situation may delineate task constraints on the cognitive processing system. In the study, 115 college students indicated that suggestion and environmental reinforcement were  not strong enough to induce reliably the uses and gratifications orientations of surveillance, diversion, and anticipated communication in a laboratory setting. Self-reported use of imagery related positively to cognitive differentiation and negatively to subjects' thinking about other matters while reading, supporting a central assumption in the model that imagery strategy is resource and detail intensive.

        "description":"The photographs of William Henry Jackson taken during the 1871 survey of the Yellowstone region of Wyoming and Montana have often been cited as the first specific group of photographs used for successful persuasion. Many historians credit Jackson's photographs as being the most influential factor in persuading Congress to designate the Yellowstone region as the nation's first national park. But a closer examination of historical reports and congressional accounts shows that these claims are exaggerated. Oral descriptions of the area from unofficial expeditions prior to the survey sounded unbelievable, but were consistent in many ways, thus lending the stories credibility before the Jackson photographs were taken. An article from a prominent newspaper applauding passage of the  national park bill made no reference to the Jackson photographs. Jackson himself viewed his role as expedition photographer as supportive rather than primary. Although congressional members received the photographs as part of the Yellowstone lobbying effort, those members most influential in the passage of the bill were more likely persuaded by accounts from family members in previous expeditions than by the photographs. There is little evidence that Jackson's photographs were more influential than the reports and specimens presented to Congress in persuading members to designate the area a park. (HTH)",

        "description":"Among the possible results brought about by the reduction from 1970 to 1980 of the overseas staffs of American newspapers were (1) increased reliance upon official or state media as news sources; (2) a nation underinformed despite its heavy worldwide political, economic, and cultural involvement; and (3) a lack of coherent reporting of the historical and human complexities of a situation. With this in mind, the foreign news coverage from the Chicago &quot;Tribune&quot; (which drastically reduced its foreign staff) and the New York &quot;Times&quot; (which maintained a sizeable foreign staff) was compared to examine the impact of foreign staff reductions on the quality of foreign coverage. Foreign news content was analyzed in 14 issues of each paper for each of the ten years. Variables recorded were  geopolitical focus (first, second or socialist, and third world news) and origin (wire service or correspondent). Although both papers published progressively fewer foreign items, the decline was noticeably greater for the &quot;Tribune.&quot; In eight of ten years the &quot;Times&quot; published more correspondent items than wire service items, while in none of the ten years did the &quot;Tribune&quot; correspondents provide more items than were taken from the wire services. As &quot;Tribune&quot; correspondents became more involved in third world coverage, the paper relied more heavily on wire services for first world news while the &quot;Times&quot; maintained its correspondent coverage of all three geopolitical regions.

        "description":"A study examined whether editorial involvement of magazine editors could be predicted by various personal and professional characteristics. Questionnaires completed by 170 editors of magazines elicited information about the extent of their involvement in editorial operations and their personal and professional characteristics, including age, sex, education level, degree field, job enjoyment, years of editorial experience, personal aggressiveness, difficulty of work, comparative competence with other members of the staff, personal standards, adherence to editorial formulas, and aspirations for promotion or economic advancement. Results showed that the most significant predictor of involvement in editorial operations was whether the editorial content met the personal standards of  the editor. In addition, editors who were most likely to preview all stories were those who were more aggressive and who had high personal standards for content. Those editors who became involved in the acceptance or rejection of stories felt items must meet their personal standards, were seeking promotion, and thought that their work was difficult. Finally, males were more apt to enter into the editing process than were females. (FL)",

        "author":["Smith, C. Zoe"],
        "description":"The photographs of Margaret Bourke-White and Lewis Wickes Hine are graphic accounts of the urban industrial United States during the Depression of the 1930s. Hine was a sociologist who initially used his camera to promote social reform and is best remembered for his photographs of immigrants at Ellis Island, New York, and of children laboring in coal mines and textile mills. He later concentrated his photography on Americans on the job, especially when that job meant working with machinery, hoping to depict the true dignity and integrity of labor. Documenting what was good about laborers--their control over themselves and their machines, and the dependence of one laborer upon another--motivated his earlier work. Margaret Bourke-White was more intrigued by architecture and  industry, although she photographed a variety of subjects during her career with &quot;Fortune&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; magazines. Bourke-White seemed not to have appreciated or understood the worker's relationship to industrialized society. To her, machines were a series of beautiful patterns to which she attributed human qualities. In her photographs, humans merely served as reference points from which to judge the tremendous size of machines. Her lack of compassion in these early industrial photographs is what clearly distinguishes her work from that of Hine. (HTH)",

        "description":"A study examined whether television's stereotypical portrayals of men and women affected children's sex role preferences. The subjects, 105 fifth and 70 eighth grade students from a predominately black urban school in the southern United States, were assigned to see one of three versions of a videotape of a family drama in which male and female characters took on various occupational, familial, and socioemotional roles. The sex-typed and sex-reversed (nontraditional) tapes were exact replicas with the male and female characters simply switching lines and roles. Some lines in the androgynous version were modified slightly to allow the characters to each take half of the feminine and half of the masculine lines and roles. The results showed that, in general, children could be  influenced by short term exposure to alternative sex role portrayals. The influence was mediated, however, by age and sex of the viewer and the dimension of sex role being studied. Specifically, children who saw the sex-typed version increased the most in \"sex-typedness,\" while those who saw the nontraditional versions increased the least or moved to a nonsex-typed preference direction. Girls of both ages showed less sex typing than did boys, especially eighth grade boys. Eighth grade girls also showed greater change than the younger girls on the socioemotional sex role dimension after exposure to the nontraditional version of the tape. (FL)",

        "description":"A study of the role of the attention construct in the process of transforming specific newspaper and television media content into political knowledge involved a survey of 71 undergraduate students in an introductory journalism course. A review of the literature had revealed that the use of the attention construct had been infrequent in mass media research, while two other major types of media variables--exposure and reliance--had frequently been studied, particularly in relation to objective knowledge. Therefore, the study tested attention along with exposure and reliance against subjective and objective knowledge. During the week preceding the United States presidential elections in 1980, the students completed questionnaires that rated their exposure to and reliance on the  media, their political interests, the importance they attached to selected political issues, their attention to candidates and to issues, and their objective and subjective knowledge of candidates' positions. Among the conclusions drawn from the study were that television exposure leads to certainty on political issues and that it is a person's own view of his or her knowledge that is likely to lead to its use in political behaviors such as voting.

The first chapter in the book provides a detailed overview of linguistic studies of oral and written language relationships. The next three chapters focus on the relationships between children's oral and written language skills and what these relationships imply about the teaching of writing and reading. Chapters five and six consider oral and written language in a societal context, while chapters seven, eight, and nine are concerned with methodological issues in the study of speaking-writing relationships, each suggesting a way to broaden the understanding of these relationships. The next two chapters broaden the understanding of  oral-written relationships by considering two special groups of individuals who often struggle to learn English--speakers of other languages and the profoundly deaf. The final two chapters focus on pedagogy, such as integrating speaking and writing in a business communications course. (RL)",

        "description":"As part of a larger study of political socialization in adolescence, 782 adolescents and 718 parents were surveyed to test hypotheses about political information as a function of the early phase of a presidential campaign and the news exposure level of the respondent. Despite shortcomings in the sample design and in the precision of interview timing, it was established that there was considerable variation in the flow and acquisition of political information during the early weeks of the presidential campaign. Audience members who were heavily exposed to campaign-related news events were quick to translate these news events into more highly structured affective reactions and preferences regarding candidates. Such activity probably tends to hasten the process of sorting out a few  leading candidates from their straggling opponents (&quot;winnowing&quot;). Simple conceptions of &quot;information&quot; that were limited to individual-level cognitions failed to tap some of the most important aspects of these winnowing processes. The structuring of political affect and the arousal and resolution of uncertainty at the aggregate level were seen as important indicators of the dependence of the media's audience on campaign news during the critical early phases of the campaign year.

Nine hundred and one teachers from all grade levels were asked to indicate what percentage of their students engaged in each of 64 nonverbal behaviors. The results indicated that observance of personal space increased with grade level, while interpersonal touching decreased except for sexual touching. The gazing variables indicated no  developmental increase, with students at all levels maintaining eye contact when speaking and when spoken to. The kinesic variables also showed no developmental pattern, although smiling appeared to decrease until grade seven, then fluctuate through grade 12. The ability to identify emotions from vocal cues steadily increased with grade level. There was also a developmental pattern for the physical appearance variables, with avoidance of overweight children and concern about dress increasing with grade level. (HTH)",

        "description":"A comprehensive understanding of stage fright will better enable teachers and researchers to select the most appropriate &quot;cure&quot; and to determine those cases in which speech training will help reduce stage fright or other states of communication apprehension. Attempts to understand stage fright have focused on three psychological theories of emotion (neurological, body reaction, and a two-factor theory of body reaction and environmental cues), but each theory has proved inadequate. A more comprehensive theory depicts stage fright as the result of the interaction of three principal components: the behavioral, the physiological, and the cognitive. The behavioral factor includes avoiding speech situations and taking actions to control or repress tensions. The physiological factor  refers to arousal symptoms such as increased sweating and breathing rate. The cognitive factor is the consciousness of the behavioral or physiological changes. Both the behavioral and the physiological factors must be present for a speaker to experience stage fright, and the greater the physiological changes the greater the behavioral changes. Further research into the emotional nature of stage fright must be dependent on all three factors, recognize stage fright as only one phase of communication apprehension, and examine how different audience and situation cues affect the intensity of stage fright.

Although the provisions of the law call for each student to be assessed individually and provided with an Individualized Education Program (IEP), the costs associated with these requirements too often encourage schools to fit the children into programs that are designed to handle categories of disability rather than individual learning needs. Flexible, specific IEPs planned in collaboration with parents should be part of clearly defined, goal-oriented school programs. Support and leadership from administrators is a key to the success of mainstreaming. Administrators should be concerned with establishing  good communications, developing mainstreaming skills through staff development programs, modeling and encouraging an attitude of respect and acceptance toward the disabled, fostering participation in planning by all affected, and informing themselves of the options available for making school services and facilities suitable for mainstreaming.

Unlike businesses, schools do not have unambiguous, superordinate objectives (such as profit). Furthermore, they cannot easily reject umprofitable customers or change their products, cannot restrict themselves to a homogeneous student population in order to make possible a uniform process and output, and cannot operate under managers untrained in the goods and services to be produced. Despite these differences, schools do act like businesses in a number of ways. They maintain corporate-like secrecy about the different costs of resources allocated to the instruction of each individual student, they manipulate the curriculum to improve  public relations, and they shunt students from one learning track or class to another to save resources. Schools also resemble businesses when they define their educational products narrowly (to increase the appearance of accountability while decreasing the need to be accountable), and when they proceed as though the school's responsibility consisted in efficiently performing its traditional tasks and keeping the community happy while leaving the hard decisions as to the role of education to others.

In New York City, Boston, Athens, and Cyprus, there is a paucity of educational personnel trained to work with this population. As a pilot survey conducted in the Unites States and abroad illustrates, along with a paucity of trained personnel in the area of Greek bilingual special education, there is a lack of evaluation and curriculum resources with which to identify and instruct Greek special education students. The general conditions of Greek bilingual special education both in the United States and in Greece and Cyprus are articulated by the author, along with recommendations for future action.

Procedures used were modification of the environmental arrangement of the classroom (such as moving the learning centers closer to students' desks), changing the method of curriculum presentation and teaching strategy (such as shaping students to work independently rather than in small groups), and implementation of a classroom token economy. Data collected by a time sampling recording procedure indicated that ontask study behavior increased for all Ss. Written statements from the classroom teacher showed a subjective, anecdotal improvement in general classroom functioning as well. In addition to increases in study  behavior in all children, other changes observed included children speaking more quietly, answering when spoken to, smiling more often, being more polite to others, talking to each other more frequently and more appropriately, and increasing accuracy in seatwork.

Initial sections address the status of Black professionals in the area of special education and learning styles commonly exemplified by Black college students. Noted among instructional strategies that appeal to Blacks are the following: allow more time for mastering material, present sufficient examples to enable getting the point, work to strengthen verbal expression and use of formal language, and allow warmup periods in studying. Reported are results of a survey and research  study on 19 master's students in special education from a predominantly Black university. Findings are cited which include that Black college students preferred learning activities closely associated with their career choice and that students in a competency based humanistic teacher education group expressed greater enthusiasm about their learning atmosphere and made higher grades than a competency based teacher education groups.

Among the observations made about federal legislation and recreation for the handicapped are the following: legislation is the cornerstone of progress in rehabilitation of the disabled globally and in the United States, in services, in human rights, in research and training, and in scientific development; from 1920 to 1960 recreation for handicapped has had practically no part in rehabilitation of disabled  legislation in the United States; recreation for the handicapped is gaining acceptance as a basic goal of rehabilitation; and the most desirable single goal in 1980 and the decade to follow would be to pursue the passage of federal legislation which would establish a federal policy in support or recreation for the handicapped.

The Full Model to Open Question sequence began with presenting the child with a model of the correct answer and then proceeded to increasingly less restricted choices until the open ended request (\"Tell me about this\"). The Open Question to Full Model sequence begins with the open question and proceeds through the sequence in reverse order until the child responds correctly. Each S received each training sequence for two sets of responses. Results indicated that the Full Model to Open Question strategy required fewer training sessions than the Open Question to Full Model strategy with all four  Ss and trainers. Although both strategies were successful in teaching the target responses, under the Full Model to Open Question condition, each S appeared to evidence a \"learning to learn\" phenomenon with fewer sessions necessary for the second set of responses taught.

Tutoring of peer initiations occurred in a small room adjacent to the main classroom. The peers were tutored to request information (RI) and request behavior (RB) from each other. The tutor was trained to use two teaching techniques, modeling and prompting, to get one child to verbally initiate to the other. A within subject multiple baseline design was employed. Intervention occurred across two target behaviors and two children. Criterion for phase change was based on the number of peer initiations and the number of times these initiations were followed by a response from the other peer.  Criterion was set at five or more target behaviors complied with for four of five consecutive sessions. Both target children met this criterion for RIs but not for RBs. However, total RBs increased substantially from baseline to intervention. Training of the tutor by teacher before play session was effective in promoting spontaneous tutoring behavior during the play session. During training the tutor had an average of 10 opportunities to practice conversation facilitation skills. The average number of tutor prompts or models per play session was 7.7. The average number of teacher directions helping the tutor teach her peers was 3.2 per session. (Author/DB)",

The program, one component of Houston's Magnet school approach designed to comply with desegregation rulings, developed broadened criteria for identifying gifted minority students. Vanguard has expanded to 11 campuses: six elementary schools, three middle or junior high schools, a senior high school, and a new setting whcih integrates an elementary Vanguard program with hearing impaired students. Program evaluation incorporated the use of ethnographics (analytic descriptions or reconstructions of intact cultural scenes and groups that delineate shared beliefs, practices, artifacts, folk knowledge, and behaviors of groups of people).  Proposed data collection techniques are described as well as evaluation sequences and monitoring and audit procedures. (CL)",

Current practices are reviewed in terms of their lack of efficacy and conceptual and methodological problems. Issues of ethical concern are discussed for three areas (sample subtopics in parentheses): utility and equity (cost vs. benefits); consent (autonomy and informed consent, competence and paternalism); and demystification about current limits of competence and knowledge.

Purposes of the study included obtaining indepth descriptions of the technical assistance process to increase the general level of understanding of its nature and identify important variables which influence its effectiveness. The feasibility of the case study approach also was explored as a method for gathering such information. The report contains descriptions of the context in which the study took place and the sites and persons who were involved, of the development of the conceptual framework for the study, of the technical assistance as  it occurred (the two cases), and a discussion of the findings from the cases, accompanied by suggestions for future efforts. Results are organized according to four major questions: (1) What client characteristics affect technical assistance? (2) What technical assistance provider characteristics affect the technical assistance? (3) What characteristics of the technical assistance events themselves influence the assistance? and (4) What are the outcomes, effects, and/or impacts of technical assistance? Significant client characteristics included leadership style, administrative autonomy, and communication practices. Influential provider characteristics included interpersonal and coordination skills, responsiveness, and knowledge of the project's purposes and goals. Factors of the  technical assistance event judged as important were structure, communication, consultant/client match, involvement, and scheduling. Outcomes and impacts of technical assistance were identified in the areas of administration, staff, overall communication, focus of program activities, and program operation. Evaluation of the case study method indicated that the method is a useful way to learn about the technical assistance process. (DB)",

Data were collected on 11 language tasks which included drawing, forming letters and numbers, and general print production. Ss were also requested to answer historical/experimental questions and conceptual/qualitative questions about reading and writing. Other tasks ascertained Ss' book handling knowledge as well as oral reading abilities. Interviews and surveys were conducted to determine Ss' attitudes toward reading and writing, parental attitudes and models of reading, and the interactive relationship between language and home environments. Ss' miscue analyses (i.e., deviations from print) of their oral  reading revealed how efficiently they utilized the syntactic, semantic, and graphonomic language systems. Results indicated that these Black adolescents' reading and writing behavior could be analyzed, categorized, and measured qualitatively within a particular information processing/psycholinguistic paradigm. Implications focused on the practical implementation of whole language instruction and integrated activities into the urban junior high school curriculum and home environment for mildly mentally retarded minority urban adolescents.

English finally achieved dominant status in all domains, but this achievement came about through cultural and societal, rather than legal, forces. In the United States as well, the status of English was achieved without official declaration. The early history of the United States contains few instances of attempts to restrict the use of other languages (with the exception of the American Indian languages). In fact, up to the end of the Civil War, the United States could well have been called a multilingual society. Toward the end of the  19th century and into the early 20th, many state laws were passed restricting the use of languages other than English, especially in education. Two reasons for this shift were the growing tendency to regard the public school as an institution to create a unified conforming citizenry, and the emergence of \"subversive speech\" as a crime commonly before the courts. In current discussions over the creation of a national language policy, policy makers should be guided less by a past of restrictive legislation than by a sense of the history behind that legislation.

        "description":"The first part of these findings is a report on a study of the characteristics of 120 Spanish-English bilingual children's speech over a two-year period in the classroom, on the playground, and at home. Three types of language measures were used as well as audiotaped speech samples taken in the three communication settings. Preliminary findings suggest that (1) children vary in language usage and preference depending on the setting; (2) discourse in the classroom is predominantly English; (3) acquisition of reading skills and of language is individualistic in nature; (4) codeswitching is more prevalent in some communities than others; and (5) multiple measures of oral language proficiency may be needed for valid assessment. The second part of the report focused on the bilingual  discourse of 24 children in kindergarten through grade two, using utterance as the basic unit of speech. The analysis examined: (1) frequency of codeswitching in two different border areas in Texas; (2) codeswitching over a period of two years; (3) language mixing as a function of age/grade level; and (4) type of language mixing over time and by region. It was found that codeswitching did not occur with great frequency, and that regional differences were found in the extent to which it did occur. (AMH)",

        "description":"The study of the varieties of language usage in social contexts can made a significant contribution to general welfare if judgments of people's language are unshackled from right-wrong presuppositions and a dispassionate approach is taken to relating their language to the situations they must deal with in the course of their lives. An understanding of code switching can be a valuable tool to a literary critic, and, conversely, literature that rings true in sociolinguistic terms can illuminate our understanding of people's behavior in different language contexts. A failure to take into account individual and group differences in language usage, and pressures to maintain or avoid certain usages, has hampered effective reading instruction. Both in terms of comprehension and  performance, reading instruction will benefit from a recognition of the fact that a child's spoken language does affect his/her reading. Finally, medical practitioners will find their communication with patients much improved if they take into account not only dialectal differences and unfamiliarity with jargon, but also patient expectations from doctor language. The language of the doctor with an effective bedside manner will be flexible for the sake of a communicative dialogue, without being condescending or pretentiously non-standard or common. (JB)",

        "description":"During the past ten years, research on second language acquisition (SLA) has expanded; at the same time, different models and hypotheses have been proposed to explain and account for the processes underlying SLA. Four models seem to be dominant at the present time: (1) the monitor model, which distinguishes between implicit or unconscious language acquisition and explicit language learning; (2) the discourse approach which emphasizes the relationship between the form and function of linguistic structures; (3) the neurofunctional perspective, which looks at SLA processes through two interrelated systems, macro-behavioral and neurofunctional, and which distinguishes between primary, secondary, and foreign language learning; and (4) the acculturation model, based on social and  psychological factors, which claims that acculturation is the major cause of second language acquisition. Each model is reviewed, evaluated, and critiqued from an experimental perspective. It is argued that the acculturation model may establish the starting point from which experimental research on SLA might be pursued. (Author/AMH)",

        "description":"Sociolinguistic information is needed for proper implementation of bilingual education programs. The survey discussed here was designed to provide information on the sociolinguistic parameters in the bilingual community, identification of the transfer or maintenance status of Spanish, and the selection of a bilingual education program. A questionnaire related to general language use and language preference patterns was administered to educators and parents in a small, rural Colorado community, which had had a bilingual education program for four years. They were also asked to examine models of bilingual programs to determine the type of program they would prefer to their own. The results demonstrated that educators and parents differ in their sociolinguistic characteristics and  in their selection of a bilingual education program model. These results challenge the assumptions that teaching/administrative staff in bilingual programs themselves reflect bilingual goals and orientations in their behavior, and that ethnicity rather than socio-economic or educational factors is a primary influence in language maintenance. The unintentional exclusion of children from the survey is seen as a flaw and reflective of the tendency to exclude those most affected by a policy from the policy-making process. (AMH)",

Many studies emphasize that children's responses to school tasks are directly influenced by values learned at home and that these factors add to the complexity of communication in the classroom. Studies of the communication process are reviewed for their contribution to the exploration of the relationships between words, vocal and kinesic systems, and the interpretive procedures of participants in classroom conversation. Particular attention is given to studies of acquired contextualization conventions, that is, non-lexical and non-grammatical signaling of communicative intent, and to the way those conventions lead to  interpretive differences in ethnically mixed settings or in interaction between children and adults. An example of an episode in a classroom is given to illustrate these conventions and the misinterpretation that can arise. It is suggested that the factors discussed may begin to provide a solution to the problem of what it is about school and classroom environment that leads some children to learn and others to fall behind.

A trait-treatment interaction approach was utilized in this study to examine the role of FD/I among 236 college students enrolled in six sections of an introductory Spanish course. The purpose of the investigation was to determine the significance of student style, teacher style, and student-teacher stylistic match or mismatch upon second language achievement. Field dependence was assessed with the Group Embedded Figures Test and subjects were then classified as FD or FI with a median-split technique. Factorial analyses revealed a significant main effect for student style in performance  on measures of Spanish linguistic, communicative, and integrative competence. In each instance the FI group of students exhibited a superior performance. There was no main effect for teacher style nor were there any significant interaction effects. It was concluded that the learner factor (FD/I cognitive style) was of more importance in achievement than the situational factor (teacher style). It is suggested that further naturalistic, ethnographic research be undertaken to examine student-teacher styles as process variables in the second language classroom to complement outcome-oriented studies such as this one.

The following six factors were retained that supported the work by NCHEMS: personal growth, job skills, cultural awareness, general knowledge, academic skills, and human relations skills. The findings tend to track the taxonomy  proposed by Lenning except for the splitting of his category of the social/cultural/personal area into the three dimensions of personal growth, cultural awareness, and human relations. The findings do not support Lenning's more refined four-digit taxonomy that has five dimensions and groups items into two-digit subcategories within each dimension (a procedure similar to the structure of the Higher Education General Information Survey). It was found that outcomes of the university have changed in a smooth continuous fashion over the 40 years. Additionally, different curricula have produced different outcomes, a finding that adds some support to the viewpoint that certain types of people self-select into specific career fields. (SW)",

Based on the work of representatives from many campuses, a large scale computer simulation was developed, using as input numbers of full-time-equivalent faculty and students for each two-digit code of the Higher Education General Information Survey and for four student levels. The student-faculty ratios were initially determined for each discipline/level combination, and by overlaying the student mix for each campus on the matrix of ratios, projections were made of the total faculty needed by each campus. The first  iteration of the process resulted in substantial reallocation of faculty both within and between campuses. Subsequent iterations caused the individual ratios to be adjusted based upon experience, campus data, and analyses of individual campus priorities. The 4 x 36 matrix clearly differentiates by level of instruction and by discipline at the same time equity in the distribution of resources is promoted by requiring all campuses to request resources at the same productivity level for instruction at a given level and discipline. Role differentiation is promoted by overlaying each campuses' student mix, by discipline and level, on the matrix of ratios. It is suggested that the formula achieved the goal of moderating the decline of faculty resources but failed to reduce the general debates  over equity, role differentiation, and appropriate funding levels. A new approach that reduces line item accountability and that is compatible with increased budget flexibility has been approved. (SW)",

It was found that AASCU institutions that have been successful in obtaining outside funds for research purposes do tend to place more emphasis, in both policy and resource allocation, on graduate teaching and internally and externally-funded research. Measures of size of faculty and student body, as well as doctoral work in several disciplines, were found to correlate significantly with grants at AASCU institutions. The best single predictor of success in 1978 was success four years earlier, with the existence of a grants administration office, dollar amount of grants  four years earlier, and existence of an engineering doctorate also significantly contributing to predictability. It is concluded that AASCU institutions successful at obtaining externally-funded research money tended to have certain things in common: past success in obtaining grants; emphasis on graduate and particularly doctoral work; larger student bodies and faculties; and emphasis on research and publication for promotion and tenure purposes.

Of the 3,500 alumni who were mailed a newsletter containing the questionnaire, 129 responded. The respondents represented a broad cross-section of Lincoln University alumni, and three-fourths were black and slightly over half were female. Information is also presented on year of graduation and major. On the whole, the former students seemed relatively content with their educational choices. the idea of not attending college was lowest on their list of possible changes, and was, in fact, overwhelmingly rejected. Similarly, the  educational process was generally acknowledged to have enhanced virtually all skills that the respondent possesses and applies. Respondents reported a general pattern of a somewhat lower skill level than their current employment applies, and this reinforces the idea of a need for greater, or more effective, college exposure. However, discrimination, and employment opportunity, rather than low educational or skill qualifications, appeared to present the major difficulties in first job searches. This general pattern was not dependent upon the respondents' race: the most striking racial pattern is the absence of significant attitudinal differences between black and white alumni. Nevertheless, blacks experienced more job discrimination, and felt that the skill applications were generally more  intensive than did their white counterparts. (SW)",

Four approaches found in the literature are: measuring quality by reputation, by scholarly productivity, by correlating reputation and scholarly productivity, and by multiple measures. Ohio State University uses a multiple measures approach to assess quality. Graduate school representatives judge doctoral examinations and report to the graduate school dean about the fairness of the examination, the quality of the examination, and the quality of the student's performance. The judgments are tabulated and presented as quantitative and qualitative indicators of quality. Quantitative data are derived from the General Examination  Evaluation Forms. The graduate school representatives rate from one to seven (poor to excellent) the appropriateness of the oral questions, the level of difficulty of the oral questions, and the candidate's performance. Qualitative data are derived from written comments made by the graduate school representatives. Quantitative and qualitative data are also derived from the Final Oral Examination. The graduate school representatives' evaluations are added to other internal and external quality measures to help programs identify their strengths and weaknesses. These evaluations have been useful in helping program faculty change their examination procedures, the content of doctoral examinations, and perceptions that have contributed to the suspension of graduate admissions in a field of  specialization.

        "description":"The practices of program budgeting, costing, and strategic planning in higher education are examined. It is suggested that many postsecondary administrators and other groups have viewed a particular technique as the answer to their problems and converted a valid management technique into a management fad. Program budgeting, a system whereby the organization's programs or outputs, rather than its subunits, are allocated resources, is most often identified with Planning Programming Budgeting Systems (PPBS). It is claimed that PPBS was adopted by higher education soon after its first uses in government settings without evidence to suggest its applicability and without careful consideration of its uses and limitations. Among other problems is the fact that higher education is unable  to specify the nature of its outputs, much less to measure them for cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness calculations that underlie the utility of PPBS. Additionally, terms such as &quot;cost,&quot;&quot;benefit,&quot; and &quot;program&quot; were used as if they had definitive and commonly understood meanings when they did not. In regard to costing, it is suggested that the lack of a usable production function has forced higher education to cost activities rather than outputs and has imposed limitations on the usefulness of the cost data. A second failure to adapt to a new setting is the adoption by state agencies of costing techniques developed for institutional use. It is claimed that, to date, strategic planning implementation parallels that of PPBS: implementation is beginning to occur concurrent with, not  following conceptual development. Many of the features of colleges limit their options and potential responsiveness to strategic change: the norm of collegial decision-making, tenure and specialization of faculty members, and interdependencies in the curriculum. It is suggested that the role and utility of the rational model and of other decision making models in the context of higher education institutions are important considerations. (SW)",

        "description":"A multivariate model to explain student success and failure at the Open University of the United Kingdom is outlined. The model is based on the results of an evaluation study that explored the suitability of this teaching system for young people under 21 years old. Twenty-three characteristics were designated as social and psychological problems, and it was hypothesized that the more problems students had, the less likely they would be to gain a credit. Younger students were assigned scores ranging from zero to 23 depending upon the number of problems they exhibited. It was found that educationally qualified students with low scores were particularly successful and unqualified students with high scores were very unlikely to gain a credit. In order to attach weights to individual  problems, a stepwise multiple regression was conducted using the 23 problems as independent variables and whether or not a credit was gained as the dependent variable. The resulting variables was an extremely good predictor for first-year progress among younger students. When performance across the age range was examined, it was found that younger students with few social and psychological problems fared as well as their older counterparts and that the relatively poor progress made by younger students could partly be explained by the fact that their study environments and personality characteristics tended to be less suited to distance study. However, it was also shown that when numerous problems existed it was the older students who were more willing or able to overcome them. It is  concluded that environmental and psychological factors are at least as important as academic ability in determining student performance, and that the model can be used to identify high-risk students.

          "And Others"],
        "description":"The emerging trend in state higher education finance policy to use and index to establish tuition and fee levels at public institutions was studied, based on a 1980 national survey of tuition-setting policies. It was found that, increasingly, states are adopting indexing to cost of education as an established policy for determining tuition: 14 states index tuition to the cost of education, 3 states index tuition to a specific measure, 30 states do not have an established policy for determining tuition but seem to use incremental pricing, and 3 states have established policies, but use no particular formula to determine tuition. When determining the cost of education according to set accounting practices and charging students a set percentage of this cost, the indexing system must  consider: the elements that should be included in the computation of the cost of education or instruction; whether the cost of education should be computed by student level; what percentage of costs should be passed on to students in the form of tuition; and whether percentage charged should vary by student residency or by type of institution. It is suggested that a policy that sets tuition by use of an index has implications for state budgeting, planning, and student enrollment. Indexing tends to curtail institutional control over the amount of money generated from tuition and also to decrease budgetary flexibility in the use of these revenues at the campus level. It is possible that if tuition is indexed to costs that are rapidly increasing, the resulting tuition increases may  contribute to enrollment declines. Administrators may also be burdened with the need to conduct annual studies to determine per student instructional or educational costs. Additional concerns include whether students at different institutions are being treated equitably and whether access to higher education is affected by tuition rates based on costing. (SW)",

        "description":"Alumni impressions of the degree to which their college educations contributed to their personal growth in a number of outcome areas were assessed, in 1980-81 based on data collected at 36 colleges and universities. A total of 7,330 alumni records were examined, and the respondents ranged in age from 20 through over 65 years old, with a median age of 26.2 years. Respondents from public colleges accounted for 71.8 percent of the sample, while those from private colleges represented 28.2 percent. The large majority were enrolled primarily as full-time, in-state students. Using the American College Testing Program Alumni Survey, which is appended, it was found that alumni felt that their college educations contributed to their personal growth most strongly in areas such as learning  on your own, working independently, and organizing your time effectively. These areas appear to be related to general learning skills, rather than areas related to specific academic subjects on skills. It is suggested that this finding tends to support the contention that college offers more than simple training in specific subject areas. The results also appear to indicate that students with different academic majors feel very differently about the outcomes of their programs. These differences are most pronounced in the scientific and mathematics-related outcome areas. The response differences between public college and private college alumni were less distinct than the differences among major areas. However, while private college respondents tended to rate their college experiences  higher overall, public college alumni were more positive in their responses to the mathematics and science-related outcome areas.

        "description":"The development of an interactive computer model at the University of Kansas and its potential to promote administrative involvement in sophisticated model development and to increase the effectiveness of institutional planning is considered. The model was developed to provide administrators a tool for analyzing the interaction of predicted enrollments with alternative staff, workload, and funding policies. The multiyear model, the Interactive Model of University Resources, is based on the assumption that students will demand a certain number of credit hours in various disciplines. Key outputs of the model include a comparison of faculty salary funding with salary costs and a display of the student credit hours (SCH) demanded by students versus the supply of SCH available given  the existing number of faculty and established teaching loads. Among the parameters that were used to develop the model are: levels of instruction, types of faculty, and average faculty salaries by discipline by faculty type. An interim solution to meet the data requirements of the model and other analytical efforts involved using data in the personnel/payroll, student records, and other data bases and files. When beginning a simulation with the model, the user must select policies and assumptions from displayed menus such as enrollment protection technique and faculty attrition rate. The user can then choose the manual or automatic mode. In the manual mode, the user can vary the mix of faculty and workloads for each discipline for each year. In the automatic mode the user can choose  whether the model will adjust faculty mix or workload to balance SCH supply to demand. A simplified version of the basic program algorithm for each discipline for a single year is diagramed. (SW)",

Faculty from a major research university in the midwest, a smaller state university in the midwest, and a predominantly black state university located in the southeast participated. The approximately 350 faculty respondents represented 16 departments. Factor loadings on the 17 items of the AES were determined for each university. Two functions appeared to separate the three universities in terms of (1) the head's departmental leadership--communicating departmental needs to higher level administrators, allocating resources among faculty,  directing promotion and tenure process, and making difficult decisions; and (2) the head's departmental management--handling routine duties, resolving tensions, encouraging good teaching, making difficult decisions, and improving scholarly reputation. To determine whether the AES was able to detect differences among departments within a given institution, similar multivariate analyses were conducted on the major research university's ratings. Three functions appeared to separate the department heads in terms of the department head's contribution toward improving the reputation of the department, the head's administrative ability, and the head's handling of curricular/instructional matters. A revision of the AES to 11 items was also tested. Overall, it is concluded that factor analysis of  the AES suggests that department administrators are evaluated by their faculty along one general dimension or factor. Possible reasons for the observed unidimensionality of the AES are considered. A sample questionnaire is included. (SW)",

        "description":"Differences between black and white undergraduate student backgrounds and perceptions concerning a predominantly white university prior to college entrance, while enrolled, and within one year after receipt of a baccalaureate degree were examined. Data were collected between 1978 and 1980 from students at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, which has 70 percent female enrollment. Research measures included the Student Descriptive Questionnaire developed by the Educational Testing Service and the Student Perceptions Survey, which incorporates items from the Higher Education Measurement and Evaluation Kit and from a survey of black students enrolled in white colleges and universities, which was sponsored by the Southern Regional Education Board. A major difference that  was found between black and white students' college experiences, was the need for financial assistance on the part of most black students. Another difference, which was consistent across the three time periods, was the academic aptitude and achievement of the students. Black students generally scored lower on the Scholastic Aptitude Test and saw themselves as deficient and in need of improving their math abilities. This difference in academic aptitude and achievement remained throughout the college years as evidenced by the difference in the grade point average for graduating seniors. The third major difference was related to students' social interests and activities. Blacks were much more interested than whites in participating in student government and activities of special ethnic or  racial clubs, such as the Neo-Black Society. It is suggested that the findings illustrate the need for a supportive environment for minority students. A bibliography is appended. (SW)",

        "description":"The relationship between personality characteristics and academic success of college freshmen at a predominantly female campus was studied, using the Myers-Briggs Type indicator (MBTI) to measure personality and first-year grade point average to measure academic success. The comparative effectiveness of the MBTI and the traditional predictors using Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) Scores and high school rank was also assessed. The MBTI classifies people on each of four indices: extraversion/introversion, sensing/intuition, thinking/feeling, and judgment/perception. A sample of 1,812 freshmen entering the University of North Carolina, Greensboro, during 1977-79 were studied. Using dichotomous scores, a significant relationship was found between the first-year grade point averages  and the students' preference for the sensing/intuition dimension; those with a preference for intuition tended to obtain higher GPAs. Using continuous scores, significant but low correlations (.08) were found between the sensing/intuition dimension and the GPA as well as the judging/perceptive dimension and the GPA. Based on the findings, it is suggested that the utility of the MBTI in predicting academic success is limited (the MBTI accounted for two percent of the variance in GPA). There were also inconsistencies in the results for male and black students and for students with certain majors. However, the fact that the introversion/extraversion dimension accounted for an additional seven percent of the variance in the GPA for 1979 black students, after the SAT and high school rank  scores were included, suggests that the MBTI has the potential for being an important predictor of academic success for select groups.

Priorities fall into three major areas: improving the quality of teachers and other school personnel, improving the curriculum at the secondary and postsecondary levels, and coordination between the sectors of education. Recommendations about teachers and other school personnel deal with their selection, certification, preparation, and continuing education. Recommendations regarding curriculum call for higher academic standards in high schools and colleges, as well as improving the preparation of youth for work. Recommendations for joint action by  the agencies and institutions that govern and deliver education in the region are made, since their cooperation is essential if the recommendations are to be implemented. Financial implications of the recommendations are also considered. Among the specific recommendations are the following: states should apply selection procedures throughout the entire process of preparing teachers (rather than at the end point only), starting with tighter admission standards and ending with performance evaluation of all beginning teachers; in each state, the ongoing evaluation of teacher education programs should be a joint activity of the state higher education board and of the state board of education; and the states should modify their certification regulations and remove rigid and unnecessary  requirements.

Current and projected enrollment are assessed, and other groups of women who are already employed or seeking work and who are likely candidates for educational re-entry are described. Among the findings are these: The Carnegie Council on Policy Studies in Higher Education predicts a 23 percent decline in the traditional college-bound group of 18 to 24 year olds by 1997. It maintains, however, that the impact on colleges will be partially offset by increases in participation by students 25 and older, by women and by members of minority groups. A trend toward nontraditional students (women, minorities, older students, etc.) has already appeared in the least  traditional sectors of higher education (i.e., public two-year colleges rather than elite universities). At two-year schools older students comprise 40 percent of enrollment; enrollment in community colleges includes nearly 53 percent women; and women comprise slightly less than 50 percent of enrollment at four-year institutions. More than one-third of all college students are at least 25 years old, and the number of women 35 and older enrolled in college has doubled since 1972. Full-time enrollment has been growing much faster among women than among men, and part-time enrollment is also rising faster for women. Two percent of full-time undergraduate students in 1978 were Asian American/Pacific Islander, 10 percent were black, 4.9 percent were Hispanics, and 0.6 percent were American  Indians. The percentage of these minorities that was women ranged from 46 percent to 57 percent. Fields of study and degrees obtained by the different minority groups and information on women who work are included. (SW)",

Based on the philosophy that tests, particularly those involving no grading, are useful study devices, computers are used to make tests available to students. Ten lessons have been developed on different topics in geology, and the computer program for handling multiple choice tests is written in BASIC. Additionally, the number of times a question is tried and the number of times the correct answer is selected as a first choice is recorded in order to help determine how much class time to devote to various course topics. Microcomputers were implemented to enable the use of graphs, cross sections, or maps. Among other questions, the lesson asks students to arrange the rock  units and the periods of erosion, folding, and faulting in order of relative age. Student reactions to the use of the computer were assessed based on questionnaire responses. The computer tests and lessons are used as an addition to the conventional lecture, discussion, and laboratory approach. The chief benefits of the computer lessons are: they provide a good means for review of subject matter, they help to identify problem areas, the computer recordkeeping provides the instructor with information on how well the class is learning various concepts and principles, and most of the students taking the computer tests or lessons have had no previous computer exposure.

        "author":["Bean, John P."],
        "description":"A theoretical model of turnover in work organizations was applied to the college student dropout process at a major midwestern land grant university. The 854 freshmen women subjects completed a questionnaire that included measures for 14 independent variables: grades, practical value, development, routinization, instrumental communication, participation, integration, courses, distributive justice, campus organizations, opportunity, marriage, satisfaction, intent to leave. It was projected that 12 determinants would influence satisfaction, intent to leave and dropping out in a causal sequence. The model was estimated using path analysis and multiple regression. Nine variables were ranked by total causal effects. From high to low, these were: intent to leave, grades, practical  value, opportunity, marriage, satisfaction, campus organizations, courses, and participation. The dropout data were obtained for spring and fall semesters 1979 and spring 1980. It is suggested that the attrition model, based on the Price/Mueller model of turnover in work organizations, was supported by estimation procedures, and that much can be learned about student behavior from the study of employee behavior. The chief difference between the findings for Price and Mueller and the present study was in the effectiveness of intention as an intervening variable to influence dropout or turnover decisions. One reason for this difference is probably due to the shorter time interval for students than for employees between gathering the data on the determinants and the data on dropouts.  (SW)",

        "description":"A process theory of coping developed largely by Robert F. Peck (one of the authors), a sentence completion instrument, and data concerning the manner in which college women cope are considered. Peck proposes that a person going through optimal coping confronts the problem, attempts one or several types of activities in order to resolve the situation, persists in obtaining a solution, and generally resolves the problem in an effective and self-satisfying manner. A semi-projective instrument consisting of 34 sentences that pose the following five types of problems was developed: achievement, interpersonal relations, authority, aggression, and anxiety. The instrument is scored by categorizing the responses according to dimensions such as overt problem solving, emotional  expressiveness, aggressive response, and attempt to control affect. The categories are then evaluatively scaled on the dimensions of confrontation, engagement, and coping effectiveness. To assess coping in adults with this instrument, a group of college women, mostly junior and senior education majors, were asked to complete the instrument on two occasions five weeks apart, as well as to complete questionnaires about achievement motivation, personality characteristics, and their interpersonal interaction style. It was found that the instrument is reliable and has utility for the assessment of coping. Additionally, it was found that women who were pursuing a somewhat typical female occupational goal (elementary and secondary school teaching) demonstrate a broad range of coping, from highly  adaptive problem solving to marginal adaptation, noncoping, or avoidance, denial. Good copers exhibited work values associated with high achievement, and personality characteristics such as internal locus of control. (SW)",

Results indicated that PTV viewing seems to be motivated primarily by the desire for a change of pace from commercial TV fare, and the related  expectation of being entertained by intelligent, well written, well acted, and well produced programming. The multidimensional nature of PTV viewing motivations and gratifications contradicted the stereotyped unidimension image of PTV as a dull, demanding instructional/educational service. (MER)",

The three sites chosen for the study were selected on the basis of the diversity of their geographic location and the type of school population served. It was discovered that school systems tend to adapt microcomputer use to their own goals, needs, and ways of operating. Although several common trends were observed among the systems studied, it was concluded that microcomputers on their own will not  promote any particular outcomes, and their impact will depend largely on the educational context in which they are embedded.

Based on a previous laboratory model, the Generalized Maintenance Trainer Simulator (GMTS) is a relatively low cost trainer that offers intensive training in equipment set-up, troubleshooting, and system assessment. It uses a software database and microfiche photographs to simulate electronic equipment, and the executive computer programs that manage all interactions between students and the system are programmed in UCSD Pascal. A database representing a satellite communications system was also developed to demonstrate the trainer's capabilities and to permit gathering  of supportability data. The GMTS hardware and software have been refined and documented to meet the research objective of providing the intensive training desired at low cost. Testing and evaluation of the trainer in the school environment are scheduled. (MER)",

It is argued that many of these technologies are efficient in cost/benefit terms, but are often not being used in organizations because policy developers are not aware of their potential. It is concluded that: (1) the telecommunications authority should establish a unit to facilitate increased awareness of policy developers of communications options; (2) there are large numbers of applications of telephone conferencing which have not been tried in Australia; (3) computer conferencing could be used to link parliamentary committee members into global networks in their respective areas; (4) BOM could be used  for the development of grass roots networks and policy development networks where computer conferencing is too expensive an option; and (5) there is a need for further research into the question of how communications techniques could assist with the development of more effective approaches to policy development and implementation in Australia.

Fifth grade students in a public school in Syracuse, New York, were randomly selected as subjects, and then randomly placed in either the experimental or the control group. The experimental group was taught LOGO, a programming language developed for use with young children, while the control group received no special instruction. At the end of the treatment period, both groups were administered a series of tests measuring their conditional reasoning abilities. Tests were scored in two distinct ways, and the two groups were statistically compared  within both scoring schemes by split-plot two-factor repeated measures and one-way analysis of variance. It was found that students in the experimental group who interpreted conditional logic statements biconditionally performed significantly better on the inversion fallacy principle than the control group; no significant difference was found when test items were scored in the traditional manner. Comparison of pre- and post-experiment achievement test scores showed a significant improvement in reading only for the control group. Some areas for further research are suggested, and a 64-item bibliography is attached. (MER)",

It goes on to profile the colleges in terms of student demographics, programs  and course offerings, and finances. Finally, this section enumerates the challenges the Committee saw emerging for the community colleges. Section IV presents in detail the recommendations of the Committee for dealing with these challenges. These recommendations concern community college mission, community needs, the open-door philosophy, governance, community development, higher education coordination, funding, interinstitutional cooperation, management practices, the protection of the basic nature of the community college, and public confidence. Section V presents conclusions, Section VI contains appendices providing supportive data, and Section VII offers a bibliography. (AYC)",

        "description":"The Energy Communications Center (ECC) has sponsored a number of alcohol fuels activities designed to share information about alcohol fuels with two-year college faculty and administrators and to clarify the manpower and curriculum issues related to fuel production. This paper is the result of the last of these activities, a one-day meeting of fuel experts and educators held in March 1981. After a summary of the major conclusions reached at the meeting, background information on the goals and activities of the ECC is presented, along with a listing of the March 1981 meeting participants. Next, the paper explains why the alcohol fuels industry is in flux and presents two arguments in support of American investment in the industry. These arguments relate to alcohol as a means of  enhancing national security and alcohol production as a trigger for rural revitalization. Speculative figures are then presented for the future of alcohol fuel production, followed by a review of studies projecting labor requirements in the industry. The next section of the paper looks at the role of the community colleges, focusing on their function as regional training centers, a three-phase approach to program development, the implementation of this approach at State Fair College, and their responsibility to provide objective, factual details about the alcohol fuels issue to diminish community resistance. After summarizing the issues raised at the March meeting, the paper concludes with an annotated list of resources. (AYC)",

        "description":"In spite of an increased emphasis on technical training within the college curriculum, there is a growing realization that the humanities in general and ethics in particular are vital to the student's personal development and moral enlightenment. Accordingly, LaGuardia Community College, with the financial backing of the National Endowment for the Humanities, is conducting a Public History Program (PHP) that integrates literature and ethics in the exploration of five topics related to the local history of the Borough of Queens (New York): transportation, work, housing, leisure, and aging. Through seminars, learning packages, traveling exhibits, calendars, and broadsides, the PHP attempts to identify the central values woven into these historical issues. Since differing personal  values, which are not often consciously recognized, cause confrontations between individuals and groups, this ethical examination should open lines of communication between people, demonstrate the insignificance of many interpersonal disputes, provide a clearer understanding of students' own values and the values of others, and allow individuals to take more control over the forces that govern their lives. Appended to the paper are examples of the ethics materials developed for the PHP learning packages, which raise ethical questions for discussion related to work, the social costs of progress, and the themes of an exhibit of housing photographs.

        "description":"Today, among adolescents, childbearing may precede rather than follow marriage. Evidence suggests that adolescent childbearers now rely heavily on their families to provide needed support. Among a sample of 320 adolescent, mostly black mothers from low-income families, most spent a majority of their early years of parenthood in an extended family arrangement, and nearly half were living with kin after 5 years. Research has shown that marriage, whether it occurs before or after the child is born, offers very little protection to teenage mothers; young mothers who remained single were better off than those who married, receiving more financial and emotional support from their kin. There is some evidence that family support buffers the impact of single parenthood for the offspring  as well. Non-conclusive findings of case studies of families with pregnant adolescents suggest that the pregnant adolescent's status in her family improves after the child is born, that paternal involvement in child rearing is often precluded by the mother's family, and that parenting duties are shared by members of the mother's household. However, these conditions in the family may be neither consistent nor continuous. (In conclusion, tentative recommendations for policy makers are advanced.) (Author/RH)",

The topics covered by these chapters include: emancipation statutes; commitment of minors to mental health institutions; children's participation in political processes; incarceration of children in adult jails; waiver of juvenile court jurisdiction; deinstitutionalization and alternative placements of status offenders; child  voice in custody decisions; community support programs; and laws prohibiting the sexual exploitation of children. A brief summary preceding each chapter highlights the key changes and/or emerging issues identified within that chapter. Chapter 12 presents a summary sketch of federal program initiatives for children during the period 1975 to 1980. A rudimentary assessment of the cumulative effect of these programs in shaping the current status of adolescents is also provided.

        "description":"Fifth in a series of six volumes reporting outcomes of the preliminary evaluation of an educational intervention, this report presents the findings of the effects of Project Developmental Continuity (PDC) up to the time the evaluation study's cohort of children completed grade 1. Preliminary findings concerning the relationship between variables in the teacher, parent and child domains are also provided. Begun at 15 sites in 1974 with the purpose of ensuring disadvantaged children receive continuous individualized attention as they progress from Head Start through the early primary grades, PDC emphasizes the involvement of school personnel and parents in formulating educational goals and in curriculum development. Chapter I of this volume presents a brief history of the PDC  program. Chapter II describes the conceptual framework guiding the evaluation of PDC processes and effects on children. Data collection and analysis procedures are discussed in Chapter III. Chapter IV presents the descriptive findings regarding the sample and the characteristics of the instruments. Chapter V describes the results of the analysis of the child outcome measures. Chapter VI summarizes the major findings and discusses implications for the future. Appendices A and B provide, respectively, descriptions of the child development measures used and a comparison of summary score distributions by treatment group. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Current changes in the American nuclear family, the impact of changes in family structure on children, and a rationale for day care services are delineated in this literature review. The family modifications examined are (1) divorce, (2) remarriage, (3) single parenting, (4) father absence, (5) teenage parenting, and (6) extended families. Particular attention is given, respectively, to children's problems in the transition from an intact to a remarried family, and to the impact of father absence on children's social, intellectual, and emotional behavior. The history of day care provision in the United States is outlined, and different types of provision are described. It is concluded from the review of literature that the traditional American family has changed due to a rising  divorce rate, lowered birth rate, increased numbers of women in the work force, altered male and female roles, mobility in society, and other changes in economic and value orientations. Because of changing family structures, child rearing patterns have also altered. Since traditional sources of support for families with children are not readily available, new or additional support systems for families must be found. Traditional family support systems may also need to be reviewed. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"This study focused on two questions: (1) is there a difference between social and mechanical non-social causality in infancy? and (2) do infants use information about contact between objects in inanimate, mechanical causal sequences more than they use it in situations where a social event is to be caused? Forty-eight 10- to 10.9-month-old infants and their mothers participated in the study. Infants were given the opportunity to produce three events selected to present a continuum from inanimate and mechanical to animate and social. The events were (a) the appearance of a picture in a window; (b) the movement of a mechanical dog; and (c) social responses from a female experimenter. The events were activated by operating a manipulandum (a knob). Two conditions were employed: 24 of  the infants could trigger each event by moving the knob toward the event, thereby creating contact with it, while the other 24 could activate each event by moving the knob away from the event. Mothers demonstrated to their children how to use the knob. Infants were given a five minute period in which they could use the knob to trigger the events. Each session was videotaped from one camera located behind a one-way mirror and a second camera located in the room. After each toy session the mother and one other observer rated the infant's level of understanding of the cause-effect relationship between moving the knob and the occurrence of the event. An analysis of variance performed on the number of pushes of the knob toward and away from the events and on the two qualitative ratings of the  infant's understanding revealed that infants most frequently used the knob to produce pictures in the window, and that they understood that event best. The results indicate that infants use different causal strategies in social and non-social situations. The role of contact between cause and effect is discussed. (Author/MP)",

        "description":"The study reported here provides a theoretical and empirical framework for the analysis of employment tax credit policy (a government subsidy or business tax credit to firms who maintain or expand their use of labor). Various programs are examined from the standpoint of structure and implications. The programs are selective employment incentive; foreign employment credit, broad-based employment credit, and the new jobs tax credit. Literature is reviewed pertaining to economy-wide programs, including selective and broad-based employment credit programs. The effects of employment tax credits on individual firms are also examined. Then, the aggregate implications of employment tax credits are analyzed from the perspective of a complete macro-economic model of the economy. The model  includes various employment tax credit parameters and accommodates several alternative methods for financing the program. Also included is an empirical evaluation of the impact of an employment tax credit on the U.S. economy and a comparison of the cost of the program with public service employment alternatives. Appended are explanations of aggregate formulation, consumption calculation formulas, and references. Flow charts, tables, and other graphics illustrate many key points. (Author/CT)",

Smith. The craft-type entrepreneur is mainly interested in self-employment and owns a small business while the opportunistic-type, although interested in self-employment, primarily concentrates on expansion and organization building. Smith hypothesized that the two types differ in fourteen areas. To test Smith's hypothesis, sixty-four entrepreneurs (evenly divided between the two types) in central Illinois were interviewed and asked to respond to two instruments: a vocational preference inventory, developed by John L. Holland to measure personality types, and an attitude statement survey, designed by Hanna  Levenson to measure locus of control. Analysis of the data showed that the two types differ on seven of Smith's variables and that Holland's and Levenson's classifications of personalities are consistent with Smith's. Based on these findings, the following recommendations were made for career and vocational education: (1) self-employment should be presented to students as a career option; (2) programs for entrepreneurship should be initiated at both secondary and postsecondary levels; (3) students should be made aware of the two types of entrepreneurship; and (4) further research is needed in self-employment from the perspective of career development theory. (A curriculum is suggested for teaching the skills necessary to entrepreneurship, and an approach is offered for the organization of  instructional materials.) (ELG)",

The Huntington Beach Union High project developed and articulated a K-12 competency-based career education model. Data collected was inappropriate for determining whether growth was statistically significant, but student understanding increased after the program. Without a control group, it could not be stated that gains would not have occurred without the career education experience. The Fremont Unified project developed and implemented a career  decision making course. Activities were developed to meet objectives of six components: career guidance center, career decision making, staff development/infusion, articulation, community involvement, and dissemination. Data was analyzed by a third-party evaluator. Although many objectives were met, a teacher's strike affected objectives that required extensive teacher involvement.

The program effectiveness data indicate that the program is changing the lives of those who participate as well as their families. These data also show the program impacting on the economic health of this nation. The results of Council review of the administration effectiveness of the U.S. Office of Education, Division of Adult  Education, are somewhat less positive. Constraints imposed by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare policy, by the Civil Service system, by the regulatory process as well as the rules, regulations, and statutes themselves, and by the lack of a systematic staff and management development program within the Division prevent the Division from relating effectively to the states in such areas as long-range planning, evaluation and dissemination. Bureaucracy, effective management, lifelong learning, and illiteracy are issues which the Administration must deal with in the coming years. (Several data tables are included.) (Author/CT)",

        "description":"The Coast Guard, in efforts to improve the safety of recreational boating, undertook research to identify educational alternatives in boating safety programs. Background research was done to assess materials from areas of boating education and education in comparable recreational areas. Research was also conducted to review educational and mass media methods suitable for conducting boating educational programs. Output from this research provided information for planning and conducting a boater educational program. The prototype program utilized mass media, formal boating courses, Coast Guard visitations, and home study methods. The program was directed toward reducing collision and loading-related accidents and fatalities. A video tape supplement was produced to present the  prototype program in the perspective of an actual educational effort. Two evaluations of the mass media-type messages using experimental methods were performed. One experiment tested three levels of participatory response on the part of the viewers of a specially prepared television public service announcement for boater education. The version evoking highest participatory response levels produced greater recall of information given in the announcement. Another experiment compared a &quot;model&quot; pamphlet design to a &quot;typical&quot; pamphlet design used in other boating educational materials. Recall of pamphlet information was greater for the &quot;model&quot; design. (Appendix materials, which comprise about one half of this document, include, among other things, mailing lists for private and government  agencies, and publishers relevant to boating and boating education.)

Several research questions were formulated; for example, what proportion of ABE/ASE students have a \"favorable ratio\" of positive aspects of an ego-stage crisis over the negative aspects? Seventy-two volunteer ABE/ASE students, aged sixteen to seventy, were given a self-description questionnaire to determine their perceptions of their psychosocial characteristics. Also, an educational experience questionnaire was administered to determine the extent to which students believed their educational programs helped them deal positively or negatively with their  concerns for trust, autonomy, initiative, and/or industry. The proportion of mistrusting students in the sample was greater than the proportion of trusting students; but the proportion having high pertinent concerns for trust was greater than the proportion having low pertinent concerns for trust. ABE/ASE students viewing themselves as having a sense of positive autonomy was greater than the proportion viewing themselves as having a sense of shame and doubt. It appears from another finding of this research that ABE/ASE programs are generally doing well in promoting positive psychosocial development and in controlling negative influences. (CSS)",

Representing seven Job Corps centers, a sample of 489 youth between the ages of 16 and 22 participated, of whom 85 percent were black and 87 percent were urban. In order to draw comparisons, the participants were chosen from three different groups: persisters or those who remained in the Job Corps at least three months; those who dropped out of the program earlier; and those who did not enroll. Of the twenty-one outcomes which were measured covering the three impact areas, persisters were found to have improved in eight areas (job seeking skills, job satisfaction, attitude toward authority, self-esteem, crime reduction, nutrition  behavior, family relations, and leisure time), while dropouts only improved in two and nonenrollees in five. Particularly impressive was the Job Corps' impact on (1) crime reduction, which showed that the Corps can function effectively as a rehabilitation agent (delinquent females were found to have benefitted the most with only a four percent rate of recidivism among persisters, or compared to a much higher rate for nonenrolled and dropout females); and (2) health, which resulted from the Corps' providing free medical care to participants, including physical examinations, doctor visits, dental care, and family life and nutrition education. (Numerous tables throughout display various analyses of the data collected for this study.) (ELG)",

First, a survey was conducted to identify the job tasks performed by the operators, their frequency, importance, and necessity. A questionnaire listing 651 tasks divided into six subject areas (management, human relations, wastewater collection, wastewater treatment, water treatment, and water distribution) was sent out to operators at three job levels. Based on responses from 231 operators, 439 tasks were found to be significant in plant operation. It was then necessary to revise the existing curriculum to address these tasks more fully and to convert it to a competency based format. A competency based  testing program was developed to permit students to &quot;test out&quot; of instructional units, and the curriculum was changed to allow entry at various times. To evaluate the program, four types of measurement were used: (1) course effectiveness, measured by a computerized campus system, called SPOT, which is administered to students upon program completion; (2) instructor effectiveness; (3) student skills performance, which includes a basic math skills test upon entry and a remedial program, called PAD, to correct math and reading deficiencies; and (4) postgraduate job performance.

        "description":"Women's American ORT (Organization for Rehabilitation through Training) is an autonomous affiliate of a worldwide Jewish volunteer organization. It is dedicated to fighting poverty by providing Jewish youth and adults with vocational skills so that they may become productive members of society. In the past, WAO (Women's American ORT) has made major contributions toward improving the image and status of vocational education in the U.S., and now it is becoming involved in implementation of career education efforts: securing greater community involvement in career education, working more closely with K-12 school systems, and encouraging a career education emphasis in higher education. In general, WAO needs (1) to develop a strong, definitive statement on career education, (2) to  educate its members about career education, (3) to give career education priority status among its goals, and (4) to gain positions for its members on career education advisory boards at all governmental levels. WAO can use its media contacts to gain greater community understanding for and support of career education. (This paper is part of a series resulting from seminars sponsored by USOE's Office of Career Education on collaboration in career education. The two appendixes to this monograph contain lists of WAO seminar participants and of the thirty issues that they raised.) (ELG)",

After an explanation of the term \"collaboration\" in the introduction, the expected learner benefits from collaborative career education are outlined as well as the advantages for both educators and the business/labor/industry community. Two major problems are then identified: the private sector's refusal to recognize and accept responsibility in career education and the educators' refusal to allow the private sector to participate in operational policymaking. Next, suggestions are proposed for initiating a community  collaborative career education effort, and discussion is devoted to the major actions required: (1) securing commitment from top community leaders and the community in general, (2) motivating teachers to learn about and use community resources, (3) sustaining the collaborative effort through a community education/work council and a collaboration coordinator, (4) financing the council's operations and coordinator's position, and (5) obtaining policy support statements from leading business, labor, and industrial organizations. Brief descriptions are included of collaborative efforts already underway by eleven community-based organizations and by the fifteen local career education coordinators who attended the third seminar.

The COD test was objective-referenced in nature. Each test item was matched to COD objectives in one of the following areas: job characteristics; job requirements; career decision making; basic skills; and attitudes and values. A panel of educators, school administrators, and business representatives met to evaluate the actual student performance in terms of their own &quot;benchmark&quot; of desirable achievement. Finally, the COD technical committee met to review all the results of  the assessment and, with the input of the Benchmark Panel, generated a set of interpretative comments and recommendations for action. (This report describes the major outcomes of the assessment by reporting the following: performance on objectives; comparisons of the achievement of Massachusetts students with that of students within each age group; and highlights of the student and principal questionnaires. Also the interpretations and recommendations made by the panel and technical committee are presented.

Federally authorized appropriations during this time have increased from eight million dollars in 1963 to eighty million in 1978. Enacted to replace the Smith-Hughes Act (1917), the 1963 Act was designed to meet current needs by funding projects in the areas of research, demonstration projects and models, and training. The Vocational Education Amendments of 1968 divided federal funding into three distinct categories: (1) Part C for research and training, (2) Part D for demonstration projects, and (3) Part I for curriculum development. Under this separation of funding it was  found that programs often operated in isolation without continuity from research to demonstration to implementation. To correct this situation, amendments were passed in 1976 to consolidate research, exemplary and innovative programs, and curriculum and staff development into a single category. Unlike the earlier legislation, these laws restricted federal funding to applied, close-ended research projects of national significance. Despite the coordinated approach required by these statutes, curriculum development appears to be receiving less emphasis and financial support than other areas. (ELG)",

Former teachers were asked to rank forty-five factors on the extent of influence each factor had on their decision to leave teaching. The five factors which were ranked as the most influential were long range occupational goals were other than teaching vocational agriculture; there were students in class who should not have been in vocational agriculture; inadequate advancement opportunities; long hours; and inadequate salary. An analysis of the relationship between demographic factors and influential factors revealed four findings, two of which are the following: as time spent in  supervision of students' occupational experience programs increased, former teachers generally reported student learning difficulties and discipline problems as being less influential in their decision to leave; and the higher the reported salary during the last year of teaching the less influential inadequate salary generally became. In comparing former and current teachers, it was found that the former teachers tended to report lower salaries than the current teachers with whom they were matched. (EM)",

        "description":"Through an examination of the background and current status of programs at the National Center for Research in Vocational Education, one can identify many research problems and issues. Some of these current National Center programs include a diffusion program (combining five U.S. Office of Education-sponsored projects), research and development (R&amp;D) efforts (focusing on operational problems in National Center diffusion and information systems), and information system activities (including the ERIC Clearinghouse on Adult, Career, and Vocational Education, the National Center Clearinghouse, and the Resource and Referral Service). Based on these and past activities, eight issues can be identified as potential research topics concerning educational dissemination and utilization: (1)  a discrepancy exists between national priorities and local user needs for the dissemination of R&amp;D results; (2) communication processes need further development; (3) practitioner capability to obtain and use R&amp;D information needs strengthening; (4) diffusion of innovation strategies have not been validated; (5) information about exemplary programs is not valid or reliable; (6) methods of conceptualizing and measuring the impact of R&amp;D based information have not been developed; (7) the issue of selective versus comprehensive information systems needs resolution; and (8) the roles and relationships of public and private agencies active in dissemination and utilization need clarification.

It also examines three case studies in Chicago; Erie, Pennsylvania; and the Virginia Peninsula. The report discusses the need for cooperation between CETA and the vocational education system. Characteristics of good skill training are outlined as well as difficulties in developing CETA programs. Ways in which Title II of the Educational Act of 1976 aid CETA program development are examined. In the Chicago case study, funding of CETA programs is explained in great detail. A flow chart illustrates Chicago's Title I CETA program, including employment services and opportunities in 1977. Much discussion is given here to classroom training. Mention  is made of state funding's involvement and how Chicago's program is coordinated. The Erie and Virginia Peninsula studies cover in less detail the same areas as the Chicago study. Flow charts of Erie's Office of Manpower Services and the route taken by a prospective CETA client are included. The Virginia Peninsula study contains flow charts of the peninsula's office of manpower programs organization and the manpower service delivery system. Appended are Chicago's Acceptable Occupations list and Erie's skill needs survey of manufacturing. (CT)",

        "author":["Woelfer, Carlyle"],
        "description":"The purpose of this project was to develop a comprehensive model plan for the articulation of public high school vocational education programs with the occupational education programs of the community colleges/technical institutes in Duplin County, North Carolina. Such a plan would serve also as a guide for articulation efforts throughout the state. Project procedures were divided into two phases. Phase I included the orientation and preparation of project participants relative to articulation concepts; the finalizing of a plan of action; the development of policies and procedures; the organization of local area joint advisory and program committees that would be used in the development of the materials; the development of job task inventories and state pilot model instruction  objectives guides; application of articulation procedures; and the development of an articulation policies and procedures guide. During phase II a set of three &quot;State Pilot Model&quot; instructional objective guides were developed in automotive mechanics, executive secretary/business education, and drafting. A &quot;State Pilot Model&quot; articulation policies and procedures guide was also developed. For those programs commonly taught by numerous institutions throughout the state, it was concluded that a better quality articulated vocational/occupational education program can be developed with less cost and effort by a joint state occupational advisory and program committee than can be done at the local level.

Next, questionnaires were sent to fifteen recruit training centers to obtain data on the services' remedial reading programs. On-site reviews of remedial reading programs in each of the services were conducted. Several adverse effects of poor reading ability were found. Poor readers (1) were discharged at higher than normal rate; (2) face difficulty in technical training; (3) do not perform as well on the job; and (4) have limited career potential. Among the efforts of the Department of Defense (DOD) to alleviate this  problem was the development of reading improvement programs. Efforts were also made to reduce the difficulty of reading material that personnel must use, but further efforts are needed in this area. Among the suggested alternatives to alleviate this problem were more selective recruitment, reevaluation and redesign of literacy training programs, and simplification of reading materials. It was recommended that more efforts in this area be made. (Locations visited and characteristics of the DOD reading remediation programs are appended.) (CT)",

Part 3 introduces a paper evaluating direct labor market effects of the old trade adjustment assistance program  before its reformulation under the 1974 Trade Act. The fourth part examines foreign investment and employment. In part 5 a paper is presented on international productivity comparisons.

Among the first of its kind in the country, the Denver program has completed six years of operation and has placed over 400 women in more than fifty different skilled occupations. Each of the five full-time staff members focuses on a different aspect of the program. Through various recruitment methods, women are made aware of BJW's existence and purpose. Following attendance at an orientation session, about half of the applicants screen themselves out, leaving a highly motivated group to enter BJW. The enrollees are then provided prevocational counseling to assist them in occupational choice and are  tutored in preparation for entry examinations and interviews. Support services are also offered, such as child care, provision of trade tools, and counseling. In order to place participants, the staff has established an effective relationship with labor, management, and government agencies. Followup to job placement is conducted of both the women and their employers. Because of careful matching of jobs and enrollees, the program has achieved a successful record of trainee job retention.

The enterprise unit consists of all establishments under common direct or indirect ownership. It is defined to include all entities, including subsidiaries, where there is more than 50% ownership. The classification covers the entire field of economic activities: agriculture, forestry, and fishing; mining; construction; manufacturing; transportation and public utilities; wholesale trade, retail trade; finance, insurance, and real estate; services; and public administration. This classification is a revision of the 1968 Enterprise Standard Industrial Classification (ESIC). Most changes reflect  the attempt to conform with the latest revision of the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) (1972). (A table showing the changes is presented in the appendix.) The structure of the enterprise classification makes it possible to tabulate, analyze, and publish enterprise data on a division, two-digit, three-digit, or four-digit basis. Entries appear by field and contain the ESIC code number, the enterprise title, and the SIC code number. (CSS)",

        "description":"This report describes the preliminary results of administering the Occupational Attitude Inventory (OAI) to 7,567 airmen worldwide. Two-thirds of those sampled were first-term airmen. Results of the survey revealed numerous differences and similarities between first-termers and careerists. Differences and similarities were noted on background information items, job aspect items, job factors, and importance of job factors to career decisions. Job factors with the highest job satisfaction ratings were opportunities for social contact, job security, moral acceptability of job, leave and time-off policies, supervisory responsibilities, safety programs, and family attitude toward job. Factors receiving low satisfaction ratings were cost of living, status in civilian community,  promotion chances based on ability, and quality of base housing and eating facilities. There was considerable agreement between first-terms and careerists on which factors are the most dissatisfying, differences existing in intensity of feeling rather than direction. Factors that rated high in importance to career decisions included such job aspects as work itself, promotion chances, economic security, and self-improvement opportunities. Of the twelve factors with high importance ratings only two were low in satisfaction ratings: promotion chances based on ability and cost of living. (Author/CSS)",

The first of seven sections reviews the current status of sanctioning and credentialing in mental health continuing education by various disciplines, mental health agencies, and training institutions. Section 2 defines certain terms; for instance, continuing education is defined as any systematic learning experience to improve, modify, or update knowledge, skills, or values in professional or occupational practice. The third section suggests steps for providing more sanction and support for continuing education. Section 4 discusses accreditation of continuing education  programs and the certification of continuing education hours. In section 5 seven issues, including complexity of the system, continuing education versus competency, and funding, are raised. Several approaches to credentialing, adopted by societies, agencies, and states, are described in section 6. The final section identifies twelve basic issues and proposes strategies to meet each issue. For example, the first issue involves linking sanctioned activities into a comprehensive continuing education system for delivery of mental health/human services.

        "description":"The Career Decision-Making Program (CDM) for secondary school students consists of approximately fifty individual products which can be used as a semester course, a six-to-eight-week exploratory course, independent units, or outside of the CDM program in other career guidance activities. The CDM program has two components: (1) the Exploring Career Decision-Making (ECDM) curriculum materials and (2) the Career Information System (CIS), a comprehensive organization and management system for career information resources. The fifteen ECDM curriculum units were designed to assist students in the development of career planning and decision-making skills through a group process for individualized career exploration. Each unit is self-contained and employs a variety of materials and  techniques, including filmstrips, worksheets, and hands-on activities. Utilization guides were also developed for the teacher/counselor conducting the units. The CIS component and the ECDM materials were field tested as a total unit at thirty-eight sites within sixteen states. Overall, evaluations were favorable, and revisions were made to implement the suggestions made by users during the field testing. (This document contains the final report and provides a description of CDM program development, model design, product development, field testing, evaluation plan, dissemination, and the revision of the &quot;Dictionary of Occupational Titles.&quot; The ECDM materials are available in ERIC as CE 019 231-232; the CIS materials, CE 019 233-240; and a guide to related filmstrips, CE 019 241.)

The first four units focus on the central program concepts of career decision-making, self-exploration, and occupational exploration. These units introduce basic skills that students will use throughout the program. Units 5-10 use the Career Information System component (CE 019 233-240) of the CDM program to provide experiences in exploring Worker Trait Groups and occupations in terms of personal characteristics. In units 11-13, students examine  major social, environmental, and economic influences on careers. The two final units help students utilize exploration and decision-making skills in developing or clarifying career plans, including tentative occupational choices. (BM)",

In chapter 2, L. J. Cary emphasizes three distinctive features of the community approach: (1) popular or broad-based participation, (2) community as an important concept, and (3) the holistic nature of concern. In \"The Information Self-help Approach\", H. Y. McClusky suggests that the right kind of information applied by knowledgeable participants at strategic junctures can make a difference in community development. In chapter 4, R. Thomas places heavy emphasis upon the \"special problem\" as the target for resolution in a problem-solving approach. He illustrates how a common interest in a particular problem goes beyond  the limited locational criteria of community. W. M. Evensen, writing on the experimental approach, reveals a growing concern among agencies and institutions in the application of a quasi-experimental design to community-development activities. G. S. Abshier, in \"The Demonstration Approach,\" emphasizes the difference between a true experimental program and a demonstration. Finally, R. J. Salmon and G. A. Tapper discuss the dynamic approach of power-conflict. They explore the meaning of power in the community-development process today. Biographical sketches of the authors are included. (Author/CT)",

        "description":"A cultural assimilator was developed to teach white junior officers about black culture in the army. Scenarios involving misunderstandings between blacks and whites in the army were presented, and respondents were asked to identify &quot;correct&quot; reasons for the misunderstandings. In the first of three field tests respondents showed evidence of learning from assimilator training, but cultural sensitivity to black culture on a related measure did not increase, and stereotyping was not reduced. In a second assimilator field test subordinates rated their company commanders as being more effective in race relations when commanders demonstrated greater knowledge of black culture. However, this was true only for white and Hispanic subordinates and not for black subordinates. A third  assimilator evaluation and follow-up showed that neither self-reports nor supervisor nor subordinate reports provided evidence that trained personnel were seen as being more effective in race relations than those who received no training. It was concluded that assimilator scenarios may be useful training aids as part of race-relations discussions but are not likely to have a strong favorable impact by themselves. (Author/CSS)",

        "description":"Nearly one-half of all unemployed persons in the U.S. today are between the ages of sixteen and twenty-four even though that age group accounts for only one-fourth of the total labor force. Unemployment among sixteen- to nineteen-year-olds is currently more than fifteen percent, and among twenty- to twenty-four-year-olds it exceeds ten percent. The projected decline in the size of the youth population will not significantly affect youth unemployment until approximately 1980, and even then the impact will not be sudden or dramatic. At present, the unemployment rate for nonwhite teenagers is almost three times the rate for white teenagers. Racial discrimination, inadequate skills and education, location in economically depressed areas, and intensified competition as a result of the  rapid influx of white teenagers and adult women into the labor market are contributing factors. Results in this study suggest that (1) monetary and fiscal policies can be used to reduce youth unemployment, as well as unemployment in general; (2) government policies established for other purposes, such as increases in the minimum wage and in payroll taxes, reduce employment opportunities for teenagers; and (3) the data presented in this study on differences in unemployment rates among subgroups of youths may be useful in targeting youth employment programs.

The third title stipulates special federal responsibilities, including special national programs and activities for Native Americans, migrant workers, veterans, handicapped persons, and older workers, as well as  information on efforts in research, training, and evaluation. Title 4 provides for youth programs, such as Youth Incentive Entitlement Pilot Projects, Youth Community Conservation and Improvement Projects, Youth Employment and Training Programs, Job Corps, and Summer Youth Program. Title 5 establishes the National Commission for Employment Policy, and the sixth title provides for the Countercyclical Public Service Employment Program. Title 7 covers private sector opportunities for the economically disadvantaged while the last provides for the establishment of a Young Adult Conservation Corps. The last third of the report notes the differences between the Senate bill and the House amendment and the substitute agreed to in conference. (EM)",

        "description":"A transfer-of-training design was used to evaluate the contributions of simulator training with synergistic six-degrees-of-freedom platform motion to aerobatic skills acquisition in the novice pilot. Thirty-six undergraduate pilot trainees were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: motion, no-motion, and control. Those in the control group received standard preflight/flightline instructions. Experimental subjects received five sorties in the advanced simulator for pilot training (ASPT), covering instruction on basic and advanced aerobatic tasks. All students received a fixed number of repetitions per task. Student performance in ASPT was evaluated periodically throughout pretraining using instructor pilot (IP) ratings for overall task performance and of special data  cards. Airborne performance was evaluated by the flightline instructor pilot using the same data card format used during the ASPT phase. Findings were (1) using IP ratings, no differences in motion and no-motion groups' performance emerged, (2) using special data cards, no consistent differences emerged between motion and no-motion groups, (3) significant learning occurred during simulator training for both groups, (4) experimental groups performed significantly better in the T-37 than did the control group, and (5) no significant differences emerged in T-37 performance between motion and no-motion groups.

Emphasis was given to research conducted by or for the military. The variables that may affect the retention of motor skills were dichotomized into task variables and procedural variables. The task variables that may underlie the long-term retention of motor skill include (1) duration of the no-practice period, or retention interval; (2) nature of the response required to accomplish a particular motor task; (3) degree to which the learner can organize or impose order upon the elements that define the task; (4) structure of the training environment; and (5) initial or &quot;natural&quot; ability of the learner in  performance of a task without prior practice. The procedural variables that may affect the long-term retention of motor skill include (1) degree of proficiency attained by the learner during initial training; (2) amount and kind of refresher training; (3) transfer of skills on one task to performance on another task; (4) presence of interfering activities; (5) distribution of practice during training; (6) use of part-task versus whole-task training methods; and (7) introduction of extra test trials prior to final testing.

No significant differences were obtained in the performance of the groups. The analyses of the interpretability of individual signs indicated that there was good reason to question the interpretability of many international road signs.  Apparently, the more abstract the symbolic representation, the lower the interpretability. Training should stress selective instructional strategies for the more abstract signs and have a longer instruction period. (Author/CSS)",

These questions are followed by some statistics regarding women's work force participation, including wages. Next, the implications of these facts for both daughters and sons are discussed. Then follows a discussion of the current enrollment of men and women in vocational education programs which are not traditional for their sex.

        "description":"The participation of women in the skilled trades increased appreciably between 1960 and 1970; however, the rate of increase was not as large as could have been expected if women had entered the skilled trades at the same rate they entered the total civilian labor market. The gap between men's and women's median earnings was greater in 1970 than in 1960, but in the skilled trades the decrease in women's earnings in proportion to men's was smaller. The participation of women in the skilled trades appears to be higher in larger companies in large metropolitan areas than it is on the average nationwide. Also, proportionately more minority women are employed in the skilled trades by such companies. Women continue to be underrepresented in both apprenticeship training programs and  vocational/technical education programs for the skilled trades even though affirmative action regulations and special stimulus programs have made some gains. Women have been well represented as participants in federal government training programs; however, they have been disproportionately concentrated in programs which lead to low-paying and low-skill jobs. Government funded outreach projects for women designed to prepare and place women in pre-apprenticeship, apprenticeship, and traditionally male blue-collar jobs have increased from one program in 1971 to over eighty in 1978. Now it is time to determine the effectiveness of these programs and to analyze which combination of factors is optimal--the project designs, the skills/characteristics of women selected, the support/training  offered, and the follow-up services.

The data collected covered the following categories: opportunities in nontraditional professional occupations; characteristics of women choosing traditional and nontraditional professional occupations; counseling/support services for women in math, science, and management; role models used to increase nontraditional participation; counseling services/resources for college women; counseling services aimed at changing change agents; legislative support for women  entering nontraditional occupations; participation of and support programs for women in nontraditional, nonprofessional occupations; and apprenticeship training. Positive trends were identified in several nontraditional occupational fields where female enrollments in professional training have increased during the past decade. Seen as a result of several factors rather than the result of any one programmatic effort, these increases were facilitated by legislation and efforts by states and institutions to recruit more women. Promising projects were identified that aimed at influencing educators, parents, and students to change their attitudes and behaviors. (BM)",

The findings were synthesized to identify programmatic requirements and to establish directions for national and state planning efforts. Among the findings are these: (1) language is a critical factor in planning specific career education programs for bilingual persons; (2) children of bilingual families, where two languages are critical for survival, demonstrate  distinctive, more adult, social maturity; (3) the school system loses its &quot;holding power&quot; on bilingual children during the seventh through ninth grades; (4) career-related materials in bilingual format are virtually non-existent; and (5) state and local planning of career and vocational education, bilingual education, and migrant education have not been coordinated. One of the four major recommendations suggests that bilingual career awareness materials (K-6) and bilingual career exploration materials (K-7) be developed concurrently in terms of career education concept development, languages appropriate for student and/or parents, and the environment of the bilingual family.

        "description":"The impetus for developing a model to retrain women teachers and skilled women to become teachers in traditionally male-intensive secondary vocational education has emerged from a combination of problems and issues. The most pertinent of these involve the factors of supply and demand, coupled with the need to reduce sex stereotyping and bias in employment. A retraining program should respond to the need for female teachers in male-intensive vocational programs by state and should identify where the need for such a program is greatest. The major conceptual issues that must be addressed in proposing a retraining model include the characteristics of the women for whom the program is being designed, the certification requirements of the state, job growth potential, and time required  to attain skill levels and operate the retraining model. Other factors involved in planning the model are evaluation, funding sources, and packaging the program. The two areas that consistently offer the most opportunities for employing teachers in male-intensive vocational programs in most states are trade and industrial education and industrial arts. Some aspects to consider in retraining women in these areas are program design, work experience, competency-based programs, and preservice and inservice training. Recruitment practices, selection of applicants for pilot programs counseling, and various support programs must be carefully planned to insure that the first group of women entering these positions has a positive and successful experience.

        "description":"Research studies in agriculture education conducted between 1969 and 1978 are analyzed to provide an overview of representative studies in the following areas: teacher education, instruction, curriculum, student services, recruitment and retention of teachers, disadvantaged students, program planning, evaluation studies, administration and supervision, adult education, postsecondary agricultural education, and career education in agriculture. (All studies selected relate to secondary and postsecondary vocational agriculture programs in the United States.) After research in each area is reviewed, summary comments are presented to indicate trends, patterns, and important findings in that area. Finally, overall conclusions and recommendations are presented based on the total review  of the research. Some of these conclusions are as follows: (1) even though the profession has an abundance of task analysis information and nationally prepared curriculum guides available for all specialty areas, little attempt has been made to evaluate task lists or curriculum guides using actual field observations; (2) even though there appears to be sufficient work completed in identifying the professional competencies needed by vocational agriculture teachers, the profession could benefit from coordinated inquiry into which competencies improve student learning; and (3) even though there is substantial documentation of the shortage of vocational agriculture teachers, to date there is no evidence of a recruitment program successful enough to attract the attention of the profession.

The second paper, by Dr. Mark Schulman of Antioch College, comprises one-half of this monograph and covers the problems organized labor faces with respect to career education. The content of this paper is in three parts. The first part discusses the issues regarding the relationship between career education and labor and includes theoretical, conceptual, and operational considerations; the second  part explores the short- and long-range implications of strategies to consolidate or modify labor participation in career education; and the last part offers tentative conclusions and summarizes the paper's content. The third paper, by Kenneth Hoyt, Director of the Office of Career Education, presents the views expressed by members of organized labor at a seminar dealing with the role and function of organized labor in the career education effort. His paper focuses on seven topics, some of which are the following: the kinds of career education activities in which organized labor should participate; how the K-12 school system should obtain resource persons from organized labor; organized labor representation on community career education action councils; and involving organized labor on  career education field trips.

The project developed a computer-based system to deliver and manage instructional modules, developed and field tested twenty instructional modules, and developed a procedure for evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of individual performance-based modules as delivered by a computer-based system. The project served fifteen inservice vocational education teachers and attempted to meet project objectives by (1) utilizing performance-based teacher education modules stressing individualized instruction via a computer-managed system, (2) utilizing advisement processes that will be improved by  setting aside blocks of time at each vocational education setting, (3) developing performance-based modules to limit time spent in a North Carolina A&amp;T State University classroom and increase course-content meaningfulness in meeting inservice needs of teachers in their unique setting, and (4) reducing class meetings through independent studies aided by instructional modules and on-site instructor observations. The project demonstrated that it was feasible to develop a computer-managed instructional system that can individualize instruction for students and provide activities consistent with professional course requirements.

The author examines the process by which welfare recipients move into the employed ranks and the extent to which this is accomplished through participation in employment and training programs. It is pointed out by the author that women receiving Aid for Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) fall into three groups: about 10% who are on welfare most of their working years, about 40% who fluctuate between low-income employment and welfare, and about 50% temporarily on welfare because of circumstances. A significant reported finding is that AFDC mothers with the highest  education and recent work experience leave welfare more readily than other mothers. In addition, about half of the children of welfare households move out of poverty. According to the author, people move off welfare when they find jobs to enable them to achieve a higher living standard than welfare provides. Studies reviewed by the author demonstrate that 47% of the low-income people employed may remain poor, 25% may be out of poverty most of the time, and 28% may be out of poverty about half of the time.

The game is intended to represent major aspects of employability programs and to surface a number of issues related to the organization, management, and delivery of services in employment and training programs. The constraints of the game allow participants to assume ownership for their actions during the game, thereby assisting participants to locate problem areas and to pose solutions. At the end, participants move from a simulated setting  to a better understanding of the real problems which exist within Employment and Training Programs.

Results revealed several distinct differences between handicapped and nonhandicapped dropouts in the sample. Of the characteristics of the handicapped group, three of the most distinct were failure to make the junior-to-senior-high-school transition, lack of future plans, and more positive views of the educational system.

JAN first appeared in the literature in the early 1960's as a tool for capturing the decision-making policies of individuals. After individual policies are &quot;captured,&quot; the process groups individuals into existing homogeneous groups which are heterogeneous to other existing groups. As an example of the use of JAN as an experiential tool in the learning process, adult participants in an executive development program were asked to make decisions regarding a number of applicants for positions within a large organization. The applicants' profiles contained various measures of personality, aptitude, achievement, and demographic data. After the  policies of the students were &quot;captured,&quot; students were given feedback as to which variables they were emphasizing in their decision-making process. They were also statistically grouped with other students who had similar policies, based on the JAN results. The students were then asked to compare their &quot;captured&quot; policies with the policies they perceived themselves as using and with policies of other students. The experiential exercise allows for exploration of decision policies, enhanced with personal involvement of participants. The process always generates enthusiasm and insights, and provides feedback to the students so that decisions can be monitored, evaluated, discussed, revised and re-evaluated. (Author/BN)",

Some 657 young Puerto Ricans were interviewed for this study, drawn from a pool of about 5,000 questionnaired in 1968. The major findings were that the health factors associated with drug involvement were mainly those of habit and fatigability. Other factors which could be used as descriptors of specific substance users included sensory impairment and digestive problems as well as not having psychosomatic or mobility problems. The best predictors were found in the area of: habits, especially sleeping patterns; facial appearance; sense receptors (eyes, ears); mobility and activity restrictions; heart trouble; nervousness; and  the taking of prescription medicines or pills. The highest number of associations as well as the best predictive ability was found in the marijuana and alcohol groups. The least amount of significant relations and predictors was found in the realm of heroin use. (Author)",

Computation of product moment correlation coefficients provided evidence that none of the predicted associations were supported by the data except those predicting a relationship between anticipatory socialization and high commitment, and anticipatory socialization and receptive behavior.

A program utilizing nurses to deliver grief intervention to parents losing a baby to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) was examined as an illustration of such preventive programing. This project covered the state of North Carolina and involved a sample of 154 subject families, after the infants' deaths, three home visits were conducted. Psychological goals of the visits were: (1) to reduce parents' guilt by countering inaccurate explanations for the death; (2) to encourage expression and acceptance of grief and to reassure them that this normal grieving process  would end; and (3) to provide support in coping with problems. Demographic data on the families was similar to that reported elsewhere in that younger, unmarried, and nonwhite mothers were overrepresented. Because parents of SIDS victims experience profound feelings of guilt and especially severe crisis reactions, programs relieving guilt and providing additional support to them are felt to have significant preventive potential. Data tentatively supporting the conclusion that the SIDS grief intervention program had a beneficial impact on the participants. (Author/JLL)",

In this study, subjects persevered in their perceptions of personal persuasiveness even after it was revealed that the initial success or failure upon which their impressions were based had been predetermined. Specifically, they formed perceptions of their ability to convince another student to donate blood, then learned that the &quot;persuaded&quot; person was actually responding not to the subject's arguments but to a prearranged script. But even after learning that their self-perceptions were based on false feedback, they continued to act according to them. Contrary to predictions and previous findings, however,  instructions to explicitly explain an initial outcome did not increase its subjective likelihood. This finding may be explained in terms of the &quot;sufficient&quot; conditions which normally prompt individuals to explain social events. (Author)",

Of the adolescents surveyed, 39% felt that teachers never or rarely seem to care about them. This is a crucial dimension, since teacher warmth has been shown to be relevant to achievement. The differences with respect to student characteristics were not as great as expected, considering previous research on how teacher expectations and attitudes vary. Although teachers are thought to have lower expectations for students in the lower tracks, from the students' point of view there was little difference in pressure to achieve among the various academic groupings. At the same time, it is of  some concern that the lower-achieving students did not report that teachers care about them to the same degree as the better students did. (BN)",

It is concluded that the evidence currently cannot support either the advocacy or the avoidance of one-child families. (Author)",

        "description":"Theoretical and practical implications of the proposition that teachers' differential behavior toward high and low expectation students serves a control function were tested. As predicted, initial performance expectations were found related to later perceptions of control over performance, even when the initial relationship between expectations and control was removed, while initial control was not found related to later expectations. On a practical level, the effects of teacher participation in an expectation experiment were assessed. \"Unalterable\" teachers, whose expectations were found most predicatable from the sex and I.Q. of their students, reported not being affected by experiment participation while \"alterable\" teachers did. Students of \"alterable\" teachers showed greater  relative reading gains over the school year than students of \"unalterable\" teachers. Means indicate that \"alterable\" lows closed the gap between themselves and \"alterable\" highs, and that by the end of the school year \"unalterable\" lows tended to have lesser effort-outcome covariation beliefs than \"unalterable\" highs, while students in \"alterable\" highs showed a relative gain in effort-outcome covariation belief when compared to \"unalterable\" lows.

Observer subjects (N=315) read a brief description of a first encounter between two women. During the meeting one of the women made either an intimate or a non-intimate disclosure (low vs. high initial intimacy). The other woman responded in one of five ways: with an intimate disclosure (high-return-disclosure), a non-intimate disclosure (low-return-disclosure), acknowledgement and sympathy (concern), concern-plus-high-return-disclosure, or concern-plus-low-return-disclosure. Regardless of initial intimacy, the most favorable impressions of the respondent were formed in the \"concern\" condition. When the respondent made a disclosure of her own, the interaction  predicted by the normative hypothesis was replicated.

The first experiment assessed the effects of both own and other's disclosure on a participant perceiver. After meeting a confederate partner, female undergraduate subjects (N=83) were induced to make an intimate or superficial disclosure by means of a &quot;forced compliance&quot; procedure. In return, their (videotaped) partner then disclosed on either three intimate or three superficial topics. Subjects who made intimate disclosures reported no more attraction toward the partner than did those who made superficial disclosures, but a clear effect for other's disclosure was found in the impression rating analysis. Subjects formed more favorable  impressions of the confederate when she disclosed intimately (the revealer-liking effect). Comparisons made between these data and those of the second experiment (an observer replication using the subjects' actual disclosure tapes and the manipulations from the first experiment) showed that female observer subjects predicted greater attraction on the part of participants who had made intimate disclosures than those who made superficial disclosures. Additionally, subjects also differed with the participant in their perceptions of the confederate. (Author)",

In the first, involving a small group of third- and fourth-grade children, several stories were prepared based on the assumption that the cloze procedure might be manipulated to reveal a reader's use of semantic, syntactic, and graphophonic cuing systems. As a result of this study, five specific reading/language abilities were identified: finding clues by referring back or ahead into the text, using information already known about the story line or topic (\"real world knowledge\"), using the cumulative and logical buildup of a story line or topic to make predictions, and using letter clues (replacements controlled by the remaining orthographic clues). A second study was  designed around stories that contained deletions made according to the five strategies. The subjects, 39 third-through seventh-grade students, were grouped as \"above average,\"\"average,\" and \"below average\" readers and administered a cloze procedure task. The results indicated that the above average readers' silent reading behavior was different from that of below average readers. The essential differences centered on focus, the employment of reading strategies, real world knowledge, and the ability to handle graphophonic clues. (FL)",

Following an extensive review of literature in the theoretical areas upon which reading programs are normally based--reading, language, learning, and teaching--specific characteristics within each area were identified, and a program rating instrument was constructed. This instrument was used by three teams of specialists to assess seven reading programs in classroom situations. The results indicated that the programs do not have consistent or coherent theoretical bases; what differences they do have are obscured by their internal inconsistencies and their large areas of overlap. Even though the program analyses did not yield  any significant differences, four major theoretical positions were identified that might be useful in future discussions of reading programs.

The subjects were drawn from grades 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 12, and college. Half completed a task that required them merely to encode the connectives; the other half were required to combine as well as encode them. The results revealed significant effects of task, age, session, and connective, with comprehension of different connectives developing at different rates. Children as young as second  grade encoded the connectives in consistent ways; however, it was not until fourth grade that they showed evidence of consistent combination of connectives. In general, comprehension of the conjunctive connective was the easiest, while comprehension of the conditional and biconditional connectives proved to be the most difficult.

In addition to the regular reading program, the experimental group worked during part of the class time with the MRM system. The procedures required the experimental group to read a selection of approximately 150 words from a text and peruse the selection for three words or short phrases (message units) they determined to be important to the essential message contained in the selection. The units were then used as the major  part of a sentence containing a main idea in the selection, and the contents of the main idea sentence became the basis for determining the MRM unit that appeared to be the central idea relative to the message as a whole. Comprehension gains were determined through pre- and posttest administration. No substantial differences were found favoring the experimental subjects. (TJ)",

Both groups read an article of college level difficulty; students in the structured overview group completed a prereading, teacher-guided discussion of major concepts from the article as they were depicted on the overview. Both groups completed a ten-item multiple choice test on the article immediately following the reading and again one week later. Results showed a significant difference in short-term comprehension favoring the structured  overview over the control group, and a significant difference in short-term comprehension favoring average readers over below average readers in both groups. There was no significant difference between the groups on the long-term measure. The differential effect of the overview for average and below average readers suggests that reading achievement is an important independent variable in investigations of adjunct learning aids. (TJ)",

A superior, alternative definition is that a metaphor is the use of an expression that is contextually anomalous and for which the metaphoric tension is in principle eliminable. Tension elimination can be conveniently discussed in terms of three functions that metaphors can perform: expressing things that are literally inexpressible, conveying concepts in a compact manner, and expressing ideas vividly. Results of  experiments on the comprehension of metaphors suggest that two important variables affecting the comprehension of nonliteral uses of language in general, and of metaphors in particular, are the nature of and the amount of contextual support. Finally, it might seem that there is an important difference between metaphors and similes because the apparent violation of conversational postulates, at least of the sincerity postulate, is immediately obvious in the case of the metaphor, but much less obvious for the simile.

        "description":"Reading comprehension tests usually contain reading passages followed by multiple choice questions about the passages; but one potential weakness of this format is that the questions may be &quot;passage independent,&quot; answerable without necessarily reading the passage first. When examining this phenomenon by assessing a particular test, the &quot;Stanford Test of Academic Skills,&quot; researchers administered two forms of the test to 101 tenth graders. One group (49 students) answered Form A test items without reading the passage, then read the Form B passage and answered those questions. The other group (52 students) read the Form A passage and answered its questions, then completed Form B test items without reading the Form B passage. Analysis of test scores shows that both groups achieved  significantly higher scores in passage-independent conditions than chance (normal distribution approximations) would predict. These results, coming in the midst of greater demands for tests of basic skills such as reading proficiency, raise doubts about the value of standardized reading tests as they are presently constructed.

        "description":"College undergraduates participated in a cost/benefit analysis and a speed/accuracy analysis of semantic priming in a lexical decision task. In both studies, half the cues were neutral and half were words from 30 semantic categories. Word targets were the category names, and nonword targets were derived from those names. The cue-word was valid 80% of the time and invalid 20% of the time. In the first experiment, cue time, a between groups factor, was either 200, 300, 400, 500, or 700 milliseconds (msec). It was found that valid cues produced facilitation at cue times as short as 400 msec, and invalid cues produced inhibition at cue times as short as 200 msec. The second experiment used a response-signal technique to collect information about the speed/accuracy trade-off in a  lexical decision task. Cues were always presented for 800 msec, and targets were presented for varying time periods. Results indicated that subjects are capable of trading accuracy for speed, invalid cues can lower discriminability, and response bias in an active component in priming. The two experiments indicate that discriminability, criterion bias, and response bias seem to be integrated in providing facilitation, but that simple applications of criterion bias or response bias alone do not adequately explain the facilitation effect.

Six paragraph-length stories, each of which included one or two critical sentences containing a general verb, were presented orally to the subjects. The experimental versions included an extra sentence or phrase whose meaning, when combined with the meaning of the general verb, was hypothesized to produce the meaning of a particular more specific verb. After hearing the stories, the subjects were administered a recall test containing four to eight sentences from each story, each with a missing word that the subjects were asked to fill in. The verbs of the critical sentences were always  used. Results showed that subjects in the experimental group were more likely to recall the specific verb than were control subjects, that the effect of inserting material was stronger for some pairs than for others, and that the inserted material acted specifically to shift recall from the general verb to the particular specific verb predicted.

The following procedures used for coding words are then described: determination of the proportion of each speaker's total tokens at home and at school that were internal state tokens and the proportion that occurred in each of three domains (cognitive, perceptual, and affective), the coding of the tokens for &quot;semanticity&quot; (the relation of  the word's meaning to the meaning of the utterance as a whole), and the assignation of a dictionary definition to each semantic token. Sample dialogues between children and adults are then presented to illustrate possible categories to which mental state words can be assigned. The report includes numerous tables of data on such topics as categories of internal state vocabulary, distributions of internal state tokens for individual children, and categorizations of specific internal state words used.

Following a historical review of hermeneutics from its Hellenic roots through the phase of traditional hermeneutics to the major reformulation of the field by Friedrich Schleiermacher and Wilhelm Dilthey in the nineteenth century, the paper describes contemporary phenomenological hermeneutics. It points out that in phenomenological hermeneutics meaning is fundamental, subjectivity is redefined as being-interpreted, objectivity is redefined as historicity (the ongoingness of interpretation beyond the existential possibilities of individuals), language is an active presence in the constitutive structure of meaning or existence,  understanding is an event of language, and communication is the ongoing process of interpretation within language. It then discusses Paul Ricoeur's theory of comprehension and his model that permits the isolation of major issues in any theory of interpretation; and it outlines the work of contemporary French &quot;poststructuralists.&quot; The conclusion discusses stumbling blocks to the isolation and identification of the methodological implications of hermeneutical theorizing and discusses the implications of hermeneutics for current social theorizing and communication research.

The results indicated the following: exposure to the campaign is necessary for media effects; partisan precommitment is sufficient to prevent those effects; in the absence of precommitment, those exposed to the campaign will make their decisions on the basis of its content; and in the absence of precommitment,  those who are not exposed to the campaign will vote on the basis of prior party identification.

It then discusses research into writing as a process, writing for audiences, the history of writing instruction, and the  relationship of writing to consciousness. The second section of the paper describes 25 teaching techniques that permit an open-choice, experience-based format for writing while allowing for some \"grammar interventions\" during prewriting, editing, and proofreading. Four appendixes provide sample materials; student worksheets; an outline of competency levels in grammar and usage, sentence structure, and paragraph development; and a class-composed poem generated in the process of teaching grammar.

A model of moral/cognitive development created by Lawrence Kohlberg indicates that human responses to moral choices move through as many as six stages of moral growth. Freshman composition students assigned one of Kohlberg's moral dilemma problems consistently gave responses that were between Kohlberg's stages three and four. One implication of this finding is that more accurate developmental models for teaching writing must go beyond those for remedial-level instruction to develop a model of cognitive growth in nonremedial students. Kohlberg notes a moving ahead and falling back in  moral-cognitive development which seems to be paralleled in the development of cognitive complexity and rhetorical strategies. A second implication may be that the cognitive growth of students must be initiated by putting students in writing and discussion situations that lead them toward the level of moral/cognitive development typical of those who appreciate most literature. More highly developed writing and cognition will be fostered by teaching the terminology of complicated perspectives. (Student responses to a moral dilemma problem are appended.) (TJ)",

Applying Joseph Woelfel's message-oriented linear force aggregation theory to taboos, the paper provides a theoretical rationale for five methods of taboo removal: relabeling the taboo, offering &quot;diffuser&quot; incentives, legalizing it, promoting the idea of popular approval of it, and creating a festive atmosphere around it. The paper also discusses ways in which mass media antitaboo campaigns can overcome the barriers that seem to mitigate media effects, and it concludes with a list of five  hypotheses to test the role of the media in taboo-reducing campaigns.

The student then decides which authors are closest and which are farthest from his or her \"ideal self\" and \"actual self.\" The follow-up discussion clarifies the issues involved in defining oneself (or a more detailed analysis is achieved through the use of a computer). The second exercise, the coorientation model, requires students to rank or rate story titles or leads  according to interest or probable readership for themselves and for a clearly defined audience. These ratings are then compared with hypothetical play in editing a publication or with actual survey results of audience ratings. Effective use of these two techniques involves consistent discussion and evaluation on the individual level, along with statistical analyses. (Author/MAI)",

As far back as the early 1950s, this situation attracted considerable concern, but it was not until the late 1960s that complaints were transformed into critical historiographical reflection. A review of articles that have offered critical reflections on journalism historiography indicates that only a handful of journalism historians have given serious consideration to the origins of the problems in their field; that, of those, most have failed to penetrate to the heart of the philosophical and methodological assumptions from which the difficulties have spread; and that, with only a few exceptions, journalism  historians have not utilized or developed viable alternative perspectives. To ensure the survival and growth of the field of journalism historiography, serious ongoing reflection should be given to three main problem areas: the journalism historian's field of investigation, the making of historical judgments, and the task of historical revision.

Bakke&quot; case, in which the Supreme Court ruled against rigid race quota programs such as the one that had prevented Allan Bakke, a white man, from being admitted to medical school. Each issue of the four newspapers--the New York &quot;Amsterdam News,&quot; the &quot;Los Angeles Sentinel,&quot; the &quot;Atlanta Daily World,&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Defender&quot;--was examined during the ten-month period preceding the argument of the case before the Supreme Court and during the period immediately following the June 1978 decision. Among the findings were that the coverage of the Bakke case was scarce; that after the Supreme Court ruling the &quot;Amsterdam News&quot; far exceeded other newspapers in  the amount and type of coverage, while the &quot;Sentinel&quot; and the &quot;World&quot; continued to give little attention to the case; that coverage was event-oriented rather than issue-oriented; that, while most editorials took a definite anti-Bakke stand, some took no position in the controversy; that relevant letters to the editor were almost nonexistent; and that most articles did not receive front-page or prominent coverage. The findings suggest that today's black press is a chronicler, rather than an interpreter, of issues and events affecting the black community. (GT)",

Among the findings of research on male/female speech differences are that, contrary to the stereotype, men talk more than women; men's conversation is task-oriented, while that of women is ego enhancing to others; in most speech communities women use more standard phonology and syntax than men; and women use certain female-typed words in some circumstances. Such differences are learned as linguistic aspects of a sex role and are neither genetic nor universal. Not all studies have found sex-linked language differences, and the findings of many studies reflect a comparison of women with men of presumably the same, though in  reality lower, class status, due to a methodological bias. In addition to differences in language usage, conversations between the sexes often involve interruptions of women's speech, and a lack of attention to women's conversation by men. But even if a woman exactly duplicates men's language use, she will not be evaluated in the same way, since subjective appraisals of women and men as speakers are based on an interaction between a speaker's activities and the language and sex role stereotypes known to the listener.

The editorial content of such magazines is usually in a jaunty, informal style, and typical articles are informational, investigational, or personality profiles, with a definitely local orientation. Survey respondents attributed the success of the magazines to the fact that they fill the gap between national and local media, aiming a particular editorial style at an audience that advertisers see as potentially good customers.  Readers were most often characterized by the magazines as affluent, well-educated consumers, obviously an appealing group to advertisers who are willing to pay a premium to reach such markets. With all their success, however, city magazine publishers noted several problems they must surmount, including establishing a strong local identity; building circulation; finding good editorial sources/materials; the burgeoning costs of paper, printing, personnel, and distribution; and acquiring advertising support, especially from national advertisers.

During the 16-month test period of the British and French Concorde supersonic jet flights into Dulles International Airport, a noise complaint telephone number was publicized and complaint calls were coded. Also, mass media coverage of the controversy was monitored by tabulating the number of Concorde-related statements appearing in the &quot;Washington Post,&quot; on NBC, CBS, and ABC national newscasts, and on television station WTOP, which had the highest rated local news programs. After  the tabulations were analyzed, it was found that three of the theories (direct and indirect effects, agenda setting, and reverse agenda setting) received some empirical support.

Following an overview of the literature of cognitive science, the paper offers an explication of the computational paradigm underlying the new discipline. It then refutes attacks that have been made upon the paradigm's assumption that artificial intelligence research and psychological experimentation should be mutually heuristic because they both seek a unified theory of the cognitive processes performed by any system capable of certain tasks. In an illustration of the kinds of theoretical concepts that are emerging from  cognitive science, the paper describes a recently proposed theory of story comprehension. In conclusion, the paper argues that cognitive science has important implications for communication research in the areas of content analysis methodology, the theory of messages, and the theory of communicative competence, and it outlines a proposed research project designed to illustrate those implications.

Its growth was based on a rhetorical vision that offered a plausible interpretation of the data of the senses and accounted for developments in human activity and conditions. That rhetorical vision was linked to democratic political fantasies of the worth of the individual and of rural-agrarian supremacy. It decayed from a dynamic drama of restoration of the pristine New Testament church to a rigid structure of institutionalization. Faith and imagination go together, translating spiritual truths into the fantasy world view of the culture, and while ultimate truths remain constant, the rhetorical approach must change. Liberal and conservative  Disciples lost sight of this principle and lost most of the persuasiveness enjoyed in the early days. When the vision fragmented in the conflict with cultural change and the new European theology, most of its millennial eschatology faded out. A religious rhetoric that neglects the eschatological frame of reference is not true to the biblical message nor to the needs of modern people. (TJ)",

        "description":"Values are more easily discussed than manipulated or measured. A curricular development project aimed at developing critical television viewing skills has developed a curriculum for the middle school grades. The project is based on the assumption that children can utilize certain viewing, listening, and reading skills and analytic procedures to modify source, message, and medium effects, and that these skills and procedures can be taught in the regular classroom. Among the goals of the project are to prepare young persons to identify and evaluate the values and value conflicts embedded in much of television content, and to provide experiences in value clarification, including the consideration of reasonable alternatives to the problem solutions presented in television programs.  One classroom approach is to work out descriptions of children's favorite television characters, identify the values represented by the characters, and explore values inherent in different situations. This process can help teach children value identification, value clarification, and value judgment. (TJ)",

        "description":"Public Laws 81-815 and 81-874 were enacted in 1950 to assist school districts financially burdened as a result of certain federal activities. Under Public Law 81-874, payments for maintenance and operation of local schools are authorized when local revenues are reduced by the federal acquisition of real property, when the district provides education to children who reside on federal property, or when there is a sudden increase in school attendance due to federal activities. Under Public Law 81-815 federal financial assistance is authorized for school construction in districts having substantial enrollment increases due to federal activities. In 1965 both laws were amended to include federal disaster assistance to schools. The bulk of this report is made up of tables detailing the  administration of both laws since 1951 with an emphasis on 1977. Tables for P.L. 81-874 show such data as applications submitted, appropriations, entitlements, payments, expenditures, number of children eligible for payment, and payments for transportation, custodial, and maintenance services. Tables for P.L. 81-815 show such figures as appropriations, per pupil construction costs, applications, projects approved, and numbers of classrooms provided. The last table shows federal funds reserved for disaster assistance for fiscal years 1966-77 and 1977. The data indicate substantial program growth since the laws were enacted. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Current dissatisfaction with operations of the New York City school system calls for policy proposals based on a better understanding of the system, rather than on economic issues. Any policy proposals aimed at reform must describe the goals of suggested programs and indicate how they relate to the goals of other programs. An evaluation of student performance is essential. Also important is a consideration of costs and outcomes of the proposal, the role played by the consumer, and the successful placement of students and personnel in the system. Since the New York City system is too aggregative, properly structured decentralization would be an appropriate route to take. For example, local school boards should be permitted to design their own school systems, paying particular  attention to the heterogeneity of the community. The role of the teachers' union, migration to avoid taxation, and contracting out for educational services are other factors to explore when initiating policy reform in the New York system.

The papers are based on the premise that student equity can be measured by comparing how much school districts spend. In the first paper the author presents a systematic analysis of several measures of equity and the implication of using each measure. In the second paper, the authors evaluate each state's accomplishment in equalizing student expenditures between 1970 and 1975. The data for the 1970 analysis were derived from 5,100 school districts and for 1975 from 6,100 districts. The authors conclude that overall national expenditure disparities have not decreased and may have, in fact, increased. The final paper is an evaluation of the 1973 Wisconsin school finance reform  law. The detailed paper provides insights on how a sweeping reform package can be virtually nullified because of inconsistencies inherent in the legislation. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This paper examines effects of pressure from the community and teachers' organization on interaction patterns or structures within schools, specifically on normative consensus, upward communication, and facilitative dependence. These structures help determine the extent of cooperation and support teachers receive. Questionnaire data from virtually all administrators and 253 teachers in a stratified random sample of 34 junior high and middle schools are used for a school-level correlation analysis. Community pressure generally disrupts the structures of cooperation, but at severe levels of intrusion into the school, the effect may be reversed as administrators and teachers close ranks against the community. Teacher organization pressure increases consensus among teachers but  decreases it between faculty and principal and between principal and superintendent. Such pressure reduces the receptivity of the principal to teacher ideas (in their eyes, at least), although enhancing his actual knowledge of teacher concerns. Finally, teacher organization activity at the district level makes it harder for school personnel to help one another. These findings are interpreted in the light of changes in school-environmental relations, wherein community delegation of authority to professionals is giving way to community surveillance and influence in the schools.

        "description":"This study was the second year of a project that attempted to formulate criteria for project evaluation and funding decisions. Activities were designed to produce measures of project impact for vocational education projects. The second year's work focused on refinement of impact variables, and a survey of directors of vocational education concerning their priorities for impact variables. Local education agencies (LEAs) in New York State were asked their opinions about whether the impact variables were valid and whether it would be feasible for them to collect the data required. Six project impact variables were considered the most valid. (1) Students trained have positive attitudes toward work. (2) Training increases student employment options. (3) Employers are satisfied with  graduates of the program. (4) Graduates are working in occupations for which they are trained. (5) Project objectives are fulfilled. (6) Training objectives are met in the most cost-effective manner. The LEAs queried indicated that collection of necessary data would be feasible but that they could use support with data collection in several areas. The next steps required are a review of the impact rating forms and development of additional related rating forms and the preparation of a funding and evaluation handbook for LEAs. (Author/JM)",

Concerned about evaluating children's affective growth in open classrooms, eight educators in a large metropolitan area agreed to meet regularly after school hours to develop an instrument to assess affective growth in children. The five teachers and three administrators who formed the Open Education Evaluation Group (OEEG) were drawn from five local elementary schools and shared an interest in open education. The case study of the OEEG suggests that there may be important differences between the desire of the group participants to use these strategies and their ability to use them effectively. After 15 months the OEEG, using  participatory strategies, failed to accomplish its goal. The presentation focuses on problems in four areas that appeared to have implications for the OEEG's failure: skill level, consensus decision-making, self-oriented needs, and hierarchical differentiation.

DCPS' capital improvement planning and monitoring processes were reviewed, including its policies for constructing new facilities  and replacing or modernizing existing school buildings. The need for capital improvement projects in progress or proposed for funding during fiscal years 1976 through 1981 were examined. The report, after analyzing spaces available in nearby schools, advised that the Board of Education could save about $7.7 million of capital improvement funds by canceling its plans to build a replacement school and could improve the administration of the capital improvement program through better planning for the design, construction, or modernization of school buildings.

Data, summarized by state, are presented in tables and charts containing information on the number and dollar value of bond issues voted on and passed and the number, dollar value, and net interest of bonds sold. The study revealed several general findings about bond sales nationally. Bond elections reached new lows in fiscal year 1976; only 770 issues were voted on and only 391 were approved. The dollar value ($970) of bond issues approved was  the lowest recorded since the study began in 1958. Bond sales for fiscal year 1976 increased slightly over fiscal year 1975. The average net interest cost for fiscal year 1976 was 6.25 percent, down slightly from the previous year. The monthly average net interest cost reached a new high of 7.1 percent for September 1975.

        "description":"Private education as an area of study offers many opportunities to educational researchers. Four types of research that would include private education are discussed and examples of research possibilities under each type are offered. The first type involves fundamental educational processes. Suggested are studies of the effects of various levels of funding in schools and comparing school systems maintaining complex administrative bureaucracies with those that do not. Opportunities exist in Western Canada for comparing publicly supported Catholic schools with privately supported Catholic schools. The second type of research is that aimed at understanding private schools. Studies could concentrate on the social networks developed at private schools and their long-term functions.  Another topic would be a comprehensive analysis of the legal problems of private schools, with emphasis on the special legal principles that apply to them. The third type of research would encourage more scholars to do research on private education. A carefully done analysis of major differences between public and private schools would be a starting point for many studies. The fourth type involves analyzing broad social issues. An examination of the roots of legal compulsion in education is suggested. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"Activity and interest in competency-based education are growing. As of March 1978, some type of competency-based education requirement had been instituted in 34 states. Many recent changes in American society are affecting competency-based education. For example, today's learners are likely to be lifelong learners, but their learning may be intermittent. Jobs are changing from low-skill manual labor jobs to high-skill technical positions. Needs and roles of the citizen, the consumer, and the family member are changing. Traditional high school graduation requirements are becoming obsolete. The five major characteristics of competency-based education are that it is a learner-centered philosophy, it is a policy demand, it is real-life oriented, it is flexible, and its standards are  clearly articulated. Contrary to the opinion of critics, competency-based education is not really new or revolutionary, is not an emphasis on only the measurable, and does not underestimate the complexity of individuals and of social systems. Oregon was the first state to institute competency-based education and in spite of some implementation problems, the program is beginning to be successful. Competency-based education is certainly not all of education but it is the foundation on which all other schooling must be built. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Comparing or estimating the costs of educational projects by merely using cost-per-student figures is imprecise and ignores area differences in prices. The resource approach to cost analysis begins by determining specific physical resources (such as facilities, staff, equipment, materials, and services) needed for a project. Then the cost of these resource requirements is estimated and totaled. This approach is useful for practitioners in determining the cost of implementing a project in their districts and for those desiring to compare cost information across projects and across districts. The resource approach generates two types of cost estimates--the \"project comparable cost\" (PCC) and the \"district specific cost\" (DSC). To calculate the PCC, the same standard prices are used  to calculate the costs of similar resources in all districts. To calculate the DSC, practitioners use the prices for resources in their own districts. The PCC is used in comparing the costs of projects in different areas while the DSC is used to compare or estimate the costs of projects within a district. An illustrative example of project cost estimation is provided. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The development of new instructional organizations has placed demands on school facilities that cannot be met adequately with the procedures currently used for school design. Organizational methods, for example, that stress small-group and individual work in non-age-graded settings are not accommodated easily by either of the two common forms of school structures in the United States--the closed-classroom, eggcrate design, or the large, open-pod design. To improve the design of school facilities, a recording technique has been developed for gathering information on educational activities. A floor plan of a school that shows all areas that are potentially useable for school activities is labeled and the major characteristics of the spaces including equipment are recorded. For each  activity observed, the location, duration, and equipment used are recorded, along with the type of activity and certain characteristics of the students and instructor. These data are then analyzed to yield information on instructional patterns, space and facility requirements, and student circulation. (Author)",

(1) What organizational phenomena are most powerfully linked, either directly or indirectly, to widely valued pupil outcomes? (2) What can we learn, from studies involving private schools, about the range of feasible school influence on community well-being? (3) What data sources can be developed to make at least some of the special research opportunities in private schools available to scholars? (4) What are the major impediments to the  development and perpetuation of private educational options in response to consumer demand, and what are the most promising strategies for limiting, reducing, or eliminating those impediments? (5) What are the circumstances, frequency, and range of existing relationships between public and private educational agencies? What mutual influences are exercised, with what consequences for communities as a whole? (6) How can we best advance our understanding of private schools as entities important in their own right, even apart from what we might learn about the fundamental processes that pervade all schools?

        "description":"This study presents a rationale for working with the principles of transactional analysis (TA) in the bilingual/bicultural classroom, particularly to develop the child's self-concept. The two basic premises of TA are that all human beings have a fundamental worth that is neither increased nor decreased by anything they may do or refrain from doing, and that we are responsible to a great extent for choosing our own feelings and for deciding how to act upon them. The implications of these premises for the bilingual classroom are enormous: if a child's self-concept is consistently eroded by early and continued academic failure, if the language spoken by those he loves most is treated as a second-rate idiom, and if his home culture is denigrated or ignored, the conclusions that child  comes to regarding his essential worth may not be positive ones. The objectives of applying the principles of TA to the bilingual classroom include providing a nurturing environment where &quot;positive strokes&quot; are freely given and received by all students and by the teacher; facilitating communication by teaching new communications skills; and giving students tools they can use in taking responsibility for their own actions and reactions and stopping inappropriate reactions. When these objectives are met, student self-concept is enhanced and learning can take place more readily, pleasurably, and effectively. (EJS)",

This study deals with non-native students' understanding of what they read and on how their understanding compares with that of natives. Also being tested is a method for investigating students' understanding of texts. The theory of cohesion developed by Halliday and Hasan provided the researchers with a useful tool for analyzing the target text and for generating a series of questions. These questions were asked of a small number of native and non-native readers of English. It was found that cohesive factors distinguished non-native from native readers but it was not established which of these factors was most important in the reading  process. It is suggested that collecting introspective information from non-native informants about how they answer comprehension questions could be helpful in understanding second-language reading.

The inference-based model claims that the comprehension of non-literal meanings requires more and deeper processing than the comprehension of literal meanings. The expectancy-based model rests on the presupposition that the speaker will respect Grician principles of conversation and will supply any information the hearer needs to know. The inference-based model discounts the relevance of this information in the inference process. The three experiments examined comprehension latencies for unfamiliar proverbs used both literally and figuratively after paragraphs of two lengths. In all three experiments, figurative uses of the  proverbs were understood more rapidly than literal uses, and proverbs following long paragraphs were understood more rapidly than proverbs following short paragraphs. The data supported the hypothesis that comprehension is a unitary process concerned with determining what the other speaker means, and that ease of understanding is proportionate to the amount of shared information and presuppositions. Novel, non-literal uses of language are not intrinsically more difficult to understand than literal uses. (Author/AMH)",

        "description":"The assumption that question-answer sequences consist of two moves was examined using data from recordings of second-grade classrooms in Austin, Texas. Interactions initiated by children's spontaneous questions in informal, small group settings were evaluated. Twenty-nine dialogue samples are presented and analyzed. Four issues in the study of interaction are discussed: the selection of data for analysis, the use of &quot;null set&quot; in discourse, recognition of a &quot;notable absence,&quot; and the usefulness of a two-move unit for describing events in conversation. The data indicate that answers are negotiated, and that three moves, rather than two, are required to accomplish an inquiry sequence: a question, a reply, and an evaluation. The status of a reply as answer or nonanswer is not  determined until a questioner contributes his evaluation. A replier therefore does not know how his reply fits into an on-going conversation until the questioner reacts to it. (SW)",

        "author":["Irvine, Judith T."],
        "description":"This paper considers a distinction frequently used in sociolinguistics and ethnography of speaking to describe speech events: their formality or informality. Three principle meanings of &quot;formality&quot; found in the literature concern whether the formality relates to properties of a communicative code, properties of the social setting in which a code is used, or properties of the analyst's description. Four aspects of formality that apply cross-culturally are: (1) increased structuring of speech; (2) consistency in terms of the social significance of variants chosen at different levels of communicative expression; (3) invoking of positional identities of participants; and (4) emergence of a focus in speech interactions. The role of these variables in cross-cultural comparison and a  comparison of certain speech events among the Wolof and Mursi are discussed. All societies seem to make distinctions among speech events according to the four aspects of formality. Comparisons within a society and between societies can be made according to how they connect the various aspects of formality and what concomitant effects formalizing a speech event will have. Formality, in this view, is largely a process of focusing, which can operate along various dimensions. (SW)",

        "author":["Brady, Margaret"],
        "description":"The narrative performances of Navajo children were examined to determine the ways in which the skills of competently structuring a narrative are informally learned within the peer group. Ten- and eleven-year-old Navajo children, living near Window Rock, Arizona, were evaluated in telling stories about the most traditional figures of Navajo belief, skinwalkers (the Navajo equivalents of werewolves). The stories were collected from the children as they gathered in self-selected groups within the classroom. The narratives were told in English, the first language of most of the children. For the Navajo child, a peer group is not merely a collection of friends, but of family members. Six elements in the structure of a well-formed narrative, suggested by William Labov (1972), provide  an organizational framework for the analysis. These elements are: abstract, orientation, complicating action, evaluation, result or resolution, and coda. Examples of the story-telling of specific children are cited. It is concluded that competence in ordering and structuring a narrative remains intimately connected with the interactions of a narrator's peers, for it is through peer group interaction that a child learns what is acceptable, what is exciting and involving, and what is culturally meaningful. The narrative competence in structuring the story cannot be measured simply on a scale of cognitive abilities and age-graded achievements. (SW)",

So is &quot;This is the cat that caught the rat that stole the cheese.&quot;&quot;This is the cat with white paws that caught the rat that stole the cheese&quot; is unobjectionable as well. Since a clear cutoff point cannot be specified, it is tempting to resort to the three dots. This study proposes that the argument from the lack of a clear cutoff point to infinity is a bad argument; the set of English sentences may be a fuzzy set rather than a standard set. Furthermore, it is argued that the initial question suppresses several quite distinct questions. A theory constructed to account for formal relations between sentences might warrant the positing of  infinite semantic structures. A theory constructed to account for human understanding probably would not. The common claim that infinity is necessary if there are to be novel and creative uses of language is found to be entirely without substance. (Author/AMH)",

Known as the Wessell Commission, it was created in June 1976 when the City University of New York (CUNY) was closed for lack of operating funds. Legislation permitting CUNY to reopen contained a provision for the comprehensive study of postsecondary education in the state by a temporary commission. Background information is provided on the enrollment shift, state student aid, interagency conflict, the leadership void, the city university crisis, and the state political environment. The commission was evaluated to assess the extent to which its stated objectives were accomplished and the general impact it had on state public policy for higher education.  Interviews were held with the members of both the executive and legislative staffs of the commission. The 14 commission staff members who were interviewed indicated that there had been a definite need for the commission. The final report appeared to reasonably meet most of the stated objectives of the commission, especially those dealing with the Board of Regents, allocation of resources to the private institutions, and public sector governance. In the views of the staff, the commission had very little influence upon higher educational policy. The staff responses are analyzed and seven concluding observations are presented. (SW)",

        "description":"This review of academic programming considers changes that have occurred as a reaction to real or perceived shifts in institutional and social conditions and values, program design, and program approval, review, and evaluation. Among the conditions influencing programming decisions in the late 1970s are open-access policies, affirmative-action policies, the new majorities of part-time and female students, the demand for noncredit and nontraditional educational opportunities, developments in collective bargaining, and geographic duplication of degree program. The curriculum for American undergraduates typically contains three components: general education, the major concentration, and electives. It is shown that the undergraduate career is now divided almost equally among these  three components, and that a growth in elective-taking has been at the expense of the general education component. Curricula have been redesigned to serve the increasing body of adult students, since the number of traditional-age college students has been declining. Program approval refers to a state agency's giving permission to an institution to offer a program. Program review involves analysis of an institution's existing programs, by a state agency, by the institution itself, or possibly by an accrediting group. In practice these terms often are used interchangeably. Publications and studies in various states on program review, approval, and evaluation are cited. A bibliography is included. (SW)",

A very diverse set of individuals with widely varying interests works part-time. The purposes for which they are employed vary widely as do the rules under which they work. Changing lifestyles and work attitudes demand flexible employment options. Civil service reforms recently passed or currently pending acknowledge changing attitudes toward work, and a &quot;Federal Employees Part-Time Career Employment Act of 1978&quot; requires federal agency heads and the Civil Service Commission to work toward increasing use of career part-time positions. Among the many advantages of having part-time faculty are that the  contributions of young intellectuals are not lost because of the current Ph.D. surplus, people with family responsibilities can be accommodated, and retirement can be phased in. The arguments against using part-timers include the fact that they are an inexpensive source of labor, and established faculty and their unions view this as a serious threat to their own economic security. Some other concerns that are discussed are accreditation and teaching quality. Rights to employment security, equal compensation, and access to full-time faculty bargaining units are concerns of part-time faculty. A bibliography is included. (SW)",

        "description":"Differences between freshman expectations at the University of Maryland in 1968 and 1969 were assessed using data from College and University Environment Scales (CUES). Two editions of CUES have been published. CUES I consists of 150 statements about university life that help to define the atmosphere of the institution as seen by the student. The five scales are practicality, community, awareness, propriety, and scholarship. CUES II includes four major changes: (1) the norms are based on a larger sample; (2) the items that had best discriminated between institutions were kept while others were eliminated; (3) new items were introduced in an attempt to keep pace with changing trends; and (4) two new scales were added (campus morale) and (quality of teaching/faculty-student  relationships). During the summer of 1969 CUES I was administered to 484 students and CUES II was administered to 593 students who were entering the university. Large changes were recorded from 1968 to 1969 on three of the five scales in CUES I: awareness, propriety, and scholarship. A stress on self, society, and intellectual discipline is expected to be less important by the 1969 incoming freshmen, while caution and thoughtfulness are expected to be more evident. Only on the propriety scale did the CUES II results differ from the CUES I results. It is concluded that &quot;propriety&quot; as measured by CUES II is something different from &quot;propriety&quot; as measured by CUES I. (SW)",

The 2B group tended to seek self-development and be stimulated by coursework and felt this coursework required more intensive study outside the classroom. They also tended to have higher educational aspirations, to live with  their parents, and to have less well-educated fathers. Generally, the 2B group had more positive feelings about the university, its faculty, and facilities. They tended to feel that students had more channels for expressing complaints and policy-making opportunities, were more likely to feel students who disrupt the university should be suspended, and were less likely to perceive racism at the university than the 3B group.

Participants also tended to be more against  defense spending, selective service, and the war in Vietnam. Participants tended to feel that the National Guard intensified the violence on campus, that the President should not be supported in all circumstances, and that the university should disclose more about research and should not maintain non-academic student records.

Ten different settings or events were observed. The questionnaire included items related to opinions and attitudes toward the moratorium, the Vietnam war, and the Nixon administration, and extent and type of participation. One hundred sixty-six subjects took both pre- and post-test questionnaires. The results show clear differences among settings: those settings or events that were focused specifically on  protest of a given issue showed a greater degree of expressed hostility and tension-reducing interaction, as opposed to information-oriented interaction. The results of the pre-post questionnaire indicate a general reduction in extent of participation by students in moratorium-related activities from October to November.

        "description":"In 1975 a nationwide sample of admissions offices of 110 large, primarily white universities were surveyed on their admission of black freshmen and on their admission criteria. Particular emphasis was placed on further effects of budget cuts and on admission criteria for nonblack minorities. Responses from 107 schools, showed that the national median percent of black freshmen remained at five percent, as it was in 1974, compared to six percent in 1973, five percent in 1972, four percent in 1971 and 1970, and three percent in 1969. The southern region was the only region that increased (six percent in 1975, five percent in 1974). Nonblack minority enrollments of freshmen are presented, and western schools were revealed to have the highest percentages of nonblack minorities (six  percent Asian Americans, and five percent Spanish-speaking Americans). While 24 percent of the schools reported some impact of tighter budgets in minority admissions programs in 1975, there was a rate of 40 percent in 1974. The number of schools employing open admissions has increased, as has the mean number of admissions criteria employed by the schools. The number of special programs is down, as is the number of schools employing different criteria for minority students. The arguments for considering race and sex-related variables in admissions are presented, and noncognitive variables useful in selecting cultural and racial minority students are suggested.

Study variables were liberal-conservative self-ratings of the residents, political party identification, education, age, income, sex, race, and attitudes and behavior related to campus disruptions and the war in Vietnam. Some general conclusions were reached, but there was a great range of opinion among the College Park community residents. Based on the self-selected labels of liberal and conservatives, liberals tended to see the society and university at fault, and the conservatives tended to place the fault with the  demonstrators. Younger community residents were more likely to feel that the National Guard intensified the violence and that foreign policy caused the disturbances. Older residents tended to feel that disrupters should be expelled, that the National Guard made the campus safe, and that outside agitators and spring fever caused the disruptions. A sample of 5,671 students were administered some of the same items. Students generally responded similarly to the liberal community group sample with respect to the war and to causes of the disturbances. Survey questions and response data are included. (SW)",

Letter grades and test scores were obtained for all 315 students in an introductory psychology class in the Fall of l969. Prior to the second exam, the 7l students who received grades of A or B on the first exam were randomly assigned to two groups, and 35 students in one of the groups received a letter from the instructor commending their performance and indicating expectations of similar subsequent performance. Correlations among the first three exams were computed for students  receiving A's and B's on the first exam and the group receiving C's, D's, or F's, and for those in the A and B group who did and did not receive letters. Scores on subsequent tests were more highly related to the first exam for the group of students who received A's or B's on the first test than the group which received C's, D's, or F's. The difference was not great, and interpretations must consider the limitation in range of the A and B group, which may result in lower correlations than the more heterogenous condition of the C, D, and F group. The distribution of &quot;Reinforcement&quot; letters to a sample of students who received A's or B's on the first exam had no observable effect on subsequent test performance. (SW)",

Twelve Counseling Center research staff members faked answers to the 1969 University Student Census (USC), an activities and attitude inventory administered to all undergraduates. The staff members answered the USC twice and faked two roles randomly assigned from the 12 possible permutations of the four student types: academic, collegiate, nonconformist, and vocational. The academic type is highly involved with ideas and highly identifies with the college, faculty, and administration. The collegiate type is not highly involved with ideas but highly identifies with the college. The nonconformist type is  highly involved with ideas but does not highly identify with the college, and the vocational type is not highly involved with ideas nor highly identified with the college. Students responding in a particular pattern were identified and were classified as one of the four types if they met certain criteria. The response patterns for the four subcultures were compared with the responses of the 22,544 students who had completed the census. The four types of students differed significantly with regard to their mean grade point averages and tended to differ in their choices of major and college within the university. Based on study findings, each of the four student types are described. A description of Clark and Trow's typology, statistical tables, and references are included. (SW)",

IEP procedures analyze student records, faculty effort, and annual expenditures. The particular approach taken in the analysis of the student faculty relationship has important theoretical problems, is too complex and costly, and adds little significant insight for use in university administration. The descriptive approach of IEP is based on the faculty activity report which has numerous validity problems that destroy the potential use of its major contribution: the calculation of unit costs. The complex relationships between faculty and students, which are causes of the costs, are concealed by this effort. The errors of measurement  chiefly center around the accuracy and validity of the faculty activity reports and the &quot;representativeness&quot; of data from a particular time period. Additional error results from problems such as social security matches between salary and faculty activity records, program classification structure matches between student records and faculty activity records, and the consistency across institutions of the types of operational decisions necessary in any large project. The complexity of the calculations used to produce the indices serves to compound the errors of measurement of the inputs. (SW)",

The investigation of internal factors include: reviewing institutional surveys as a source of attitudinal information concerning student, faculty, and alumni interests in satellite course offerings; and examining the geographic distribution of students, alumni and public service participants in order to delineate highly accessible sites for new campuses. External factors for  possible research include: (1) an analysis of the various market segments in the region that could potentially respond to new educational services in outlying areas; (2) an examination of potentially high accessible sites within the region based on population concentrations and transportation corridors; (3) an assessment of the economic feasibility of satellite campus development; and (4) a review of the general administrative and/or procedural problems associated with the creation of satellite sites.

Three central questions are addressed: (1) Who came and how was the ethnic composition of the university affected by open admissions? (2) To what degree did different parts of the university become ethnically integrated? (3) How did the members of different ethnic groups do? The analyses cover the first five years of open admissions and utilize four types of data. Open admissions did provide important access to the university for minority students, but more whites than minority students benefited from the policy for the years 1970-72. The distribution of minority groups at the university became more equal as a result of open admissions, but some  stratification did remain. The impact of stratification at preceding levels of the system, in high schools and elementary schools, continued to be felt. Minority students were more likely to be found in the technical-vocational curricula, but student preferences appear to be the contributing factor. Students in the open admissions program did well by comparison with national norms. Even when high school performance was controlled, relatively consistent and sometimes large differences were visible in ethnic rates of success. In the senior colleges, Jewish students were generally the most successful and Hispanic students were the least successful.

        "description":"If no radical changes occur over the next 10 years in the aggregate relationships among college-age cohort sizes, enrollment figures and ratios of doctoral faculty-to-students, the mid-l980's and mid-l900's will see precipitous, but probably temporary declines in the demand for new Ph.D. faculty. Without the implementation of policies designed to offset such cyclical fluctuations, there will be serious consequences for academic research and teaching. Several innovative policies and recommendations to insure a moderate but steady flow of young doctorate scholars into academia are detailed and their consequences in terms of faculty demography and program costs are explained. On the national level, a Junior Scholars Program that would provide limited research positions is  recommended. On the institutional level, early retirement programs introduced to fit projected changes in age structure and teaching demand are suggested. The importance of the timing of implementation for any of these programs is stressed. Statistical orojections and summaries of previous related reoorts are appended. (Author/BH)",

The summary report presents the major activities and findings of the study. The Introduction gives its history and background and outlines its scope, including the goals, organizational structure, and implementation. In Chapter 1, nontraditional education is defined, with its essential components and elements as well as its strengths and weaknesses identified. Chapter 2 presents findings on the current status of accreditation of nontraditional education, proposes changes in the process, and touches on a number of related issues such as experiential and prior learning, off-campus degrees and programs, contractual  relationships, continuing education, the meaning of degrees, relationships to state and federal agencies, and the costs of accreditation. The implications of the project's findings are presented in Chapter 3, directly addressing the roles and relationships of traditional postsecondary education, the nontraditionalist, and accreditation. Twenty-five recommendations addressed to specific audiences are made in Chapter 4. Significant findings of a national survey undertaken for the project are reported throughout. Appended are a sequential evaluation model for institutions with off-campus programs, a list of advisory committee members, a roster of participating institutions, and a report of the PECA Seminar on the COPA Project.

Discriminant analysis indicated that factor dimensions, termed Interest Value, Practical Appeal and Dullness/Apathy, best distinguished between groups of freshmen categorized as high, moderate and low interactors. High interactors were characterized by more positive ratings of their academic program on all three dimensions and by more positive ratings of their non-academic life on Interest Value than were low interactors. as measured by cumulative freshman grade point average, made little difference among the three groups. Analysis  of supplementary data also indicated that high interactors ranked faculty members significantly higher as a source of positive influence on their intellectual development and as a source of positive influence on their personal development than did low interactors. In a follow-up analysis of the same subjects conducted during the subsequent academic year, amount of informal contact with faculty was found to be significantly associated with persistence at the institution.

        "description":"The outcomes of the employment situation for science and engineering PhDs were assessed through a survey of college and university departments and faculty members who had accepted new academic jobs or who had left academic jobs for other positions within the last three years. Faculty members who had accepted their first job after receiving the doctorate were not included. A large sample of PhDs in 12 fields who were employed by the federal government and PhDs in many fields who were employed outside academe or government were also surveyed. The study analyzed the responses to an eight-page questionnaire, completed by 10,000 doctorate holders, which dealt with career outcomes, current job characteristics, personal and educational backgrounds, and career histories. Findings are  reported on three important career outcomes: salary, job satisfaction, and publication rates. Detailed multivariate analyses were conducted on the three dependent variables and the following six categories of independent variables: background factors, educational experience, present job characteristics, employment history, satisfaction with life in general and with leisure activities, and mobility. It appears that salary, publication, and relationship of job to graduate study are important determinants of job satisfaction, although publication affects satisfaction only because it relates to salary. It is concluded that academic jobs are not the only desirable jobs for science and engineering PhDs, and that the decline in academic jobs does not warrant cutbacks in science and engineering.  Maintenance of PhD production need not result in less satisfying or less productive jobs. (SW)",

One entire class of 1,548 students of a large municipal college was followed from college entry in 1967 through entry into postgraduate and occupational training. Data were taken from tests, questionnaires, and academic records of the entire student group, and from an intensive battery of tests administered to 100 students from the original group. The various cognitive styles (field-dependent or field-independent) and their relation to choice of major and academic careers as well as postgraduate careers are described. The objectives of the study include: (1) examination of the influence of cognitive styles on academic  progress; (2) examination of the influence of patterns of students' standing in the various cognitive styles on postgraduate study; (3) determination of the degree to which academic choices at the high school level are predictive of academic functioning in college and graduate school; (4) study of the effect upon various aspects of college evolution of a marked discrepancy in the level of functioning to determine the sources of cognitive style development; (5) examination of the role of cognitive styles in the verbal functioning of students who appear no different in standard tests of verbal ability.

Various forms of the bill and the benefits received from them since 1944 are discussed with specific attention to the post-Vietnam era. Comparisons are provided between the income levels, educational levels, and employment levels of veterans and nonveterans. It is concluded that the participation rate for black  veterans exceeds that of white veterans and that veterans have higher employment rates and educational levels than nonveterans. The GI Bill influences the educational community because it increases the number of students and increases the flow of federal money to educational institutions. Figures for veteran enrollment by type of institution, and revenue from GI Bill students by type of institution are projected for fiscal years 1978 through 1983. Comparison of the GI Bill with other federal student grant programs are also included. The pros and cons concerning benefit levels, the time limit on receiving benefits, and benefits for flight and correspondence school are presented. (BH)",

Chapter 1 explains the origin, purpose, and provisions of the program. Chapter 2 provides an overview of the study, including both the data collection and analysis plans. In Chapter 3 focus is on institutional organization for NDSL (such as centralization and specific functions, billing and collection, data processing, and staff training), and Chapter 4 deals with NDSL recipient selection and packaging patterns. Institutional perceptions of problems (in selection and administration) in the award of NDSL funds are explored in Chapter 5 and the exit interview (with  graduates and dropouts) is described in Chapter 6. NDSL billing and collection procedures (administrative options, teacher cancellation provisions, educational deferments, collection agencies, administrative actions against defaulters, and write-off preferences) are reviewed in Chapter 7. Chapter 8 deals with such billing and collection problems as administration of cancellation, deferment, and truth-in-lending provisions; preparing fiscal operations reports; and maintaining contact with borrowers. Relationships between administrative practices and annual institutional NDSL default rates are examined in Chapter 9. (BD)",

Changes in the rate at which nontenured faculty are granted tenure is one such adjustment. A logit model that explains time to tenure as dependent on the time since an individual received his Ph.D. and market conditions is estimated using data from two large surveys of faculty. Estimated time to tenure is then related to other possible measures of excess demand or supply. It is found that the smaller the increase in starting salary, controlling for salary level, the lower is time to tenure. (Author)",

SREB has encouraged long-range statewide planning and has brought together legislators, governors, educators, and other public leaders seeking and finding directions for the future of colleges and universities. In the early sixties SREB encouraged that the region assess its needs and objectives by national standards of quality and opportunity, and not by sectional benchmarks; following this advice may have been the most important single factor in the region's educational progress. In 1976 SREB identified the critical concerns demanding regional attention in the future. In the  South, where there is not the enormous private endowment support of some other regions, the alliance of higher education and government has been important. The following issues are addressed: expanding educational opportunities at the college level, the mutual responsibilities of government and higher education in solving societal problems, academic freedom, competencies of college graduates, public school competency testing, educational finance, counterproductive controversies involving trends toward larger government and increasing checks and balances, and faculty collective bargaining. A list of nine priorities for postsecondary education in the South, issued by SREB in 1976, is included. (SW)",

Currently, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare focuses on aid to primary and secondary levels, and the National Endowment for the Humanities has not developed programs to support professional training in a specific form or arts education of the artist. In the fall of 1978, the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) began to consider educational institutions as eligible for Challenge Grants, a development that points to certain basic issues about the importance of the arts experience for students at colleges and universities. Recommendations of a task force of NEA are cited, including the suggestion that grants be made available for needy students to pay for advanced arts study. Data  are presented on postsecondary enrollments in the fine arts and employment opportunities after graduation. Several views on the relationship of the artist to academe, some innovative curricular developments in the arts, and examples of the collaboration of art and science are discussed. Information on performing arts programs provide some indication of the support higher education gives to the arts. The data reveal that the performing arts do not pay their own way. The fact that institutions are willing to support such programs is one indicator of the importance such programs play for the institutions. (SW)",

As a result of developments, such as changes in the mandatory retirement age and the limited growth of universities, assessing the nature and extent of changes in personnel characteristics, and determining the impacts of various personnel decisions upon these characteristics is important. A method is presented that provides insights into changing personnel characteristics and of the effectiveness of various changes in personnel policies. The method utilizes a Markov model of faculty flows and requires a minimum of two years of time series data concerning  faculty age and tenure status. The impacts of six policies on the tenure status, salary, and age distribution of full-time faculty members at a large land grant university were analyzed. The policies are: (1) continuation of current hiring and retirement practices; (2) hiring only nontenured faculty; (3) hiring only assistant professors and instructors for the tenure track; (4) hiring only nontenured assistant professors and instructors for the tenure track; (5) mandatory retirement age extended to 70; and (6) mandatory retirement age at 65. The report demonstrates how these policies are modeled and discusses the various results. (JMD)",

        "description":"The Veterans Administration (VA) loan program was reviewed by the General Accounting Office (GAO) to determine if it was meeting its primary objectives as stated in the legislative history. The program is mandated to provide an additional source of financial aid to students attending high-tuition institutions who would otherwise be financially unable to attend. The program was not meeting congressional intent in that about 72 percent of the loans made were to veterans attending schools charging low tuition or none at all. VA also has no assurance that the loans were based on demonstrated financial need. According to VA data, as of December 31, 1977, 44 percent of all matured loans were in default. The rate may have been as high as 55 percent if GAO findings in nine VA regions  were representative of the entire country. VA's central office was not aware of the extent of this problem because it was not collecting all of the data necessary to compute the default rate properly. Recommendations are offered to the Administrator of Veterans Affairs. (Author/SW)",

The first addresses the definition of quality in administration, and concludes that a high quality institution is one whose management system keeps track of the intellectual and personal development of its students. In the second paper, seven basic principles are suggested for use in the identification and evaluation of outcomes in a particular college or university's undergraduate education. The third paper outlines and discusses several themes emerging during the conference: assumptions about  outcomes, quantitative measurement of education, evaluation by outcomes, the use of self-study and team review, the use of accreditation, and the validity of outcomes assessments.

        "description":"The question of evaluating effective teaching in light of the fact that teaching is still the principal function of the university is addressed. Most faculty receive very little specific training in teaching, even though the skills involved are complex and sophisticated. There is a dual responsibility for evaluation of teaching by faculty and administration, a type of collaboration that corresponds to the way most contemporary Canadian universities are governed. The main responsibility of the administration should be to provide a climate within which effective teaching and learning can occur. A teaching resource center, sabbatical leaves, and research and development grants for faculty are examples of encouragement or rewards provided to teachers for initiatives they may take.  Faculty should not be constrained from practicing new approaches in their teaching. Teachers should provide information about their teaching performance that could be used for evaluation purposes. A teaching dossier might contain summaries of student course evaluations, comments by colleagues on the quality of the material presented in class, descriptions of innovative teaching and learning techniques, and evidence of some gain in knowledge or experience on the part of students. It is suggested that teachers should claim credit for good teaching in the same way as they would take the responsibility to document scholarly endeavors and administrative work. The involvement or concerns of students and the community in the evaluation of teaching performance is also discussed. (SW)",

It is believed that the Catholic community must be educated in the tradition of Catholic social thought, and a learning environment must be created that reflects a commitment to justice and an openness on the part of Catholics to change personal attitudes and behavior. After a foreward on education and justice by Alice Gallin, the following four perspectives are presented: &quot;Education for Social Justice--A Christian Perspective,&quot; by William J. Byron; &quot;Justice and Peace: The Place and the Potential of Colleges and Universities,&quot; by J. Bryan Hehir; &quot;Education in a Global Perspective,&quot; by Lawrence T. Murphy;  and &quot;Justice--What Is It All About?&quot; by David Burell. Seven institutions were chosen as pilot schools to implement the proposal, and two of the pilot programs are described. Ray Jackson and Dan Regan describe the program at Villanova University and Ken Jamieson describes the program at the University of Notre Dame. Short descriptions are also provided of each of the seven pilot schools. Descriptions of programs at other schools are as follows: Joseph Fahey discusses the model at Manhattan College; Suzanne DeBenedittis discusses the Loyola-Marymount University program; Don Post describes the global studies program at Saint Edward's University; and Joseph Fahey describes the M.A. program in religious studies at Sacred Heart University.

        "description":"The need to effectively evaluate teaching performance of university faculty and a suggested approach involving a teaching dossier are discussed. Administrative decisions about the careers of faculty members have tended to be based on publication records rather than teaching evaluation. It is suggested that the curriculum vitae of a faculty member should provide more substantial information about teaching than a mere listing of courses. Teaching accomplishments should be described in terms of the following areas: the agreement that may exist between the instructor and his chairman or dean concerning teaching responsibilities or criteria for success, a statement of formal teaching duties, the supervision of graduate or honors students, and informal teaching activities. A summary  statement of data from student ratings of recently-taught courses could be provided as evidence of teaching effectiveness. Real change in student abilities or performance, statements of alumni concerning the quality of instruction, and comments from colleagues teaching the same students in subsequent courses are some of the indicators a teacher can use in the dossier. Some indirect indicators of teaching performance or effectiveness are participation in curriculum development, authoring instructional materials, and conducting research on teaching and learning within the discipline. While there will be resistance to the notion of the teacher dossier, the fact that it provides only a brief addition to the existing curriculum vitae may encourage its use. (SW)",

Centers in North America, Europe, and Australia can be classified as reflecting broad trends or models. The \"clinical/psychotherapeutic\" approach offers a consultative service to faculty for advice and assistance with teaching problems. The \"research institute\" approach acts primarily as a center for empirical investigations of the teaching-learning process. The \"consultant/facilitator\" approach provides consultation on a wide variety of issues related to teaching and  learning and provides general workshops. The \"general service center\" provides all the services of the other approaches, including research and consultation for individual faculty. Some general problems and concerns of instructional development activities are academic freedom, the kinds of research conducted, social change and personal development educational objectives, and the danger of token efforts. When feedback to faculty members is provided by colleagues or administrative superiors, some faculty feel that the traditional right to teach without interference is endangered. Research conducted through instructional development centers needs to be relevant to the teaching process of the particular university. (SW)",

The life phase includes theories that identify age-linked periods of stability and transition throughout adulthood. The development stage refers to structural dimensions of intellect, character, and personality organization. Learning style includes research on individuals' characteristic predilections and preferences for certain functional modes of learning over others, both cognitively and behaviorally. For each area, the parameters of the construct are defined, key concepts are identified, major representative theories are reviewed, and the implications of the viewpoint for  adult education are discussed. A large proportion of the text deals with the domain of the developmental stage. Implications for educational practice are analyzed on three levels: individual uses, institutional uses, and societal uses. A major premise of the paper is the idea that adults develop, and that educational programs and opportunities, and some of the resources of society, ought to be organized in ways that are responsive to adults' developmental needs.

A second focus of the analysis is the flow of transfer students from community colleges to the university and the state university. The analysis is limited to trends in the flow of students and to the relationship between that flow and the proximity of a university or state university campus. The flow of state student aid funds to students residing in the various counties in 1977 was also assessed. No decline was found in the college-going rate of recent high school graduates; the rate of attendance in California schools for those aged 19 and under is about 60 percent.  Proximity to a campus of the University of California or the California State University and Colleges appears to be a significant determiner of whether a high school graduate will enroll at one of these campuses. Proximity to a four-year college campus appears to be an important factor in community college student transfer particularly in the state university system. Study findings and information about California colleges and universities are included in the appendices. (SW)",

Much that is being offered through courses and services by postsecondary educational institutions is also being provided through BIGM training activities, and there are areas of cooperation between BIGM and schools. BIGM commitment to educational activity on the national level is reflected in an average annual expenditure of over $160 per employee, and in the development of educational facilities by over one-half of the nation's large companies. The focus of educational programming offered by BIGM concern the following broad categories: management education; interpersonal relations education; supervisory skills education and  training; specific skills training, including business machines; organizational development education, including management by objectives; orientation education to an industry, culture, or location; and personal development education that is not directly job-related. The current educational climate, which includes external degree programs and field work, appears congenial to the exploration of more direct ties between BIGM and postsecondary education. A data base that describes the educational objectives and amount of training activity offered by BIGM in California is needed. (SW)",

A 51-item questionnaire was designed to reflect public feeling about several areas of postsecondary education, including finance; governance; faculty; teaching, research, and service functions; and admissions and enrollment practices. Demographic data about the respondents were also collected. The sample of 1,259 adults, ages 16 and over, was representative of 82.4 percent of Alabama's total population in that age range; 655 completed questionnaires were analyzed. Respondents expressed a very favorable opinion of higher education in the state, believed higher education is important for themselves and their children, and the majority stated a  willingness to pay more taxes to improve the quality of education in Alabama. More than 46 percent of the public are unsure about how well colleges and universities use the money they receive from the state. An overview of related literature, a description of the survey procedure, a sample questionnaire, and the implications of the findings for higher education in the state are presented. (SW)",

Many programs provide tutorial services to help the student meet the demands of coursework and to increase basic skills of reading, writing, and mathematics. It is usually thought that acquisition of sufficient basic skills will enable students to compete successfully in the classroom. Federal regulations and requirements are vague in suggesting any methodology by which program goals may be achieved. There is a higher rate of attrition in school among low income and minority students compared to middle and upper income students. Innovative  programs and methodologies are needed to teach formal operational thinking processes. The student needs to be able to use a wide variety of symbols and understand abstract relationships. The fields of behavioral and educational psychology should be studied to determine effective methodologies for teaching critical thinking. (SW)",

        "description":"The factors affecting the admission and enrollment of minority students at the 12 state universities in Ohio were studied through campus visits, questionnaire administration, and correlation and multiple regression analysis of the findings. Summaries are presented on minority recruitment and retention efforts at each university for the following offices: admissions, financial aid, affirmative action, minority affairs, student affairs, academic affairs, social and cultural activities, black/ethnic studies, and black/ethnic cultural centers. Predictor variables that were isolated for analysis were: cost, federal financial aid, distance from a cultural center, strength of black studies programs and black cultural centers, and strength of minority and special service programs.  Figures were obtained for full-time, main-campus, entering undergraduate freshmen for each fall session from 1973 to 1976. The statistical analysis suggests that the major factors affecting minority student enrollment are geographic location and the strength of the tutoring, counseling, and social, academic, and cultural programming services available to minority students. Two other factors deserving attention by administrators are the availability of financial aid and the need for more minority group members in faculty, staff, and administrative positions. (SW)",

        "description":"An overview of current literature about alternatives and variations to existing concepts of tenure of faculty is presented. Tenure continues the appointment of faculty until retirement unless there is dismissal for adequate cause or unavoidable termination because of financial exigency or change of institutional program. Academic freedom is assured through procedures providing for academic due process in the case of dismissal for cause and economic security is provided by the expectation of continued employment. A combination of demographic changes, judicial decisions, shifts in the college curriculum, and financial restraint in allocation of resources for higher education suggest that this traditional understanding of tenure systems in higher education may change. In future  periods of declining enrollments and financial restraint, more tenured faculty will be terminated, with tenure providing small measure of job security. Two major alternatives to tenure are contract systems and modifications combined with traditional tenure systems. There are numerous variations of contracts that replace tenure, but no major university has yet adopted any form of a contract system. Modifications include extension of the probationary period, establishing periodic evaluation of tenured faculty, establishing a nontenure track, and extensive use of part-time faculty appointments. Some major studies that document the concept and process of tenure in American higher education are cited. (SW)",

This study also attempted to determine the direction, degree, and possible correlates of this modification. The Biology Attitude Scale was administered at the beginning and conclusion of two non-biology majors courses and three biology majors courses. Biology majors had significantly more positive entering attitudes toward biology than did the non-biology majors; however, all groups except the biology honors-section had decreased in positive attitudes by the end of the term. Although the decrease was not statistically significant, it was sufficient to result in statistically  indistinguishable leaving-attitudes as evaluated by analysis of covariance. This study also demonstrated that the students' attitudes toward biology are only minimally related to such well-defined ideographic characteristics as gender and age. (Author)",

Special features of the methodology include an STI user view which emphasizes a market-centered approach based upon the wants and predilections of the real-world users, as opposed to the technology centered viewpoint which attempts to push user acceptance and usage of available technologies; a design perspective rather than a science research perspective; and field studies employing interventions which are  measured longitudinally in two different organizational contexts. The four interventions studied include the hiring of a &quot;high communicator&quot;--the individual who tends the gates of technical information flow within an organization; the rearrangement of offices and people within a department; the resignation of a &quot;high communicator&quot;; and the progress of individual projects through time. Findings suggest a need for a close look at the &quot;high communicator&quot; concept to account for the professionals' individual differences in function and style, as well as differences encountered over time. The self time study method is suggested as one fruitful means of providing some measurement of process which is necessary to further understand the phenomena. (Author/MBR)",

The L.I.F.E. collection of instructional materials includes toys, games, puzzles, books, magazines, records, multimedia kits, films, and conventional print materials for the mildly to profoundly retarded as well as a resource collection for parents, teachers, advocates, and the general public. Specific programs include films and discussion groups for parents, story hours, films, dramatics, hobby clubs, and holiday events for retarded patrons, and special programs for children and young adults which attempt to foster understanding of their retarded peers. As a result of the experiences  in the planning and operation of these programs, suggestions for the development of similar programs are presented along with media selection criteria and a listing of resource agencies and specific instructional materials.

The steps required in gaining acceptance of the idea, planning, designing, installing, and perfecting each system are included. The Population Council library, whose clerical staff was formerly responsible for manually routing periodicals to library staff, designed a program where the computer actually printed three types of routing slips, matching the existing system. Journals were routed in three ways: (1) to a particular staff member for a check of contents for possible abstracting for the Population Council's monthly publication; (2) contents' pages of journals to a large number of staff for check to see if any wanted to see the entire issue; and (3)  the journal itself to all those interested in seeing every issue, regardless of content. The Rockefeller Foundation Library's system has the capability of producing on-demand lists of titles received, in alphabetical order, by subject, with holdings; lists of titles received arranged by the individual who saw them; and lists of titles needing renewal in the upcoming month.

Basic questions posed by the study are: Do the same pressures exist for the whole user population? Are the most significant variables affecting booktheft internal or external to the library, or both? If both, how do these variables interact? The theoretical framework of the research isolates five major factors possibly contributing to a high rate of booktheft: the library, academic pressure, individual personality, social and psychological pressures, and general criminal framework of theft. This report discusses (1) the development of a  questionnaire to explore library users' booktheft attitudes and to obtain background information about library users and the sub-population of book thieves; (2) questionnaire distribution at two comparable academic libraries before and after one installed an electronic booktheft detection device; (3) comparison of library inventory figures before and after that installation; (4) statistical manipulation of survey information; and (5) analysis of results.

This paper discusses this concept and the implementation of the system, including the presentation of lessons, recording activities, designing a lesson, evaluation, distribution of data, and management. While experience with large numbers of students and course authors is not yet available, the system is functioning technically in accordance with expectations at this  time. It is expected that it will be used more extensively by lecturers and students at the university in the future, and that extensions in the form of a compiler for the TUTOR subset and the CAISCO interpreter for a microcomputer system will make it possible to test the changeability and flexibility of this modular system.

        "author":["Elliott, William"],
        "description":"Since little attention has been given to defining a role for industry in the professional development of educators, the need exists for an administrative structure that facilitates jointly-sponsored in-service education with planning to identify participants, determine individual objectives and work stations, to supervise work experience, and to arrange for academic credit. One example of a strategy used to bridge the communication gap that often exists between education and industry is a series of seminars called &quot;Economics in the Classroom,&quot; which was part of a teacher professional development model that combined the resources of public schools, business/industry, organized labor, state/local community organizations, teacher organizations, and local colleges/universities. The  successful formula used for the design and implementation of these seminars could serve as a model for structuring professional development programs for vocational teachers. The key element seems to be the responsibilities of the groups comprising the steering committee. Also central to the success of a collaborative relationship is the involvement and initiative of the local plant manager. Staff development is necessary for vocational educators to continue to improve their performance and keep up-to-date in their fields. The private sector should play a direct role in the design of the program, hosting some of the conferences, providing instructional personnel and facilities, and assisting in the evaluation of the training.

In section I, the author presents his own understanding of power (position power and individual power) and provides a theoretical framework for the actions described in section II. (This theoretical framework includes two basic elements which are needed in working with the power structure: knowledge of self and an understanding of the continual friction between old and new in every society or organization.) In section II, the author describes the process of forming a collaboration with the help of the power structure. The first step described in the process is thinking, a step which  requires careful examination of thoughts and the strengthening of convictions. The second step described is to discuss these convictions with peers and trusted associates before presenting these beliefs to strangers. Finally, the author lists twelve guidelines to assist the educator in successfully involving outside groups in education. (BM)",

        "description":"One of the major developments in the effort to link the workplace and education has been the formation of community-based councils, primarily industry-education councils and work-education councils. These councils have generally focused their efforts on easing the transition of youth from education to work. They have also been organized to assist educational institutions in career education, staff/curriculum development, career guidance, occupational information, school-based job placement, and student work experience. Vocational education can benefit significantly from the experience gained in education/work by the variety of community-wide advisory councils cited previously. Industry-education councils and other community-wide advisory mechanisms offer vocational educators the  type of linkage to the workplace that can lead to effective programmatic change consistent with employer expectations. There are four areas which should be considered in discussing professional development of vocational educators within the context of the industry-education cooperation movement and community-wide collaborative councils: (1) an assessment of the major changes in the marketplace as a requirement for occupational planning; (2) an examination of economic policies and the problem of the unskilled and underemployed; (3) an analysis of two major community support systems to the education/work effort; and (4) suggested council-vocational education initiatives in professional development.

It also meant the establishment of a model interinstitutional network for referrals, recruitment, programs, and services among the five cooperating institutions. The advantages of belonging to RCEWP are efficient dissemination of information in useful form; efficient sharing of material resources, increased contact among members, and awareness of other educators' ideas and of community resources; encouragement for professional growth; support and strategies for encouraging institutional  change; efficient provision of community services; and a synergistic effect on the services available to adults. The program activities of the network focused on the professional development of educators and services for the community and students. Professional development activities included training seminars, programs and conferences on varied topics, such as program planning, assertiveness training, public speaking, and math anxieties. Community and student services included a women's day on campus, &quot;Women at Work&quot; (a workshop), &quot;Job Rights for Working Women&quot; (a panel), and &quot;Tell-A-Woman&quot; (a monthly newsletter).

Procedures were divided into three parts: a review of relevant existing published data and, to the extent possible, ongoing studies; a survey of a national sample of private organizations providing corrections-related direct client services; and on-site field investigations of programs in several different urban settings. The major findings include the following: (1) laws authorizing community supervision of convicted persons and contracting with private organizations for correctional services have provided the states in the study with broad authority necessary for these programs; (2) there is a major  shortage of information about referrals of defendants and convicted persons to community based programs; (3) there are organizations specializing in services to persons released from prison, persons referred by criminal court for narcotics addiction treatment, or other services to public offenders; however, a major proportion of direct client services to persons convicted of offenses lie outside this set of specialized programs; (4) cost figures are difficult to interpret because of the ambiguity of valuing services rendered; (5) accountability is most often in terms of process (number of clients admitted, average daily census) rather than in terms of client performance (number completing various stages; ratio of graduates to dropouts). (Implications of findings are discussed in terms of  the need for referral sources and service vendors to develop jointly planned monitoring and accountability procedures, the need to determine the number of clients of specified types, and the need to determine the logic of decision making in referring clients to community based programs.)

The project focused on grades K-4 and emphasized helping the students develop an awareness of self, an awareness of others, and an awareness of careers. Two needs assessment instruments (appended to this report) were developed; one surveyed parents and the other surveyed the students. Various training and inservice sessions for the staff were conducted throughout the year. The following publications were developed: a career education handbook for schools who serve American Indian children; a career education notebook for the parents and teachers; a programmed-experiential text concerning American Indian values; a series of  teacher-developed learning modules; a programmed reader which utilizes a bilingual approach; a local directory of employment opportunities; and a directory of career opportunities in the Armed Forces. To make the program more responsive to the Marty area and maintain close contacts with the school, a bilingual specialist was employed. To carry out evaluation activities, the staff developed three levels (K-3, 4-6, 7-12) of the &quot;Indian Attitude Survey&quot; (instruments appended), which was designed to measure positive changes in attitude of the Indian child towards himself and his relation to others. An experimental-control group pre-post-test design was planned. The pre-test was given in December of 1975 before any career education materials were utilized at Marty. The post-testing is expected  to take place in the spring of 1977 and again in 1978. (BM)",

        "description":"The purpose of this project was to improve the quality and demonstrate the most effective methods and techniques of career education in four high schools in the state of New Hampshire. The focus was to effect change at two points: the first was the academic curriculum, where committees in each of the project schools reviewed their existing curriculum in relation to needs assessment results and created means of integrating career education decision-making skills into their existing programs; the second was a review of existing guidance programs and community linkages where, utilizing the same needs assessment results, plans were created for providing a more systematic guidance program at each school and for expanding existing community/school relationships. The process evaluation  yielded the following three findings: (1) those schools where open communication among all staff levels was the greatest adapted to the system easier than schools with more rigid hierarchies; (2) the committees in all four schools went through an extensive period of establishing consensus of what career education means to them; and (3) the participating staff members at all four schools had difficulty seeing the various tasks as part of a total system. In summary, it was found that a systematic participatory change model did affect changes in each of the schools involved and that these changes would have lasting effect due to the investment created through participation in the process.

        "description":"A third-party evaluation was conducted to assess the accomplishments of a project designed to improve the quality and demonstrate the most effective methods/techniques of career education in four New Hampshire high schools. Accomplishments were assessed in the following areas: development of a staging model; curriculum infusion; school-community interflow; and learner outcome objectives. Several accomplishments were noted regarding the development of a staging model and curriculum infusion. It was concluded that attempts to increase the school-community interflow through structural change in the schools' basic operations was not consistently treated as a priority product objective. Since the project did not generate data needed for statistical analysis, the assessment of learner  outcome objectives was based on the evaluator's observations at each site. These observations led to the following general conclusions: community representatives were involved in needs assessment at some sites but seldom involved in working committees; teachers at all sites were involved in curriculum infusion activities; counseling departments at three sites developed systems to monitor developmental activities and address neglected areas but they did not appear to initiate training for teachers and administrators; and administrators and policy makers at some sites increased their responsiveness to the group and articulation to the community, but they were seldom involved in working groups and have not yet installed structural changes.

        "description":"The major objective of the South Dakota Career Education Project was to provide a program of in-service education and curriculum enrichment for the staffs and students of ten demonstration school systems. An external evaluation of the project was conducted based primarily on personal interviews and the perusal of materials developed as a part of the project. The project, as portrayed through the interviews, revealed a great deal of activity without much direction. There were numerous discrepancies with the project proposal which may be attributed to its beginning in mid-year of a one-year proposal. Most emphasis was given to the preparation of units, while relatively little emphasis was given to the preparation of career education programs or the establishment of career education  priorities in the schools. Guidelines were formulated for the development of units, but no procedures were devised for assessing the units. In general, the assignment, coordination, and supervision of project staff and evaluation procedures seemed less than adequate. Two major recommendations were made: project management must be strengthened and project direction must be clarified. Two significant assets were indicated: a valuable collection of career education materials were purchased/obtained, and a very cordial working relationship existed among most of the participant schools and colleges. (A companion document presents the project performance report and an annotated bibliography of curriculum materials.) (BM)",

Five major program goals are identified as basic to the student's understanding of the impact of food selection and preparation upon society and the environment: (1) the interrelations among food supply, social and environmental conditions, and world nutrition; (2) the basic nutrients and food sources for individual and family needs; (3) the skills of food preparation, serving, and food management; (4) consumer skills related to purchasing food; and (5) opportunities and qualifications for employment in food service occupations. To achieve these five program goals, the guide offers sixteen  course goals for which it provides over 275 learning activities. It is suggested that as teachers select appropriate learning experiences for their grade levels, they should refer to the resources section for the references whose numbers are indicated next to the experiences. The resources section lists the titles of and sources for books and articles, pamphlets, kits and games, magazines, and audiovisual materials. Besides class discussions, the activities include guest speakers, displays, field trips, audiovisual aids, experiments, educational games, interviews, surveys, and reading materials. To evaluate student proficiencies, both paper-and-pencil tests and nontest means (such as observation, conferences, and report forms) are suggested. (ELG)",

The conference participants included eight representatives of Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) prime sponsors and nine educators, all of whom were involved in implementing YEDPA during its first year of operation. First, the historical antecedents of YEDPA are traced based primarily on an earlier monograph by G. L. Mangum, &quot;Career Education and the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act.&quot; Next, an overview of YEDPA is presented focusing on the three major subparts: Youth Incentive Entitlement Projects (YIEP); Youth Community Conservation and  Improvement Projects (YCCIP); and Youth Employment Training Program (YETP). A summary of the discussions in the mini-conferences is presented under six topical areas: (1) primary concerns of CETA and/or YEDPA prime sponsors; (2) descriptions of current YIEP and YETP efforts; (3) problems encountered with early YETP efforts; (4) examples of ways in which YETP programs are supplementing educational opportunities; (5) recommendations of participants for increasing the effectiveness of YEDPA; and (6) philosophical issues to be resolved in local education agency/prime sponsor agreements.

For three weeks newspapers, television, and radio devoted time and space to the campaign which focused on one of the following topics each week: the need for planning in career development; career development; career education as a means for mid-life career changes; and career education's role in reducing sex and ethnic stereotyping and the resulting discrimination. Following the campaign, a study (which is attached to this report) was conducted to determine its effectiveness. A total of 1410 telephone interviews were completed, including 203 middle and high school students, 248 employers, and 959 members of the general public (i.e., individuals who  were neither students or employers). Analysis of their responses showed that (1) only twenty-one percent of the total sample was aware of career education, and the majority of these respondents said their knowledge resulted from reading the newspapers; (2) most people were able to define career education correctly; (3) while most students expressed an interest in finding out more about career education programs, the majority of employers and general public were not interested; and (4) of those who were aware of the campaign, a disappointingly low number (fifteen percent) recalled the announcement of where to write for additional information.

The expected outcome of the exercises is that the child will ask himself one or more questions; for example, he may ask, &quot;What do I like?&quot;; &quot;What do I want?&quot;; and/or &quot;When do I not have a choice?&quot; Lesson plans are coded according to grade level of the activity, the objective it meets, and the activity itself. Several first grade lesson titles are &quot;If I Had a Million,&quot;&quot;Things I Like,&quot; and &quot;Kerchiefs&quot;;  several fifth grade lesson titles are &quot;Sports,&quot;&quot;Music,&quot; and &quot;Money.&quot; Objectives and procedures are included for each lesson. Some lessons employ materials (such as cartoons, etc.), and some use playlets or stories.

The sample included 1,062 nontraditional, 1,006 mixed, and 1,002 traditional women from 156 AVTSs in thirty-six states. Educational personnel named by the nontraditional women as influential were also surveyed. It was found that mothers are the single most influential person to all  women; students perceive career education as the most influential counseling technique; and interest, not earnings, is the major reason for selecting a nontraditional training program. The largest single problem nontraditional students face is that of men adjusting to them in the classroom. One recommendation was that some traditional career counseling techniques (for example, individual testing) should be re-examined in light of the findings.

In reviewing the extent of current knowledge, its scope is found to be limited to three general areas: the role is known of background factors, ability, school performance, and the influence of teachers, family, and friends on the age (or grade level) at which young men make the transition from school to work; people are influenced by their personalities to aspire to certain types of occupations; and young people find jobs primarily through the assistance of acquaintances and relatives but prefer direct application without the intervention of a third party.  Routes for further investigation are suggested as follow: (1) age/SES [socio-economic status]/race/education-specific distributions and transition rates for full- and part-time schooling and simultaneous employment; (2) longitudinal studies of preferences that include later actual job outcome characteristics to test the assumption that career aspiration helps to explain the allocation of different jobs; (3) data on recruitment methods used nationally by employers (i.e., data indicating age-specific preferences for employees and based on actual behavior); and (4) more elaborate study of the process of job search, emphasizing patterns of job seeking across occupational situses, heterogeneity of job search methods, and the relationships among duration, intensity, and methods of search.

        "description":"To help secondary school business teachers and school counselors in Pennsylvania assist students in making career choices and securing a job, this guide provides information on job counseling and developing business education programs. The first chapter focuses on the changing employment climate and outlines activities that will increase vocational guidance counselors' knowledge of the opportunities available to graduates. In chapter 2, a brief history of business education is given, followed by a discussion of the student needs that a business education program should meet. Besides describing the aptitudes and skills necessary for the three major areas of business education (accounting, clerical, and stenographic-secretarial), chapter 3 analyzes the employment outlook for each  area. To add flexibility and more choices to standard programs, specialized offerings are suggested, such as a combined college preparatory-business curriculum, mini courses, summer school, adult evening classes, and cooperative programs. Chapter 4 indicates other areas with which counselors should be familiar, including (1) opportunities for minorities; (2) occupational sex stereotyping; (3) job information sources such as PENNSCRIPT, the &quot;Occupational Outlook Handbook,&quot; and intermediate unit media centers; (4) the uses of tests; (5) school placement services; (6) program evaluation based on surveys of employers and graduates and a checklist compiled by the state department of education; (7) Future Business Leaders of America; and (8) future directions for business education.

        "description":"Observations of career decision-making (CDM) behaviors of college students were analyzed to investigate how variations in the CDM process may be associated with age, sex, and &quot;sex-typed&quot; values. This descriptive study was based on records of students' interactions with the computer-based System of Interactive Guidance and Information (SIGI). First, the effects of age and sex on a wide range of CDM variables were examined. Then, for groups classified as having values &quot;typical&quot; or &quot;atypical&quot; of each sex, statistical analyses were made of differences and similarities in such behaviors as preferences for major fields of interest and kinds of occupations chosen. Effects of initial status on CDM variables were sometimes found when age and sex effects were absent. Age differences were  relatively infrequent and small. While sex differences tended to confirm the usual sex stereotypes, the two &quot;typical&quot; sub-groups accounted for many of these differences. Differences between the &quot;typical&quot; and &quot;atypical&quot; sub-groups within each sex often paralleled those between the sexes. Findings show that there is a precedent for people of either sex who want to escape sex-role stereotypes and seek career satisfactions in terms of their own values. A major conclusion is that similarities between age and sex groups in the CDM process outweigh differences and justify &quot;sex-blind&quot; guidance, such as facilitated by the SIGI program. (An illustration of a student's interaction with SIGI is included.) (Author/BM)",

        "description":"The purpose of this project was to develop and disseminate a conceptual model for comprehensive secondary school (7-12) career guidance programs. The model consisted of transportable packages intended to provide a framework for the delivery of career guidance strategies designed to facilitate the achievement of desired student outcomes. Initially, sixteen Georgia school systems were involved, but later seven systems were discontinued and twenty-one new systems were added. A needs assessment was conducted to ascertain need priorities for program planning and development, and a multiple criterion approach to the assessment of the project was planned (some of the instruments are appended). The major conclusions are (1) though staff development is costly and frustrating, it seems to  be the key to lasting effect and carry-over from project orientation to project continuation; and (2) there is a critical need at all levels (state, local, and federal) for more program coordination. (Numerous materials are appended, including guides for training paraprofessionals, establishing a career guidance center, setting up a career guidance library, and evaluating the program. Also, twenty-four related documents are available, such as a program development guide--CE 018 146; a staff development handbook--CE 018 138; an external evaluation of the training materials--CE 018 339; and several staff development training manuals and materials for both the secondary and elementary school levels.)

First, the life career development perspective is examined as a framework for organizing guidance objectives and practices so that there is a developmental, integrative conceptualization. Also included are descriptions of the following processes which can be utilized in reaching some of these guidance objectives: teacher developed activities, media packages, and experiential career education (Career Education); models and methods. moral reasoning, and expanding experiences (Values Education); media programs and group processes (Human Relations Education). In the second section, the psychological education movement  is surveyed to provide some basic principles for new and intensive personal development goals. Four facets of psychological education are examined: communications training; understanding behavior; behavior change; and achievement motivation and responsible assertiveness. Finally, in section three, program components are presented to aid in establishing comprehensive career guidance within the mainstream of the elementary school curriculum. Included is a list of goals and developmental objectives organized by grade level (K-6) under the following domains: interpersonal effectiveness; work and life skills; and life career planning.

The first chapter describes an emerging new concept of career guidance, current career guidance efforts in Georgia, and a comprehensive model that can be modified for effective local use. (This model encompasses the following three domains: life career planning,  interpersonal competence, and work and life skills.) Chapter 2 presents a format for planning a local career guidance program by using a comprehensive model to define the parameters of career guidance. Chapter 3 describes exemplary implementation strategies and delivery systems. Sample activities and resources are included to provide school personnel with various methods for organizing and delivering career guidance processes. (BM)",

An executive summary precedes the report and summarizes its main findings. For example, it is reported that the federal government has provided only a fraction of its financial support for learning opportunities for adults over traditional college age. Part 1 of the report defines lifelong learning and describes the elements of a society concerned with learning. Lifelong learning is described as the process by which individuals continue to develop their knowledge, skills, and attitudes over their lifetimes. The second part analyzes federal, state, and local relations in lifelong learning and recommends federal activities  in research, demonstration, and coordination at each level. Part 3 applies the lifelong learning perspective to four groups of learners: workers, urban youth, women, and older adults, and recommends some federal roles in improving lifelong learning for these groups. Four appendixes contain the findings of Congress, sources of education and learning in the U.S.A., the Lifelong Learning Act, and the Lifelong Learning Project papers. (CSS)",

Data was collected from a total of 3,002 students and 469 faculty members representing twenty-seven diploma, associate, and baccalaureate schools in twelve states. Few nursing schools were found to be integrated (only schools with a minimum of ten percent black enrollment were considered integrated), and these schools were most often located in black neighborhoods and offered low tuition rates and two-year programs. No direct relationship was found between recruitment efforts and the size of black enrollment. Once a school was successful in recruiting and graduating large numbers of black nurses, it continued to attract  qualified minority applicants. While the level of admission standards was assessed as having little influence on enrollment size, preadmission programs offered by the schools to give remedial assistance to black applicants succeeded in increasing the number of black students. Schools were more often interested in increasing minority enrollment rates than retention rates; only six of the twenty-seven surveyed were successful in both recruitment and retention efforts. The success of integrating the profession was found to be undermined by the belief of a majority of black students that discrimination exists in the nursing profession and that nursing professional associations are unresponsive to the needs of black nurses.

Data were collected from the following sources: surveys of 8,000 executives of state and local criminal justice agencies, 1,600 state trial and appellate courts, and 250 law enforcement academies; an analysis of a 1975 census survey of 50,000 state and local criminal justice employees; and field visits to more than 250 agencies and training or educational institutions. Some of the findings of this extensive study include the following: selective increases of personnel are needed in most categories of criminal justice agencies; the five-year  outlook is for lower levels of recruitment in most areas; the quality of much of the Law Enforcement Education Program (LEEP) appears to be seriously deficient; and commitment to criminal justice manpower planning is necessary for improving the effectiveness of assistance programs for manpower development at both the national and state levels.

Chapter 2 presents a profile of three levels of law enforcement agencies (local, state, and federal) and discusses the relationship between police manpower and the crime rate. Chapter 3 provides employment projections of state and local personnel needs, by occupation, for a ten-year period (to  1985). A summary of recruitment needs and turnover problems in law enforcement agencies is presented in chapter 4. Education and training needs for law enforcement occupations are discussed in chapters 5 and 6, respectively; and based on the comparisons of current educational and training programs with desired standards, conclusions and recommendations for program improvement are made.

        "description":"Focusing on adjudication manpower (judges, prosecutors, public defenders, court administrators, and probation officers), this document is one in a series of six volumes reporting the results of the National Manpower Survey (NMS) of the Criminal Justice System. Chapter 1 of six chapters summarizes the major results and recommendations of an assessment of the court adjudication agencies. Chapter 2 describes the criminal justice process today and the respective roles of each of these categories of agencies and their key personnel. Current employment in each category, agency workloads, and manpower needs are also discussed. Chapter 3 presents the projection of future personnel needs of state and local criminal justice agencies, by occupation, for a ten-year period (to 1985). Chapter  4 reviews NMS findings on recent personnel turnover and tenure among assistant prosecutors and defenders, on factors contributing to the relatively high turnover in these positions, and on the implications of these patterns for future recruitment needs. Chapter 5 describes the historical development of legal education and training programs and discusses key issues related to the adequacy and quality of current programs. The final chapter reviews the role and functions of court administrators, provides a profile of existing incumbents in terms of training and experience, and assesses training and education needs for current and future incumbents of these positions.

Three secondary staff development training packages (Educational Environment, CE 018 154; Work and Leisure Environments, CE 018 161; and Human Relations, CE 018 147) were evaluated for feasibility, transportability, and validity. Evaluation of project planning, communication and implementation was also conducted. Overall, the planning aspect of the management was judged to be extensive and generally effective. It was reported that participants at all levels found communication to be insufficient. The training packages were described as well organized, clear in exposition, substantive in content,  and unique as a system in the breadth and comprehensiveness of their coverage. Since field testing and the implementation phase was yet to be done, the demonstrated usefulness of the materials could not be assessed. It was recommended that the manuals be analyzed to clarify the overlaps in content and activities and that an explanatory document be prepared to accompany the training packages to describe the relationships between packages and to identify specific goals, objectives, and activities within each training manual. Finally, additional changes in packaging and ideas for future development were suggested. (BM)",

The data were obtained from written questionnaires administered to a representative sampling of part-time adult vocational instructors and all Minnesota area vocational-technical institutions' adult vocational coordinators. Results were as follows: (1) ninety-three percent of the coordinators and eighty-seven percent of the instructors felt there was a need for a teacher education program; (2) the  exact composition of the program was not determined although the five core courses required to achieve five-year certification at the postsecondary level might also be appropriate for the adult instructors; (3) instructors felt the need for substantial assistance in dealing with human interactions in the classroom and techniques for identifying the individual needs and capacities of students, and also assistance in addressing special needs students; and (4) the most effective delivery system to the instruction instructors seemed to be similar to the procedures used with postsecondary vocational instructors.

This increase in deaf children in public school programs will demand not only modification of existing academic programs to permit equal program accessibility to the deaf child, but also the development and implementation of appropriate support service systems. It is anticipated that the school counselor will emerge as the key support system for the deaf child attending a public school program. This increasingly important function of the counselor will necessitate an understanding of the specific social and psychological needs of  the deaf child, and the strategies that may be employed to meet these needs. An overview of the social and psychological needs of the deaf child attending the public school system is provided. Suggestions and strategies for counseling and \"outreach\" support activities are offered. (Author)",

With the standard instructions for the MFF, performance was found to be unrelated to test anxiety or extraversion and was parallel in many respects to the performance of children on the equivalent form of the MFF. Instructions which emphasized accurate performance were effective in reducing errors and increasing latencies, but did not substantially alter the range of performances. Instructions which minimized feedback about performance and eliminated the most obvious cues for implicit strategies indicated that performance was more related to information processing style than to implicit  strategies for performance. An alternative means of measuring performance on the MFF which attenuates performance differences that result from implicit strategies and allows for a more meaningful comparison of performances from different studies was proposed.

All training was done in groups utilizing male and female co-trainers. One relationship satisfaction questionnaire was administered prior to training; all questionnaires and performance measures were given one and seven weeks following training. Results indicated that the CCP training produced significant increases in nonverbal positive messages relative to the CSW and no  training. CCP training also resulted in significant decreases in nonverbal negative messages compared to the CSW. Both training conditions significantly reduced verbal negative messages. Self-report measures revealed no significant differences at follow-up testing. Although trainer differences may have partially accounted for the results, the CCP appears to be a viable alternative to behavioral programs such as CSW. (Author)",

In a post-experimental questionnaire, stereotypic females indicated that they had been the most influenced, whereas androgynous females reported the least amount of influence from others. Stereotypic subjects of both sexes admitted to holding significantly more  traditional sex-role attitudes than androgynous subjects. Results from the Rotter I-E Scale indicated only that males scored significantly more internal than females. However, data from Coan's Personal Opinion Survey showed that androgynous females were reliably more internal than stereotypic females on six of the seven factors.

Subjects' assessments of a videotape were compared to a criterion code which defined the population of behaviors. Results indicated that systematic observation procedures were more accurate than unsystematic procedures, though this factor interacted with gender of observer and valence of behavior. Additionally, males tended to sample more representatively than females.

        "description":"There exists the practical possibility of randomly selected control groups for outcome assessments in mental health programs. Ethical considerations for randomization include distinguishing between innovation and \"fooling around,\" and discriminatory implications of a first-come first-served selection procedure. Practical considerations include reviewing the differences between volunteers and non-volunteers and the utility of rigorous evaluation information. The strategies for implementing control groups in the research design, using administration and staff, include: (1) use of minimal program group; (2) separation of action and evaluation units; (3) inclusion of the lottery procedure on the informed consent form; and (4) allowance for particularly needy applicants. For dealing  with participants the strategies include: use of a lottery for selection; informing potential participants about lottery; contacting and informing participants personally; when possible, providing subsequent services to the no-program group.

Three major aspects of the role of the police in influencing what happens after arrest are studied. Factors such as tangible evidence and witnesses are influenced by the time between the offense and the arrest. The characteristics of the officers whose arrests end in convictions are contrasted with those of other officers. Differences between arrest criteria and conviction criteria are examined from the context of the legal and institutional framework within which they are processed. Findings are discussed in terms of innovations such as the giving of legal aid by the Office of General Counsel to the entire police department and members of the police-prosecutor teams. Such  innovations require a broader perspective of the officer's role than has been traditionally assumed by the police. (BN)",

Subjects were 231 dating couples. Questionnaires were utilized, with follow-ups conducted six months, one year, and two years after initial testing. Findings indicate that dual-career marriage is popular among a sizeable proportion of students, with men being more traditional than women; dual-career students are less traditional, with women more likely to attend graduate school, and men more likely to have higher SAT scores; \"mismatched\" couples appear less satisfied, while traditional couples date more exclusively and give higher estimates of probable marriage;  dual-career couples are more likely to report equal power; and mismatched couples are more likely to break up, while traditional couples are more likely to become engaged or married. Although the popularity of dual-career marriage in this sample is striking, it seems unlikely that all of these students will achieve this ideal. Major inconsistencies are evident between ideals and specific attitudes about future work and family commitments. (Author/JLL)",

In a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design, subjects were presented with a description of a situation in which the woman was forced to engage in sex. Four levels of acquaintance were included. In addition, the woman either strongly resisted her assailant, or acquiesced to his demands. Subjects were asked to make judgments about the man, the woman and the rape situation. The results revealed that subjects defined rape in terms of the level of resistance evidenced by the woman. The level of acquaintance did not affect the subjects' definition of the situation as rape, although it did affect their attitudes toward prosecution of the assailant. Finally, men and women differ in their use of the  acquaintance and resistance dimensions in determining the severity of a situation when coercive sex has occurred. (Author)",

A group of male and female undergraduates at Carthage College (N=112) were exposed to one of four stress treatment conditions: escapable noise (EN), inescapable noise (IN), noise experienced with no expectation of control (NC) or no noise (NN). Three measures of subsequent performance decrement on an anagram task were obtained: trials to criterion, mean solution time, and total failures to solve. To test for distrust, this task was administered by the same or a different experimenter. A three-way analysis of variance was performed for stress treatment, same versus different experimenter, and sex of subject. A significant main effect for stress  treatment was found. The IN and NC groups showed equivalent performance decrements on all three dependent variables. The EN and NN groups showed no performance decrements. No other significant main effects or interactions were found. Experiencing uncontrollability resulted in equal performance decrements regardless of subjects' expectations of or efforts to control the noise. Distrust was not supported as an alternative explanation. (Author)",

This paper explores interpersonal attraction (attitudes toward individuals) and helping behavior (assisting others) within the broader context of attitude change. Laboratory and field studies have revealed a number of factors which influence interpersonal attraction, including similarity of traits and attitudes, frequency of contact, reciprocal liking, and physical attractiveness. The practical application of these factors is discussed. The second area of exploration, helping behavior, is, additionally, related to attitude change. Several factors mediate helping behavior, including moral norms, particular  moods, rewards, and models. Applications of these factors are discussed. Four major theoretical frameworks regarding attitude change are also examined, as well as the practical application of these frameworks. It is suggested that many of the principles of social psychology be employed, but that thorough planning take place to determine how the principles can best be applied in a particular situation. Research should be fully explored before implementation of programs. (KA)",

In the main section of the paper, selected strategies that seem to hold promise for improving children's prose learning are described, and supporting research examples are presented, for the following categories: prose-dependent, stage-setting strategies; processor-dependent, stage-setting strategies; prose-dependent, storage/retrieval strategies; and processor-dependent,  storage/retrieval strategies. It is concluded that, in order to be effective, prose-learning strategies require clever delivery on the part of an instructor (including the matching of strategies to materials and students) and conscientious application on the part of the student.

Teachers perceived 6.2% of pupils as being unable to cope with everyday demands in reading, while 6.6% were perceived as unable to cope with everyday demands in writing. A further 7% of pupils were perceived as being unable to cope with the reading demands of postprimary schooling, while 5.2% were perceived as being unable to cope with the writing demands of postprimary schooling. Fifty-nine percent of the pupils with disabilities were perceived as having them in both reading and writing. Children with disabilities tended to be older than other sixth class pupils, to score considerably lower on tests of verbal  reasoning and English attainment, and to be rated by their teachers as lower than other pupils on personal-social characteristics, especially those related to school performance.

        "description":"Current reading theory suggests that oral language skills and reading skills interact with and implement each other. Three guidelines are helpful in shaping the development of proficient readers. (1) From kindergarten on, each year should be spent moving from oral language to print. Furthermore, the move within oral language should be from dialogue to monologue to narrative to exposition in emphasis. (2) Movement through the grades should incorporate an increasing number of activities cast in a rhetorical settings (the reader should move from a relatively rich fictive mode--short stories and drama--to assertions, paragraphs, and passages in which the reader must focus on syntactic and semantic detail). Development of comprehension skills in arhetorical settings should begin with  metalinguistic games (playing with language) in the earliest years of school. (3) As the student moves through the grades, there should be an effort to coordinate joint involvement in utterance and text activities. This coordination allows comprehension skills learned in one mode of discourse to be applied in another mode of discourse. (TJ)",

The major differences between good and poor readers have been shown to occur at the level of the single word; other differences occur in knowledge of spelling patterns and ability to make use of letters' positional redundancy (their tendency to occur very often in a given position) in words. To demonstrate knowledge of positional redundancy, subjects search for a target letter in a string of letters; data from experiments using this visual scanning task suggest that redundancy related to letter position alone is a strong differentiator of reading ability. Regardless of how much of the reading process is visually based and how much is based  on phonology, considerable visual processing must precede a phonological stage. Other experiments have addressed a variety of topics, including brain hemispheric specialization in children's reading; differences between good and poor readers in memory processing, use of spatial redundancy, and use of distinctive letter features alone; and positional redundancy effects using novel nonalphabetic symbols. Current research is concerned with determining the relative information value of positional information alone and in conjunction with letter context information. (GW)",

Results of the study revealed that sufficient opportunities for systematic vocabulary development did not exist at many grade levels in the series for the following reasons: there was a general lack of coordination between what was suggested for teaching in the teacher's guides and what was offered in corresponding reading selections; textbook writers and consultants misunderstood what prefixation is in the English language; and there was an  over-reliance on the principle of frequency or on the literary selections in determining the vocabulary used in the text. It was concluded that a generalization from the findings on prefixed words justifies the development of a new rationale for determining vocabulary in reading texts. (MAI)",

In experiment one, employing 12 &quot;average&quot; fourth grade readers, and experiment two, employing six learning disabled intermediate level students, word synonyms were taught to pairs of students on three consecutive days. Experiment three, employing ten fourth grade disabled readers, examined the effect of two to four sessions of vocabulary instruction on comprehension of connected discourse. The three treatments used varied in the amount of direct instruction, ranging from permitting students to infer meanings from context to drilling students on synonyms. Results indicated that the treatments were differentially effective in teaching word synonyms, that with  increases in direct instruction more meanings were acquired, and that the treatments produced differential transfer to sentence comprehension. Average students learned some word synonyms under all conditions except a noninstructional control condition; learning disabled students required more direct instruction to produce any learning. Although vocabulary training was found to transfer to comprehension of single sentences, on two of three measures of passage comprehension no effects were observed that could be attributed to vocabulary instruction.

Postreading activities augment what has already been learned and generate useful alternative texts, such as notes and outlines.

        "description":"SAM (Script Applier Mechanism), a computer program designed to understand stories that rely heavily on scripts (typical sequences of events in particular contexts), is described in this report. Chapter one, which discusses SAM's background, shows how causal chaining was developed to connect events in stories, presents a typical script, and explains the general form for a script. The following chapter presents examples to show how SAM processes stories by creating a linked causal chain of conceptualizations that represent what took place and then generating the output back in English. Chapter three describes the following components of SAM: the English-to-conceptual dependency analyzer; the EXEC (executive program), which decides which script is required for each input; the script  applier, which constructs a story representation from conceptual dependency input; the generator, which produces an English sentence as an output; and the Chinese generator, which can translate the output into Chinese. The chapter also explains how SAM creates paraphrases and summaries of processed stories and how it answers four types of questions that rely on information in a script. A brief concluding chapter notes that SAM's significance lies in its provision of a test for a theory of understanding based on scripts. (GW)",

        "description":"A survey of 548 male and female household heads in Columbus, Ohio, was conducted in 1977 to discover the effects of dependency on different media on levels of trust toward government, knowledge about government, and perceived knowledge about government at both local and national levels. It was hypothesized that newspaper dependency is positively associated with increased knowledge, perceived comprehension, and trust at both local and national levels even when controls for age and education are included. It was also hypothesized that television dependency is negatively associated with the same variables. In general, these hypotheses held except that at the national level, knowledge was found to be related to perceived comprehension but not to trust. It appears that age and  education do interact with the variables and dependency so that among younger sample members with a low education level, dependency does not produce the effects on knowledge, perceived comprehension, and trust that it does in other sample members.

The pentad, Burke's instrument for interpreting actual and potential motives, can help develop lines of thought that might never occur without some such model. Other inventional systems such as exploring the limits of agreement with the thesis, finding the complex in the simple, expanding the circumference, and translation afford opportunities to make writing an adventure in words and ideas. The importance of Burke has two bases: he is the major spokesperson in the United States in our century for a rhetoric grounded in dialectic and he offers a way of getting beyond our narrow concern with linguistic style so that writing  becomes action and a matter of interpreting motives rather than being a linguistic process for processing information.

He describes this rhetoric as &quot;rhetorical rationalism&quot; that recognizes a multiplicity of ways of being reasonable and recognizes that the goal of rhetoric is to &quot;elaborate principles of being, thought, and action that are humanly reasonable.&quot; However, it is necessary to leave room for future modification, recognizing that values play an important part in decisions and introduce an arbitrary element in any decision. He creates a useful heuristic for the composition class: philosophical pairs (evoked simultaneously but not necessarily opposites) that can be used by students to  determine the most effective approach to a topic. Such pairs include means/ends, multiplicity/unity, and letter/spirit; they generate a structure and a vocabulary which become an essential part of the argument. The use of these pairs in composition classes helps students suspend judgment and gives them a procedure which brings out the uniqueness of what they are writing about. (TJ)",

        "description":"Objective news reporting, in which reporters present but do not evaluate facts, has certain negative consequences. When the convention of journalistic objectivity was adopted around 1900, journalists moved from interpreting and analyzing events to being relatively passive links between sources and audiences. The most troublesome convention of objective reporting for the consumer appears to be the presentation of conflicting truth claims. A 1977 series of articles in the Hartford, Connecticut, &quot;Courant&quot; presented conflicting claims about a Hartford map designating much of the city as &quot;inappropriate&quot; for residence, which was allegedly distributed by a realtor to airlines employees who were being transferred to Hartford. The articles included accusations by civil rights leaders that  the maps were designed to steer people away from areas populated by blacks, denials by airlines and realty officials that they had distributed the map, and reactions by public officials. The truth about the facts was never made known, and readers had no way of discriminating among the contradictory claims. While news ought to reflect thoughtful scrutiny, or at least a concern for the probable truth of claims, its form makes this impossible. Moreover, the public debate accommodated in the press is limited to the views of officialdom. (Six &quot;Courant&quot; news stories about the map controversy are included.) (GW)",

The question that assessed media reliance was &quot;How much do you count on (television/newspapers) to help you make up your mind about whom to vote for in a presidential election--a lot, somewhat, or not at all?&quot; Questions on political attitudes assessed opinions regarding political powerlessness, altruism of politicians, efficacy of the voting process, distrust of politicians, political alienation, and political understanding. Opinions of the 1972 presidential contenders, George McGovern and Richard Nixon, were also assessed. Analysis of the data indicated the  following: the greater their reliance on television, the more respondents seemed to feel that politicians were altruistic and trustworthy, that voting was efficacious, and that the candidates had positive images, and the less respondents appeared to feel politically powerless and alienated. Newspaper reliance was associated with the above characteristics to an even greater degree. Television reliance was unrelated to political understanding, while newspaper reliance was positively and significantly associated with it. (GW)",

        "description":"Error analysis can provide teachers with a foundation for creating practical writing experiences for students and can allow the teacher to examine errors for linguistic features appropriate and inappropriate to the social context of writing. Teachers tend to call for a finished, error-free product, a polished final paper instead of using error analysis to discover possible patterns of error. Process-oriented writing programs involve a series of small interactive steps between teacher and student in which organization, logical thinking, and syntactic maturity are some of the subgoals in the task of writing effectively. General studies in error analysis report frequency and kind of error while specific studies look more to teaching implications. One model for using error analysis  in the teaching process translates student errors into positive teaching points and then puts each teaching point through a sequence of writing tasks in order to produce modular instruction around each point.

Poems are then explicated to show Akhmatova's treatment of her major themes. Among the poems dealt with are \"The Guest,\" a version of the story of don Juan, which shows the powerlessness of don Juan's women; a poem in which marriage is seen as confining; \"Lot's Wife,\" in which Lot is seen as an obsessed being and as ignorant of the inner world of the woman narrator; a poem in which Akhmatova appears to grapple  with the eventuality of her own eclipse and the rise of other women poets; \"Epigram,\" in which women artists are perceived as threats or annoyances; and \"To Poetry,\" which encapsulates Akhmatova's treatment of her most common poetic themes-poetry, women poets, love, and male lovers-and her differing attitudes and expectations regarding men and women.

It combines the positive aspects of diaries and class notebooks, focusing on academic subjects from a personal point of view. Teachers can assign journal entries not only as homework, but also to begin or end classes, at the start of lectures, or to interrupt/refocus class discussions. Used in these ways, journal writing acts as a learning catalyst and as a clarifying activity, directing student attention toward a particular subject while providing writing practice and a permanent record to which the student can refer when preparing for a test or writing a more formal composition. Although  teachers do not have to read student journals or comment about their content, positive comments and suggestions about student journals can serve to improve effective use of the journals. Teachers can even keep their own journals--not only as an example for their students to follow, but also as a means of constant self-evaluation. (RL)",

One writer has identified eight developmental tasks that teenagers must undertake as they move toward adulthood: discovering one's sex role in our culture, developing relationships with peers, achieving an easy relationship with members of the opposite sex, accepting one's physical body, changing relationship with parents, working for pay, finding a vocation, and becoming aware of one's value patterns. A number of adolescent novels recently published include a ninth developmental task exposure to and acceptance of someone's death. Some novels show successful coming to terms with death, others show less successful adaptation. A few novels that  include this task are &quot;Confessions of a Teenage Baboon&quot; and &quot;Pardon Me, You're Stepping on My Eyeball&quot; both by Paul Zindel, &quot;A Figure of Speech&quot; by Norma Fox Mazer, &quot;Cinnamon Cane&quot; by Melinda Pollowitz, and &quot;I Am the Cheese&quot; by Robert Cormier.

Much too depends on the leadership abilities of superintendents. Management teams are purported to increase administrator satisfaction because of increased opportunity for decision-making. The management team is an organized deliberative body that includes the superintendent, superintendent's assistants, principals, and curriculum advisors. The team may take many different forms, but minimal requirements are legally constituted power and representatives from all the district's important systems. The most controversial problem surrounding the management team is whether to include principals. Some see the team as a  means of forestalling principal unionization while others believe that teams and principal unionization are not incompatible. The team must define as clearly as possible its relation to the superintendent. The two most pressing problems with the management team are that its joint problem-solving may be time-consuming and that its communication may become fragmented. Good examples of the management team are found in Attleboro (Massachusetts), San Leandro (California), and Whittier (California). (Author/JM)",

The point of view taken suggests that for a group to maintain a high level of productivity, it will periodically need to examine itself in three major areas. A group will need to provide for change in membership, it will need to be able to adopt new goals, and it will need to maintain a flexible attitude toward its procedures. The booklets in the series are designed to help group leaders and members strengthen their skills in group processes, work cooperatively with others, and plan and carry out new projects. Topics include techniques to maintain enthusiasm in a group,  ways that agencies can effectively use consultants, and factors that affect introducing and implementing new projects. The booklets in the series are adapted from a much more comprehensive set of materials and training activities developed and field tested by the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory over the past several years in dozens of locations throughout the western United States.

Experience with citizen involvement efforts suggests that successful planning has three elements. The first is a shared vision of potential: what the future will be like after the proposed change is introduced, what results are expected, what purposes will be met, and who must be satisfied. The second element is commitment and support for the proposed change, not only from those who are directly involved in the planning effort, but also from those who will supervise or help carry out the new practice. The third element is a planning design based on these shared perceptions and  support, with adequate preparation for startup and a procedure for later monitoring and problem-solving. Each of these elements is discussed in more detail in the booklet. (Author/MLF)",

The experiences of the Rural Education Program in the field, together with the findings of the implementation research, lead the author to believe that a successful implementation process is one that utilizes mutual adaptation. This process promotes interaction and mutual influence between the agency, the community, and the project plan. It relies on continuous problem-solving to make sure that within a project the training is focused on day-to-day issues, the materials are adapted to local needs, and there are sufficient participants to build project morale. Implementation becomes an organizational process that depends vitally on human interactions. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"In many ways, 1976-1977 was a traditional year in labor relations in education. For the most part, traditional bargaining issues prevailed--wages and fringes, especially leave issues; tenure, seniority, and retirement; teacher workload and class assignments; union dues; and academic freedom and constitutional rights. The two major teacher unions--National Education Association (NEA) and American Federation of Teachers (AFT)--continued to battle for membership and prestige, although both suffered a drop in membership. While the 152 strikes in 1976-1977 were below the record high of 203 walkouts the year before, they were considerably above the number of strikes fifteen years ago and indicative of the recent militancy in teacher unions generally. But because of developments like  declining enrollments and lack of taxpayer support, labor relations in 1976-77 were also unlike any in memory. For instance, AFT President Albert Shanker called for the suspension of collective bargaining of municipal employee agreements as long as New York's financial crisis persisted. This report focuses on teacher organizing activity, collective bargaining issues, contract settlements, strike activity, legal issues and developments affecting teachers, state board activity, and state legislature enactments. Examples of AFT and NEA organizing literature are included. (Author/JM)",

In the 1890s municipal reform wrested control of urban school systems from city political machines and their neighborhood subunits. Since then the structure of school government has rested on two types of legitimacy. These are a belief in professionalism and a commitment to middle-class influence. The institution of the nonpartisan, at-large school board not only cut the roots of the urban machine, it also destroyed neighborhood and parent access to educational decision-making. For two decades now the second political revolution has challenged the legitimacy of the professionals and the middle class. A teacher organization elite has now replaced the administrator elite. New  building level access mechanisms have arisen in mandated advisory groups and community school efforts. We are now entering a trial and error phase in the second political revolution. Technological issues about teaching and learning need to be resolved before the trial and error process can end fruitfully. Careful natural history studies with open-ended theory generation as requisite goals will provide the understanding needed for the early years after the present revolution. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This study examined the relationships between various components of organizational control and individual teacher reports of autonomy. The effects of two types of control were examined: information-gathering structures (such as observation) and directive control structures (such as rules). The data for the study were drawn from a survey of 35 schools in southeastern Michigan, from the Michigan Educational Assessment Program, the Michigan Department of Education's Register of Professional Personnel, Michigan school district offices, and the 1970 United States Census. The survey used two questionnaires, one for building administrators and one for teachers. It was expected that more elaborate control structures would be associated with decreased levels of individual reported  autonomy. This expectation was not widely supported by the data analysis. Neither type of control was regularly associated at statistically significant levels with teacher perceptions of their own autonomy. In fact there was some suggestion that control actually enhances perceived autonomy. Explanations for these unexpected findings may lie in the role of organizational structures in facilitating teacher influence attempts and on the role of administrative expectations in facilitating individual professional practice. Future work must specify processes intervening between control structures and individual experiences and explore the nonconstraining effects of control. (Author/JM)",

This paper investigates how well children aged 2;3 to 2;11 can discriminate between pairs of minimally different real words, and it shows that the results are affected by how well the children know the words. It is argued that in some earlier studies not knowing the words well enough may have given the impression of worse discrimination abilities. The present study makes several methodological improvements on the earlier studies. Pilot work had suggested that how well children know the words interfered with the results, so this variable was made a central part of the study. Also, on the assumption that children around two-and-a-half years of age  can make many of the discriminations, those discriminations least likely to be known were investigated. (Author/NCR)",

Four monolingual children were recorded at approximately two week intervals, beginning when the children were about 1;6. Data provide evidence for three general stages: (1) the child has no contrast and produces both adult voiced and voiceless stops with short lag voicing; (2) the child has a contrast but one that falls within the adult perceptual boundaries of one (usually voiced) phoneme, and thus is presumably not perceptible to adults; and (3) the child has a contrast that resembles the adult contrast. Three children had reached stage 3 by age 1;9 the fourth child  was still in stage 2 by the age 2;4. In addition, the data document the development of the voicing contrast across the three places of articulation. The rate and nature of the developmental process are discussed briefly in relation to two competing models for phonological acquisition (the &quot;across-the-board&quot; model and the &quot;lexical diffusion&quot; model) and two hypotheses regarding the skills being learned.

By means of a survey questionnaire and interviews, the University's vice presidents and other senior administrators were asked to estimate the amount of time and money spent by the school to comply with federal rules, regulations, and guidelines. The University's participation in federally-supported projects and activities and the historical background, mission, and profile of the school are discussed. Excluding student aid, government support of the univeristy constitutes about 6 percent of the operating budget; about half this amount comes from the state, primarily in the form of a direct assistance grant. Compliance with government  regulations and guidelines is conservatively estimated to cost the university about $250,000, or 2 percent of its operating budget. Some of these costs are one-time expenses; other expenditures are out-of-pocket, most in the form of staff time. The administrative staff spends an increasing precentage of their time on government related matters rather than on academically-related concerns. Policy issues to be considered in assessing the costs of compliance are discussed, and l0 recommendations are offered for the Sloan Commission to consider as it attempts to assess the problems on a national scale.

        "description":"Some of the problems that exist for women in educational research and development and ways in which better opportunities for advanced levels of training and job advancement could be provided are described. Three stages of women's professional development are considered: the student years, the early postdoctoral years (one-to-five years after the degree), and the intermediate professional years. Problems related to the selection of women to graduate programs for training in educational research and development include: specific prerequisite course requirements; institutional requirements such as limiting financial aid to full-time students; differential expectations that are held for females and males by educational research faculty members serving on interview and review  committees; and women's low expectations for their own careers. Both in the formal training in the classroom and in the informal interactions with other students and faculty, the woman student meets obstacles to her professional development. There is evidence to suggest that males are more often trained as research assistants while females are trained as teaching assistants. Problems faced by most women in the early postdoctoral years include the lack of postdoctoral training programs or internships for women in educational research, finding the initial postdoctoral job, and developing the professional skills that the job requires. Among the problems encountered by women faculty in the intermediate professional years are developing new skills, such as administration and budgeting; keeping  up-to-date in areas of special research interests; and being evaluated for tenure, promotion, or a new position.

The availability of women for faculty positions and the process by which they are selected are discussed. Among the processes that can limit the hiring of women for academic positions are: the use of sex-biased criteria; institutional rules and regulations that disproportionally affect women; biased or unfair application of neutral criteria, such as differential expectations for and evaluations of men and women; and women's own self-concept and expectations for success. Even when young women are hired as faculty members, they are more likely to hold positions in the lower academic ranks than are  men and they do not advance as rapidly up the career ladder. Women are often excluded from many of the opportunities that are available to men.

Another study question was whether there were any differences in personal background characteristics between students who pledged and those who did not. The study group were men and women who participated in rush and pledged a fraternity or sorority and those who participated in rush but did not pledge. Students who did not pledge either withdrew voluntarily or were not preferred by sororities or fraternities. Anonymous questionnaires were administered after the formal rush period. A greater percentage of students of both sexes  who pledged agreed that rush was a worthwhile addition to their college experience, felt comfortable in &quot;being themselves&quot; during rush, and believed that the activities of rush period provided them with sufficient information for making a choice about pledging. The milieu of the fraternal system and the people in it were the dominant influences on the decision to pledge. Students who pledged reported that rush had a neutral to positive effect on their views of themselves, while non-pledges indicated that it had a neutral to negative impact. (Author/SW)",

Enabling legislation intended that schools attain a revolving fund status but each school differs in its ability to do this because different loan collection procedures are used. Legislation requires schools to make loans to nearly all eligible students and privacy considerations affect the extent that schools can pursue delinquent borrowers. Direct loan recipients display different payback characteristics depending on the type of institution they attend. This factor could account for part of the difference in the ability of institutions to attain a self-sustaining revolving fund status. The type of school is a major factor related to  delinquency rates. Two-year public and proprietary institutions appear to have the greatest problem. It is unlikely that the majority of schools participating in the program will achieve a self-sustaining revolving fund status anytime soon. Management practices at participating institutions are discussed and it is concluded that most schools complied with due diligence requirements. Borrower profiles were developed based on a study of demographic, financial, academic, and direct loan status factors. Borrower characteristics most and least associated with delinquency are outlined. (SW)",

        "description":"As a response to the concerns associated with the allocation of state resources to institutions of higher education, several states have developed budget formulas to derive estimates of the institutional financial requirements. Formulas, however, were developed during a period of rapid growth, and might be unresponsive to institutional needs during the forthcoming decade of stabilized or declining enrollment. Two major questions are addressed in this paper: (1) To what extent are budget formulas responsive to changing enrollments? and (2) To what extent are the internal budget factors concerning formula adequacy affected by enrollment shifts? Characteristics of an hypothetical institution were developed for the base FY 1977 and then projected to FY 1978 under five conditions of  enrollment. These characteristics were applied, as required, to five selected FY 1978 state budget formulas: Louisiana, New Mexico, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas. Examination of the results indicated that under conditions of declining enrollment, the fixed costs of institutional support and maintenance are not adequately reflected in the budget. This appears to be the case even when the formula is designed specifically to address such costs accurately. (Author/LBH)",

        "description":"In order to sort out a comprehensible total picture regarding needs assessment and to develop a useful conceptual framework for this area, a comprehensive review of the needs assessment literature pertinent to the concerns of postsecondary education was conducted. The review found that needs assessment is a viable tool for input to planning, but serious problems exist. These include: (1) lack of a good definition of need; (2) difficulty in separating real need from wants and demands; (3) lack of valid and reliable measures and indicators of met and unmet need; (4) lack of useful taxonomies of needs; (5) tendency of many needs assessors to be imprecise about whose needs are of concern, and to not consider different groups separately; (6) tendency to focus on goals in needs  assessment rather than let needs data help the institution evaluate and reformulate its goals; (7) tendency to be imprecise concerning which decisionmakers will use the needs data, and how; (8) failure to make use of relevant secondary data and to overcome the possible pitfalls inherent in such data; (9) difficulty of integrating &quot;soft&quot; with &quot;hard&quot; data; and (10) the tendency to make decisions using over-simplified decision rules. This information provides a framework to assist in overcoming such problems and for evaluating needs assessment models. (Author/JMD)",

        "description":"The question, &quot;Do planning techniques make a difference, and if so, to whom, and for what purpose?&quot; was addressed by studying master planning, resource allocation, and program evaluation in several large, research-oriented universities. Observations regarding perceived utility and problems associated with these activities are discussed. Perceived utility varied by organizational level. Master planning and resource allocation techniques were the tools of the central administrator, and were not of major use to the department chairman. Program evaluation efforts had greatest impact on the operating units reviewed and were less useful to the central administrator. The ideal cycle of goal directed planning, followed by choice of action and evaluation of outcomes, does not come to  automatic closure given the usual form of these activities. The most effective activities provided alternative vantage points for viewing the organization. Expanded participation raised expectations and subsequent frustrations when limited resources provided few rewards. Communication problems become more acute. Faculty participation had inherent limits. Elements of administrative environment are critical in determining the influence of planning activities on decisions. The conscious protection of openness, participation, and communication were essential. (Author)",

        "description":"The cost-benefit of administrative data at a state college is placed in perspective relative to the institutional involvement in computer use. The costs of computer operations, personnel, and peripheral equipment expenses related to instruction are analyzed. Data bases and systems support institutional activities, such as registration, and aid managerial decision making. Decisions focus on establishing the effectiveness of institutions (e.g., delivering quality instruction) and enhancing the efficiency of resource utilization. Since the data bases were developed to meet federal, state, and institutional needs, they deal almost exclusively with the parameters of efficiency. The data bases do a fair job in providing information of instructional workload but are poor-to-nonexistent  in providing data on faculty quality and amount of noninstructional activity. Efforts should be made to augment the data systems to include constructs more directly related to effectiveness. The measurement of activities and outputs must be expanded and become a priority of faculty and their organizations. Efforts also must be extended to develop data exchanges for comparable colleges and curricula. Administrators have started in this direction, but if faculty do not become involved, the results will focus on indices of efficiency and not on the parameters of effectiveness. (SW)",

Evidence of recent increases in the proportion of non-tenure track positions is described, this development is interpreted, and implications for higher education are discussed. The paper proceeds in three sections. First, the declining demand for new doctorates in higher education since 1967 and the continuing production of new doctorates into the mid-l970's are detailed. Second, ways in which academic labor market conditions have increasingly led institutions to hire new faculty for non-tenure track positions are described. Finally, dual labor market theory is employed to interpret this development as the creation of primary and secondary  tracks in the academic labor market and to assess the qualitative impact of this development on institutions of higher learning. Using the analog of the nineteenth century German university, it is concluded that there is a point at which the proportion of non-tenure track positions in an institution will have a deleterious impact on the scholarly functions of the university.

However, determining the existence and extent of discrimination is not a simple matter. A four-step procedure is recommended that attempts to uncover the existence of discrimination and begins to rectify the problem wherever it is found. Major issues associated with the tools and structures employed during each step of the salary equity process are discussed. The model employed by the university of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is described. It suggests a four-phase process utilizing different types of judgment at each stage and making different sets of demands upon the institution during each of the four phases.

The impacts delineated are the results of an evaluation of these workshops. The impacts examined were extracted from the expected outcomes of various instructional improvement programs delineated by Gaff. The impacts selected for analysis were (1) the development and use of new techniques or methods of instruction and (2) the development of favorable attitudes toward teaching and learning by faculty. A survey instrument, which operationalized these two impacts, was administered to the population of 65 faculty who had participated in one or more of the workshops for  instructional improvement. A total of 44 completed forms were received for a response rate of 68 percent. The results tend to indicate that the workshops did have some impact upon the faculty participants. Most faculty did become involved in the process of developing new methods or techniques of instruction. More favorable attitudes toward teaching and learning were also developed. (Author)",

The three study objectives were to: (1) determine the magnitude of the range set up by the department degree structure to give student majors an opportunity to take courses outside their basic discipline; (2) assess the degree of students' responsiveness to utilize course offerings outside their basic discipline; and (3) measure the ability of departments to attract students from related and foreign disciplines. The degree program structures of selected disciplines were analyzed over a three-year period. The magnitude of the range allowing for course work outside a student's area of concentration remained stable in most cases. Multidisciplinarity, or the potential  utilization of various disciplines, is common at the University. Theoretical degree program structures welcome breadth through optional courses and electives, but depth prevails in most of the students' major curricula. It is concluded that multidisciplinarity is desirable to restrain curricular duplication and parochialism, but its limitations make it nonviable as a means to assure basic broad knowledge in the major forms of intellectual discourse. Minimum standards for breadth and maximum standards for depth need to be set in order to assure a basic understanding of knowledge acquisition in main branches of study and to guard against the dangers of overspecialization. An autonomous faculty group should be formed to represent interdisciplinary interests and to defend them politically.  (SW)",

The model helps assess the general financial impact of projected enrollment trends under current policy guidelines while also simulating alternative sets of financing guidelines and estimating their effects on overall expenditures and financing patterns. It helps to assess the specific financial impact of alternative policies at different enrollment margins and assists in identifying  and/or confirming which policies are in need of more specific and detailed analysis. It also helps in the educative component of policy deliberations by illuminating quantitative relationships among volume, expenditures, and sources of revenue in postsecondary education.

Administrations of higher education have been forced to rely more heavily on information systems to respond to the demands for accountability and allocations of limited resources. Information systems technology through the advent of data base management systems is able to be more responsive to administrative information needs, provided the relationships within the data required by administrators is known. The analysis, conducted at the University of  Minnesota, consisted of testing several data grouping techniques including four hierarchical clustering methods, factor analysis, and observation of summary matrices on the data. Complete linkage and average linkage cluster analysis provided what appeared to be the most reliable groupings of the entities and were applied to the data. The methodology does reveal the relationships that respondents perceive to be in the data. The methodology as it was tested was effective as an aid to the data base designer in establishing a relational model of the data base. (Author/JMD)",

        "description":"To support informational needs of day-to-day and long-range decision-making, many universities have developed their own data collection devices and institutional reporting systems. Often these models only represent a single point in time and do not effectively support needs at college and departmental levels. This paper identifies some of the more prevalent problems encountered with higher level information models and discusses Higher Education Planning Systems (HEPS) as a viable alternative that will serve all organizational levels. HEPS's reports are produced at several levels of aggregation and display data for several time periods. A technical overview of the HEPS subset is presented as implemented by the University of Toledo, utilizing data from the College of Business  Administration. Costing methodology is the fulcrum of a planning process designed to affect budgeting. The manner of recording courses that span multiple instructional levels and the method of representing faculty work load are essential to costing the components of instruction. Two methods of recording faculty work load were tested in HEPS: (1) assigned work load and (2) diary type of work load. Reactions and comments from different levels within the University and proposed future uses for this system are discussed. (Author/JMD)",

Using student choice data obtained from admitted freshmen applicants to Carnegie-Mellon University, some empirical results are presented that are related to the effects of price, among other factors, on the college choice decision-making behavior process of high school seniors. The two most important factors affecting the college choice process are seen to be college quality and price related considerations, especially the availability of student financial  aid.

        "description":"When changes occur in the number of credit hours demanded of a teaching unit, understanding of the sources of change is valuable policy making. Acceptable methods of determining sources of variance are not intuitively obvious, nor are the limitations of the simplest approaches. Sources of variance, not their causes, are discussed. Identification of a decrease in the proportion of credits taken in a college as the source of load decrease will not explain why less of that college's courses are being selected. However, the sources of variance can be of great policy interest and can make the search for causes more efficient. Often decision makers are unaware of the real sources of variation. Planning regarding curricular structure and recruiting may take different directions if the  nature and relative strength of the various sources are clearly understood. The mechanistic sources of load change are enrollment, mean load per student, and proportion of load taken in the unit under study. Each may be analyzed in terms of any student sets for which data are available. Equations are given for such computations and an actual example of this method is discussed using data from selected colleges at the University of Minnesota. (Author)",

        "description":"Plant operation currently consumes about 8 percent of an institution's budget (10-12 percent is not uncommon), of which half is expended on energy. In addition, the deferred maintenance of existing plant, a measure by which many institutions balanced their budget or minimized their deficits, can no longer be postponed. Nationally, an estimated $22 billion to $35 billion worth of maintenance is \"now due.\" Rising energy costs and aging buildings will require institutions to devote an increasing share of their budget to the physical plant. As space becomes more expensive to maintain and operate, the method by which it is allocated and utilized will become of greater concern to the academic community. The issue this paper examines is: Should institutions of higher education  cost-account space and physical plant operating and maintenance expenses to their academic units or programs? And if so, should fiscal responsibility include managerial control of the physical environment by those units? It is believed that if academic departments of colleges were financially responsible for their physical environment, the resources of the university's plant used in support of the academic mission would be more effectively utilized.

Receipt of the doctorate, the number and length of post-doctoral fellowships, and the achievement of tenure are temporal factors in academic careers. The change in timing of these factors is a form of adjustment to market conditions. The length of time it takes an individual to receive a Ph.D. from the time he finishes his B.A. is examined. Data from surveys of the American Council on Education and the National Research Council are cited for the discussion of changes in time to Ph.D. over time. The data cover comprehensively all doctorates received from U.S. universities. The American Council on Education Survey of Teaching Faculty, conducted in  1973, provides information on people currently employed in academia. A statistical model that separates age effects of time to Ph.D. from date effects is described. Implications of estimation results for the formal model are discussed, and graphs are included. (SW)",

The effort begins by specifying the purpose for which this measure is intended: centralized allocation, according to the equimarginal principle, of limited resources to alternative units producing education. It then specifies a simple and narrow goal that education is to meet: satisfaction of an individual student's preferences for market good, on-the-job consumption, and the direct benefits of education. Educational output is defined as a compensating variation, or lump-sum dollar amount. The measure depends upon the particular set of preferences chosen, and as a result there will, in general, be as many distinct and equally correct measures as there are students. Consideration of the  preferences of faculty and other relevant individuals will only add to the multiplicity of measures. It is concluded that centralized allocation of resources to alternative education units according to the equimarginal principle cannot be accomplished if the preferences of each individual student are to be taken into account.

The intercept interview was found to be of highest efficiency in terms  of time, money, and rate of return. Telephone surveys were found to be of high efficiency; however, controls over male/female ratio need to be exercised, and rates of telephone penetration and unlisted numbers must be considered.

Analysis of the student data base led to the identification of seven confusion tendencies that affect the perception of harmonies: bass line confusions, confusions by inversion, confusions by chord function, confusions by chord quality, unperceived sevenths, unperceived roots, and favorite response confusions. The level of student achievement on individual harmonies was found to be highly correlated with the percentage of times these harmonies are asked in the curriculum. (Author)",

To control the quality of this training, Computer Managed Instruction (CMI) is now incorporated into some of these packages. This CMI component uses a sequential probability algorithm that allows tests to vary in length depending upon the learner's skill level. This algorithm assures that the test results are statistically reliable while keeping the length of the tests as short as possible. All of the programs that make up this CMI system are written in BASIC; all of the CMI programs and data files for about 800 tests items will fit on a single, dual-density  diskette. These characteristics make the CMI system applicable to internal and large systems training as well as small systems training, because it is small enough to fit on a diskette yet sophisticated enough to handle more and larger item banks if additional disk space is available.

Of the 1,641 non-returning students who were sent questionnaires, 449 responded. Survey data on students' level of satisfaction with ACC, their employment status, and educational status is presented for respondents as a whole, and by sex, college major, and ethnic group. Highlights from the report include the following: over 50% indicated they intended to further pursue educational objectives they had partially completed at ACC; only 6.7% indicated dissatisfaction as a reason for not returning; of the 55% of respondents who were employed, 72% indicated their courses were of value in obtaining a job,  performing on the job, or in job advancement; 59% of those transferring to another school lost no credit hours; 67% were interested in taking additional courses at ACC; more males than females were \"very satisfied\" with the educational experience; males rated veterans' services highest in a group of services while women rated learning lab packages highest; all ethnic groups rated university transfer as their main reason for attending ACC; and 33.3% of the occupational and 26% of the university transfer respondents were \"very satisfied\" with their experiences.

        "description":"The staff development program for part-time teachers, designed and first implemented at Hagerstown Junior College (Maryland), became the basis of a model for a statewide program in June 1978. The goal of the program, which consisted of an interest inventory and workshops focusing on the teachers' five greatest concerns as revealed by the inventory, was to meet the needs of the part-time teachers in a limited time using instructors whose expertise had credibility. The interest inventory, which sought to identify the topics judged to be central to the teaching-learning process, and which asked for a ranking of topics of greatest concern and about willingness to participate in a workshop, was returned by half of the 400 part-time teachers at the 17 Maryland community colleges.  Workshop topics were developing performance objectives, developing effective lecture techniques, increasing student motivation, diagnosing teaching-learning problems, and using group process skills in the classroom. To facilitate dissemination of the results of the workshops, the sessions were videotaped for use on individual campuses as a basis for initiating staff development activity. Though workshop participant evaluations were positive, an assessment of the over-all impact of the model will include evaluations from those using the tapes. Appendices contain the interest inventory, workshop agenda, and workshop evaluation summary. (MB)",

The colleges' recommendations highlighted the following concerns: in-service training to deal with new community college clientele; improving information to students on available services; expanding use of paraprofessionals; and the need for follow-up on dropouts. A district planning team composed of counselors and administrators outlined the needs and objectives for implementing a program to serve the 150 counselors in the colleges. A three-phase staff development program, lasting from spring 1977  to December 1977 and using $39,500 of a $600,000 allocation by the trustees, was composed of the following: (1) four three-hour workshops held at each campus which focused on participant-selected topics; (2) a district-wide conference entitled &quot;Self-Renewal for Counselors&quot;; and (3) a ten-workshop program based on a&quot;Mini-U&quot; format. To be successful, any staff development program needs the support of the trustees, administration, and the participants. A literature review underscores the increased necessity for staff development caused by enrollment patterns and the reduction of new staff. (MB)",

Information was gathered in the following areas: current job status; salary; method of obtaining employment; work experience previous to college training; reasons for attending MCCC; education since leaving MCCC; four-year college attended; rating of the educational program and of the cooperative education experience; and suggestions and comments. Results showed that 65% of the co-op respondents were employed in program-related full-time jobs. The co-op  group was more likely to use college services when seeking employment. Only 3.57% of the co-op group was unemployed as compared to 6.5% of the non co-op group. Sixty-seven percent of the co-op group graduated from MCCC as compared to 39% of the non co-op group. Non co-op group respondents reported earning higher salaries. The employers who responded indicated a favorable rating of the employees trained at MCCC and they perceived those with co-op experience as more efficient and able to learn more quickly.

        "description":"The use of space for formal instruction in fall 1977 at the Center and South campuses of Macomb County Community College was examined for five time spans: prime time day (weekdays, 8 a.m.-1 p.m.), prime time night (Monday-Thursday, 6 p.m.-10 p.m.), prime time week (prime time day and night), afternoon (Monday-Thursday, 1 p.m.-6 p.m.), and schedule week (Monday-Friday, 7 a.m.-11 p.m., Saturday, 8 a.m.-4 p.m.). The ratio of room utilization to room availability was calculated in half hour time periods. The total number of half hour periods of use was divided by the total number of half hour periods of availability during the time spans and calculated for each room, building, campus, and the college as a whole. To determine whether there was a difference in the use of rooms because  of their function, each space was designated either a lecture room or a laboratory. Findings show that the college utilized 226 rooms for instruction; 146 were lecture rooms and 80 were laboratories. Except for during the afternoon, a lecture room was more likely to be in use than a laboratory. At both campuses, instructional space was more effectively used during evening prime time (75%) than during day prime time (62%). To identify space much or little used, a definition of \"normal\" was applied. A room in use 84% or more of the time was said to be used more than normally; one in use 16% or less of the time, less than normally. Tables outline data on room use by campus. (MB)",

        "description":"An examination of the grading policies at the 29 Michigan community colleges is presented. Six major classifications cover all grades given at the colleges: main grading system, pass-fail grades, withdrawal grades, incomplete grades, and audit options. The most common grade policy, used by 24 of the colleges, is the five grade system assigning both a letter and a number of honor or grade points to each grade. One college records only passing grades and does not assign any grade point value. Four colleges use variations of the honor point system which allow more distinctions within the range of excellent to failing, i.e., the decimal grade system (4.0, 3.5, 3.0, etc.) and the twelve point system (A+ 12, A 11, A- 10, etc.). Several schools, in addition to the grade point system,  have a second system where the student receives simply a mark of pass or fail. Seventeen colleges distinguish between a withdrawal made while the student is passing and one made while the student is failing. At seven schools the student who withdraws while failing is penalized by having those credit hours calculated in the GPA as if the course were failed. All the colleges have an incomplete grade though they differ in the time allotted for resolution of the incomplete. All but six colleges mention a system whereby a student can audit a class. State legislation requiring the reporting of student credit hours is also discussed. (MB)",

Co-op students were younger the first time they enrolled than non co-op students (an average of 19.9 years old compared to 25 years old). Male co-ops were more apt to be employed in program-related jobs; however, the co-op experience did not have the same effect on the women students. Graduation from the technical program, either co-op or non co-op, had little influence on students' ability to get a program-related job; participation in the  co-op option had a greater impact on employment than the fact of graduation. Co-op students completed significantly more technical courses and had higher final grade point averages (GPA). The co-op graduates did not have higher GPA's than the co-op non-graduates, but the non co-op graduates of the technical program had higher final GPA's than the non co-op non-graduates. There was no significant difference in students' GPA before and after the co-op experience.

        "description":"Within the system of higher education, the humanistic disciplines are an essential subsystem; a subsystem, however, on which the current emphasis on laborforce relevance is having particularly detrimental effects. The current state of the humanistic disciplines may be characterized as that of a state of recession. Some of the external factors contributing to the recession are the declining birthrate, inflation, and problems with financial support; within the field, problems of overspecialization and subsequent lack of marketable skills, and conflicts among educators about educational goals add to the condition. A first step in working out of the recession is for educators to establish for themselves goals and priorities centering around &quot;anthrocentric&quot; undergraduate education.  This focus would foster moral, aesthetic, and cognitive development while contributing to the quality of the laborforce; this is opposed to the &quot;contentcentric&quot; approach, which argues that humanistic education is an end in itself. A second step in revitalizing undergraduate humanistic education, is a concentration on instructional/curricular innovations which would focus on value clarification and contemporary ethical problem-solving with a view toward the future. Anthrocentric education thus requires that specialist and research competencies not be the primary criteria for the selection of professors for these undergraduate courses.

Examination of theoretical differences between the organismic model (which assumes an active organism) and mechanistic model (which assumes a reactive organism) suggests that a developmental perspective: (1) implies that behavioral observations must be analyzed with respect to their meaning in context; (2) raises the question of the meaningfulness of educational testing situations; (3) is important in the conceptualization of development in early childhood programs; and (4) leads to a shift away from a preoccupation with criterion performance to  a concern with the processes underlying performance. A developmental perspective also emphasizes: changes in cognitive structures rather than behavioral change per se; discontinuity rather than continuity of change; reciprocal causality between organism and environment rather than unidirectional causality of environment on organism; and organized complexity rather than linear causality in change. The implications of these model features for assessing program effectiveness are discussed. The rationale presented for working toward a developmental perspective in evaluation highlights the involvement of participants in understanding program development, adult (staff and parent) development, and child development.

A standardized interview indicated that subjects appropriately perceived the differences between coping and mastery models. Inexperienced patients who viewed either model were significantly less disruptive on the Behavior Profile Scale than inexperienced control subjects.

The review provides readers with (1) information allowing more effective evaluation of research involving symbolic play and (2) background for designing or adopting play measurement techniques for use in their own research. The first section concerns the definition of symbolic play and sequences of development that have been empirically observed. Discussion focuses on structural analysis of symbolic play behaviors, role and object substitution in symbolic play, and planning and sequencing of pretend acts. In the second section paradigms used in the various investigations are compared and inferences are made concerning the  influence of methodological choices on the results observed. Home vs. laboratory investigations, mother role in symbolic play studies, experimenter roles in play assessment, and toys and other objects are examined. The final section suggests research directions both for those who would investigate the nature and development of symbolic play, and for those who wish to measure symbolic play ability for comparison with other variables. Findings of the studies reviewed indicate that order of acquisition of the earlier types of symbolic play can be specified while sequencing of later appearing behaviors remains in question.

These studies of sixty 3-year-olds during one year in preschool, and 50 of these same children during 2 consecutive years in preschool, yielded findings indicating that children from economically disadvantaged homes fail in school more often than their more advantaged counterparts because they do not receive enough cognitive stimulation during a critical phase in their development and because their home environments are not  conducive to the development of effective cognitive and learning styles or problem solving strategies. Results also showed that (1) preschool education, begun with such children when they are 3 years old, can have significant immediate compensatory effects, but that (2) such effects are greater when the children are offered a well-organized program focusing on the development of conceptual abilities and representational skills and structured to meet each child's individual needs.

An initial definition of the policy problem focuses on the relationship between families as private systems that enhance human development and bureaucratic structures intended to maintain public good. Two levels of policy implications are identified: policy principles or goals and program options or choices for implementing principles. A review of the Administration for Children, Youth, and Families (ACYF) funded research projects on child welfare programs, child abuse and neglect services, day care regulation, child development programs, and youth development  services provides a major source of empirical information for the policy principles and options listed. These policy principles and options are categorized under (1) preschool child care (care of preschool children by adults other than the children's primary caregiver), (2) family participation (aspects of parent or sibling involvement in policies and programs aimed at strengthening their child rearing capacities), (3) work place issues (allocation of adult's time between child caring and market-place activities), and (4) delivery mechanisms (strategies for implementing federal policies affecting family life and child development).

        "description":"This epidemiological study investigates the question of whether there are sex-race group differences in factors responsible for school achievement in the early grades. Approximately 350 children enrolled in 18 schools were measured at the beginning of kindergarten and end of the 3rd grade for cognitive ability, social-emotional characteristics and school achievement. When the sex-race groups were examined separately, it was found that the white female group performed best at the end of the 3rd grade in all areas. Performance levels decreased in this order: white females, white males, black females, black males. Results of correlational and multiple regression analyses reported in this study indicate several differences among the sex-race groups. Cognitive ability appears to  account for more of the variance in reading achievement for whites than for blacks. Home background and other factors measured at kindergarten entrance are related to achievement, ability and social maturity at the end of 3rd grade only for the white males. Implications of the findings for theory of school achievement and for research are presented. The relation of school achievement to later health differences among the groups studied is also discussed. The advisability of separate sex-race group analysis before making conclusions for the total group is indicated. (Author/RH)",

Among recommendations were that schools of social work within major Indian  regions adopt a schema for inclusion of American Indian content into social work curriculum; that an Indian perspective include an American Indian Advisory Curriculum Committee; and that administrators of schools of social work make available to their faculty members resources according to the needs identified by the Curriculum Task Force.

Recognizing the wide diversity of definitions for rural and nonmetropolitan, and understanding that rural youth are faced with economic and educational disadvantagement, the councils feel that their challenge is to work toward creating rural economic opportunities that will enhance the quality of community life and reflect community values. Toward that end, 10 propositions have been developed. While several propositions deal with the roles rural work-education councils should fulfill in providing various opportunities for rural youth, other propositions are: because national data do not  adequately reflect the dimensions of rural living, the councils should collect, develop, and disseminate more relevant, accurate, and usable data regarding local rural communities; expansion of education and training opportunities must be balanced by and integrated with the development of appropriate employment opportunities; and rural communities need to develop collaborative models that respond to and grow out of local styles, customs, and modes of organization. Each proposition is accompanied by background and a section on &quot;action initiatives&quot; for implementation. A list of references concludes the document. (BR)",

Educational delivery at the community college level suffers unique problems because it takes place in a milieu of sparse population and limited opportunities for employment, cultural activities, and full social services. On the other hand, these colleges have a great opportunity to initiate and conduct programs and services to enhance educational, economic, cultural, recreational, and civic development in rural areas. It is recommended that the following principles adopted by the Task Force on Rural Community Colleges be circulated to public boards, agencies,  legislatures, and Congress: (1) equal educational opportunity demands that public policy-making bodies provide for comprehensive curriculum and service programs in all community colleges regardless of size or geographic location; (2) equity in funding depends on allowing for higher operation costs per unit in smaller, rural community colleges; (3) accreditation evaluation should be done by representatives from peer institutions; (4) federal funds are not equalizing education for students of two-year colleges (in fact, existing inequalities are increasing); and (5) development of rural community college literature and a research base is vital.

In the 12-month period centered on April 1977, the farm population was 7,806,000, or 450,000 fewer farm residents (5.4%) than in 1976 and 1.9 million fewer (19.6%) than in 1970. However, the 3.3% annual rate of net outmigration (average amount of net migration and reclassification as a percentage of average farm population) for 1970-77 was below the 5-6% rates of the fifties and sixties. Among the country's four geographic regions, the South continued to be the heaviest loser; the West has shown some stability in farm population since 1970. In 1977, the North Central  states had almost half the total U.S. farm population (46%), followed by the South (34%), West (12%), and Northeast (7%). As to components of farm population change (births, deaths, net change from migration and residence reclassification), in the April 1976-77 period, 27,000 more births than deaths partly offset the total of 474,000 persons lost through migration or reclassification. For the 1970-77 period, average net loss through migration and reclassification to nonfarm was 301,000 annually, with an average of 28,000 more farm births than deaths. (RS)",

The majority of the paper is given to a description of the sampling and data gathering techniques used. Throughout, an emphasis is placed on procedures used and decisions made together with the reasoning behind the decisions made. Actions taken which reduced the experimental design power and advantages of using the design are discussed. It is concluded that the experimental design deserves to be  considered in the evaluator's tools to be used in improving both the decision-making process and the resulting decisions. (Author/HM)",

A stratified random sample of junior and senior high school science teachers from three regions (12 states) of the United States was selected to respond to a questionnaire and an attitude measure. The questionnaire contained 20 items dealing with teacher satisfaction on teaching skills and 25 items dealing with teacher satisfaction on school conditions. Results showed that both junior and senior high school teachers rated their knowledge and abilities as satisfactory to good on all the 20 ability items. However, five of these items showed a significant difference between the ratings of the junior and senior high school teachers. Results showed also that the junior high  teachers rated their school conditions as significantly poorer than did the senior high school teachers on eight of the 25 items. It was concluded that these science teachers are generally satisfied with their own abilities, but believe their school conditions need improvement. (HM)",

A stratified random sample was selected of 236 secondary science teachers including 84 biology teachers, 111 chemistry teachers, and 41 physics teachers from 14 states. The selected science teachers completed four instruments. Each teacher randomly selected one of his/her classes to complete four instruments. Stepwise regression and canonical correlation were used to analyze the data. Results showed that the selected teacher characteristics accounted for one-fifth to one-third of the total variance in student scores. It was also indicated that the self-improvement  variable seemed to be the most consistent predictor for student outcomes. (HM)",

A randomly selected group of junior and senior high school science teachers and randomly selected classes of theirs were administered achievement tests in science. Chi square and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were used to analyze the data. Participation in NSF Science Institutes and geographic regions were factors in a two-way ANCOVA. Class mean for achievement was the dependent variable and teacher achievement was the covariate. NSF participation was found to be a significant factor in student achievement for high school teachers but not for junior high school  teachers. The study was replicated for mathematics teachers and classes and the same results were found. It was concluded that significance at the senior high school and nonsignificance at the junior high level may be due to the difference in subject matter taught and the population of students between the two levels.

A stratified random sample of secondary schools from three regions was selected. The principal of each sampled school randomly selected a biology, chemistry or physics teacher who, in turn, randomly selected one of his classes to complete two instruments: Learning Environment Inventory (LEI); and the Test of Achievement in Science (TAS). The statistical procedures used were multivariate and univariate analyses of variance, and discriminant function analyses. Achievement level (high, middle, low) and science course (biology, chemistry, physics) were the two independent factors. The combined mean score for each science course on ten scales of LEI were  the dependent variables. Results showed that there were significant differences between the students' perception of their environment in the three science courses. (HM)",

Two variables--number of semester hours credit in mathematics, and grade level of teaching--accounted for 61 percent of the observed NTE score variance. Predicted and obtained NTE scores were compared for a trichotomous division of teachers into low, middle, and high achievement. The prediction seems adequate for use in classifying teachers by achievement in research studies without requiring costly and time-consuming testing. (Author/HM)",

This group emphasized the need to collect information on the degree to which an innovative course is implemented for the purpose of taking corrective action to achieve full installation before performance data are collected. The second approach is associated with the work of Stallings, who limited the evaluation to classrooms in which the key elements of an innovation actually had been implemented by classroom teachers. The third approach emerged from the work of Hall and Loucks. It suggests eight levels of use of an implementation. The fourth approach is the approach suggested by the author to maximize the  information from experimental implementation of innovative courses. It requires completion of eleven steps. Assumptions, disadvantages and advantages of this approach are also discussed. (HM)",

Completed questionnaires were returned by 62% of the volunteers who were in the field at the time of the survey. Analyses were conducted to provide basic descriptive information about volunteers, information on differences between groups or types of volunteers, and an examination of a few special issues. Comparisons were made between the results of the 1975 and 1976 surveys. Some of the results are: (1) 67% and 69% of the respondents to the 1975 and 1976 surveys, respectively, reported that their jobs were useful to the development of the host country; (2) 83% and 84% of the respondents reported that they were positive in their feelings toward the host country people; and (3) the  respondents to the 1975 and 1976 surveys had mean scores of 495 and 500 on the volunteer Psychological Well-Being Index.

        "description":"This study proposes that children's phonological behavior at Stage VI of sensorimotor development may show markedly decreased variability compared to children at Stage V. According to Piaget, sensorimotor development during Stage VI is distinguished from preceding stages by the onset of representational ability and ability to form mental combinations. Twenty normally developing children, half of whom were at the &quot;one-word&quot; stage and the other at the &quot;two-word&quot; stage (respectively V and VI), were seen for a minimum of two and a maximum of four sessions within a period of six weeks. A controlled experimental playroom with normal environmental stimuli and a standard set of objects and books were used. The Ordinal Scales of Psychological Development (Uzgiris and Hunt, 1975) were  administered, and samples of nonimitative speech were taken. The data were subjected to analyses of production variability, optional processes, and phone classes. Results indicated: (1) Children at Stage VI manifested significantly less production variability than at Stage V; (2) a greater relative number of optional processes were necessary in describing Stage VI phonological behavior; (3) Stage VI children showed a greater number of phone classes per child; and (4) a marked decrease in variability correspondence of word-initial sounds was evident. The study concludes that there is significantly less variability in the phonological behavior of children at Stage VI than at Stage V, suggesting a degree of discontinuity in phonological development.

        "author":["Hakuta, Kenji"],
        "description":"Comprehension of reversible active and passive sentences was studied with 48 Japanese children between the ages of two and six. Four types of sentences were constructed using passive and active structures and two word orders: subject-object-verb (SOV) and object-subject-verb (OSV). The basic order of elements in a simple sentence in Japanese is SOV, but the order of the subject and the object can be interchanged to yield OSV. This reversal is possible because Japanese has postposed particles that mark grammatical role. To test comprehension with the four types of sentences, the children were required to act out the sentences using toy animals. In a production task, which immediately followed the comprehension task, subjects described what they saw on a slide viewer. Results  suggest that children between the ages of three years, three months, and four years, two months, require a certain correlation between particles and their position in a sentence (particles are position-specific). Only children between five years, three months, and six years, two months, appear to begin freeing themselves from the constraints of word order and interpreting sentences based on the information conveyed by particles alone. A second experiment was conducted on the comprehension of complex active sentences, using the act-out procedure, with 39 children between the ages of three years, three months, and six years, two months. Findings suggest that the constraints of word order in comprehension of particles in Japanese children operate differentially, depending on the  construction. (SW)",

        "description":"The development of sentence coordination in children using sentences conjoined by \"and\" was studied to test the adequacy of the transformationally based derivational theory of complexity. Two cross-sectional experiments were conducted using 18 sentence types with children between the ages of three and five. One experiment used an elicited imitation procedure, and the other used an act-out comprehension procedure. It was found that sentential coordinations were no easier than phrasal coordinations and that forward forms were not easier than backward forms. Predictions based on the derivational theory of complexity were not supported. A second analysis was carried out on the data from the imitation experiment. There were significantly more elaborations and reduction responses in  the four-year-olds than in either of the two age groups. Spontaneous speech protocols from a longitudinal study of three children were also analyzed, and the data show that the earlier forms of coordination to appear in children are phrasal forms. The forward forms have a primacy over the backward forms in both the spontaneous speech and elicited production data, but not in the comprehension and imitation data. This asymmetry may be due to a planning difficulty for the backward forms. It is concluded that the ontogenesis of coordination is not well described by the derivational theory of complexity. (SW)",

The purpose of the study was to find out where and how this transition occurred between the pure Bhojpuri-speaking area and the pure Maithili-speaking area by surveying the area in between. To gather linguistic data, lists were elicited, and a sociolinguistic questionnaire, involving tape recording and oral questioning, was administered. It is concluded that caste dialects do not have an influence on the dialect transition of this survey area, but there is evidence that social-patterning dialects exist. This means that certain groups of people have certain social  patterns in common and that there is more social interaction within this group than between groups. These social-pattern groups may or may not correspond to castes. The likeness percentages and the sociolinguistic scale table both showed that the transition is mainly a gradual, geographical transition from west to east, from Bhojpuri to Maithili. (NCR)",

Based on each professional group's income profile, loan repayments were computed for each year of repayment and summed across alternative repayment periods to arrive at the aggregate ability to repay during the repayment period. Manageable aggregate ability to repay for each graduate and professional group was then converted into manageable loan principal limits for loans with alternative interest rates, amortization periods, and repayment plans (equal installment and graduate repayment option). The simulated manageable educational debt levels were intended to illustrate the relationship between the  hypothetical prospective income of selected professional groups and their theoretical ability to repay educational loans. Borrowers may want to elect a graduated repayment option and to extend the repayment period from 10 to 15 years if their total educational indebtedness exceeds a threshold amount. Separate borrowing limits and graduated repayment option plans could be established under the Guaranteed Student Loan Program for borrowers in different professions. Simulated loan principal limits were run for the following groups: males with five or more years of college, law students, medical students, and doctoral scientists and engineers. Eleven tables and formulas for estimating loan repayments are included. (SW)",

As a consequence the once sharp distinctions between youth and adult students, campus and extension education, and traditional and nontraditional clients are giving way to recognition of greater heterogeneity in student populations. The growth in the number of part-time students has been advantageous in a time of declining full-time enrollments. At the same time, the trend has caused concern and some changes in several areas of higher education, including institutional finance, student recruitment, academic programs, teaching, support services, and student participation in campus activities. As a result,  policies for this new majority in higher education will be shaped in the forseeable future by very different and more changeable social and educational priorities, requiring much more flexibility in higher education, even from year to year.

Three volumes issued by the Carnegie Council on Policy Studies deal with the problems and issues of the college curriculum. One volume, by Frederick Rudolph, is a historical survey of the American undergraduate curriculum. A second volume deals with the major issues of the 1970s, and an undergraduate curriculum handbook duplicates much of what is in the other volumes. Curriculum improvement is addressed by Chickering, Halliburton, Bergquist, and Lindquist (1977) in a project for the Council for the Advancement of Small Colleges. The handbook is designed for faculty and administrators. An effort that is helpful in defining the minimal competencies of a college graduate has been made by  four scholars writing under the auspices of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission (1977). A small volume by Boyer and Kaplan discusses the need for a core curriculum. A proposal for a core curriculum at Harvard University, a California task force's proposed changes in general education, and an effort at Columbia University to &quot;reintegrate&quot; the university through general education are noted. Belknap and Kuhns (1977) discuss general education, and innovations and attempted reforms of the past two decades are treated in a volume by Grant and Riesman (1978). Trends that are outlined in this newsletter include the current pressures toward unity after a period of much diversity. The shift in thinking about curricula represents a turning from change and innovation to reform and  restructuring. (SW)",

Responses represented 47 of the 51 districts, and 68 of the 96 schools with a twelfth grade. Of the total 5,123 seniors identified, 2,499 returned the questionnaire. Four types of variables of questions were included: demographic characteristics of the student, high school experiences, postsecondary plans, and detailed plans of respondents planning or pursuing some type of postsecondary education. Two specific questions that were analyzed are: how seniors planning to attend differ  from those who are not, and where seniors planning to go to college intend to go and what factors enter into that choice. Seniors were found to be quite satisfied with their high school experiences, but a large number feel in need of additional assistance or education in deciding on a career or education, improving mathematics skills, expressing their ideas in writing, and improving reading skills. The great majority of seniors who plan to pursue education at a postsecondary level plan to leave Alaska. A sample survey form is appended. (SW)",

One reason for this appears to be that even highly motivated women lack confidence in their abilities and are discouraged from seeking demanding careers by others. Recently, a growing number of older \"reentry\" women are entering college. These women have an even greater difficulty developing a positive view of their academic competence. Extensive research has demonstrated the importance of attributions or beliefs about why success or failure occurs in understanding achievement-oriented behavior. Ability, effort, motivation, luck, difficulty of a task, and outside help or hindrance are among the causal attributions that can be made. Models in the  literature are examined that conceptualize the the attributional process and discuss causal attributions and general expectations for women, the perpetuation of existing expectancies, and women's own expectations and the attribution of causes of one's own performance. It has been found that reentry women tend to feel insecure about their academic competence and that the housewife role may have added to this. Additional problems include feelings of guilt, and the reactions of others to their reentry, including family, classmates, and instructors. Reentry women appear to have three basic needs: training in basic academic skills such as how to write papers; adequate child care; and women in similar situations with whom they can talk. (JMD)",

        "description":"A summary is presented of data available on graduate tuition and fees, numbers of graduate programs and degrees conferred, and residence and mobility of graduate and first-professional students in the 13 states that comprise the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education. Graduate tuition levels in the 13 western states vary widely for both resident and nonresident students. The median resident tuition was $545 compared to a median nonresident tuition of $l,632. Despite these tuition barriers, large numbers of students do migrate to attend graduate and first-professional school. Only three states experienced a net out-migration of graduate students in Fall 1975. Only four states attracted more first-professional students than the number of their state residents attending  first-professional schools in other states. The migration of graduate and first-professional students has not been the subject of policy research and evaluation from a regional perspective, nor has the impact of tuition rates been viewed from a regional planning perspective. Appendices provide 1977-78 graduate tuition and fees at public institutions in the west; Ph.D. programs available in six western states, number of doctoral degrees awarded, and average number of degrees awarded per program in 1975-76; and graduate enrollment at state universities and land grant colleges during the Fall of 1976 and 1977.

        "description":"The problem-oriented medical record, developed by Lawrence L. Weed, M.D., involves an interactive computer system and has been operational on two wards at the University Hospital in Burlington, Vermont, a teaching hospital. The Problem-Oriented Medical Information System (PROMIS) consists of terminals that feed into the central memory units; the terminals can be wheeled to the patient's bedside. Displays indicate first the common and then less common diseases that can be attributed to the patient's symptoms. Other displays logically lead the physician to a treatment plan through references from the medical literature and other considerations. The system also maintains problem-oriented progress notes. The system is designed to educate a new physician and other health practitioners  who are patient-centered, team-oriented, and who relate to patients as mutual participants. Physicians must be trained and educated differently under this system. Under a restructured medical curriculum, it should be possible to train more people for less expense. The system creates conditions under which medical care can become coordinated in its delivery and potentially less costly both because tests are not done unless absolutely necessary and because the physician is warned not to do something in treating one problem that will complicate another. To the extent that &quot;experts&quot; create guidance tools that other members of the health team can use, costs can be lowered. The present system of provider-centered health care will be restructured to be patient-centered if the PROMIS system is  accepted by the medical community. (SW)",

Usable data were received from 311 institutions for a response rate of 91 percent. National estimates were obtained by weighting each response by the ratio of the number of institutions in the population to the number that responded. Nearly half of the doctoral and professional institutions offered some form of special  recruitment, academic, or financial aid program to benefit female or minority graduate students. The degree of involvement varied by the control of the institution as well as by the type, with universities and public institutions being the most active. Certain fields of graduate study, notably law and medicine, reported an above average level of effort.

The sample was comprised of 52 percent male and 48 percent female, and the class breakdown was 43 percent freshmen, 28 percent sophomores, 9 percent seniors, and 2 percent no classification. Black undergraduates were more concerned with studying efficiently and earning satisfactory grades than were non-blacks. Blacks were also more certain of their career goals, although they felt a greater need for educational  counseling. Blacks and non-blacks felt faculty were interested in them, and were sufficiently available for assitance with class work. Blacks considered financial problems to be the main reason they may have to withdraw from school. Blacks were more interested than non-blacks in student organizations (other than fraternities and sororities). Fewer blacks owned cars, and more lived on campus than non-blacks. Blacks dated less, visited the Student Union more, and watched TV more. (SW)",

Their spring 1969 semester grades, ACT (or converted SAT) composite scores, and responses to selected items on the 1969 University Student Census were compared. Nonstatistically significant differences were found on academic or biographical variables. Fraternity members differed from independents in their opinions on only two items: they more frequently felt they had been leaders in high school, and agreed more than independents that students had ample opportunity to participate in university policy-making. The failure of anticipated differences to appear in  such areas as racial attitudes and academic versus social emphases may be a function of small sample size. The expectation of differences may also be inaccurate stereotypes of individuals, based on group behaviors. (Author/SW)",

A random sample of 540 subjects were administered a Likert Scale to evaluate 17 statements on the USC, and these 17 items were factor analyzed. Results indicate a rather consistent behaviorial validation for the alienation scale. The more alienated students knew fewer faculty, felt more need for counseling, and fewer of their fathers attended the University of Maryland. Another finding was that students who dated more felt more alienated. It  could be that the more active students on campus (including socially active) tend to be more critical of the university and therefore more alienated. The scale focuses on alienation from the university, and this alienation could be seen as independent of alienation from peers. It is further possible that students alienated from the school seek involvement elsewhere. Results also indicate that new students (freshmen or transfer) anticipated less alienation than other students felt. (Author/SW)",

The programs involved the use of a stand-alone computer-based system for evaluating and training recruit company commanders and for obtaining information needed for managing Recruit Training Command operations in general. In accomplishing these functions, the computer controlled the operation of a videotape player and a card reader in addition to some more traditional components of a computer-based training system. A new computer language was developed especially for facilitating the transfer of some programs previously prepared in PLATO IV coding to a  form compatible with the current computer system. Preliminary efforts to evaluate the feasibility and desirability of these programs indicated that the system can operate as intended in the operational setting and that its acceptance by Recruit Training Command personnel is generally favorable. The results also indicated that the system would entail relatively small expenditures to acquire, operate, and maintain. (Author/CMV)",

The R&amp;M model is the first of three models that comprise a modeling system for use in LCC analysis of avionics systems. The total system will provide the Air Force with an enhanced in-house capability to incorporate LCC considerations early in the system acquisition process. As part of the overall modeling system, the R&amp;M model provides estimates of failure rates, maintenance manpower requirements, support equipment requirements, and spares requirements which are used to generate estimates of system support costs. When operated in a stand-alone mode, the R&amp;M model can be  utilized to analyze the impact of various avionics design configurations on system support requirements. This report describes the R&amp;M model in detail. The technical approach is discussed in general and then specific terms. Particular attention is given to the analysis that led to the model specification and to the model's functional description in terms of input, output, and process. A specific example calculation is given to illustrate how the model can be utilized to conduct an R&amp;M study. (Author)",

Two experiments are described which extend laboratory work on delay compensation schemes to the simulation of formation flight in the research device, Advanced Simulation for Pilot Training (ASPT). Both studies were geared to determining break-points for low-pass filters that would allow adequate flying control performance and provide an acceptable display. One experiment represented a factorial combination of settings of the display filters and the non-visual cues of aircraft motion provided by the g-seat and motion platform, and the second represented a simple  comparison of filter settings. Both studies indicated that, at least for formation flight, there is a range of filter settings which will not adversely affect flight control and will adequately suppress visual flutter. This range represents half-power settings for the filters of three-fourths to one Hertz. (Author/CMV)",

Work on computer-oriented speech was concerned with improving the facilities and procedures for utilizing the speech system software and the Micro Intoned Speech Synthesizer (&quot;MISS machine&quot;), as well as the continued development and improvement of sentential synthesis through intonation contouring with word concatenation. In the three complex teaching programs studied, work included the completion of the writing of audio and display only versions of lessons in a portion of the logic course, improving the interface with curriculum and lessons for the proof theory course. In the area of  teaching beginning reading, a study in which three systems of computer-generated speech were compared to each other and a human-voice control on the task of producing individual letter sounds was designed and conducted with a group of first graders as subjects. A comparison of the three systems on a more complete list of sounds was carried out with fifth grade students. Experimental objectives, procedures, and results are detailed for each area, and a bibliography is provided. (BBM)",

Although remediation programs vary from one college to another, they share some common characteristics. Most programs include a placement component, two or three courses in arithmetic and algebra, and support services like tutoring, laboratory activities, and counseling. Objectives usually include helping the student to: (1) acquire basic arithmetic and algebra skills; (2) become mathematically literate; (3) gain confidence and self-respect in mathematics; (4) develop positive attitudes toward mathematics; and (5) prepare for further studies in mathematics or for entry into technical, vocational, or business programs. Attempts to evaluate these programs  tend to either focus on specific objectives, like the extent to which remedial courses prepare students for further studies in mathematics, or on the evaluation of instructional strategies themselves. Although it is known that remedial programs provide students with essential skills in arithmetic and elementary algebra and that certain instructional methods promote positive attitudes, studies provide conflicting evidence about the effectiveness of the programs and the most appropriate of the 16 studied instructional strategies.

        "description":"A budgetary process that serves a college in an era of expansion is likely to break down when the resource base is reduced and tough-minded decisions about priorities are required. This paper describes a resource allocation system that Gadsden State Junior College developed and tested over a two-year period to respond to fiscal contraction. Key elements of the system are an enrollment-driven program costing procedure, a faculty-based Priorities Advisory Committee, and integration of budgeting with the college's planning system to permit resource allocations to be related to attainment of institutional goals and priorities. Outlined are definitions of specific problems; objectives of the budgetary process; three alternative approaches to incremental budgeting--outcome-oriented  budgeting, formula budgeting, and cost analysis; methodology of incorporating the best of each approach into the budget process; and results of Gadsden's experience. It is concluded that (1) financial contraction alone doesn't necessarily lead to a re-examination of programs in relation to the educational outcomes which are produced or the community needs served; (2) formula budgeting combined with cost analysis seems to fit the needs of the college's administrators; and (3) the \"homegrown\" process is responsive to the unique needs and the style of the college.

Four areas to assess include: (1) administrative views and support; (2) present level of staff development activities; (3) institutional and personal/professional needs; and (4) internal and external resources available to the institution. A statement of philosophy for the staff development program should be developed and approved by those for whom the program is designed. The organization of the program must be appropriate to the limitations and resources of the institution. This organization can include an advisory committee, a full-time coordinator, and the college staff members themselves. A wide variety of  activities including development of program materials, methods of improving instruction, and off-campus meetings must be designed to meet the various needs of all the constituencies represented in the institution. Appropriate incentives and rewards must also be made available to the participants. An adequate level of funding is needed for the successful implementation of the program. Finally, there must be an evaluation of the overall program, including indications of improvement in the development of individual staff members. (Author/MB)",

Questionnaires were used to assess faculty and student monthly expenditures and amounts maintained in local banks. Other data considered were: expenditures to county vendors, compensation to faculty and students, payments from other than college operating funds, payments to government agencies, and bank balances for the student tuition account. The study revealed that the county contributed $2,637,000 to the college and the college then brought state money ($5,027,848), federal money ($1,062,194), and student tuition  ($4,703,527) back into county circulation. Taking into account the multiplier effect of reinvested money, for each dollar the county contributed, ten dollars were returned to the local economy through direct college expenditures and purchases of individuals associated with the college. The total local economic impact generated by the college fell within 24 to 29.5 million dollars annually. Projections are included in the report for changes in enrollments (increases or decreases), for chargebacks caused by students going elsewhere, and for changes occurring if there were no college in Rockland County.

The study attempted to identify policies and procedures that help or hinder articulation; develop recommendations for federal, state, and local jurisdictions to promote  cooperative working relationships; disseminate the findings; and establish a mechanism to foster continued cooperation between AACJC and AVA. From materials gathered from a nationwide survey focusing on administrative practices which facilitate or impede articulation, five case studies were prepared representing successful articulation at institutes of different size, wealth, tradition, type of control, and with different student needs. Governance, curriculum development, and financing are considered for each program. Resulting recommendations concern finance on both state and federal levels, data systems, credentialing and credits, the role of vocational education, and planning. (MB)",

The advantages of the entire population and random sample surveys are considered, as well as when during the year to conduct the survey. Practical suggestions stress up-to-date address files, timing of mailings, cover letters, postage, costs, computer processing,  non-response bias, telephone checks, and checking for differences on demographic characteristics and between early and late respondents. Use and distribution of the survey results to interested parties are also explored.

        "description":"A survey by the Los Angeles Times indicated that only 18% of the 64% of the Californians who voted for Proposition 13 did so with the hope that expenditures for education would be reduced. However, because financial support for both kindergarten through twelfth grades and community colleges have come largely from local sources, these two segments of education were hit hard by the limitation of local revenue; harder than were the University of California State Universities and Colleges. Effects of Proposition 13 have been both positive and negative. Cutbacks necessitated administrative reorganization which has improved efficiency and effectiveness. On the other hand, enrollments for fall 1978 declined by about 6%, many programs were cut, and almost 5,000 instructors lost their  jobs. One alternative is tuition, but the question arises as to which segments of the student population this would affect most in terms of continued enrollment. California public education must focus on long-range rather than short-term policies and come to grips with important issues of governance, financing, and program offerings. Problems will be greater in 1979-80 when colleges attempt to operate under another emergency bill funded from surplus state revenues. Unless the legislature is more generous, it is questionable whether or not all colleges can remain as &quot;people's colleges&quot; with a comprehensive mission. (MB)",

Interviews were conducted with persons at both state and institutional levels. The study report is divided into five sections: (1) an overview of postsecondary education in North Dakota, including information about state agencies as well as educational institutions; (2) a summary of legislation related to the development of school district junior colleges  and educational centers; (3) detailed information about the institutions themselves with emphasis on existing patterns of governance and financing; (4) alternatives for the future as reflected in structures and procedures used by other states; and (5) conclusions and recommendations. Supplemental statements on the state of community colleges in North Dakota are provided by Eugene Lehrmann (Wisconsin Board for Vocational, Technical, and Adult Education), Ben Morton (West Virginia Board of Regents), John Mundt (Washington State Board for Community College Education), and Herbert Hengst (Center for Studies in Higher Education, Oklahoma). Appendices contain the proposal for the study, excerpts from the North Dakota education code, recommendations from a previous study, and a bibliography.  (Author/MB)",

Father's high or low job complexity is thought to be related to parental values for either self-direction or conformity, respectively. A conceptual model of possible relations model of possible relations among social origins, parental values, cognitive complexity, and schooling processes was developed and model variables were operationalized. Data obtained from 460 twelfth grade students and their mothers through school records, interviews with mothers, and school-administered questionnaires were factor analyzed with data from seven independent  populations. The analysis strongly supports the presence of a self-direction/conformity dimension in parental desires for appropriate conduct in their children. Data from the 12th grade students and their mothers reveal father's occupation to be the primary determinant of parental valuation of self-direction/conformity within racial groups. Black mothers valued conformity more than did white mothers. No sex effect on maternal valuation was found. Measured intelligence was found to be consistently more important in mediating the effects of social origins than are parental self-direction/conformity values. Findings on the whole do not provide strong support for the hypothesized link between parental social position, parental values and the adolescent schooling experience.  (Author/RH)",

The following principles for the selection of interactional focus are identified and discussed: (1) the teacher's understanding of her own situation; (2) strengthening (the teachers) worthwhile dispositions; (3) teacher competencies already acquired; (4) building long term relationships; and (5) providing moderate amounts of inspiration. General techniques for working with teachers are described under the following headings: (1) maintain an optimal distance between yourself and the teachers you are working with; (2) cultivate the habit of  suspending judgment on what you observe; (3) phrase suggestions in experimental form; (4) avoid the temptation to stop a pattern behavior; (5) help the teacher to re-define her job so that it is achievable; (6) act as a neutralizer of conflicts; (7) use demonstrations of your own skills cautiously; (8) share your understanding of how a teacher sees you; and (9) resist the temptation to &quot;use&quot; teachers to get to the children.

        "description":"A program designed to improve behaviors characteristic of impulsivity and inhibition by enhancing children's real-life problem solving thinking skills is provided for use by parents and teachers of four- and five-year-old children. Twenty minutes of daily lessons are administered in small groups (or to a single child at home), in combination with problem solving dialoguing techniques when real problems arise at school or at home. The two problem solving skills that most highly relate to improved behavior are ability to: (1) name alternative solutions to interpersonal problems (e.g., wanting a toy another child has), and (2) name relevent consequences of an act (e.g., grabbing that toy). Studies have shown that problem solving training not only helps to improve existing behavioral  difficulties, but follow-up of youngsters from nursery to kindergarten shows that adjusted youngsters in nursery are less likely to show behavior problems in kindergarten if trained than if not trained.

It is suggested that parenting should become a more cooperative process involving everyone in the community, particularly school personnel. Parent/teacher teaming, based on a common understanding of developmental objectives, is advocated as a tactic for achieving effective home-school relationships. Several ways of facilitating sustained home-school interaction, including parent-school cooperative child care, parent-child lending libraries, and parent advisory teams, are briefly described. Examples of school, community, university  and agency sponsored parent education programs are presented and their implications for schools are assessed. Criteria for effective parenting and characteristics of development sensitive parents are suggested. Guides for effective parent and teacher communication are offered. (Author/RH)",

(2) What kinds of transformations in these behaviors take place during development? and (3) How do rearing experiences influence these behaviors? Data related to these questions were obtained from several age groups and through different methods. Children 10 months to 2-1/2 years were studied in the home environment by trained mothers who functioned as research assistants. Children 3-1/2-5-1/2 years were studied under experimental conditions. Children 5-8 years were studied in nursery schools and day camps through naturalistic and systematic observation. Among the findings, developmentally changing behaviors  were noted: children's response to the distress of another begins (around 10-12 months) with agitated facial expressions and/or crys of distress and proceeds through touching or rubbing the injured person and, later to trying on feelings by deliberate imitation and self-referencing or immediate taking on the emotion of the injured other. An increase in altruism appears to require a combination of conditions in which caregivers have a nurturant relationship with the child and actively demonstrate altruism in behavior toward people in distress.

Possible models for effecting child care policy are discussed and emphasis is given to the development of the interactive model which is viewed as having good potential for uniting issues of child care and public policy. Part II consists of a summary of an extensive survey of federal programs assisting disadvantaged children from birth to age 9, which was used as a focus for further exploration by  conference participants. The survey examines the importance of critical periods and early experience, interventions, prediction from childhood to adult characteristics and goals and standards of programs. Evaluations of early childhood intervention programs are discussed. Recommendations for child care program planning are advanced. Part III includes participants' critiques of the survey of federal programs, a brief summary of conference discussions, and a statement linking child care and public policy. (Author/RH)",

The SASB model of two-person social interactions defines behavioral opposites, complements, antidotes and introjections. The model describes dyadic social interactions in terms of focus, affiliation, interdependence and topic. Topics include: primitive basics; approach-avoidance; need fulfillment, contact, nurturance; attachment; logic and communication; attention to self development; balance in relationship; intimacy-distance; and identity. The model has been confirmed by factor analysis, circumplex analysis, dimensional ratings and autocorrelations.

        "description":"In this investigation of group problem solving in small groups, performance on a tower-building task was studied in same-sex triads of 141 third grade children exposed to four instructional conditions, each consisting of three phases of six trials each. Instructional conditions were either determinate (i.e., individualistic or contrient reward structures) or indeterminate (i.e., undesignated or no rewards). In Phase One and Three of the task, triad members were equally rewarded (i.e., promotive reward structure). In Phase Two members received rewards according to different instructional conditions. Four measures of group performance were obtained. Two-factor multivariate analyses of variance were conducted, with repeated measures on Phase Two. Results of this study and the  reanalysis of a previous study indicate that discrepancy scores between most and least contributing group members increased over time regardless of the instructional condition to which the group was exposed. In regard to indeterminate conditions, the change from promotive to no reward contingencies resulted in the maintenance of cooperative strategies. Change from promotive to undesignated reward contingencies resulted in a shift to individualistic performances. Generally, the children interpreted current task demands in terms of current goals, and transitions between cooperation, competition, and individualization were immediate. Further research into the interaction of contextual factors and immediate goal structures is recommended. (Author/RH)",

Findings include: the University of California's position is that library services are an important and integral part of the University's academic programs; a University of California Library Task Force advocates that high quality instruction and research can be maintained only with adequate financial support for high quality library services; no new academic program can be started unless library costs and  resources are determined first; two basic models are available for the delivery of library services to Chicano studies--a decentralized and a centralized model; there is a need to increase communication and interaction between the Chicano Studies Program and the Chicano Studies Library if both are to develop into more effective units. Among the recommendations are that: a Chicano Studies Library Advisory Committee be established either concurrent with, or subsequent to, the work of the task force; all Chicano Studies instructors be required to submit to the Chicano Studies Library a textbook and reference book list for respective courses, which the Library will purchase on a first priority basis.

This model identifies cultural values, beliefs, and behavioral characteristics that may be causing internal stress and doubt. It also provides the counselor information concerning the individual's cultural awareness and loyalty, which are measured with a cultural assessment instrument. This scale consists of 151 questions, which comprise 6 variables: language, cultural heritage, ethnic interaction, ethnic pride and identity, ethnic distance and perceived discrimination, and generational proximity to Mexico. By means of this scale,  the counselor can develop a cultural treatment plan designed to treat those variables that the client is weak in and reinforce those that are the client's strengths. The treatment plan is based on the belief that traditional methods and modalities of treating Chicano alcoholics are unsatisfactory and that more culturally relevant treating modalities are necessary. In keeping with this, the client undergoes a treatment plan which includes cultural awareness, training in self-identity and pride in self and, therefore, learns to become a productive member of his or her cultural group. This paper discusses and describes this bilingual-bicultural counseling model, cultural conflict as a probable cause for Chicano alcoholism, and Casa Del Sol's position on treatment and philosophy.

The projects are designed to meet the Navajo child's art needs based on the belief that the art program of the elementary school should concern itself basically with four major avenues of personal growth and development: (1) the growth of aesthetic awareness and sensitivities, (2) the acquisition of art skills, (3) creative and critical thinking, (4) individual and personal expression. The document includes the following: program scope, need, philosophy; roles of the administrator, classroom teacher, and parents; and art appreciation activities for kindergarten  through second grade, third through fifth grade, and sixth through eighth grade. The following subjects and activities are treated in this guide: the elementary art room, murals, puppets, lettering and postermaking; recipes, modeling materials, paper sculpture, carving media, sculpturing media, cleaners and thinners, bulletin boards, paper-mache, drawing media and tools. Among other topics are: paper-mache sculpture, painting, crayons, colored chalk, transparent water colors, inks and dyes; printmaking, weaving and a selection of general projects. Exemplary exercises, illustrations, and lesson plans are also included in the guide. (RTS)",

Learning activities expose students early to ideas of patterning and repatterning. The guidelines are to be used as a mathematical core for elementary school, not as a total curriculum. The more than 140 objectives are categorized according to four strands--comparative (sets, cardinal and sequential relationships, grouping, place value, types of numbers), joining (addition and multiplication operations), separate (subtraction and division operations), and  geometry (line, shapes, figures, measurement). Objectives are cross referenced according to strand components, and the guidelines also contain a cross reference with other text books available in the Navajo area. The guidelines are organized according to objective; for each, there are comments, prerequisite objectives, and at least two activities, with materials listed and directions for carrying them out explained. Illustrations of mathematical processes are provided, along with ditto sheets for some activities. The guidelines also contain a sample of the pupil's record sheet and a glossary. (RS)",

        "description":"Despite developmental efforts and a relatively larger population growth rate in nonmetro areas since 1970, rural/nonmetro people are still behind their metro counterparts in terms of wage levels, family income, adequacy of housing, and access to essential public services like education and health care. Rural public school education lags behind metro central and suburban public school education in virtually all areas. Rural students not only attend schools with fewer support staff and services, less revenue, and less per pupil funding, but they are also more likely to enroll in school later, progress through school more slowly, complete fewer school years, and score lower on national tests than students attending metro area schools. Federal aid to metro central schools in 1972-73  was $133.33 per student, but only $91.10 to nonmetro students. Rural public schools spent less per pupil than metro central or suburban public schools in all categories except student transportation during that year. High proportions of rural students fail to graduate from high school or attend college. Since many of them do not get the higher education necessary for white collar or professional jobs, these students tend to enter the labor force in blue collar and other lower paying occupations.

Citizen participation is the latest mechanism of a democratic people for dealing with \"big government\" and making it accountable. Another reason for citizen participation has to do with the lowering of public confidence in American institutions. One of the major reasons for having citizen participation is overwhelmingly positive, and that is the numerous examples of efficient, creative citizen-action solutions to apparently insolvable problems. The vast majority of research and commentary on citizen participation is urban in orientation even though large-scale citizen  involvement in the administrative process in the United States originated in programs of the U.S. Department of Agriculture through its concern with rural areas. This overview of citizen participation was prepared as a synthesis of research materials for use in education programs or as a guide for discussions of citizen participation; although focused specifically upon citizen participation in rural development, the results have general application. Among topics covered are the decision-making process with citizen participation in administration, objectives and accomplishments of citizen participation, and guidelines and implementation for effective citizen participation programs.

In 1977 the BIA operated 15 off-reservation and 57 on-reservation boarding schools for 18,562 students. An investigation into the operation of these schools found buildings and dormitories vacant, classrooms half-empty, expensive equipment unused, and funds mismanaged. Some schools were poorly maintained with some conditions presenting safety hazards. Boarding schools, both on and off the reservation, were for the most part ignoring BIA eligibility criteria and admitting  students whose eligibility had not been verified. Six off-reservation schools visited were designed for 6,320 students; they had a combined enrollment of 2,654. The Bureau has been aware of underutilization of its off-reservation boarding schools but has been unable or unwilling to consolidate them because of Congressional and/or tribal actions. Information for this study was obtained through examination of reports and documents, visits to five BIA headquarters and area offices, interviews with BIA officials, school administrators, and tribal officials, and inspections of six off-reservation and four on-reservation boarding schools. Nine recommendations for improving the efficiency of the BIA boarding schools are given. (DS)",

Because Indian people are subject to their own tribal regulations as well as to State and Federal laws, it also provides for the study of tribal government structures. The course seeks to help students to learn the origin of the history of Indian policy and understand the social, economic, political, and environmental factors that have influenced it in the past and that are at work  today. Particular attention is directed toward the Indian Self-Determination and Educational Assistance Act which places great emphasis on tribal government. Each of the 19 units within the course lists the major concepts to be studied along with an outline for the unit. Materials would include historical records, maps, charts, graphs, copies of the U.S. Constitution, tribal constitutions, the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968, congressional records, and pamphlets from the Office of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. Learning activities include lecture-discussions, resource speakers, field trips, special projects, and role play. (Author/DS)",

These differences are important in understanding agricultural potentials, the impact of agricultural programs, and the future structure of agriculture in Tennessee. Significant age differences were determined, with only six percent of the operators of small farms under 45 years of age compared to 34 percent of the part time operators and 42 percent of the large farm operators. Continuity of farm operations among generations was much higher for large farms. Farmers with less than an eighth grade education made up 54 percent of the small farm category, 40 percent of the part  time, and 24 percent of the large farm group. Sixty percent of the large full time farmers used long term credit, compared to 26 percent of the small farmers, 39 percent of the part time, and nine percent of the retired farmers. Seventy-five percent of the operators of small farms said they would not mortgage their farm to purchase more land, compared to 56 percent of the operators of large farms. Twenty-two tables present data on each of the four categories in such areas as characteristics of household heads, percentage of types of farms, land resource and use, crop practices, number of beef cattle, insurance, attitudes toward risk and credit, off farm work and income, and changes in the last five years.

        "author":["Stinson, Thomas F."],
        "description":"Alternative methods for taxing the mineral industry at the State level include four types of taxes: the ad valorem tax, severance tax, gross production tax, and net production tax. An ad valorem tax is a property tax levied on a mineral deposit's assessed value and due whether the deposit is being worked or not. The severance tax is usually an exise tax paid by the producer for the privilege of extracting resources from the soil. The gross production tax is almost identical to the severance tax, but is based on a percentage of the dollar value of the ore extracted rather than a fixed amount per ton. The net production tax is also similar, but is more closely related to a net income tax because companies are allowed to deduct some expenses from gross revenues in order to define  net taxable production. This document compares the four kinds of taxes on the basis of ease of administration, social justice, consistency with national economic goals, and revenue adequacy. It cites the severance tax and gross production tax as appearing to provide the best vehicles for taxing mineral activity. Because the construction and development phase of a mine causes financial strain for a community in providing new services (e.g., schools and expanded water and sewer systems) before new tax revenues become available, discussion is given to programs by Montana, North Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming to reduce the fiscal impact of new mineral development. An overview of mineral tax laws in each of the 25 major mineral producing states is also given. (DS)",

The program was initiated to maintain as much integrity as possible to the cultures of the Arikara, Hidatsa, and Mandan tribes on the Fort Berthold Reservation. Educational materials included teachers' guides, booklets of traditional tales of the respective tribes, and visual aids. Two of the schools included kindergarten through sixth grades in the language instruction, one served grades K-8. Classes were conducted 15 minutes a day two, four, and five days a week,  depending on the school. Some 160 elementary students and 33 college students received language instruction in the program. To evaluate the educational materials and language instruction, interviews were conducted with 50 people, including teachers, school administrators, parents, and students. All five native language teachers found the teaching materials effective, as did the four administrators and 11 of the 12 non-program teachers. All but one of the total respondents indicated they would like to see the native language classes continued; 32 of the 36 teachers, administrators, and parents queried considered the program to be successful. Most of the school personnel believed the classes promoted a postive self-image for the students. Program evaluators found a &quot;tremendous feeling of  pride&quot; among the people of the communities that their children were learning the native language. (DS)",

        "description":"While total farm population is declining, the number of people living on the farms which produce the bulk of the nation's food and fiber is increasing. The 1970-75 total farm population decline was 13 percent, but the number of people living on farms with annual sales greater than $40,000 increased 76 percent. Such farms account for about 80 percent of total U.S. farm receipts, but only 24 percent of the U.S. farm population. Some of the indicated increase in population on large farms is unquestionably due to general price inflation and its effect on dollar value of farm product sales, but at least part of the change reflects real increase. The number of people living on farms with under $2,500 in annual sales dropped from 3.6 million in 1970 to 2.8 million in 1975. Farms of this  sales size contain one-third of the U.S. farm population, and residents earn most of their money income from off-farm sources. The total 1970-75 farm population decline occurred among farm residents without regard to race, operator status, or region of residence. Losses were heavier in the nonoperator population than the operator population, the population of Blacks declined faster than Whites, and the population living on southern farms dropped at a greater rate than the number of farm people in the northern and western states. In 1975, about 60 percent of the total farm population resided on farms operated by a full owner, about 30 percent were on part owner operator farms, and the remaining 10 percent were on tenant or managed farms.

        "description":"The relation of 20 predictor variables to the academic and non-academic self-concepts of 274 six to nine year old Mexican American migrant children were examined by canonical correlation and canonical variate analysis to determine whether self-concept was a multi-faceted construct. Academic and non-academic self-concepts were taken from the Self-Appraisal Inventory. Four sets of predictor variables included 11 teacher-rated classroom behaviors assessed by the Devereux Elementary School Behavior Rating Scale, 4 aspects of attitudes toward school measured by the School Sentiment Index, age levels, and teacher-rated language capability. The analysis determined canonical relations accounting for 51% of the total variance. Correlations between the canonical variates produced by the  analysis and the original variables lead to the conclusion that the first and second variates were due to the relations of academic and non-academic self-concept measures to the prediction variables. Canonical variate analysis was also used to describe the different patterns of relations between the two aspects of self-concept and the 20 predictors. The validity of inferring self-concept from classroom behaviors of minority group children was discussed in relation to the finding that several behaviors usually considered negative correlates of self-concept measures were found to be positive correlates in this study.

        "description":"Career and career-related preferences rural youth made and estimation of degree to which choices were translated into adult behavior were investigated by tracing a rural sample of southern 1968 high school graduates through the first four years of post-high school. Focus was on choices expressed and attainments experienced with respect to education, occupation, marriage, fertility, residence, and military service. Sex and race variation was analyzed. Results indicated: (1) social origins and school tracking--low predictability for estimating achievement levels; (2) adolescent preferences--all four race and sex groups expressed mainstream American success orientations; (3) early adult behavior and preferences--dominant influence was educational preference, followed by occupational  preferences and marriage plans (high level educational/occupational preferences facilitated, early marriage preference depressed attainment); (4) sex differences--apparent in content of career preferences (restricted sex-typed orientations) and greater depressing effects of familial influences; and (5) race differences--harder for Blacks to transmit advantages achieved at any stage to the next phase. Implications are that programs for rural women should expand preference content of orientation and stress results of early marriage/fertility on attainment, and programs for rural Blacks should focus on ways to transmit preferences into attainment.

The \"Social Conflict\" package, with Prejudice, Indian Education, Americanizing the Indian, and B.I.A. units, and the \"Fine Arts\" package, with Art, Music, Literature, and Dance and Drama units, were Pan-Indian in orientation with a strong contemporary issues base. AICDP sent the program to 21 North Dakota high schools for introductory use. Evaluators interviewed participating teachers and librarians formally and informally, and attended AICDP workshops to offer AICDP some external perspective on the program and to determine how it was used and viewed by educators. The program had considerable overall merit. The 18 teachers in 14 schools who actually used the materials used  the packages, Teacher Guides, supplementary materials and suggested activities selectively. The Art and Prejudice units were the best. Most teachers found reading levels satisfactory, content accurate, and the material beneficial to Indian and non-Indian students alike. Few high school libraries had the resources necessary for the program. AICDP should integrate the two packages in the program and reduce the overall cost. In addition, there should be more AICDP workshops, teacher and student feedback and evaluation, and improved libraries. (SB)",

The study made 23 specific recommendations for improving management activities in the areas of budget process, personnel management, and management information; it was suggested that BIA area offices be reduced and that increased emphasis be placed on agency level service delivery. Two witnesses from Indian organizations appeared to suggest needed changes in the BIA; another witness discussed ways to improve legal enforcement and  implementation of the federal trust responsibility to Indians. The August 1 meeting featured testimony from governmental witnesses as officials from the Department of Interior and BIA appeared to present their views on the changes suggested by the management study. This document features the hearing proceedings as well as both informal and prepared statements of the witnesses. Also included are a statement prepared by the BIA responding to questions on its organization, a study of administrative conflicts of interest in the protection of Indian natural resources, and the report of the BIA management study.

The Subcommittee majority staff's report of research and on-site inspections emphasized a need to grasp the diversity of the American Indian peoples and the need for them to more fully understand the workings of the federal government, while pointing out that the BIA suffers from a lack of leadership, a lack of information gathering and program monitoring capabilities, a plethora of administrative problems, and more time spent in self justification than in problem solving.

Speakers addressed child neglect and abuse, and woman abuse, which follow similar patterns of self-perpetuation. It was felt that few agencies at any level are equipped to handle woman abuse, and that key problem areas in  which change is necessary are research, social policy, emergency services, and the criminal justice system. Workshop participants formulated detailed recommendations for prevention services, emergency and social services, the criminal justice system, and tribal needs. Participants agreed that in the San Juan Basin, there is considerable interest in and support for an organized, systematic, and effective response to problems of domestic violence; residents are looking to their leaders and officials for aid and support in this area because, untreated, domestic violence can only spread.

In 1970-74, migration and population trends were reversed and total employment increased; large population increases came mostly through immigration to specific coal-producing areas. Enormous socioeconomic factors will be expected to have an impact on the American Indian population, which has 9 percent of the region's total strippable coal reserves. The narrative portion of the profile looks at population and demographic patterns (towns,  recent mobility, minority composition, fertility, age structure, dependence rates, educational attainment, school enrollment); employment, earnings, and labor force (employment patterns in public utilities, agriculture, manufacturing, contract construction, mining, transportation, communication, government services; earnings by sex/occupation; past labor force growth/future potential); indicators of well-being (income, poverty, family structure, housing); and implications (baseline economy, community services, regional growth).

Reviewing 400 years of Indian education, the report was compiled from federal, state, local, and private records, public hearings, conventions and meetings, site visits, surveys, and interviews with officials, educators, and parents. Interim recommendations deal with service delivery, local control, off-reservation boarding schools, USOE and BIA programs, BIA day schools, the scholarship program, Title IV, Johnson-O'Malley program, noncompensatory educational programs, and data collection. Long-term recommendations call for a comprehensive education bill to insure adequate  quantity and quality of education services to Indian peoples; policy guidelines which clearly reaffirm the commitment of Congress to meet Indian educational needs, and a congressional policy of support and financing for Indian community control of Indian education. Material is presented on historical policies and finances affecting Indian education, federal agencies in Indian education, state policies and finance, field hearing findings, and special studies (Navajo education, nonrecognized Indians, primary/secondary education, off-reservation boarding schools, Indian community controlled schools, higher education).

Prepared for the American Indian Policy Review Commission, the report is the work of representatives from task forces on tribal government, federal, state, and tribal jurisdiction, and reservation development and resource protection. Report findings include: Department of Interior has not been sufficiently effective in implementing ANCSA; long-term ability of native corporations for economic success is undercut by delay in land transfers and impact of inflation; Natives' long-term ability to control their land and corporation will be undercut by 1991 removal of exemption against taxation and against  alienability of Native-held ANCSA corporation stock; Native village status is complicated by application of concepts with little relevance to Alaska. Recommendations deal with completion of interim conveyances by 1981; repeal of the ANCSA easement provision; amending ANCSA so that 20-year taxation exemption runs from conveyance of fee simple title to all ANCSA lands and so that all undeveloped lands remain permanently tax exempt; establishment of Special Congressional Commission to determine if ANCSA assures viability of Alaska Native communities; amendment of PL 638 as regards self-determination grants in Alaska.

        "description":"Social power is defined as the ability to affect group decisions; power actors are those individuals who seek and exercise power and affect group decisions. Power structure research was conducted in Kershaw County, South Carolina in 1971 and 1977. Although methodologies differed, both surveys identified and interviewed power actors for the county, listing 49 power actors in 1971 and 45 in 1977. During the six year period new power actors emerged; the lists shared only 15 common names. Physicians, dentists, clergy, school administrators and industrial executives were on the 1971 list but not the 1977 one. The merchant/realtor/developer category was most numerous in 1977. Influence of the Junior Chamber of Commerce, service clubs, fraternal orders, and religious groups nearly  vanished by 1977. Influence from and participation in quasi-governmental commissions, councils, and public service agencies increased. Although this pattern facilitated participation from more individuals and enhanced a trend toward pluralism, two dangers are seen. Funds for some public programs may decline, creating needs for abrupt adjustment in institutional functions. More importantly, many programs depend on federal-state-regional support, and power structure and decision making also are dependent on these federal, state, and multi-county council funds. Thus, more of the decisions for Kershaw County are being expedited outside the county. (DS)",

A cross-sectional sample of Level I (n=372), Level II (n=290) and Level III (n=379) served as the data source. Students were enrolled in one of two junior high schools within the suburban Philadelphia school district. Achievement was treated as a dependent variable. Achievement groups were contrasted on a series of eleven factors with their counterparts within and between levels using discriminate analysis. Significant differences were found between achievement groups at all levels. Working style and emotional attitude  toward science were sharp points of contrast between high and low achievers. Comparison of low achievement groups between Levels I and II, and II and III indicated that reading was the only factor which differed significantly. Similar comparison with high achievers indicated an increased need for computational skills and mathematical apptitude in proceeding from Level I to II. (Author/HM)",

Although behavioral objectives generally were shown to make no significant difference when utilized in the same manner as the advanced organizer, a significant increase in achievement occurred when they were used together. This increase might be attributed partly to the use of the behavioral objectives. A series of three audiotutorial units in genetics covering topics in mitosis, meiosis, and chromosomal abnormalities composed the instructional materials. During the course of the six-week experimental  period, all subjects received audio tapes, study guides, visual aides, and tests. Achievement was measured by formative unit tests, a summative final test, and a summative retention test. (Author/BB)",

Specific and generalized episodes are described. Consideration of these episodes leads to recommendations for inclusion in a year's program of: (1) a few unusual and dramatic experiments that can be linked to topics of central importance; (2) experiments that involve common, everyday objects as equipment so that physics can be more easily related to daily life; and (3) experiments that are true problems, which will train students in planning an investigation instead of following  directions and in writing a proper report instead of reciting the steps laid down in a manual.

The use of more inductive/indirect teaching strategies, which reflect the true nature of science, seems to be dictated by the programs. Implementation of teacher training methods should be based upon empirical links of effectiveness which have been established between particular teacher behaviors and pupil outcomes and between a training mode and the desired teacher behavior. One classroom analysis system which has been designed to allow collection of data on teaching behaviors in both verbal and non-verbal classroom activities is the Teaching Strategy Observation Differential (TSOD). The TSOD is  particularly well suited for collection of data on science teacher behavior in classrooms and laboratories where many of the learning activities involve student-centered non-verbal strategies. Another measure is the Data Processing Observation Guide which measures the occurrence of ten specific operations and three general interactions which occur in a classroom where science process skill learning is taking place.

The generalized approach given here is not as detailed as an energy audit, but it allows school administrators, maintenance personnel, or building operators to analyze energy uses and to determine energy conservation steps and estimate savings in accordance with U.S. Department of Energy Class C Information Audit procedures. The four chapters present: (1) no cost maintenance and operation changes; (2) example problems for determining savings of energy conservation measures; (3) lists of energy conservation measures; and (4) how to prepare an energy conservation plan for your school.

It consists of two chapters. The first chapter includes potential long-term impacts, both positive and negative, of the proposed Department of Education on three key science and technology-related areas. These are the programs of the National Science Foundation's Science Education Directorate, general support programs for graduate science and engineering training across the country, and educational analysis and research which should be the responsibility of an appropriate Federal agency. Key criteria  to be utilized in these evaluations are presented for the use of congressional committees. Specific options dealing with these science education activities are also presented. The second chapter presents an analysis of the effects of the establishment of the proposed Department of Education on science and technology activities of the federal government. An appendix including a bill to establish a Department of Education and for other purposes is also presented at the end of this publication. (HM)",

One dimension, the classification of the cognitive abilities required to answer specific science questions, was divided into four categories: (1) knowledge; (2) comprehension; (3) application; and (4) analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. The other dimension divided the domain of science into three major areas: content, process, and science and society. The questions illustrate various topics of the biological sciences, earth sciences, physical sciences, and integrated topics such as equilibrium,  evolution, and probability.

Chapter two provides information from research and suggests strategies for changing the science curriculum and designing new programs. Chapter three suggests four broad goals of science education for kindergarten through grade twelve. These goals fall into four areas: (1) attitude; (2) thinking processes; (3) skills; and (4) knowledge. Terminal objectives,  examples of learner behavior, and the appropriate grade levels where the behavior is likely to be observed are categorized.

        "description":"This paper presents the findings of three studies to define the status and needs of social studies education. The three studies used various techniques to compile data. A national survey of teachers and administrators was conducted to find out the course offerings, time spent in teaching various subjects, materials and textbooks used, and impact of federally-sponsored in-service education on science, math, and social studies education. A review of the research literature from 1955-1975 provided a summary of the effectiveness of institutional practices, perception of needs, and teacher training requirements. The third study used a case study approach and compiled research data using ethnographic strategies to describe classroom practices. Findings showed that only ten to twenty  percent of social studies teachers use New Social Studies materials, and the textbook is the dominant tool of instruction. Teachers believe that inquiry teaching is too demanding of students and an unproductive use of instructional time. The state of research in social studies education is in disarray with little practical relevance to the everyday concerns of the classroom. Ethnography is a promising methodology for rich data about teaching. The authors suggest that since teachers were found to be the key in student learning, they should be more involved in curriculum development and in research. (Author/MR)",

        "description":"This paper presents an overview of the history of Japanese in Colorado. Japanese immigrants first came to Colorado between 1900 and 1910 as railroad laborers. Some became coal miners in southern Colorado; most others became farm laborers. Although the Japanese population during this period was small, communities developed in several locales. The largest was in Denver, and included some small businesses, ethnic churches, and a Japanese newspaper. During the period 1910-1940, the Japanese population in Colorado stabilized at about 2,000. Because they were prohibited from becoming naturalized citizens, the Japanese became self-sufficient within their own business and community organizations. However, they encouraged their children to become educated and to participate in  non-Japanese institutions. The Buddhist church and several Japanese newspapers continued to be active in Denver. The period 1940-1970 began with an influx of more Japanese from the West Coast due to white hostility there caused by the outbreak of the war. Despite resistance of white Coloradans to Japanese resettlement in the state, the Denver community grew and many Japanese obtained more professional jobs. Toward the end of the period a third generation of Japanese Americans appeared in the population, and most of the ethnic associations in Denver served the second-generation Japanese instead of their immigrant parents. By the 1970s many Japanese had entered the middle class and were fairly well assimilated into the mainstream culture. Denver no longer has major residential  concentrations of Japanese. (AV)",

The introduction describes the country's geographic, historic, demographic, and economic background. Section II traces the development of education from religious training in the pre-Christian era through the post-1950 period of rapid educational expansion. Section III outlines the administrative organization at national and local levels. Section IV lists types of financial support and sources of revenue for schools. Sections V and VI describe the educational levels. Primary education is offered in six types of schools: (1) the Buddhist schools, designed primarily for training religious leaders; (2) the formal English schools, which are oriented to the study of Great Britain  and India; (3) the Sanskrit schools, whose major emphasis is language; (4) the basic schools, which provide self-sufficiency through craftwork; (5) the vernacular schools; (6) and the national schools, which are similar to the basic schools. At the secondary level are multipurpose schools which emphasize general, cultural, and vocational education. Secondary education is also available in the English, basic, and Sanskrit schools. The status and quality of higher education and teacher training are discussed in sections VII and VIII. Specialized and vocational education described in section IX, covers areas of health, agriculture, home economics, forestry, industry, and engineering. Finally, adult education stresses literacy and includes vocational, civic, and fine and cultural arts  education. A bibliography, a list of institutions of higher education, a chart of enrollment in educational programs, and a proposed educational pyramid conclude the document. (KC)",

One component of a two-part publication, the guide demonstrates how the conceptual structure of the economics discipline presented in the first publication (ED 148 648) can be used to help students at the primary grade level make more effective economic decisions. By using these activities, teachers will be able to strengthen the elementary social studies textbook's treatment of economic content and introduce children to a number of relevant and important ideas which these texts omit. The economic content is expressed in the form of six economic generalizations, each of which focuses on two or three economic concepts and on important relationships among these concepts. The  concepts include scarcity, choice making, opportunity cost, specialization, and division of labor. The activities are many and varied and involve students in playing games, listing examples, learning to discriminate between sensible and crazy sentences, setting up stores in the classroom, classifying pictures of goods and services, and analyzing and discussing pictures. For each activity the following information is provided: overview, rationale, objectives, description of materials needed, and specific teaching methods. To help the teacher who lacks formal preparation in economics, separate overviews are provided for each of the six economic generalizations. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"Social studies instruction will improve if educators understand and integrate information gained from pragmatics into social studies curriculum and methods. Pragmatics is an area of linguistic study based on the philosophy of pragmatism which emphasizes social consequences of events and actions. Pragmatics deals particularly with the relationships between words or expressions and the way in which people use them. Review of social studies content and methods reveals a strong reliance on the medium of language. For example, the anthropology curriculum stresses cultural concepts which are closely related to language concepts. Also, career education involves study of the functional uses of language in job interviews and in employee relationships. Social studies classroom teachers  will increase student involvement in active learning if they encourage discourse conversation in the classroom. Other activities which encourage understanding of meaning through language include role playing, categorizing and describing imaginary situations, interviewing community members to find about family and local history, and class discussion.

        "description":"This paper advocates development of humanistic education which will emphasize concern for student self-concept and empathy for others through a multidisciplinary approach. A survey conducted by the Educational Development Center in 1976 showed that only three out of 143 educational materials reviewed dealt with systems behavior, stressed the individual's role in problem solving, supplied positive models for solutions, or gave positive views of other cultures. This apparent lack of humanistic curriculum materials occurs in a society which is committed to technological manipulation of people and their skills. This has produced a high degree of absenteeism in the schools by students critical of the educational structure, shrinking public confidence in education, and a short-term  utilitarian view of education. Fortunately, this dismal picture is changing. American society is developing a newly cultivated respect for the artisan and a movement towards self-sufficiency which questions the technological direction of society. The resultant concern for strong self-concept is being reflected in new curriculums and in the participation of non-traditional educators in the schools. The current need in education is a synthesis of technology with humanistic awareness. (MR)",

        "author":["Bruening, William H."],
        "description":"The paper is a philosophical examination of values education. It is presented in three major sections. First, there is a discussion of the role that value education has played in the American educational system. A historical review of four documents published by national educational groups and the government indicates that moral education has been advocated throughout the 20th century and that the American educational community has fairly specific ideas about which values are important. Section two of the paper explores which values ought to be taught in moral education programs. The author observes that values can be taught in contexts other than the schools and that it is virtually impossible to have total consensus among educators, parents, and community members on which  values are to be taught. However, for the sake of argument, he accepts the basic values identified in one of the documents summarized in section one. The third section asks what teaching model would be consistent with the values accepted in part two. Analysis of literature by psychologists and philosophers reveals that individual responsibility (and values) cannot be taught--it must be acquired indirectly and through the learner's own experience. Thus, the author concludes that no specific program or teaching model can be specified for values education. Students will best learn values by observing the behavior of ethical people in general.

Specifically, the author describes the use of county records to teach about slavery in Texas before the Civil War. Four sources of records can be consulted: (1) United States Census records, which provide information on family characteristics of slaves and owners and on the size and productivity of farms, (2) state tax rolls, which reveal individuals' landholding and slaveholding status, (3) probate records, which include wills, inventories and appraisals of estates, and records of estate administration, and (4) slave narratives, which furnish transcripts from interviews with ex-slaves conducted during the  1930s. All these records are available from national and state archives or from local county clerks' offices. Information from the records can be used in a variety of ways. Their data show that the proportion of slaveholders and slaves in Texas was comparable to the proportion for the South as a whole, give interesting information about the price of slaves compared to the price of land, illustrate reactions of slaves and owners to the institution of slavery, and show how slave families were kept together or separated throughout generations.

        "description":"Urban managers and legislators are faced with the task of ensuring that policy decisions really represent citizens' needs. One method of communicating with the public by government was the creation of the Community Representatives Office (CRO) by the city of Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1973. This position is similar to the office of the ombudsman found in Scandinavia and other European countries. In this paper, the author evaluates the complaint system used by the CRO in Greensboro in terms of its responsiveness to citizens' needs. Chapter I presents a history of the ombudsman concept and traces the history of the concept in Greensboro. Chapter II examines the ways in which complaint findings from the CRO can make Greensboro city government more responsive to citizens'  concerns. Chapter III treats priorities and policy decisions as influenced by the complaint system. Conclusions presented in chapter IV indicate that: (1) the role of the ombudsman on a local level can influence the decision-making process, (2) physical location of the ombudsman or complaint agency is important, (3) length of time a city has had a particular form of local government appears immaterial to the implementation of a complaint agency, and (4) image of government agencies is affected by having a built-in mechanism whereby the rate of satisfaction for complaints is measured.

        "description":"Currently, findings of educational research are of little consequence to the curricular/instructional decisions of social studies teachers. Four basic conditions have created this inconsistency. (1) Since social studies teaching takes place among value and factual assumptions, decisions about educational practice are based more on value judgments than on research data or theory. (2) Generally, there is a lack of consistent, cumulative, definitive research findings on which to make curricular/instructional prescriptions. Most research is carried out by doctoral candidates and supervised by professors, many of whom lack commitment to research. Moreover, results that are merely statistically significant, although trivial in nature, contribute to the fragmented nature of social  studies research. Research findings are sterile because they are abstractions, out of touch with reality. (3) The concerns of social studies teachers tend to be different from those of university professors who conduct and supervise most research. (4) The instruction/learning model that has dominated the design of social studies is overly simple. Therefore, social studies researchers need to reconsider the nature of their enterprise. Attention must be focused on those attributes of science which are applicable to educational research, including the role of theory in educational practice, the functionality of research strategies, and realistic goals.

(2) Physical education: classes may not be conducted separately on the basis of sex; however, students may be separated for participation in sports that involve bodily contact, i.e. boxing, wrestling, football. (3) Extracurricular activities: schools may not sponsor or support chapters of single sex sororities, fraternities, honors  organizations, and clubs. (4) Marital and family status: students may not be discriminated against in any aspect of education because of pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery. Special programs may be operated for pregnant students if attendance is optional. Conduct and dress codes, honors and awards, facility use, and financial assistance are other areas discussed in the booklet. Guidelines for implementation in all areas include the formulation and implementation of a plan based on the model statement; dissemination of the policy to students, parents, staff, organizations, and other relevant parties; workshops and inservice training; and collection and evaluation of data on sex bias in education.

Effects of using USMES materials on students' economic understanding, attitudes, and problem-solving ability were explored. The research also examined the simultaneous relationship between achievement and attitudes. In the study, control and experimental classes were selected on the basis of whether the classroom teacher had participated in a summer inservice program on economic problem solving. Teachers in the experimental inservice group were exposed to basic economic concepts and their application to problem solving in the classroom. Students in their classes worked on an economics-oriented USMES unit,&quot;Manufacturing,&quot; during one semester. Teachers in the control group received no instruction in economics or problem solving during the evaluation period. Results indicated that intermediate elementary students significantly improved their economic understanding by working on comprehensive, realistic, and economic-oriented problems as found in the USMES curriculum. These students seemed to develop a substantially more positive attitude toward economics. Also, the program seemed appropriate for both cognitive and affective learning. However, an untrained teacher would probably have difficulty adding an economic dimension to student problem solving from simply reading the USMES materials. Therefore, inservice training will improve teachers' economic understanding and will prepare them for  introducing USMES material into the classroom. (Author/KC)",

The purpose of the study is to improve knowledge of analytical studies, research results, and financial assistance policies among personnel of the Agency for International Development (AID) and to stimulate discussion between AID personnel and other interested persons. The report is global in scope but the discussion is general and there are few references to specific countries. Chapter I presents a framework for analysis of the basic human needs approach. The framework concentrates on establishing an explicit hierarchy of objectives based on numbers of poor individuals now and in the future, intangible goals, birth  rates, material well-being, economic planning, income, production, resources, and employment. Chapter II explores policies that might be suitable in various settings for meeting basic needs in areas of productive employment, income, private goods, and public services. Chapter III analyzes channels through which various policies would affect growth rates of gross national product. A final section suggests that the development process should provide for sustainable improvements over time in the well-being of those who are too poor to satisfy their basic human needs. The conclusion is that the basic needs approach provides a workable framework to link needs, income, employment, production, and supply objectives. (DB)",

The report notes that humanities graduates have learned skills of research, problem solving, and writing, and that graduate training emphasizes the ability to penetrate underlying assumptions beyond the immediate situation. These skills may be easily transferred to non-academic pursuits. Hypothetical projects are outlined for humanities specialists and the American Studies Internship Program designed to place its graduates in business and government. Suggested areas in which Ph.D. graduates would make effective contributions include organizational development, human resource programs, career development, and public  affairs. Recommendations are that humanists realize that non-academic jobs are not second rate and that interdisciplinary studies, career counseling services, and internships be established. Sections of the paper discuss the current crisis, provide unemployment statistics, and examine academic and institutional stereotypes.

The validation of these competencies was accomplished through comparison and consensus. An instructional alternative system was designed by using a matrix system in comparing the 86 competencies with various types of instructional resources. Such an arrangement clarifies the relationship of competency to resource and reveals the balance or imbalance in instructional efforts for various competencies. The assessment activities were focused upon four aspects of the pilot program of instructional competencies: the instructional competencies per se; the pilot program model; the student  self-perception; the teacher perception of student competency. The conclusions drawn from the data indicated that there were significant increases in the students' self-perception of knowledge, experience, and confidence as they progressed from the early to later stages of professional preparation.

Results showed that those children in the investigation who had the benefit of a  teacher who taught the skills and explained what was expected were clearly superior in performance to students whose teacher encouraged them to talk but who primarily acted as discussion controller rather than as an instructor. Tables illustrating the collected data, and references, are included. (DS)",

Children between the ages of 9.0 and 12.7 years were given two subtests of the Alliance for Health, Physical Education, and Recreation Skills Test, the Speed Pass and Front Shot. Each subject performed once with a regulation basketball and once with a junior-sized basketball. Performance on both tests improved with increasing age and experience. All subjects performed better on the Speed Pass test with the junior ball, as did children under 10.5 years on the Front Shot test. Boys also performed better than girls on the Front Shot test.

A framework for assessing when one delivery strategy is more appropriate than another is provided. The framework for planning inservice delivery outlines distinct but complementary strategies that focus upon three basic and related goals. The first of these goals is to enhance adult cognitive, intrapersonal, and interpersonal development as it impinges upon teaching effectiveness. The second is to alter environmental (school) conditions that impinge upon teaching effectiveness. The final goal is to improve teaching effectiveness directly, especially by altering teacher instructional behavior in situ. Teachers in this program engage in different  forms of inservice to achieve these different goals and select their goals on the basis of their personal assessment of needs. Alternative strategies for the delivery of inservice education are considered necessary to achieve a comprehensive program. (JD)",

The student teacher identifies a specific instructional element that he or she wishes the team to observe. This may be any activity, attitude, procedure, or skill, such as question skills, lecturing techniques, student involvement, discipline, motivation  techniques, nonverbal cues, etc. Members of the P.G.S.S. team observe the student teacher in the classroom, noting successes as well as failures. Following observation the team members and the student teacher discuss the noted comments.

These questions are especially relevant to the problem of equal rights for women in a society in which the number of women in the schools and in the work force is increasing. In the light of these trends, college education for women is becoming more of a necessity, and it is necessary to examine our institutional objectives in terms of their relevance to women.

Data on four influencs (common to all student teaching experiences) were gathered by investigating four research questions: (1) expectancies of learners held by student teachers; (2) prior solo teaching time and opportunity to learn time provided by student teachers; (3) planning and instructional effectiveness of the student teacher as perceived by the university supervisor; and (4) efficacy of explaining student cognitive attainment in terms of these three variables. The variety of instruments and scales used in obtaining measures of the dependent variables (student attainment) and independent variables (expectation of learner attainment, solo teaching time,  learning time, and supervisor ratings) are described. A detailed discussion of the four regression models used to resolve the research questions is provided, accompanied by a description of the findings. In relation to question one, data did not reveal a statistically significant effect on learner attainment, while significance was indicated for questions two and three, encouraging the use of those variables in a model to explain a student's cognitive attainment. Discussion of study outcomes in relation to question four suggest that the practical significance of the model in explaining learner attainment appears to be relatively high when compared to other current research. Limitations in using the model for rating student teaching competence are enumerated. (MJB)",

Current formulations of fear appeals are unable to reconcile these findings satisfactorily. The drive model notion that high fear arousal leads to \"defensive avoidance\" is not well supported by previous research; the parallel response model assertion that fear control behavior interferes with adaptive responding to health-threat warnings remains untested; and protection motivation theory is more concerned with isolating important components of health-threat warnings than with accommodating these apparently discrepant findings. A new conceptualization of  health-threat warnings emphasizing the importance of perceived control over health is presented. Its essence is that health-threat warnings can diminish or enhance perceived control over health by lowering or raising perceptions of response and personal efficacy. It is shown that a model incorporating these two control constructs is capable of generating strategies for enhancing the persuasive impact of health-threat warnings in situations where other models encounter difficulties.

Results of tests are presented in the form of graphs, and an analysis of variance is presented. Findings indicated that certain activities lend themselves more to mainstreaming and others to participation in special programs. It was found that in certain activities normal and learning disabled children should not be integrated with trainable mentally handicapped children.

Since 1971 there have been widespread changes in state systems of school finance as a result of pressures for property tax relief and more equality in educational expenditures. The categorical approach of federal financial assistance provided primarily through ESEA has permitted relative concentration of federal expenditures where the need is greatest; it has provided for a greater equalization of intrastate per pupil expenditures directly and also indirectly by stimulating reform at the state level; and finally, it has helped to  stimulate the identification of specific educational needs. The complexities of school finance, however, and the variability of local conditions suggest there is no one best way to channel funds to all school districts. (DS)",

Student's acceptance of others affected his/her sense of belonging and feelings of self-acceptance. Attitudes toward the class were affected by attitudes toward the facilitator as a role model and by a sense of belonging. Willingness to speak out in class was affected by the student's sense of belonging and feelings of self-acceptance. The use of skills outside of class depended on the student's attitude toward the course. Feelings of mastery depended on the  student's willingness to speak out in the group and on the use of the learned skills outside of the class.

While the decisions regarding social goal and purpose rest with the society at large, educators and educational researchers have an important and appropriate role to play in helping to frame the questions of the relationship between the society and its educational institutions and in supplying certain information about what educators  can and cannot do.

Each subscale contains positively and negatively worded Likert-type items of three types: trait to group; role to group; and judgment of individuals based on group. A preliminary test was administered to three different groups of adults and a high school sample; factor analysis resulted in male and female factors. An examination of test reliability indicated that it was internally consistent and supported the two-factor construction. Construct validity was supported by the high correlations between trait to group, role to group, and individual judgment based on group items. Concurrent validity was also examined,  using a semantic differential assessment of attitude toward gender. Although this instrument was reliable, it did not correlate with the original Sex Fairness Survey, or support its validity. A second administration of both instruments to a sample of over 1,000 individuals produced similar results. The final 84-item Sex Fairness Survey and the 25-item semantic differential (used once to describe males, once females) are appended. (GDC)",

Project evaluation consists of four steps, each having its own evaluation form. Steps include specifying tasks; monitoring progress toward completion; documenting completion; and evaluating completed tasks.

Given the subjective basis of empirical information, different conclusions or recommendations about a program may result from different ideological, theoretical, and disciplinary perspectives. The logic behind the interpretation of results, and the assumptions necessary for such interpretations, must be specified and explained to facilitate the most appropriate use of an evaluation. Because of the complexity of many statistical techniques presently used, much work is needed to identify what assumptions must be met for meaningful and useful interpretations of results in a specific decision-making situation. The rationales for both the inclusion and the  exclusion of the variables to be considered in an evaluation should be made explicit. The problem of obtaining a matched control group is often nearly impossible. The relatioship between the statistical analysis and the evaluation question is often based on tenuous assumptions. The evaluation of Project Follow Through is used to exemplify these problems. (Author/CTM)",

The student self-report questionnaires were combined for all members of a class in order to obtain an average score for each item to represent the class score. The classroom observation schedules were completed by five pairs of trained observers in each of seven groups--three fourth grade classes, three fifth grade classes, and one seventh  grade group that included three classes working together. The instruments were designed to record descriptions of behaviors in four categories: peer interactions, teacher-pupil interactions, pupil-environment interactions, and physical self-presentation. Factor analysis of the student self-report data revealed five oblique factors. Estimates were made of scale reliabilities and of content validities. (Author/CTM)",

The ISSF consists of 123 weighted items on potentially abusive practices, divided into nine categories: (1) misleading recruiting practices and lax admissions policies; (2) lack of necessary disclosure in written documents; (3) misrepresentation of accredited status; (4) inequitable tuition refund policies; (5) inadequate procedures to insure qualified and stable faculty;  (6) inadequate record-keeping; (7) failure to maintain relevant and up-to-date occupational training programs; (8) inadequate job placement services; and (9) financial instability.

Analysis of covariance and analysis of variance of residualized gain scores appeared to substantially and consistently overestimate the change effects. Multiple factor analysis of variance models utilizing pretest and post-test scores yielded invalidly low F ratios. The analysis of variance of difference scores and the multiple factor analysis of variance using repeated measures were the only models which adequately controlled for pre-treatment differences; however, they appeared to be robust only when the error level is 50% or more. This places serious doubt regarding published findings, and theories based upon change score analyses. When  collecting data which have an error level less than 50% (which is true in most situations), a change score analysis is entirely inadvisable until an alternative procedure is developed.

The effect of social class upon field independence was also studied after controlling for intelligence. The Portable Rod and Frame Test was administered ten times using instructions developed for this age group. Intelligence was measured using the Otis-Lennon Intelligence Tests, and socioeconomic status was determined from the student's cumulative records and father's occupation. Low to moderate relationships were found among the two independent variables and field independence. Socioeconomic status correlated significantly with intelligence and with field independence. Intelligence correlated significantly with field  independence. However, controlling for the effects of intelligence indicated that any positive relationship found between cognitive style and socioeconomic status was most likely exaggerated. It appeared that intellectual variables far outweighted socioeconomic differences in cognitive orientation. Data on the cognitive styles of students may have practical classroom applications.

        "description":"As part of the Michigan Educational Assessment Program, 132 preprimary objectives were developed in the cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains. Volunteer teachers assessed the attainment of these skills in their kindergarten children. A profile on each student was designed to report skill attainment to first grade teachers and parents. The kindergarten teachers were allowed to test their students only on those objectives of interest in that classroom. Four methods of assessment were available: state-developed tests; teacher developed or commercial tests; observation; or other sources of information, such as parents or other teachers. The teachers maintained records of individual and group attainment, and indicated: (1) the most important objectives; (2) the preferred  assessment method; (3) the number of objectives which can be assessed in one year, and (4) opinion of the tests. Resulting class rosters indicated that more students were assessed on the cognitive and psychomotor (not affective) objectives. State tests were the most frequently used method, with observation second. Teachers felt that the collection and analysis of the data consumed large amounts of time, and that a majority of kindergarteners had already mastered the objectives tested. The objectives and teacher responses are appended. (GDC)",

Teachers and curriculum specialists helped to develop individualized tests which could measure the attainment of objectives that could not be tested with group-administered items, such as multiple choice tests. The tests were administered and scored by volunteers from state teaching associations, rather than by personnel in the 192 schools involved. The test examiners and specialists who reviewed the tests responded to a questionnarie about the costs and benefits of developing and administering individual tests. They generally felt that the expenses involved in such testing were justified, because the type of  information provided about state and local educational programs and about student skill attainment was worth it. Appendices include measurement objectives for both metric and music tests, the tests themselves, instructions for administering and scoring, and resulting item statistics. (GDC)",

An evaluator who is a member of the project staff will have difficulty producing an evaluation which is credible and valid. Project monitors will also have a problem since they are often required to assume the conflicting roles of external evaluator and project advocate. Therefore, no unit should rely entirely on a given subunit for evaluative feedback about that same subunit. Evaluative feedback systems require renewal or replacement to prevent deterioration of their independence. Evaluators should arrange for replication of their own work by independent evaluators. Four further approaches for reducing bias in evaluation include: (1) standardizing the qualitative aspects of  evaluation procedures by using a checklist; (2) upgrading evaluator training procedures; (3) reducing sources of bias external to the evaluator; and (4) comparing the project, programs, or products with alternatives.

Wagner--independently examine the economic impact of college credit by examination (CBE) on students, institutions, and higher educational systems. Major issues are identified and further research topics are suggested. Kendis suggests the following results of CBE: changing enrollment patterns; increased teaching load of tenured faculty; increased needs related to services for nontraditional students, and administrative and data processing support; greater alumni support; greater student interest in attending CBE institutions; diminished need for financial aid; and modified recruitment procedures. He suggests that advanced placement for proficiency programs require flexibility from both students  and schools. Klees lists a number of potential benefits of CBE, noting that what is beneficial to one party may not be beneficial to another--a student's saving of tuition results in less income for the university. Wagner examines the costs (both increased and decreased), as well as the benefits and problems for the student who graduates early, and for the student who receives credit and then enrolls for additional courses in a different area. He suggests further research studies and estimates their funding requirements. Extensive bibliographies are included in each paper. (GDC)",

YUBAT was compared with the province's grade 13 biology curriculum guideline, and with representative courses and textbooks. This analysis revealed much similarity between the test, courses, and two textbooks used. The cognitive level of YUBAT was considerably lower than the level specified in the guideline or the achievement level reported by teachers. It was recommended that test aims be specified so that reliability and validity could be estimated. Data were also collected from 67 teachers who had used the test. They valued the test as a measure of student achievement, but not as a measure of school curriculum or effective teaching. They felt that YUBAT  would influence course content, but not teaching methods or evaluation methods. Most recommended that the test be continued on a voluntary basis. Principals were more supportive of test use than supervisory officials. All sources generally concluded that the test permitted recognition of outstanding student achievement, but did not achieve the goal of greater between-school uniformity in the grade 13 biology curriculum.

The analysis strategies considered are analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the posttest, ANOVA of an index of response, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The first relationship illustrated is that all three strategies estimate the same effects. Thus, choice of strategy may rest on precision and other factors not considered here, such as assumptions and robustness to violation of assumptions. The second relationship illustrated was precision; it was considered by comparison of mean square errors.

Seven different operational definitions of the fair use of tests are described; distinctions made between those applied to fairness for individuals who are members of special groups, and those applied to fairness for groups but not their individual members. All seven approaches use the regression model. One method also requires the use of expected utilities. Various methods are described for investigating test item bias. Both classical test theory item analysis and  latent trait item characteristic curve approaches are mentioned. Tests for bias included analysis of variance, chi-square, factor analysis, and arbitrary confidence bands. Distractor responses and item-test point-biserial correlations have also been considered.

It is a property of the procedures used in the collection or generation of data. The notion of internal validity is examined in order to establish a method of quantitatively estimating it. A coefficient of internal validity is defined by the equation that it equals one divided by one more than the number of alternative independent plausible hypotheses. If experimented procedures rule out all alternative plausible hypotheses, then the internal validity coefficient equals one. As the number of alternative hypotheses approaches infinity, the internal validity coefficient approaches zero. Alternative hypotheses may be considered to be  equivalent to alternative independent variables that are discrete and non-overlapping and cannot be ruled out and are independently definable. A suggestion is given for weighting independent variables according to their rank order of being plausible. This view is coherent with Harman's view of induction as inference to the best explanation.

All items were job-connected and therefore represented simulated skill items. The examinee responded directly to the face of the television screen by means of an electronic stylus or gun reticle. The test was compared with a paper-and-pencil test which covered the same items and a hands-on performance test which covered many of the same items. The results indicated that  television testing is very acceptable to soldiers and feasible.

These suggestions are within the authority and responsibility of local and state educational administrators, teachers, counselors, parents, and students. The author concludes that guidelines concerning the review, selection, use, and interpretation of tests are especially needed for policy makers, since educational tests are neither inherently sex fair nor sex biased. Sources of guidelines for evaluating the fairness and the use of a test are discussed, as well as general professional standards for test construction. A number of examples from actual test items illustrate cases of bias against  females--in achievement tests, male characters are mentioned more often and in more active roles; career interest inventories have separate male and female scales and norms, resulting in disproportionate counseling about career options; and aptitude tests may be written and interpreted according to sex role stereotypes. More stringent guidelines for test selection are strongly recommended whenever selection tests result in adverse impact. A bibliography is appended. (Author/GDC)",

        "description":"Asian women have been in the United States for over one hundred and twenty years. They are, however, still victims of both sexual and racial stereotyping, the \"cheap labor\" syndrome, and are denied the opportunity to learn about their own history, heritage, and culture. Traditional female roles among Asian immigrants and a legacy of discriminatory attitudes have been largely responsible for the low status position of Asian women in American society and in their own ethnic groups. Despite the fact that increasing numbers of Asian women enter the U.S. labor market, their wages are below the median for white women and men and they tend to be underemployed in light of their educational background. In addition, a lack of positive role models, media reinforcement of prevailing  attitudes and stereotypes, and the double burden of sexism and racism have contributed to the different experiences of Asian women and white women. In order to rectify this situation, these differences need to be acknowledged and understood. Educational institutions can play a role in this by reexamining such things as textbook bias, multicultural curriculums, bilingual educational programs, teacher awareness, parent communication, and the implementation of programs such as Title VII and Title IX.

There are problems, however, more critical to urban life than those faced by low status people in our cities. Continuity and change present problems in urban areas. Three broad categories which have special relevance for urban education are human diversity, human mobility and human and institutional rigidity. Due to these characteristics and to the political and economic climate, urban populations are diverse and mobile, and at the same time stereotypic and immobile. These populations vary with respect to their status (ethnicity, culture, class, sex) and their functions (language, cognitive style, affective response patterns, etc.). These  differences have implications for the way in which educational opportunities are designed and delivered. Yet, these various groups are eventually held to similar mainstream standards despite the pluralistic nature of their reference groups. These populations seem to be in constant geographic movement within the city and into and out of the city. Between groups, though, movement is very limited and upward mobility is more a dream than a reality. In urban education, attention must be given to these and other aspects of urbanicity.

Research data on the topic are somewhat nebulous and insufficient political and social pressure have been exerted to change attitudes and take action towards the disease. Research has found no cure for the disease and treatment is palliative. Because sickle cell anemia is said to disrupt mental processes through environmental stresses, as associated with racism, the client may blame his physical attributes for the problems and societal pressures he faces. The 1978 questionnaire survey conducted (by this author) in South Bend, Indiana, indicates the need for counseling on the subject. In group  counseling, the facilitator should be flexible enough to adapt to the needs of the client. The more verbal interaction that takes place, the more effective the counseling process will be. Current medical knowledge pertaining to sickle cell anemia shows that changes are occuring. The disease and the accompanying physiological crisis and complications can now be talked about.

From a community relations standpoint, there are three major areas of concern for Hispanics nationally: education, immigration and the administration of justice. The two major educational problems of Hispanics are high drop-out rate and the school desegregation process. Desegregation issues such as the lack of quality education and the break-up of bilingual education programs could be resolved locally if local officials take the initiative to work things out in advance with the communities affected. Federally mandated desegregation is an admission that local officials have not acted to the satisfaction of the total community.  Problems associated with immigration focus on the effect illegal immigration is having on this country and conflict over the methods of enforcing immigration laws. Local officials need to address related problems, such as misinformation about immigrant populations and non-jurisdictional interrogation of suspected immigrants by police officers. The final major problem of Hispanics involves the mutual mistrust between minorities and the police. Local officials must take action in police abuse cases to restore minorities' confidence in the justice system. (Author/WI)",

Examples are cited to illustrate Pedreira's disdain for the popular, indigenous roots of Puerto Rican culture. The book's structure is briefly analyzed to show Pedreira's lack of scientific thinking about man and society. Its tone is described as an echo of the &quot;Arielist&quot;  movement that swept the Spanish speaking intellectual world in the early 20th century which was elitist, individualistic, and rhetorical.

        "description":"The primary purpose of the research presented in this paper is to develop a more complete model of educational attainment. Age at first birth is examined by multiple regression, along with other independent variables that have been found to affect educational attainment, including age at marriage. The second purpose of this paper is to address the question of causality between early childbearing and termination of education. Social, demographic, and motivational factors that affect school attainment are examined. Some of these factors include family background, region of residence, inequalities in opportunities and final between blacks and whites, aptitude or ability, and encouragement from parents between black and whites, aptitude or ability, and encouragement from parents  teachers and/or peers. Data used in this report are from the Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Women. Findings presented indicate that an early birth affects the amount of schooling a young woman is able to complete, particularly among whites, even when family background and motivation are controlled for. Early marriage is also cited as having a strong negative effect on schooling. The general conclusion proposed in this report is that an early first birth results in a life-long loss of schooling.

        "description":"Examined in this document are the prevalence of early marriage and childbearing, and the relationship of early marriage and childbearing to divorce and separation. The report focuses on three hypotheses: (1) that marriage between young, unprepared teenagers ends more frequently in divorce regardless of the presence or absence of a child; (2) that early marriage and childbearing are only associated with divorce in the case of premarital pregnancies; and (3) teenage marriage alone, without the extra financial, emotional, and physical drains of parenthood, is viable, but that the particular burden of parenthood makes these marrriages fragile. Reviews of related literature and data from the Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Women  are used in exploring these hypotheses. Factors considered include race, social and economic background, educational and work experience, and family income. Findings presented indicate that the marriage of women who first wed during the teenage years are less viable than those of older brides. In addition, it is pointed out that although the analysis conducted does not indicate that teenage childbearing increases the risk of marital dissolution in later life, it is not totally unrelated.

Variables affecting the participation of women in a given year and factors affecting the total work experience are discussed in detail. These include: hours worked, annual earnings, hourly wages, occupational status, race, geographical region in which the woman grew up, her educational attainment, the number and ages of her children, her own age, family income, marital status, school enrollment, residential changes, and physical limitations. Other factors discussed are environmental: the local labor market, residence in an urban area or a Southern state, in an area characterized by high or low unemployment, and in an area of good or poor employment  opportunities for white and black women. Two longitudinal data sets, the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Women and the Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics, are used in the analysis.

Of the variables available in the two data sets, this study examines race, age, parental socioeconomic status, number of siblings, whether the oldest child, urban or farm background, a foreign-born parent, southern background, religious affiliation (Catholic),  and whether or not the respondent grew up with both natural parents, as possible determinants of both age at first birth and age at first marriage. Other factors considered include income, education, and labor force experience.

A review of related literature is provided to point out the lack of substantial attention in such research to this area. This report then describes a study of forty adolescents undertaken to test two hypotheses: (1) there is a positive relationship between indices of viewers' aggressive behavior and aggressive character and program preferences, and (2) there is a positive relationship between indices of viewers' aggressive behavior and the frequency with which individuals will approve of televised aggression. Data from the study indicate  that the first hypothesis was not supported whereas the second hypothesis was strongly supported. Total aggression score, group membership, sex, and approval of specific situations where television characters used violence were used as the predicting variables. Based upon these findings, it is argued that a new definition of television impact is required and that it must be the basis for understanding the complex interactional and cognitive processes stimulated by television viewing and, in particular, televised violence.

Causes of the program abuses are discussed in detail, and include such factors as: (1) inadequate funds for State administration; (2) insufficient State staffing; (3) circumstances encouraging sponsors to submit overstated claims for payment; (4) identification of program target areas needs more attention; (5) improved but still inconsistent approval of sponsors and sites; (6) improved control of bidding and contracting; (7) insufficient State program monitoring and action on monitoring results; and (8) excessive advance payments to  sponsors.

The observations include the way the mission is approached from a human factors point of view  relative to skill training, counseling, and placement. Also discussed are communication systems (formal and informal) among staff and trainee populations, trainee backgrounds, their perceptions of training, counseling, and placement, and their recommendations and gains. In addition, the report proposes recommendations for constructive change in the present model.

This study found that a comprehensive set of procedures was needed to provide for the development of effective training and for assessment of the training's effectiveness. In response to Task V contract requirements, an instructional systems development (ISD) model was formulated. The model contains five phases: analyze, design, develop, implement, and control. The initial step was to verify the content validity of the material and then conduct extensive formative evaluation. Performance and attitudinal data gathered during field trials of the material were used to determine where revisions  were necessary in the final product. The completed package of validated materials, &quot;The Interservice Procedures for Instructional Systems Development,&quot; includes a five-volume set of manuals (available in ERIC as ED 122 018-022) covering all phases of the procedures and a series of workshops for technical and management level personnel involved in the use of ISD.

A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify all relevant administrator competency studies and available competency-based instructional materials. Fifteen studies were located. A curriculum development approach called Developing a Curriculum (DACUM) was used to update the competencies identified through the literature search and to identify an additional 36-40 additional tasks not found in the literature. All competency statements were analyzed, refined, and merged into a single administrator Task Inventory Instrument (191 task statements). It was then submitted to a stratified nationally representative sample of  130 practicing administrators of secondary and postsecondary vocational education programs. One hundred and twenty administrators returned usable instruments. Of the 191 task statements, 166 were considered to be verified as important. Responses to 31 tasks were found to differ significantly between secondary and postsecondary administrators and 15 tasks differed significantly between urban and rural administrators.

A search was conducted to identify currently available competency-based vocational administrator materials. Very few materials were located. Six prototypic competency-based modules were developed for training local vocational administrators using the competencies identified and nationally verified in the research phase of the project as the research base. The following six procedures were utilized: (1) verified competencies were tentatively clustered for curriculum development purposes, (2) an instructional materials  format was devised, (3) six prototypic modules and a user's guide were developed, (4) the modules and guide were field tested with administrator trainees in four types of instructional settings, (5) all materials were revised based on the feedback obtained, and (6) all materials and reports were prepared for publication and dissemination. The results of field testing indicated that all six of the modules were effective in helping administrator trainees achieve the designated competencies. A test revealed that trainee's perception of their growth on all six modules was statistically significant at the .001 level. Further, both the trainees and resource persons (instructors) reacted favorably to each of the six modules and to the use of modules as a method of instruction as compared with  traditional college education courses.

The area of minority youth includes a review of literature on: educational and occupational choice and the effect on achievement; research on the role of significant other influence in the education and occupational choices of black and white urban youth; research in the same area concentrating on females; and a handbook on sources of influence on career decision making. Regarding career development of women, one publication reports the findings of a study that applied two career pattern systems for women to data  available on a national sample. Another discusses the representation of careers for women in career guidance materials. Also, a parent handbook is reviewed that examines career implications of sex stereotyping. An instructional unit concerning the transition from school to work is described in detail including titles and prices of instructional packages. A complete set of materials for guidance program planning and evaluation is presented along with prices for the set and single copy prices. This set contains booklets, handout material masters, a filmstrip, and a cassette tape. (CT)",

        "description":"A study of employment procedures at an unnamed gas utility company was made, examining selection procedures, white and blue collar employee performance, promotion rates, and turnover. The data is based on application files, interviews with management personnel, and employee records. The company relied primarily on walk-ins and employee referrals for its job applicants. Private employment agencies were used for some specialized white collar jobs. Social agencies and the employment service were sources of black applicants. The company's selection procedures included informal and subjective elements that led to employment preference for white applicants who were related to company employees. Black employees were hired primarily as a consequence of explicit affirmative action by the  company's personnel office at headquarters. Variables that had a significant effect on the screening and hiring of new employees were referral sources, aptitude and intelligence tests, and evidence of specific skills and experience. The data suggested the possibility of discrimination against blacks and female employees in performance ratings and promotions. Both blue and white collar workers appeared able to improve their performance indicators through technical job-related courses made available or supported by the company. Short run turnover was highest for employees who were young, female, or black, and who had transferable skills. (Appended are statistics and procedures used in the study.) (Author/CT)",

        "description":"Because of the large number of vocational agriculture programs in Texas public schools and the large sum expended annually on their curriculum materials, a study was undertaken to determine the suitability of single topic student materials and of state adopted textbooks for both group and individual instructional purposes. From a random sample of 425 vocational agriculture teachers chosen to be surveyed, 400 returned the opinionnaire. Based on a statistical analysis of their responses, the following were concluded: (1) both single topic student materials and state adopted textbooks should continue to be used in Texas for both individual and group instructional purposes; (2) a majority of teachers favor single topic student materials over state adopted textbooks; (3) teachers  prefer hardbound to paperback student materials; and (4) teachers in different geographical areas perceive different needs in student materials. The following topics were recommended for future studies: the relationship between the teachers' viewpoints and factors such as geographical location, department size, tenure level, and average number of students per teacher; an assessment of which state adopted textbooks are not up-to-date and technically accurate; and the replication of this study in other states for the basis of comparison and after five years in Texas to determine if deficiencies in student materials have been corrected.

        "description":"This research was designed to develop and test a model of the Air Force manpower market. The study indicates that previous manpower supply studies failed to account for simultaneous determination of enlistments and retentions and misinterpreted regressions as supply equations. They are, instead, reduced form equations resulting from joint interaction of Air Force demand and enlistment supply activity. A stochastic process model is used to represent the Air Force manpower market. Variables determining manpower inventory levels, personnel turnover, and new enlistment flows are the mandated force level requirement, Air Force and civilian wages, the unemployment rate, and perceived civilian returns to Air Force-provided training. In the model it is possible to trace the impact of  changes in the determining variables upon retention and enlistments. The empirical work supports the simultaneous demand and supply approach developed in the study. The results indicate that (1) changes in force level account for most enlistment rate changes during the all-volunteer force period, (2) higher Air Force wages have improved retention and reduce demand for new enlistments, (3) accessions show lower Air Force Qualifications Test scores, and (4) previous estimates of military manpower supply elasticities are biased downward from true elasticity.

Thirty-five participants were selected through a combination of geographic, performance, and potential criteria. Following a needs assessment and pretest, participants attended eight seminars, including orientation, vocational education planning, funding skills, status of industrial arts, technology, concerns in industrial arts, special needs education, and interpersonal relationships. Following a posttest it was concluded that it  would be advisable to develop a similar activity for industrial arts supervisors. In addition, it was concluded that the advisory council approach by the state's industrial arts teacher education institutions is of significant value and that a cooperative effort among the industrial arts profession, the colleges, and the state division of vocational education is essential to the success of personal development projects. It was also concluded that there are many needs in industrial arts which remain unaddressed.

The major purpose of this study was to provide a preliminary assessment of the field operation needs of vocational education. From a list of more than 6,000 nominations, an instrument designed to gather priority ratings for forty-eight needs was developed. The instrument was administered to local and state vocational education personnel. Findings indicate the following conclusions: (1) highest priority needs included improvements in collaboration with key segments of the employment community in communicating the benefits of vocational education and the relevance of  curricula to job requirements; (2) high priority needs have an &quot;external&quot; orientation; (3) the major differences among groups concerning priorities were between state level and local level personnel; (4) while respondents agreed with priorities in the 1976 education amendments, they appear to have assigned lower priority to problems such as equal opportunity enrollment and sex sterotyping; and (5) six fundamental considerations appear (for example, data-based decision-making and community interaction), to underlie the respondents' priority decisions.

In particular, the effectiveness of the CETA (Comprehensive Employment and Training Act) and YEDPA (Youth Employment and Demonstration Projects Act) programs concerned the Committee. Following an opening statement by Senator Harrison Williams, testimony and prepared statements were given by public officials of Perth Amboy and Middlesex County as well as by school officials, representatives of various community agencies, and CETA trainees. The majority of witnesses felt that CETA had achieved limited success in targeting services and jobs to those in need. The Puerto Rican Association of Human Development presented testimony and  documentation on the failure of CETA to help Hispanics gain employment. It was recommended that CETA develop more sophisticated evaluation procedures, that local agencies have more input in funding distribution, bilingual programs be instituted, and CETA and the school districts increase their cooperative efforts. David H. Tyrrell of Middlesex County College testified on the relationship between CETA and colleges, stressing the need for ongoing commitment on the part of the government and the schools. He also emphasized the importance of bilingual education.

        "description":"Examining the trends and issues in vocational education, this speech focuses on the historical basis for vocational education, the current situation in vocational education, vocational education in the 1980's, the role of vocational education in economic development, and research related to these topics. Issues which are currently being discussed in congress, industry, and education are listed along with current problems affecting the success of vocational education in the area of transition from school to work. The implications for vocational education research are presented in the following four questions: (1) What economic impact does vocational education have? (2) Does the training one receives in vocational education make a smoother transition from school to work? (3) How  well are current vocational education programs doing? and (4) Can vocational education help solve problems relating to welfare, crime, health, urban and rural development. Included is a question and answer series relating to the Bakke decision, unemployment, inflation, the youth employment and development project, competency-based testing, career centers, and area vocational-technical schools.

PBTE implementation problems, strategies, and solutions were identified and documented for use as a resource by others interested in implementing PBTE. From forty-two eligible sites, five leadership sites and fifteen other sites were selected to participate. Participants met to identify and prioritize PBTE implementation problems, identify viable strategies for solving these problems, and develop plans of action at each site. A second meeting was held to assess progress made and initiate specific plans for a dissemination workshop to share implementation  strategies and related materials. Each workshop participant received data concerning the progress made by each leadership site, narrative comments prepared by each leadership site concerning problems and strategies, and six resource packages covering six key problem areas. Fifteen appendixes include a project description, status study instrument, planning worksheets, slide-tape scripts, case studies, and evaluation reports. (Author/LRA)",

A national survey of programs in operation in community and junior colleges and in business and industry provided the basis for the development of a modified delphi instrument that was submitted to a panel of experts for their evaluation and recommendations. Instrument items consisted of possible career planning activities and various procedures for facilitating the implementation of a career planning program. Among the panel's conclusions were these: (1) a majority of the individual career planning activities are  considered to be very important for inclusion within any programmatic effort to assist employed women in their career planning and developmental goals, and (2) those career planning activities that seem to be directed more at improving the knowledge and skills of employed women were judged to be more important than those various activities that related to women's individual personal needs. Development suggestions for career planning programs for employed women make up the bulk of the document. (CT)",

Two preliminary forms of the instrument were created, each consisting of 125 items. Approximately 360 students in grades eight and eleven were administered these forms. Based on these results, a revised instrument consisting of 75 items that were grouped into 15 scales was prepared and administered to 467 ninth grade students and 568 twelfth grade students.  Overall item results indicated that the work ethic is deeply entrenched in Alberta students and that they appear confident in their ability to succeed. Validity of the scales were examined by checking differences based upon junior and senior high school responses, sex, school program, job aspiration, holders of part-time jobs, students with full-time summer job experience, and comparisons with certain groups selected for closer experimentation. The results of the analyses supported the validity of the revised instrument. Results of the reliability studies were not conclusive. (The instrument and administrator's manual are appended.) (BM)",

An instrument was needed to examine the following five areas of concern: (1) attitudes toward earning a living; (2) perceptions about employer expectations; (3) perceptions about available opportunities; (4) relevance of school preparation for employment; and (5) characteristics of desirable jobs. Two pilot instruments were administered to approximately 360 students in grades eight and eleven.

The revised instrument was administered to 467 ninth grade students and 568 twelfth grade students. The students were sampled from eight separate geographic locations in Alberta. Analyses of the student opinions indicated that the scales were relatively independent of each other, were structurally valid, and should be retained in the revised instrument.

The status of programs using evidence of program effectiveness from existing data is discussed. Suggesting research needed and possible approaches for studies, the paper concludes with implications for programs, funding allocations, and legislation. The second paper, &quot;Assessment of Consumer and Homemaking Education&quot; (A. Cross), discusses criteria for determining the effectiveness of curriculum in consumer and homemaking education. Two major criteria are suggested: meeting needs of  the various groups targeted by legislation and the competencies essential for the homemaker. Types of studies needed when evaluating a program are suggested. The paper concludes with a rationale for consumer and homemaking education as a part of vocational education. The third paper, &quot;Legislation for Consumer and Homemaking Education: Social Implication&quot; (E. Simpson), examines the role of consumer and homemaking education in the Education Amendments of 1966, and selected characteristics of the American family and relevant social issues having implication for home economics and for related legislation. The purposes of home economics and the role of such programs in vocational and general education are also presented. The paper concludes with a discussion of future alternatives.  (JH)",

        "description":"In order to learn how people may alter or reconcile their aspirations and jobs during their career development, this study examined the match between vocational aspirations and actual jobs of white young men and older men. Age trends in the match between vocational aspirations and actual jobs were studied in a nationally representative sample of 3,730 white men aged sixteen to twenty-eight who were interviewed yearly over a five-year period. Findings indicate that as the youth aged, higher agreement between jobs and aspirations (classified according to Holland's typology) occurred. In addition, the distributions of both aspirations and actual jobs differed with age. Larger proportions of the older men were engaged in enterprising work, and the distribution of aspirations, which  at age sixteen diverged markedly from the distribution of jobs, resembled that distribution more closely by age twenty-eight. (Implications for changing strategies of vocational counseling and research are included.) (Author/LRA)",

        "description":"Examining the transition from school to work in Europe, this speech focuses on a comparison of initial occupational preparation for young people in France, Germany, and Great Britain. The desired competencies in new entrants to the labor market are listed in four categories: basic cognitive skills; personal qualities and work attitudes; interpersonal skills; analytical abilities and the ability to plan, organize, or make decisions; and specific occupational skills. A detailed description of national systems of skill training in France is provided. The following five issues regarding initial occupational preparation in Europe are presented: (1) What occupations should be designated for training purposes and how can one be separated from another? (2) How long should the training  last? (3) In what setting should occupational skills be acquired? (4) Where in the educational and work cycle should this training occur? (5) Who should receive formal skill training? A question and answer section is included in which the author answers questions relating to topics such as apprenticeships, the vocational education system in France, women in vocational education, handicapped people in vocational education, teacher training programs in other countries, manpower and educational planning, and how vocational education in other countries will effect change in the United States' vocational education policy.

Fourth, ninth, and twelfth grade students were selected from inner city and suburban schools. Six schools were selected for the fourth grade, and three schools were selected at the ninth and twelfth grade levels. Four girls, four teachers, and two guidance counselors at each grade level were randomly selected for interviews from the participating schools. Instruments were developed to measure confidence in doing mathematics, to measure interest in mathematics, to determine future plans to study mathematics and reasons for the decisions, and to determine career plans and reasons for the choices. The only statistically significant result from  the questionnaires appeared on the question of interest at the twelfth grade level. Girls scored significantly lower than boys at the .01 level of significance. Interview question responses indicated that there is a decrease in girls' interest in mathematics and a sharp increase in societal pressure against women in mathematics during the students' high school years.

Questionnaires concerning ninety-seven tasks were mailed to a random sample of teacher-coordinators, and all assistant state supervisors, local supervisors, and teacher educators in Virginia. The questionnaire concerned the relevancy of the tasks, the extent to which coordinators performed the tasks in the role of advisors, and the location at which the tasks  should be learned. Fifty percent or more of the responding teacher-coordinators indicated that they performed all of the ninety-seven talks listed in their role as DECA advisors. Fifty percent or more of the assistant state supervisors, local supervisors, and teacher educators indicated that teacher-coordinators should perform all ninety-seven tasks. The extent to which the tasks should be developed varied among the tasks. The major locations at which the tasks should be learned were identified as preservice and inservice programs.

        "description":"Health care is demanding increasing resources and attention in numbers of health care workers, in levels of skills required, in time spent in training, and in dollars expended. A greater spectrum of skills is required to cope with increasing health care demands, yet trends toward specialization and fracturing of responsibilities assigned to health care personnel often obstruct opportunity for application of the individual's full range of preparation. In the South, college allied health programs have registered a seven-fold increase in graduates and basic registered nursing programs have doubled, but geographical distribution problems prevent easing of worker shortages. To insure the quality of care, there is a trend to lengthen the educational preparation for entry into many  allied health fields, yet there is evidence that many workers are overtrained for the task they perform. Lengthened programs can enhance the quality of preparation, but also raise the total cost of health care. In considering the many current proposals for allied health and registered nurse programs at higher degree levels, postsecondary education should distinguish between needs for selective advanced education versus a general lengthening of entry-level preparation.

The study utilized a twelve-week sample of eighty-nine student pilots to statistically validate the Good Stick Index (GSI) as an objective measure of pilot air combat skill, to compare GSI measures to the subjective judgment of ACM skill made by instructor pilots, to investigate improvements as a measure of ACM skill, and to evaluate GSI's utility as a training aid. (GSI utilizes four parameters as indicators of air combat skill: time in gun firing envelope, average mil error, offensive/ defensive time, and time to first kill.) It was concluded  from analysis of the data that the GSI was a measure of ACM skill with contributory parameters consistent with intuitive expert opinion and with an acceptable level of accurate assessment of skill in the simulator. The GSI score was judged to be useful in evaluating individual and group learning within training programs in ACM. The individual parameters comprising the GSI were found usable as teaching guides.

Questionnaires were sent to 591 teachers in all areas of vocational education. Questionnaire items were rated according to degree of importance as perceived by the vocational teachers for their particular program areas. Results revealed six tasks which were generic to all programs. Tasks included the following: (1) determine students' strengths and weaknesses; (2) select teaching techniques that meet the instructional needs of individual students; (3) assign students to master specialized technical vocabulary related to course of instruction; (4)  encourage students to use the correct definitions of words; (5) encourage students to interpret information, draw conclusions, and predict outcomes when reading; and (6) assign students to read a sequence of events, methods or steps, or to follow written directions. Each individual program identified twelve to twenty-six competencies unique to their area. (Survey instruments are appended.) (LRA)",

Furthermore, the project supported the value of developing and testing one or more models for APL/vocational education interface. In order to satisfy the objectives of the project, two monographs were prepared and an APL Curriculum Materials Catalog was compiled which used three criteria for materials included in the catalog. In field testing the project's competency-based Adult Vocational Model, pre- and post-testing of the adult learners, using the Adult APL Survey, was performed. When the results of the pre- and post-test scores, using the t-test of correlated means, were  analyzed, a difference at the .05 level of significance was revealed. The instructors who field tested the model expressed an overall favorable attitude toward infusion of APL material into their vocational subjects. As a result of their support, recommendations were made that this study be replicated using a wider representation of vocational areas. Findings of the study included the recommendations that the State-of-the-Art and the APL Curriculum Catalog be updated yearly because of the continuing development of APL programs and materials.

The workbook also leads participants to use the planning process on a given community problem within a simulatd community. This skill is then applied to an action plan for a problem area identified in advance by the participant. (Author/PJC)",
