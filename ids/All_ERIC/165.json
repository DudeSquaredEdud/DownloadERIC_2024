        "author":["Stevens, David W."],
        "description":"Intended to inform administrators of vocational-technical education programs, and other interested persons, what the state of the art is in producing and using employment projections for educational planning purposes, this essay focuses on labor market concepts which should be used, but are now frequently abused, in the development and operation of information systems for managing and planning vocational-technical education programs. There are six chapters: (1) Introduction, (2) Employment Projection Models, (3) Employment Projection Methods: Strengths and Weaknesses, (4) Toward an Understanding of Labor Market Concepts and Processes, (5) Educational Planning Uses of Labor Market Concepts, and (6) Mission Impossible? Footnotes and bibliography are included with a note indicating  that an integral part of this effort to convey an understanding of labor market concepts and reasons for their misuse or nonuse is a selective citation of relevant items from recent literature dealing with labor market and employment projection issues.

        "description":"The purposes of the study were to (1) determine the overall perception of vocational education in Indiana as held by the general public, (2) determine if there are differences in perceptions related to the various areas within vocational education, (3) identify perceptions of vocational education by junior and senior high school students, elementary secondary teachers and school personnel, parents and patrons of a school district, employers of vocational education graduates, and young adults not currently in school, and (4) identify the determinants of negative and positive perceptions of vocational education. Telephone interviews (by trained interviewers) were conducted with 399 respondents drawn from a stratified random sample based on these factors: Geographical location,  population density, number of vocational education programs, junior and senior high school students, parents, school personnel, and employers. Students and school personnel were drawn from a sample of 12 schools selected from a total of 341 schools in Indiana. Results showed that (1) vocational education in Indiana is perceived more favorably than unfavorably, however, the discipline areas of vocational education are not viewed in the same manner by the general public, parents, students, school personnel, and employers, and (2) perceptions and opinions related to vocational education are influenced to a greater degree by personal and physical exposure to vocational education programs rather than through indirect more passive approaches. Recommendations are included in this report.  (SH)",

        "description":"Three project objectives were (1) to identify the competencies required for entry into the professional role of the teacher of vocational agriculture (exclusive of the technical competencies of scientific agriculture), (2) to validate the competencies identified, and (3) to initiate procedures for incorporating the validated competencies into the teacher education programs of the nine universities providing certification programs for vocational agriculture teachers in Texas. A list of teacher competencies was developed based on review of the literature, a working conference of teacher educators, and a pilot test with vocational agriculture teachers. The final list was incorporated in an instrument designed to illicit the respondent's opinion of the importance of each of 135  competency statements. Responses were secured from 311 of the 349 vocational agriculture teachers serving as supervising teachers in Texas (89%) and from 22 of 24 teacher trainers (92%) and 14 of 15 State staff personnel (93%). Data were compiled and became the basic documentation for decisionmaking at a second working conference of teacher educators to initiate procedures for incorporation of the validated competencies into teacher education programs of the nine universities. Outcomes, in addition to the identification and validation of a core of essential professional competencies required by vocational agriculture teachers, include the establishment of a base for the development of curriculum materials and laboratory experiences through cooperation among the agricultural education  departments of the State. Another result has been development of a transportable model that could be used by other vocational teacher education disciplines to accomplish similar outcomes. (The report includes the list of competencies with mean ratings for each respondent group.) (LAS)",

Components of the project emphasized awareness and career orientation for K-6, established career resource areas in junior high school libraries, and developed career guidance and placement centers in the senior high schools. The placement component continues to provide employment experiences to individual students. Conclusions reported include the following: Positive career education (CE) movement and involvement throughout the school district has  occurred and objectives are being achieved. Teachers, students, and administrators feel that CE is effective and is a worthwhile expenditure of resources in terms of student development. Materials are viewed as motivational in that the relationship between education and life are explored. Data indicate that students appreciate the opportunity to experience decisionmaking strategies.

The blueprint will establish a mechanism for interagency communication and cooperation at all levels, involving all aspects of health career education and training; establish a framework for identifying individual black, minority, and disadvantaged youth early in their secondary education in order to assist them in exploring careers in the health services field; and delineate the scope of counseling and related supportive services required to assist those students making a health career choice to successfully complete the selected career training and/or  educational program. This report describes the development of the operational blueprint, emphasizing management functions related to implementation of health career education and training. Other components delineated include needs assessment, education and training, and student recruitment and counseling.

        "description":"Primary objectives of a national study were to quantify resource utilization patterns of vocational education programs effectively serving special needs populations and to develop a methodology for estimating resources required to successfully serve these populations. Emphasis was placed on the disadvantaged, as defined in P.L. 90-576. Surveyed programs were selected from nominations by State consultants with responsibility for special needs programs, State advisory councils, and other selected sources. Ninety-eight program administrators (62% of the sample) completed a survey questionnaire designed to accept all measurable program resources. Seventy-eight program elements were classified into eight program components. (Resource use patterns are documented in tabular form to  facilitate program planning, budgeting, and review at all levels.) A seven-step procedure, utilizing data provided by participating program administrators was developed. (Estimates of needs are provided at national and State levels and for four types of program environments.) Findings suggested that (1) while difficult, successful vocational education for the disadvantaged is being demonstrated, (2) significant numbers of eligible students are not served, (3) the 15% set-aside funds are inadequate--12-20 times more could be expended effectively. This volume, one of a three-volume report on the national study, contains five chapters: Introduction; Literature Review, Issue Oriented Seminars, and State Plans Analysis; Methodology and Procedures; Results; and Conclusions. Appendixes include  summaries of two issue oriented seminars, sample correspondence, the master program list (coding system and system explanations), and the program administrator questionnaire.

Eleven vocational and comprehensive high schools were located that had enrolled at least five females in one or more nontraditional courses. Although these schools had no programs to encourage females to enter nontraditional areas, females were enrolled in such areas as vocational agriculture, printing, industrial chemistry, or television arts. Ten of the eleven schools were visited by members of the study team. In each, classes with females in traditionally male areas were observed and the teachers of  these classes were interviewed. Interviews were also conducted with counselors, administrators, and small groups of traditional and nontraditional students. A local coordinator was selected at each school who generated a sample of current and former students (in both traditional and nontraditional programs). A total of 1,014 permission forms were distributed and completed questionnaires were obtained from 520 students (51%). Questionnaires were collected by mail from 356 of 743 former students (48%). Questionnaires focused on attitudes, experiences, career plans, and family background. Questionnaires dealing with education, occupation, and attitudes were also collected from 366 (67%) of the parents of student respondents. The report presents data analysis, findings, and conclusions in  three parts: (1) Influences on the students' choice of a nontraditional program and examination of their school experiences and attitudes, (2) counselors' and teachers' perceptions of and attitudes toward nontraditional enrollments, and (3) postgraduation employment experiences of students.

An updated version of Tennessee's occupational information was computerized to provide on-line teletype terminal access to the information. Direct copy microfiche was developed from the printed data base. Manual career exploratory pinsorts for accessing the junior high occupational  information as well as the secondary-postsecondary version of the computerized information were developed. In addition, braille and audio tape materials were developed for use by blind students and filmstrips with audio tape narrations were developed for use by slow learners. User guides were developed for use by students, parents, teachers, counselors, and librarians on the use of each of the different types of delivery systems. Evaluation data collected from students, parents, teachers, counselors, and librarians revealed all the occupational information delivery systems were accepted favorably. Suggestions were received from users for making minor revisions in each delivery system to improve its use.

        "description":"A study compared a Modified Area Skill Survey (MASS) with a Modified Industry/Occupation Matrix (MIOM) method of projecting manpower demand. The comparison was made with regard to the bias and precision of the estimates of the two projection methods on populations of varying size. To achieve the comparison, each method was applied to the same population and estimates of future employment were obtained. A survey of the population was conducted one year later to obtain actual employment. The results were then tabulated for each projection method and a comparison of the results made using a paired sign test on the precision estimates and a paired t-test on the estimates of future employment. The results of the bias and precision comparisons were not conclusively in favor of either  projection technique. However, the cost involved in implementing the two techniques is so drastically different, it was concluded that the MIOM is more desirable for counties of all sizes. (Editor/JT)",

Procedures followed in achieving project goals and objectives were (1) to develop a career and educational information center, (2) to use the center by involving students, teachers, and counselors, (3) to develop supplementary materials for the majority of school disciplines which will tie the subject area with career investigation, (4) to develop a placement service component which can involve all students in target schools, and (5) to develop a followup component which will point up the needs in career education. Following data analysis and evaluation, these recommendations were made:  Permanent centers should be established at each high school. Each center should have a paraprofessional manager. The center must be adequately funded. Followup and placement activities should be among the functions of the center, but the center should not have the sole responsibility of these functions. The center must be located in a traffic pattern and be adequate in size to house student groups. Establishment of a student procedure for use of the center is necessary.

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine the performance levels of competencies for job entry as a data processing programer. Specifically, the study sought to answer: (1) What tasks are performed by entry level programers? (2) How frequently are these tasks performed? (3) What level of performance is necessary for these tasks? (4) How important are these tasks? and (5) What is the future projected need for these tasks? Both questionnaire and followup interviews were used. The population consisted of all data processing associate degree programing graduates at nine Wisconsin vocational, technical, and adult schools for 1973 to 1975 and their supervisors/employers. A questionnaire was developed in which respondents were asked to rate each of 75 tasks on a five-point scale relevant to  four criteria: Frequency, performance, importance, and future need. Questionnaires were mailed to each of 508 graduates (one for the graduate, and one for his employer/supervisor). There was approximately 50% response. Followup interviews were conducted with 26 graduates and 21 employers to supplement and verify the data. Both graduates and employers tended to rank the four areas the same for all six groups of tasks (systems analysis and design, program design, coding, testing and debugging, documentation, and miscellaneous). Interviews indicated that many businesses are using or are considering an on-line system in the near future. It was concluded that the Wisconsin vocational, technical, and adult education system is currently emphasizing the proper tasks needed for entry-level  programers. Many employers indicated that operation experience was very important to being a successful entry-level programer.

Subjects were the 1,156 independent school district superintendents in Texas, the 236 vocational administrators of occupational programs in those districts, and the placement service program  coordinators in the 32 schools operating placement programs. Response from each group was over 70%. Based on the study, several criteria appear to be factors in determining the priority on which applicants for employability skill development and job placement services should be evaluated. These include likelihood of administrative support, availability of facilities, high dropout ratio, urban and larger school districts, availability of vocational teaching units, schools demonstrating other areas of need such as low placement, commitment of local school districts to provide partial funding, and districts willing to abide by State guidelines to insure a uniform statewide effort. It is concluded that there are considerable perceived needs for and favorable attitudes toward the benefits of a  placement program.

        "description":"A comprehensive third-party evaluation of a regional career education project covering an eight-county area in West Virginia focused on the project's most recent year of operation (1975-76). The evaluation attempted to measure the degree of attainment of stated goals and objectives and was designed to develop a guide and lend direction to local schools in designing comprehensive career education programs. A process/product evaluation model focused on three developmental stages within the career education program: Career awareness (grades 3 and 6), career exploration (grade 9), and career preparation (grade 12). The process component, featuring specific operational and procedural (e.g., organization, materials, inservices) aspects of the program, was assessed by means of analysis  of all available project records; interviews with selected personnel: county superintendents, principals, and teachers; and unobtrusive measures. The product component, incorporating expected changes in the behavior of selected students (in grades 3, 6, 9, and 12) and changes in attitude and knowledge of representative administrators and teachers, was studied through specialized tests. It was found that the process dimension attained creditable success in both implementation and support and that career education awareness by teachers saturates the region. Since it was not possible statistically to attribute student career development gains directly to teacher participation, the establishment of behavioral objectives that relate learning activities (process) and learning outcomes (product)  is recommended.

The following specific objectives were established: (1) To develop personal, social, economic and decisionmaking skills in all students, (2) to increase elementary students' awareness of the world of work, (3) to provide career orientation and exploratory experiences for junior high or middle school students, and (4) to provide job preparation in a wide variety of occupational areas for students in grades 10-14. Third-party evaluation instruments were used to assess attitudes of teachers and students concerning the career concept. Data were collected by  reviewing reports, conducting visits to the career projects, reviewing instructional materials, and interviewing teachers and administrators. It was concluded that there was sufficient public and teacher acceptance demonstrated to term the career project an asset to the school districts involved. One-fifth of the report is a project summary: Goals, description, activities, and accomplishments.

Some of the major findings/conclusions presented are (1) Connecticut's businesses are unable to tell Connecticut's educational agencies what they need in numerical terms from the various training programs administered by the State. Long range needs of private firms are too poorly perceived to be a basis of planning by educational agencies. (2) Although Connecticut's enterprises are critical about the quality of the vocational graduates  reaching them, they are unaggressive and probably unled as to the direction to take in addressing the issue. (3) There is no common occupational language employed across the State. Chapter 2 discusses long range manpower forecasting techniques and other approaches and methods for predicting manpower needs. Chapter 3 brings together a number of considerations into a model which incorporates essential elements of a complete career guidance program.

        "description":"Research was conducted to show how segments of the population of minority and disadvantaged youth might be positively influenced by selective information campaigns to participate in vocational education programs. The first-year effort (stage 1) undertook to measure student attitudes and to develop recommendations for using this information in communicating with youth regarding vocational education. The sample studied included students from six San Francisco Bay Area school districts located in low income areas with high minority populations. Q-methodology was used to group subjects into clusters or segments of students who had reacted similarly to 48 attitude statements. Of two distinct segments, the largest (type 1) reported agreement with positive attitude statements. Type 2  students, comprising one-third of the sample, were more negative. It was concluded (1) that messages for type 2 students needed to inform them of the positive aspects of vocational education programs and to be channeled through more credible and respected sources and (2) that those for type 1 students should focus on delivery information, explaining where and how to become involved in vocational education programs. Stage 2 of the study involved developing and testing prototype information campaigns (slide tapes) aimed at each type. The messages were presented in seven classrooms in San Francisco. Before the presentation students were asked to respond to a 10-item battery to classify them as type 1 or type 2 and then to complete a pretest. They then received (on a random basis) one of the  messages and a posttest. The results indicated again the existence of the two types of students. However, with regard to immediate commitment (intent to take vocational education courses now) results were independent of treatments. (Author/LAS)",

The four occupations studied were sewing machine operator, fabric specialist, alterations hand, and laundry and dry cleaners. Four separate questionnaires were designed and sent out to 151 randomly selected companies: 39 laundries and dry cleaners, 35 fabric stores, 32 alterations establishments, and 45 sewing machine operator employers. To obtain information about the personal characteristics desired in employees, 20 professional visits were made to interview five respondents in each of the four job areas. The data  obtained from each questionnaire was tabulated, computed, and evaluated separately within each job area, using means, standard deviation, median, and rank order. The four questionnaires are included, as are the task lists with mean frequencies, and recommendations for setting up a clothing service curriculum based on the study's conclusions. (Author/HD)",

        "description":"The purpose of the study was to identify the counseling needs of the adult student enrolled in vocational-technical schools, and specifically to identify the vocational, financial, educational, personal, and social concerns reported by students. A paper-and-pencil questionnaire was administered to a total of 1,817 subjects--1,514 full- or part-time students attending one of three area vocational-technical schools in Wisconsin during 1975-76, and 303 from the same three communities who were considering returning to school but were not enrolled at the time of the study. The particular schools were selected to insure representative sampling across size of institution, rural vs. urban setting, and area of the State. Results showed that sex, age, and full-time/part-time status all  appear to be related to the type of concerns reported by students attending postsecondary vocational schools and that academic and vocational concerns appear to be predominant among students and nonstudents. Implications resulting from the findings were (1) the need for trial learning experiences (possibly minilabs) wherein the adult has an opportunity to perform the &quot;typical&quot; student behavior in a relatively low-risk supportive environment, (2) the need to provide vocational information in a manner more geared to adults rather than adolescents, and (3) the need to recognize and attend to the unique needs of full-time and part-time, male and female students of varying ages.

Focus in the final year was on refining the exiting placement program model for high school seniors. Overall project results and accomplishments were these: Established and refined the general concept of career education among local school and central office staff, established and operated a community resource system, developed and pilot tested a model placement service for exiting seniors, and provided  placement service to several hundred exiting seniors during the 3-year period. Evaluation and conclusions indicate that project components such as the community resource system and placement service were effective and useful. It is suggested that in order for placement services to be effective a set of knowledges, skills, and attitudes should be built up over a period of years through a comprehensive and continuing career development program as well as through the regular instructional program. Description of the placement component, the conceptual model in chart form, and operational steps are included. Forms and materials developed and used in this component are contained in Appendix A.

Results of the evaluation are organized around three major information areas of interest: Student self concept, student awareness of the world of work, and teacher use of career education resources and related practices. Evaluation instruments used with students were the Self Observation Scales (SOS), the Career Education Questionnaire (CEQ) (for grades 2-6), and the Career Maturity Inventory (CMI). Teachers were asked to complete the Career Education Teacher Practices Survey and the Bedford Career Education Survey.  Detailed in the report are a description of the career education program, the conceptual basis for the evaluation (information-based evaluation), a discussion of information needs and test results, and conclusions and recommendations. The major conclusion reported is that results of student outcome data and the teacher survey generally support the project documentation regarding the use of career education materials and activities, and they present a picture of the successful implementation of goals and objectives of the program.

The project was conducted using staff members from the Lakeshore Technical Institute (Wisconsin) to provide instruction, and the employees of the Sheboygan County Comprehensive Health Center (Wisconsin) as recipients of the instruction. Ten hours of continuing education inservice training were provided for each employee in five 2-hour modules. A total of 13 modules was produced--one common module in communications in addition  to four modules in each of the areas of dietary, housekeeping-janitorial, and nursing care services. The project staff concluded that this type of continuing education inservice utilizing the videotape is viable and should therefore be recommended to other nursing homes and small hospitals. This report provides a full description of the project which covers evaluation, limitations, future plans, and recommendations. The appendixes cover the majority of the document and include the video orientation script, list of topics for nursing homes, study guide used in the inservice program, TV instructor preproduction considerations, a newspaper article, employees enrolled, guidelines for operating inservice continuous education programs, conference reports, and correspondence.

(The program began with a Federally funded pilot program in the spring of 1972 in three schools and has expanded, over a four and one-half year period, to a total program in all 25 Norwalk schools. The objectives were to make students aware of why people work, the dignity of work, the wide variety of options available, and to help them acquire skills necessary for work and engage in work that is satisfying and beneficial to society.) Elementary school teachers used career education curriculum units and received assistance from a career education specialist. In the middle schools several approaches were taken  including activity periods, simulated work experiences, guidance, and others. At the high school level the career resource center was available on a full-day basis, and career conferences and activities were conducted on a regular basis. The Armed Forces Vocational Aptitude Battery was given to high school students on a voluntary basis. In this report, findings and analyses, conclusions, and recommendations are made for each of the three grade levels.

The body of the report describes objectives of the participating agencies, their activities, results of activities, and conclusions. Achievements and conclusions listed include the following: (1) A  statewide system for curriculum change in occupational education was developed, (2) technical support was provided to formulate methods and processes for development and implementation of the support system, (3) teacher training with resultant production of modularized curriculum packages in automotive mechanics and office clerical areas occurred as planned and a pilot project was conducted to test the quality and usefulness of the modules, (4) the project was successful in generating teacher enthusiasm and work in organization of curriculum management materials, (5) the most problematic area of development was installation and utilization of the computer retrieval systems tested, so it was concluded that a technical support system should followup rather than parallel curriculum  development, and (6) the success of the overall effort was such as to warrant continuation and expansion through a second phase of development currently underway.

Data on students in these programs were compared with data on students with nonschool-supervised jobs and students with no jobs. Characteristics and experiences of current and former students were compared. A random sample was selected from the 50 largest standard metropolitan statistical areas east of the Mississippi and their contiguous nonmetropolitan counties. Data were obtained from 33 high schools in 15 school districts. Information on the costs of work experience and vocational programs was obtained from school records and questionnaires given to students and school officials. The report deals with vocational education, work experience, and  cost-effectiveness analysis; economic costs and benefits; effects of cooperative education on post-high school employment experiences; monetary returns; effects on personal development, education, and employment; effects on career development and on students' perceptions of school and jobs; and cooperative education and the employer. It was concluded that from a strictly monetary point of view, investment in work experience, rather than nonwork experience vocational programs, is not justified; however, many other measures indicate the program achieves other educational, developmental, and attitudinal objectives.

        "description":"Implementation and expansion of class offerings was the primary focus of the second year of a project (in Evansville, Indiana) to determine the feasibility of establishing a center for continuing education for vocational level health occupations workers within the department of vocational education of a metropolitan school corporation. (The first year activities primarily concerned identification of needs, establishment of tentative administrative guidelines, and initiation of one new program.) Developing program curriculum content and activities according to established guidelines and criteria for accredited continuing education offerings was also emphasized in the second year along with refinement of administrative guidelines and improved communications to and from teachers.  Programs for offering were selected on the basis of need as indicated from a survey conducted the first year of the project. Since the second year involved implementation, no research was conducted. Program effectiveness was perceptually evaluated by participants, instructors, and advisory committee members. A total of 201 students were enrolled in nine class offerings and community acceptance was perceived as favorable. An increasing number of employers paid or at least reimbursed participants' tuition costs. This report includes brief statements about conclusions, recommendations, and evaluation plans. The appendixes, which cover the majority of the document, present course descriptions for the courses offered during the project's second year. (SH)",

Guidance development and technical development were the two components of the project from July 1, 1974 to August 31, 1975. This report describes the project in two sections, according to its two components. Overall project objectives are contained in the first section (Guidance Development) along with a discussion of accomplishments, major activities and events, problems, and publicity activities. The second section (Technical Development) covers technical aspects  of accomplishments, major activities and events, problems, publicity, dissemination, other activities, staff employment and utilization, and staff development. Modules which were developed and input into the computer system are described. Appendixes contain the following materials: Monthly progress reports, advisory board meeting minutes, guidelines for script preparation, field test site selection and evaluation plan, outline of inservice training program for counselors, contracts with publishers, plan for dissemination and maintenance of DISCOVER, budget, suggested division of funds, abstract and newsletter, DISCOVER system flowcharts, data base descriptions, administrative applications, and list of DISCOVER programming support functions.

The emphasis of the specific objectives was primarily on potential teacher outcomes such as awareness, understanding, and the ability to describe, identify, and design certain types of educational experiences focusing on the career needs of students and the infusion of career and vocational education within current classroom experiences. The program included both classroom and hands-on experiences in a variety of career/vocational areas. The teachers were able to take three courses in the following areas which constitute a minor in career/vocational education:  Curriculum in career education, career education practicum, and internship in a local business, industry, or trade. Project evaluation and data results indicated that students enrolled in the program showed significantly greater knowledge about career education than potential teachers who followed traditional liberal arts teacher education programs. Recommendations were made in the curriculum, administration, and resource areas for program implementation. (TA)",

Objectives, procedures followed, and project results and accomplishments are reported in detail. Results of the project included the establishment and refinement of the general concept of career education among local school and central office staff, establishment and operation of a community resource system, development and pilot testing of a model placement service for exiting seniors, and provision of placement services to several hundred exiting seniors during the 3-year period. Evaluation indicated that 62% of the students who left school after the second and third quarters of the 1975-1976 school year requested help in locating  employment. All students who requested assistance were eventually placed in jobs. Results of followup studies indicated that two-thirds were still employed. Placement activities were supported by the community resource system established to identify, analyze, and catalog community resources and make the information available to all school staff. It is recommended that in order for placement services to be effective, students need a well developed set of knowledges, skills, and attitudes, which should be built up over a period of years through a comprehensive and continuing career development program carried on in the guidance program and through regular instructional program.

        "description":"The Aides to Career Education (ACE) Program employs instructional aides to help disadvantaged vocational education students in Los Angeles develop positive attitudes toward education and employment, more cooperative behavior, pride in their course work, efficiency in completing assigned tasks, and improved attendance. In 1975-76 (the fourth year) there were 289 aides assigned to 49 high schools and 1 regional occupational center plus 13 counselor aides in 13 urban impact schools. The (1975-76) evaluation included analysis of quantitative data, administration of questionnaires to certificated, classified, and student personnel, and onsite visitations by project administrators. Findings indicated that the program was effective in meeting its overall goal of increasing individual  assistance to disadvantaged students. The program had a generally positive effect on the students assisted, especially on the slower ones. The greatest efforts of the aides were in the area of direct assistance to students. Project objectives for median ratings of 3.0 or more (on a 1-4 scale) were met in all areas and were higher than in the previous year; attendance of students in classes with ACE aides was also higher. Monthly inservice education workshops for development of aides' skills and for acquisition of feedback about the program were found to be generally effective. Provision of career guidance counselors and of teacher-developed instructional materials was found by teachers to be valuable. For the third year the number of hours assigned to each aide and the number of aides  assigned to each school were reported to be inadequate to meet student needs.

Six trained interviewers conducted interviews with graduates, their parents, and their employers. Seven basic instruments were also developed for the survey procedure. Some of the major conclusions were (1) the majority of graduates felt they had received enough information from available guidance services for selecting vocational programs, (2) many graduates responsed that they did not  receive enough help from their school in finding a job, (3) about half the graduates reported their present job completely unrelated to their high school training, (4) in general, employers felt the graduates were adequately trained for entry level work skills and few needed job station changes for their handicap, and (5) many parents liked the educational programs but expressed the need for more language development, on-the-job training, educational counseling, followup services, practical living skills, and educational programs closer to home.

        "description":"An explanation of the change that has taken place in the aims and purposes of educational policy of industralized societies as the relationship between the education and the occupation systems has changed over the course of the transformation of elite education into a mass phenomenon is the objective of this paper. Analysis and discussion is based on the thesis that in the course of this transformation process social inequality has seen its legitimization challenged and that the demand that &quot;overqualification&quot; be avoided and the qualification processes be geared to the assumed requirements of the occupational system reflects the conscious or unconscious desire to give social inequality once again the legitimization that had been shaken by the expansion of higher education. A  summary of the political debate on the expansion of education is followed by an assessment of the way changes in the relationship between the education and the occupation systems are received in the literature. Attention is given to the ideas that expansion leads to overqualification and that it promotes neither equality of opportunity nor any reduction in social inequality. Current developments are then examined as evidence of a fundamental change in the way qualification and status distribution interact. An additional chapter is devoted to an examination of current trends and tendencies in selection processes in education. The final chapter is a discussion of policy proposals that have been developed with the aim of coping with the problems that have arisen under the conditions now  governing selection as a result of mass higher education. West German literature on the subject is given particular attention; developments in the U.S. and Japan are discussed; and material on England and a number of other European countries are employed as well.

        "description":"The study was concerned with the persistent problem in conducting person/situation research--the identification of relevant dimensions or features of the situation. Since the usual strategy for discovering relevant perceptual dimension of organizational life is to ask organizational employees to respond to a set of predetermined questions, this study made use of systematic procedure for identifying the dimensions with which employees characterize their work organization--the open-ended interview and a questionnaire. Sixty-seven employees of a large middle Atlantic coast utility company were interviewed and responded to a questionnaire. Fifteen interview content categories, or issues, were identified and interviews were coded for frequency (mention of the issue), importance of the  issue, and effect with which the issue was raised (the average positiveness or negativeness with which issues were mentioned). Issues mentioned most frequently were promotion/evaluation, company management, pay/security, and supervision. The most important issues were promotion/evaluation and supervision. Affectively, bureaucracy was most negative and friendships was most positive. It was concluded that the need exists to begin focusing on the assessment of issues meaningful to individuals in the work situation, and that were attitude measures constructed to be more salient to people both in the kinds of issues raised and the directions used, they might prove more useful in attempts to document the perceptual dimensions with which employees characterize their work settings and as in aid  in gaining more reliability in person/situation research, especially that which emphasizes the interaction of employee perceptions of the work world and other employee attitudes as a strategy for understanding employee behavior.

(Major objectives of the project were (1) to explore Lhe effects of dropping out of high school, (2) to assess the degree to which educational and occupational attainments are predictable from tenth grade measures, (3) to determine the role of educational attainment in occupational attainment, as compared with the role of family background and intellectual ability, and (4) to determine the impacts of various post-high school environments and experiences on values, attitudes, and behaviors.) The results from the fifth and final data collection process and a brief overview of the results of the previous four studies are presented in the  introductory chapter. In chapter 2, educational attainment is treated as an outcome variable; also an extensive set of tenth grade measures is examined and the relationships of these measures with later educational attainment are analyzed. Chapters 3 and 4 focus on occupational attainments as outcome measures, with chapter 4 covering the job satisfaction aspect. In chapters 5 through 9, the changes that have occurred between 1966 and 1974 in motives, affective states, values, attitudes, aspirations, and behaviors are examined. The findings of the complete study are summarized in chapter 10. The appendixes contain a glossary providing a brief definition of each variable; various information on sampling and statistics; panel biases; population dropout rate; tabular data for figures;  stability coefficients; a matrix on intercorrelations among measures; the 1974 questionnaire; and references.

Sex differences in problem solving were clear. When the characteristics of the problems were altered to make them less appropriate to the masculine and feminine sex-roles, sex differences in problem solving were reduced. Masculine role identity was associated with a choice of analytic approach, feminine role identity with seeking help. Women indicate more frequently that they would  use trial and error.

The present study examined the cognitive and affective components of attitudes toward the presidency held by a cross-section of 274 Memphis youths, ages 7-18. Analysis of the data revealed that, as hypothesized, adolescents exhibit greater familiarity but less affection for the presidency than children.

This approach included aversion conditioning contingent upon emission of such undesirable drinking behaviors as gulping, drinking straight drinks, Blood Alcohol Level of 0.065 or greater, and time between drinks. In addition, socially acceptable alternatives to drinking were taught utilizing videotape techniques, role-playing, and biofeedback. Of the 17 subjects who began the program, 14 completed it. Of these 14, 10 remain outside the hospital. Definitive data is available relating to the behavior of seven subjects who are functioning as controlled drinkers. The results obtained indicate that alcoholics can successfully learn to control their  drinking behavior and do not have to remain totally abstinent. Discussion of relevant variables to successful training and future research directions are presented. It is clear that externally imposed controls are not sufficient in the total treatment picture. The patient who learns to develop internal control for his drinking behavior has the greatest likelihood of effectively changing his drinking patterns. (Author)",

Program objectives should be stated in terms of structure, process and outcome, all of which are further defined. Sociodemographic data is generally available about the specific populations served and should also be utilized. Outcome evaluation is seen as the  most difficult and costly type of evaluation, but of extreme importance. Outcomes should be defined and explicated. Simplifying the terminology and process of evaluation is essential for improving human service delivery. (NG)",

This paper describes an evaluation of a human development course offered on a college campus. The project attempts to discover the impact of the human development instruction course and the salient motivations of the students who participated. Students who had participated in the course were subsequently contacted by mail, and another group of participants were handed the questionnaires. Students generally regarded the course as rewarding. Their motivations for  attending included the fact that it seemed interesting; that they wished to learn about themselves; or their friends recommended it. (Author/NG)",

        "description":"Martinson's provocative article in Public Interest (Spring, 1974), denying efficacy in prisoner reform, singled out one of the uncertainties in correctional research. In their totality, these uncertainties embrace not only rehabilitative programs but also the method, theory, and organization of correctional research. To comprehend the status and effectiveness of correctional evaluation, we need to clarify such issues as (1) the relative efficacy of correctional treatments, (2) the importance of system models in evaluation, (3) extent to which research should strive for rigor in design, (4) importance of the theory in treatment and research, (5) proper location of research effort, (6) the place of advocacy in reasearch, (7) preferred training for researchers, and (8) optimal  administrative styles for correctional administrators. Logical and empirical considerations suggest that prisoner reform is as efficacious as other varieties of social reform; that system models of evaluation are under-used; that \"weak\" research designs impact correctional policy as heavily as \"strong\" designs; that \"no theory\" may be more useful than \"formal\" theory; that in-house researchers impact correctional policy more heavily than outside researchers; that advocacy is preferable to neutrality in applied correctional research; that \"academic\" orientation in applied researcher training may be dysfunctional; and that the impact of research is greater under \"experimental\" than under \"committed\" or \"trapped\" administrators.

The behavior therapist faces the potential danger of encouraging what is likely to be reinforced by the client's environment, thereby maintaining a societal status quo which, in itself, may be harmful. The author mentions the use of reinforcement procedures with children, and assertive training for women to illustrate his point. His concern with reinforcement procedures for children, particularly with token economics, is whether therapists are perpetuating within these children strong expectations for approval from others, which may have long-range negative effects. Regarding assertive training for women, he notes that, until recently, assertive training was used  less frequently for females than men, since assertive behavior was not viewed as appropriate for women. He advises the therapist to discuss openly the consequences of new behavior patterns with all clients. (Author/HMV)",

Two all male groups, two all female groups, and two mixed groups were studied over five 90-minute sessions. Interaction data was gathered by two observers who recorded each time a member spoke and to whom he/she spoke. Group meetings were tape recorded and a sample of 70,000 words was analyzed by the General Inquirer, a computer aided content analysis system. The results indicate connections between societal sex role requirements and small group behavior. The who-to-whom scoring and content analysis similarly reflect the themes of intimacy and interpersonal relations for women, and themes of competition and status for men. The findings also indicate that men and women  express different parts of themselves in the content and structure of their groups when interacting with members of the same and the opposite sex.The interaction styles found in this study are then used as a framework from which to understand what does occur in other settings, specifically the classroom, and the committee or work group. Questions are raised about the limitations these styles impose on individual and group potential, and how we might begin to change them. (Author)",

Subjects were 20 first-line supervisors in a midwestern manufacturing company. They were interviewed and tested for self concept, organizational concept, organizational participation, and work performance, using an ex post facto field study methodology. The subjects were then classified into three groups according to conceptual states: (1) positive, (2) neutral/positive, and (3) negative. Means, standard deviations, and correlations of variables were computed. A one-way analysis of variance tested for discriminate analysis of significance between groups, and tests were used for discriminate analysis of  variables between groups. The results showed a partial relationship between self concept and organizational concept and a statistically significant relationship between organizational participation, work performance, and the conceptual states.

Each wrote one essay per week, which was then rated for creativity on four scales (fluency, flexibility, elaboration, originality) by six judges. Subjects were divided into three groups, each receiving a different kind of reinforcement: (1) Group 1 subjects received points according to each subject's performance on each essay; (2) Group 2 received points as a group according to group's cumulative performance on each essay; (3) Group 3 subjects each received a fixed number of points regardless of scores on essays. Results were analyzed by  a one-way analysis of covariance and the Scheffe' S multiple comparison technique. Examination of the results showed that: (1) both contingent reinforcement groups were significantly superior in terms of all four mesures of creative ability to the non-contingent group; and (2) there was a significant difference between the group-shared reinforcement section and the individual reinforcement section, with the group sharing section being superior. Both contingent reinforcement groups showed dramatic increases in all four measures of creative responding over baseline (five weeks baseline, 11 weeks treatment). (Author/MPB)",

In this study attribution theory was used to determine the effect of role in a counseling interview on ratings of causal attributions for counselor and client behaviors. Counselor trainees (n=42) were randomly assigned to the roles of counselor, client, or observer for 15-minute counseling interviews. Following the counseling the trainees rated counselor and client behaviors and the causes of the behaviors. Counselors rated their own behaviors and the client behaviors as the most situationally caused. Clients rated their own behaviors and counselor behaviors as the least situationally caused. Dispositional ratings were not used to differentiate the causes of  behaviors. The relevance of attribution theory in understanding counselor and client behavior was discussed. (Author)",

Predictions regarding problem solving made from the crystallized-fluid intelligence theory of Horn and Cattell were supported only in the elderly group of subjects. Between factor relationships supported a reintegration of abilities in old age, contrary to crystallized-fluid theory predictions made on the basis of previous research.

Using an exchange theory orientation, it was hypothesized that role perceptions and related behavior patterns are related to the rewards and costs a woman expects to result from the performance of masculine and feminine behaviors. The women first completed a series of sex role scales and then participated in group discussion sessions with male confederates. The results support a social reinforcement orientation to sex role perceptions and behavior, and suggest that in order to change women's role perceptions and actual behavior, a change in the outcomes available for alternative behavior patterns is essential.

The Black children in both sets of families were rated, and a score given to each based upon his/her responses to a questionnaire, self-rating drawings, and observation. The data obtained indicated that no significant differences existed between the Black children adopted into White families and the Black children adopted into Black families in the areas of self esteem and psychopathology.

They saw blackness and Black skin color more negatively than did Black children raised in Black families. (Author/MML)",

The subject was either the only one to witness the emergency, or witnessed it with an additional participant (diffusion of responsibility), and the subject's presence was either known or unknown to the other participants (evaluation apprehension). Both manipulations affected the bystanders' response latencies: participants whose presence was known responded more quickly than those whose presence was unknown, and lone bystanders responded more quickly than those witnessing the theft with another participant. Further, bystanders whose presence was unknown and who witnessed the emergency with  another participant were significantly slower to respond than subjects in the other three experimental conditions. Since 1/3 of the bystanders' reactions did not lead to immediate helping attempts, latencies for effective helping were also analyzed. There were no independent effects of the two experimental manipulations on helping latencies. Only the statistical interaction was reproduced-- i.e., unknown bystanders who witnessed the theft with another participant were also slower to help than those in the other three conditions. The implications of these findings for the understanding of bystanders' decision process during an emergency are discussed. (Author)",

Through information gained from bimonthly meetings and frequent monitoring by workshop leaders and graduate students enrolled in the Special Education Area of the University of Vermont, parents have developed and implemented home-based programs for effecting desirable changes in their children's social academic, and self-care behaviors. Following an introduction to reinforcement principles, parents were assisted in defining behaviors, developing simple measurement procedures, recording and graphing data, and applying appropriate consequences to achieve the desired target behaviors. Home management behaviors dealt with have included school tardiness, household  chores, fights with siblings, bed-wetting, mealtime problems, reading improvement, thumbsucking and autistic-like behaviors. The four parent workshops implemented since 1971 have successfully demonstrated that participating parents can apply behavior analysis techniques to change behaviors of most children. (Author)",

A form of the Incomplete Sentence Blank Test (ISB) is presented as an instrument to reach beyond the unidimensional restrictions of standard measures, which tend to ask respondents about abstract, hypothetical implications and deficiencies of the ISB for mental health research are explored. The findings suggest that families do carry a heavy burden. Although the majority of respondents do not express feelings of shame or strong wishes for social distance from the former patient, feelings of being trapped, antagonistic, and burdened by his presence are prominent. These reactions are most pronounced in those families attempting to cope with a kin perceived as  still severely handicapped and those who have been hospitalized three or more times. (Author)",

        "description":"Forty first graders and 40 fifth graders were asked to allocate a limited number of rewards to two children working on identical tasks. Four experimental conditions were established by varying the workers' relative productivity and effort on the task. Fifth graders were generally found to utilize the norm of equity more than first graders in allocating the rewards. Significantly more fifth than first graders reported perceiving a difference in the workers' effort on the task. The first graders' allocations were generally uninfluenced by the manipulation of this performance dimension. In addition no effect of effort was found for the fifth graders under the condition of equal worker productivity. Under the condition of unequal productivity the fifth grade boys divided the rewards  proportionally regardless of the workers' relative effort; their female counterparts allocated in a similar manner only when the more productive worker had also demonstrated greater effort on the task. The manner in which the developing child makes decisions regarding what is a fair and deserved amount of resources for others to receive, and factors influencing these decisions, appears an important area for continued study.

        "description":"This research derives from the proposition that a helping relationship influences the helper's perceptions of the recipient, and that the perceptual consequences are not necessarily positive. It was hypothesized that persons who help tend to underestimate the ability of the recipient. In a 2 X 2 factorial design, subjects (48 college males) performed comparable actions which either could or could not help another person (a confederate) who either succeeded or failed at a task. Subjects who helped perceived the recipient as less competent for related tasks and as less competent in other situations. Within the help condition, subjects who attributed a greater influence to their help perceived the recipient as lower in ability. The results, together with several other  considerations, suggest that a helping relationship creates a bias toward helper perceptions of low recipient ability. (Author)",

A questionnaire, designed by the authors, was administered to students of a human sexuality course and a social psychology course at the beginning and end of the spring semester, 1975. On six of the seven attitudinal categories measured, students from the sexuality class evidenced significantly greater attitude change than those from the social psychology class in the direction of greater acceptance of sexuality and sexual egalitarianism. A male-female comparison regarding attitude change revealed no significant differences. The only behavioral change found in either class was a significant increase in masturbation among females in the sexuality course.

Two control groups, consisting of males and females taking oral contraceptives, were included. Equivalent tests were given at tw sessions two weeks apart. Analysis of the Space Relations Test as a function of menstrual phase and Repression-Sensitization indicated the predicted interaction effect of phase by RS with poorest performance for the menstruating repressor group (p.02), but the predicted deterioration by the premenstrual repressor group was not observed. Similar analysis  for the Verbal Reasoning Test yielded an interaction effect of phase by RS (P.03) and a main effect for phase (p.05). As predicted, differences on the Digit Symbol test did not reach significance. Substituting PM symptomatology for RS, a significant effect was obtained only for phase on the Verbal Reasoning Test (p.05). Results were interpreted as indicating a reactive nature of repression, so that during menstruation, repression may interfere particularly with performance on complex tasks. The three subject groups did not differ significantly on any of the three tests; however, trends in the present data corroborated those quoted in the literature. (Author)",

Eight experimental conditions were arranged in the day-care setting in which two variables were manipulated: apparatus and differential reinforcement. The effects of positive reinforcement upon cooperative behavior appeared to be greater without apparatus than with it. In the second  study, over a two month period, a point system was used to rate pupils' cooperativeness: however, this was rejected as unnecessary since the initial extrinsic motivation of a field trip evolved to an intrinsic motivation in cooperating for the sake of cooperating.

Furthermore, peer advisors are able to provide valuable feedback to the staff about campus facilities, academic offerings, the impact of policy upon students and the effectiveness of the staff itself. Professional training and supervision are critical to the success of peer advisement programs. Student development staff and academic teaching faculty may, depending upon the specific functions of the peer advisors, jointly teach, administer and  monitor the program. Students from particular academic disciplines, special interest groups or ethnicities can be selected as peer advisors thereby expanding general student services. Administrative structure should be determined by individual institutions and supervision. Clearly, peer paraprofessional staff can provide a new and exciting dimension to student services but they do require the assistance and support of professional staff in order to be effective.

Study 3 rated blond, dark haired Anglos, redheaded, Negro, Chicano, and American Indian males. Rated as most beautiful to  least beautiful in order were blond, dark, Negro, Chicano, Indian and then redhead. Indian, Negro and Chicano males were not rated as successful as redheads who were rated as less successful than blonds and dark haired Anglo males. The findings indicate a stereotyping, at least with Anglos, of a strong, successful, intelligent, good-looking blond male. Redheaded males are seen as less attractive, less intelligent, masculine, and successful. The findings can be summed up by the title that the redheaded findings have begun to be called by the researchers; the 'Bozo Effect' after a favorite clown. (Author)",

One hundred and eighty Caucasians (90 boys and 90 girls) aged 8-10 participated in the study. The pattern of results indicate that enhancement of self at the expense of others is learned in competitive environments; enhancement of self and others is learned in cooperative environments; and enhancement of self with neither enhancement nor abuse of others is learned in a self-evaluative-individualistic learning environment. No sex differences were found. (Author)",

        "description":"The Treatment Evaluation Project was established to evaluate the feasibility of using behavioral treatment in conjunction with methadone maintenance to improve the effectiveness of methadone treatment. Over 100 outpatients were accepted into treatment and randomly assigned to one of four behavioral treatment modalities in addition to the usual methadone maintenance procedures. Sixty clients participated in treatment for six months or more. Treatment was provided by a paraprofessional counseling staff under the supervision of professionals. Client outcomes were evaluated and compared in terms of (1) urinalysis results for illicit drug use; (2) employment records, (3) arrest records, and (4) treatment retention and attendance. The assigned modality of behavioral  treatment/counseling was found to bear no relationship to these outcomes. Despite the lack of differentiation in the outcomes of the overall clinical evaluation, data from specific experiments conducted during the course of the project indicate that both contingency management procedures and the emotionally-based behavior therapy procedures may have utility in the treatment of drug abuse. It is suggested that what is needed is more rigorous and systematic basic research with specific procedures and precisely focused outcome measures in order to develop an empirical base for the behavioral treatment of narcotics dependence.

Subjects were shown sets of test scores for hypothetical students and were asked to rate the performance of each student or predict each student's performance on a comprehensive final exam. Subjects given the prediction task showed a recency effect--their predictions were weighted more heavily by the second half of the scores than by the first--and tended to discount a deviant score. Subjects given the rating task showed a recency effect only when explicitly told to take into account trends in scores. The prediction group that showed the most discounting of deviant scores was also the group that  had the highest rate of recall of deviant scores on tests of retention. Discounting thus appears to be an active process, rather than a lowered level of attention. (Author)",

The first system, the developmental action program, is designed to be utilized on a job allowing the employee considerable discretion in reaching the job's objectives, and perhaps some autonomy in establishing goals. The maintenance action program is a system of appraisal applicable to the average acceptable performer with low potential for promotion because of limited ability or motivation. Finally, the remedial action program is intended for administrative use with those clearly below standard, whose performance has consistently been unacceptable. Also discussed is the nature, amount, and frequency of feedback given to performers in the  different appraisal systems. The author concludes that variations in appraisal are necessary because of multiple performance problems, performance histories, and work situations. (MPJ)",

There has been a scarcity of literature on the use of the orientation period to sensitize students to the importance of career planning. The purpose of this paper is to describe a freshmen orientation slide tape show that was developed around four themes: (1) the value of career planning for students, (2) the difficulties of career planning with an unstable economy and rapid technological change, (3) the campus and Counseling Center resources available to students, and (4) the University's commitment to the career planning of students. The method of presentation, production procedures, and verbatim description  of the slide show context are included. Outcomes and implications for the college and high school counselor are discussed.

The following variables were controlled in a six-way analysis of variance: sex of counselor, sex of student, occupational status, occupational stereotype, ability of student, and interest of student. No overt sex stereotyping was found. There were significant differences between the female and male counselors, female and male occupational stereotypes, high and low status occupations, high and low interests. Fifteen of the 57 interactions were significant. Scheffe post hoc comparisons were computed, and it was determined that counselors viewed the interest level of the student as the most important  variable in rating the appropriateness of the occupational choice.

Conditions under which reconstructive errors in recall should occur are specified. Most conventional experiments do not satisfy the conditions. In an experiment involving 360 college students, subjects were induced not to differentiate information in discourse from prior knowledge, and subsequently presented information contradicted expectations formed earlier. Predicted recall errors from a previously generated set tended to be manifested. This tendency increased with delay prior to recall. Such recall errors were almost totally absent when schematic states at recall did not contradict earlier states and when conventional memory instructions were  employed. The results were interpreted as supporting the reconstructive theory presented. A preliminary sketch of a model of inferential reconstruction is also presented. (Author/AA)",

In both experiments the major variable was the provision of appropriate frameworks for comprehending ambiguous sections of the passages. In the initial experiment, recognition of theme-congruent and theme-incongruent foils was the main measurement, while, in the second experiment, intrusions in recall and postrecall interviews were used to measure the influence of preexisting expectations on story comprehension and recall. The main effect was the striking absence of developmental trends: children behaved like adults in both the recall and recognition studies. Recall of ambiguous passages was enhanced if a relevant framework was given,  intrusions reflected the prior orientation, and the subjects had difficulty distinguishing between their own embellishments and the actual story content. Under recognition conditions, children treated theme-congruent foils as if they were target items and incongruent foils as if they were distractors. It is argued that, for children as well as for adults, schemata provide the interpretive framework for comprehending discourse. (Author)",

Enough information exists, however, to sketch an integrated, molar model of the reading process, which stresses the interrelationships between conscious and subconscious channels of thought. Efficient reading is an interaction between long-term and short-term memory and the affective domain. Cognitive competencies (analyzing, synthesizing, inferring, evaluating, etc.), although not innate, originate in a subconscious channel: the goal of the reading teacher should be to teach both graphemic and cognitive skills, to the extent that they become unpremeditated responses.

Suggestions are given for developing language arts activities to use in the language experience approach. They include developing activities and discussions which  relate to touch, taste, sound, sight, and smell; using community resource people as stimuli for language experiences; integrating language experience with content areas; using media to build a background of experience; writing autobiographies or biographies; and using opportunities for practical writing.

First-year community college students were presented with sentences arranged in pairs, each representing two of four prescribed types. Subjects were to select the harder sentence of each pair. Sentence complexity in this study was measured through student judgment. Variables included reading ability, types of sentences, and student judgment. It was concluded that, although subject judgments on individual items may vary within sentence categories, when these were totaled, certain trends emerged: in two of the four types of sentence comparisons, a significant difference in difficulty was reported; for  three out of the four hypotheses, good and poor readers did not differ significantly. However, further analysis indicated some tendency on the part of good readers to judge sentences in the direction opposite from that predicted. (HOD)",

Many different book-report contests are held each year in Japan, and some contests are conducted on a scale large enough to receive entries from about two million children. A survey conducted of representative teachers from all over Japan indicated that the most prevalent type of report is a simple record of impressions and thoughts that occur upon reading a book. In order to initiate critical reading, it is suggested that the teacher emphasize three points in guiding the student: (1) evaluation encouraging independent thinking that develops sequentially  through simple reaction, comprehension, self-judgment, revision of attitidues, and self-improvement; (2) evaluation which covers the overall scope of reading activities; and (3) assessment of self-expression. Two charts have been prepared for use in evaluating book reports. Chart 1 indicates evaluation standards for reading guidance and chart 2 indicates evaluation standards for composition guidance.

An analysis of selected instructional sequences of the New Primary Grades Reading System, a reading acquisition curriculum for five and six year olds, was performed by applying appropriate category systems from several theoretical models. The purpose of the study was to examine the conditions of learning which had been built into the instructional sequences that present new content. The results demonstrate and make more explicit one designer's mode of introducing behavioral learning principles into sequences of a structured curriculum. The analysis makes evident four main principles of instruction: (1) making explicit use of knowledge about the  capabilities of the learner for whom the materials have been designed; (2) structuring language units so that they can be readily grasped by the learner; (3) identifying a progression of effective sequence types; and (4) specifying the contingencies of reinforcement. Taken together, the strategies of instruction implicit in the design of the curriculum constitute a theory of instruction in reading acquisition. (Author/AA)",

One way parents can assist in reading improvement is by surrounding their children with language from their earliest years. Nancy Larrick, in her \"Parent's Guide to Children's Reading,\" suggests that parents read to the young child, even before the child has reached his or her first birthday. Larrick also states that parents can help to foster an interest in print by answering children's questions about letters and signs. And finally, parents can help by making books available to children either through purchase or by borrowing them from a library. There are at least three major ways in which the community can help foster and maintain reading  skills--by supporting the public schools; by sponsoring book fairs or setting up book banks or exchanges; and by reading with children either in groups or through voluntary tutoring in the schools. If children see parental and community efforts to support reading activities, they will likewise place value on reading. (LL)",

First, findings about the long-term effects of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation may be considered a challenge to popular technologies of instruction. Authors of highly structured systems, for example, tend to rely upon reinforcement to strengthen a child's newly acquired conceptual responses rather than to attend to competing spontaneous responses. The second area of research deals with the relative effectiveness of different word recognition strategies. The value of semantic and syntactic word recognition strategies and the kinds of exercises by which learners acquire them are reviewed. The third set of studies from which implications can be drawn deals with the comprehension of text  material. There is a potential need, for example, for exercises which help learners create images during the reading process. (Author/AA)",

Using 90 second-grade subjects, the research design had two parts: the exploration of the relationships among language development, reading ability, intelligence, socioeconomic status, and sex; and the  correlation of oral reading behavior with language development when the influence of word recognition ability and intelligence is controlled. Results suggested that oral syntactic proficiency as measured by Chomsky's Linguistic Instrument does not relate to contextual appropriateness of oral-reading errors but, rather, to correction behavior.

Two pretraining tasks were used to help the child learn the rules  of a \"yes/no\" game. For the study proper, the child was instructed to listen to an audiotape and to respond \"yes\" if he or she heard one word and \"no\" if he or she did not hear one word. The data was analyzed, and it was found that the average child's metalinguistic awareness of a spoken word improves with age and that there is a significant relationship between children's metalinguistic awareness of spoken words and their reading achievement.

        "description":"Findings from a number of studies of the reading interests and habits of British secondary school students are reviewed, and the results of a new survey of the opinions of 55 teachers are briefly reported. The studies indicate that a number of &quot;classic&quot; texts are popular but that &quot;subliterature&quot; is also popular and becomes more so as students grow older. Narrative fiction, particularly humorous or mystery writing, is popular; poetry, though not unpopular with younger secondary school students, is disliked by the better examination students. Out-of-class reading declines after age 12. There is a tendency toward &quot;realism&quot; and &quot;relevance&quot; in literature chosen for classroom use, which some educators feel might be limiting. (Author/AA)",

Reading-readiness skills (comprehension and auditory and visual discrimination) and primary and intermediate skills (syntax, context in word attack, comprehension, critical reading, and practice with language) can be developed by having children read literature rather than readers. In a pilot reading program in a Salt Lake City grade school, children's literature was used as reading material for 18 fourth-grade children who were reading one or two years below grade level. After 25 school days, during which the children spent twice the usual amount of time in reading and reading-related activities, test results showed gains of  one to three years. In addition, children showed more determination and confidence in other studies, read more at home, and, for the first time, indicated a preference for reading as an activity. (JM)",

The six learning-disabled students who participated in the study underwent each treatment on three separate occasions. Only the meanings-practiced condition consistently and significantly increased acquisition  and retention of word meanings. Although the treatments were differentially effective in improving word knowledge, they surprisingly did not differentially influence students' ability to recall story facts.

Results indicated that the texts differed widely in their relative emphases on reading comprehension and on particular reading comprehension subcategories. The two standardized tests were quite similar in relative emphasis on reading comPrehension, but their emphases were quite different from those of the texts. Only a small percentage of the skills emphasized in the curricula had counterparts on  the standardized tests, and those tended to reflect factual items entailing locating information in presented materials, whereas two of the three curricula gave heavier emphasis to inferential comprehension skills.

Ability to read or think critically appears to be closely related to general mental ability and may be dependent on literal reading ability. Specific instruction in various types of critical reading skills of college-age students does affect performance on critical reading tests, leading to the conclusion that critical reading is a skill which can be taught. Further, it is an important trait in those who may lead our society in the future. Given all the above, the next logical step is to develop ways and materials to aid in the teaching of critical reading  skills. (Author/AA)",

Twenty-four tenth-grade subjects described their thoughts and behavior during silent reading. From the protocols, 13 types of reader responses were identified and organized into a taxonomy of word-, clause-, and story-level responses. Nine strategies were found. Readers identified two subproblems (failure to understand words and failure to understand clauses), two problem-solving strategies (use of context and use of re-reading), and five general comprehension strategies (synonym substitution, inferences, hypotheses, addition of information, and information from the story). Significant differences in use of strategies were found between  proficient and non-proficient readers, between readers with high and low interest in their story, and between the two writing styles. Implications for a theory of reading as problem-solving, for teaching strategies, and for a case study approach to reading research are discussed. (Author/AA)",

Research findings on the correlation of readiness test scores with primary reading achievement clearly indicate that early assessment should be a functional reality in every school district. Studies have shown the superiority of the battery over the single test for identification of high-risk learners.  Research findings on specific methods and strategies for use with high-risk pupils are inconclusive. It is suggested that at the end of first grade, pupils whose preferred modality is congruent with the primary instructional strategy of the initial reading program will achieve higher than pupils whose preferred modality is not congruent with the primary instructional strategy of the initial reading program.

Superintendents were asked to enhance the researchers' understanding of instructional changes in reading and the other language arts by detailing sources of information about educational practices and by explaining the degree of their familiarity with and implementation of educational practices. Data indicated that the information sources used by educational decision makers were, in order of their importance: journals, periodicals, and bulletins; school or district  inservice education; course work and textbooks; informal meetings; conference proceedings; and the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC). Findings indicate that many schools in remote parts of the nation are engaged in educational innovation. Location, therefore, does not play a large part in the research/practice relationship.

One cloze passage was administered to each of 218 students enrolled in General Psychology and Principles of Biology courses. Dale-Chall readability levels were separately calculated for the same passages. Reading levels of the selected textbooks ranged from fifth/sixth grade to college graduate level. Results of the cloze tests indicated that the majority of the passages selected could be read by students at the instructional level, although only 22% for one text and 42% for the other could be read at the independent reading level, which is usually required.

To test these hypotheses, minor visual alterations were inserted in words in connected text. Fifteen good and 15 poor readers at the fourth-grade level read two of the altered Passages orally. Results indicated that the good readers read at a faster rate and made fewer miscalls in overall word identification than did the poor readers. However, there were no differences in the ratio of textually acceptable miscalls, and poor readers' responses to altered words seemed less bound to graphic cues than did those of the good readers.

Sessions 3 to 10 involved group interaction across three interaction patterns: adult-dominated, peer-dominated, and adult-balanced. Results indicated that children produced more complex speech when allowed to interact with each other, free of the dominance of an adult; that no particular type of culture was better able to deal with the language experiences than any other; that the presence of an adult in an autocratic role influenced the production of standard English constructions over black English  vernacular; and that the black children were comfortable with standard English forms, although they tended to speak black English vernacular with white as well as with black children.

The experiment was designed to investigate the influence of simultaneous and successive discrimination learning with stimuli which varied in stimulus similarity. Words were controlled for meaningfulness to explore whether familiarity with a word will lessen the possible effect that confusable letters may have on the perception of a word. Four types of distractor errors appeared in the words used with matching procedures in order to gain information about the cues which children use to match words. Subjects for the study were 120 kindergartners, ranked according to reading readiness  test scores and labeled as low, middle, and high. Each subject was taught six meaningful and six nonmeaningful words in two separate sessions. The results indicated, among other things, that the choice of matching procedures influenced word matching scores without consideration of the letter confusability factor. Simultaneous procedures with nonmeaningful words were superior to successive for the low, middle, and high reading readiness groups. Simultaneous matching with meaningful words was better only for the low reading readiness group. (LL)",

Organization was varied to contrast hierarchical information structures and list information structures, and to test the effect of linking the structural components of the passage into a conceptual framework. Contextual variables which were investigated included length, content (abstract or concrete), amount of time for reading, reading achievement, sex, and previous knowledge about passage content. The four comprehension tasks were immediate free recall, recognition of a factual detail, recognition of the main idea, and recognition of an inference. A fractional design for 32 high school students was used to investigate the organizational  and contextual variables within a single experiment. The results suggested that different dimensions of organization and context may affect performance on the four tasks. (AA)",

Rather than formulating value judgments about a piece of literature, critics must use their experiences to illuminate important literary clues for the benefit of the reading public. But they must also remain free enough from expectations to be able to detect clues from a fresh viewpoint. Literary criticism free from preconceptions may be understood by imagining the way a visitor from Mars might view the story of Little Red Riding Hood, asking various questions about details in the story. In addition, \"Martian thinking\" can help to explain the use of coincidence in  fiction, such as in works of Charles Dickens, for whom coincidence was a way of life. (JM)",

A review of theory and research in the area of language development suggests, then that the ability to confine interpretation to information explicitly stated in texts and to derive logical conclusions from written materials is related largely to the development of  literacy.

The problems which have arisen because of tests which measure reading and composing ability without ever requiring the child to actually read or compose have been compounded by teachers' tendencies to turn children away from books by giving them exercises in workbooks, by putting them in reading groups according to arbitrary ability levels, and by constantly testing them. A new movement in research, which concentrates on the process of children's learning rather than on the end-products of testing, can hopefully provide solutions to these Problems. Advocates perceive the child not as an empty vessel waiting to be filled with knowledge, but as an active seeker and  formulator of meaning. Miscue analysis, categorization of children's spelling errors, and interpretation of children's responses to literature are all techniques which stem from this conceptual framework. Teachers who have always taken their lessons from textbooks need to become sensitive to the learning potential in other than traditional educational experiences. (KS)",

In a journal edited from a diary kept during a round-trip horseback journey from Boston to New York, Sarah Kemble Knight (1666-1727) wrote in the tradition of Puritan diarists, with a delightful sense of humor. The able literary critic, Margaret Fuller (1810-1850), composed distinctly original essays and literary reviews, while her contemporary, Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815-1902), formulated many of the feminist principles which Susan B. Anthony (a close friend) and other feminists made famous, edited the &quot;History of Woman  Suffrage,&quot; and explained her radical feminism in an autobiography. In a speech delivered at an 1851 women's rights convention, Sojourner Truth (1797-1883) eloquently pointed out the flaws in the logic of preceding male speakers and persuasively argued for equal rights and privileges for women. In reading these and other works of American women, women may come to think of themselves as members of a full and equal half of the human species. (JM)",

Under the direction of a steering committee, the project concentrated on two national conferences in Austin, Texas and Columbia, South Carolina, both in 1970. Bringing together those responsible for dissemination at the state level, the conferences provided opportunities for (1) presenting information  about the elements, operation and promising practices of dissemination, and (2) improving communication between and among state education departments and USOE. Each conference offered large group presentations by recognized dissemination authorities and small group discussions. Evaluation of the conferences indicated that objectives of the project were being met. (Author/KP)",

It begins by discussing the general controversy surrounding the use of satellites in education, by placing the concern within the larger context of the general debate over the uses of new technologies in education, and by challenging educators to harness the enormous power of satellite communications for both formal and non-formal educational goals and objectives. It proceeds to analyze the differences between narrow-band and broad-band technologies, and raises questions concerning the educational value for using broadcast television in the classroom, whether delivered via satellite or through terrestrial means. The development of &quot;Open Learning&quot; and  non-traditional study programs is cited and discussed, along with the explosive growth of Citizens' Band radio, as examples of ways inexpensive and narrow-band technology can serve changing educational needs and requirements. A variety of narrow-band applications are then offered: Telephony, radio, slow-scan television, data and hard-copy, telex and facsimile, cable radio. A systems view is presented, as are some cost considerations. The paper concludes with the strong recommendation that educators assume a lead role in de-mystifying satellite technology. (Author)",

Uses include the delivery of video material, teaching to scattered students, master teaching, teaching of teachers, providing information on current events, video teaching of behavior, information retrieval and computer-aided instruction. It then notes some technological constraints such as bandwidth, real-time needs, dispersion or concentration of network, and other aspects of network configuration that make satellite delivery of messages more or less advantageous than alternative methods. Since relative costs as well as benefits are a concern, consideration is given to the cost of a satellite education system. Costs are estimated in terms of an ultimate nationwide and universal educational satellite  system. The paper concludes that the first steps should be the use of satellites for data communication in locations where facilities are not readily available. (Author/WBC)",

This requires the innovative application of communications technology to make life in rural communities more attractive. In terms of continuing education, there are presently two means of distributing materials. One is audio tape with text, and the other is video--either through live pick-up or stored on tape. The development of video storage discs may make stored video more feasible. Community colleges would seem to be the institution best suited to offering courses in learning centers over wide geographical areas. As a pilot operation six community colleges have formed a consortium called ACCESS to work with Goldmark  Communications in developing the requirements for a delivery system, and to develop six courses to be made available to all educational institutions. In order to make the distribution of these courses nationwide, the Rapid Transmission and Storage (RTS) facility of ATS-6 might be used. (WBC)",

        "description":"To help achieve a more dispersed population distribution, it is the strategy of the New Rural Society (NRS) project to address the interdependent rural, urban, and energy problems by solving the rural development problem issue first. People live in large urban areas chiefly because the jobs and essential services are there. Advances in communications technology could make it possible to decentralize business and government employment to rural areas and still maintain direct ties with the urban marketplace via sophisticated, relatively low-cost communications links. This document is divided into six sections: The first presents the basic phenomena that gave rise to the NRS concept. The second section discusses these phenomena in greater detail. The third describes the NRS concept  and its approach to rural development. The fourth part deals with the potential impact of population decentralization on domestic energy production and consumption. The fifth presents the overall NRS objectives, and the sixth outlines the program that NRS proposes to undertake in the next few years. (Author/WBC)",

A review of computer uses in education is presented with an emphasis on interactive computer applied to instructional processes. An example of major use of the CBEU focuses on meeting the educational needs of handicapped children, first by inservice teacher education followed by direct instruction to handicapped children via CBEU. Less than 40 percent of the handicapped children who require special education programs in the United States are receiving an adequate education. A plan is presented to provide a flexible &quot;on-the-job&quot; CBEU with a curriculum enabling inservice elementary teachers to learn how to teach mildly handicapped children. The plan described in this  paper would make tested curriculum materials available to inservice teachers through Education Centers established by Regional Sponsoring Agencies. It would also create the opportunity to expand the curriculum for practicing teachers into other needed skill areas and eventually provide direct instructional service to handicapped children. A selected bibliography is also provided. (Author/WBC)",

        "description":"Early experiments with the ATS-1 and ATS-3 satellites utilized one way and two way audio for a variety of university purposes, and several different television modes were employed in the ATS-6 satellite. Among the higher education activities on ATS-6 were inservice teacher education and the facilitation of regionalized medical education. A college curriculum sharing experiment between Stanford and Carleton Universities is to be carried out on CTS. Previous efforts to implement computer aided instruction via satellite have run into technical or other difficulties, and future efforts in this area need to be planned carefully and supported adequately. There is a much firmer base of experience with audio and video. Higher education involvement in satellite activity thus far has been  focused primarily on inservice or continuing professional education, and on medical education. Areas which seem promising for the future include bringing \"open university\" or \"external degree\" services to remote areas, and the sharing of curricula, video programing, library and computer based programing and resources among geographically dispersed institutions. Organizational and economic, as well as technical, factors need careful consideration. Included with this paper is an annotated bibliography of selected documents. (Author/WBC)",

        "description":"The communication satellite already has developed a mature technology. It carries a substantial part of the world's long range communication, and is now useable for special cultural and educational purposes. Major cultural effects come from its contribution to increasing enormously the flow of information in the world. It will increase human dependence upon media and bring about shifts in power related to control of information. There will be more contact between cultures, changes in ways of perceiving reality, and significant new trends in socialization. The technology is now available to permit individuals and small organizations to participate actively in special uses of communication satellites which will happen only if we make them happen, among them: changing the  communication environment, combating remoteness, creating new networks for useful information, serving special groups and needs, substituting communication for transportation in certain situations, making the performing arts more widely available, and innovations in learning and teaching. Lessons learned from early uses of satellites warn of some difficulties, but space communication remains ready for challenging and important uses. This paper includes an annotated bibliography.

        "description":"It is suggested that a major weakness in individualized instruction has been the failure to provide for adequate Instructional Management Information Systems. This is a defect which can be remedied by linking such programs to more sophisticated and more readily accessible instructional data processing centers. An effective application of the satellite's communications versatility may be to provide the communication linkage between user schools and a large computer system centralized at the state or on a regional basis. Another approach to individualization on a course by course basis is Computer Managed Instruction (CMI) and is advocated as an operational model for wider use. Such use could be expanded by local schools having real time access to centralized instructional data  processing facilities. More precise information about instructional objectives, individual student progress and teaching resources characterize both individualized instruction and CMI. With such information available to the student, the teacher and the administrator, orderly and systematic use as a teaching resource, can be made of adult volunteer teaching aids and peer tutors. Research has shown that these can be inexpensive and powerful adjuncts to instruction when properly supported and used. A selected bibliography is included with this paper. (Author)",

The paper is developed as follows: There is first a brief description of the technique followed by a set of guidelines used to develop the program. Next are described experiments in which the TVI format is compared to both classroom instruction and \"real time\" television. The factors that appear to be most important for the success of the TVI technique are isolated, and an estimate of program  costs and the value of developing a satellite based TVI program is presented.

Data were collected from a random sample of former students by means of personal interviews, with 270 usable responses obtained. Results of the study indicated: (1) reading and math were areas in which ABE was able to help students achieve their goals; (2) ABE experiences helped students to speak English better, to write, read, and use mathematics better, and in some cases, helped students obtain the GED or to continue their education; (3) most respondents experienced no change in employment  status from time of ABE entry to time of follow-up; (4) some respondents felt that the ABE program had improved their relationships with their children and families; (5) a majority did not feel ABE helped improve their management of money; and (6) more than 20% reported increased self-confidence and communication ability. Because of the difficulty experienced in gathering data for this study (resistance to interviews, lack of current addresses), a model for ABE follow-up studies is described in detail.

Results showed CFCC's 39-hour requirement in general education to be more demanding than the general education requirements of the majority (78.5%) of community colleges and the majority (67%) of state universities. CFCC's nine-hour requirement in each of the areas of communications, humanities, and science was more demanding than the requirements of both community colleges and state universities.

A sample of program graduates, their employers, and instructors were asked to rate 75 competencies in terms of frequency, importance, performance ability, and future need relative to on-the-job requirements. A total of 152 graduates, 80 employers, and 15 instructors provided data for analysis. Results showed a high degree of agreement between graduates, instructors, and employers in regard to the importance, frequency, performance, and future need of the various competencies. Reading memory dumps, working with systems analysts,  preparing program documentation manuals, and writing computer operator instructions were suggested as areas needing more program emphasis. Data communications routines, work with users on problems, using company system standards, and structured programming techniques were felt to be increasing importance for the future. Respondents rated knowledge of programming and COBOL as the two most important skill areas for entry-level positions. Overall, it was concluded that the Data Processing program was basically well-structured and well-taught. The survey instruments and list of ranked competencies are appended. (JDS)",

It is noted that, in some cases, the texts suggested will need additional supplementary information. The electronics/electrical curriculum is designed with a common  core of courses for the first four quarters, with specialization occurring during subsequent quarters. Areas of specialization include electromechanical technology, electrical technology, instrumentation technology, and electronics technology. The electronics technology curriculum is designed so that a student may specialize in different areas within this curriculum, according to local needs.

Data for the study were obtained by surveying 228 faculty and 44 administrators, of whom 105 and 37 responded, respectively. Results of analysis indicated statistically significant differences in the responses of the two groups, with faculty indicating a slight tendency toward agreement with or support of collective bargaining and administrators indicating a very slight disagreement with the concept of collective bargaining. No decided preference, either for or against the concept of collective bargaining, was expressed by either group. The survey findings were compared to the empirical findings of other major  studies concerning collective bargaining. Areas examined were governance, quality of educational services, academic freedom, institutional climate, institutional autonomy, nature of administration, and economic benefits. Results of the comparison revealed that both College of DuPage groups held erroneous views in some of these areas. (JDS)",

The aim of this approach was to allow collection of information that would permit reporting of students' perceptions, whether such perceptions were &quot;really&quot; correct or not. It should be noted that the student perceptions described in this report are those of ordinary students, who were not outstanding in any way. Among the many perceptions of the college by students were: the physical plant and layout of the campus was both a source of aggravation and a pleasant  experience; the faculty/administrator/staff person was accorded a higher status than was the student; administrators were persons to be avoided and were generally viewed as threatening; the student was, to a certain degree, &quot;invisible&quot; to other non-students; and, students perceived the &quot;House Plan&quot; of the college as a method of organization that permitted decentralized, more personal sites for meetings, activities, record-keeping, and college counseling.

Results of analysis of this expenditure information revealed that the college had a direct estimated economic impact during 1973-74 of $14,024,596. Since expenditures by one party become disposable income for another party, a multiplier effect occurs.

Analysis of enrollment by degree programs showed that 39.3% of the students were enrolled in transfer programs leading to a baccalaureate degree, 51.6% were enrolled in programs leading to the Associate in Applied Science degree, and 9.1% had no degree objective.  Degrees attained by the 408 full-time faculty included 75% with master's degrees, 9% with doctorates, and 17% with bachelor's degrees or less.

Evaluation of the system was based on the number of students achieving mastery, error rate data,  and a student questionnaire. Of the 10 students in the course, 9 achieved mastery of 90% of the objectives, and student responses to the detailed course evaluation questionnaire were very positive. However, error rate data indicated necessity for revision of instruction for 5 of the 20 objectives for which an average of more than 2 attempts were required.

        "description":"Following a review of the literature related to employee morale and productivity, this paper reports a study undertaken to determine if there was a significant relationship between the morale of junior college instructors and their teaching effectiveness as perceived by students. Study subjects were 129 junior college instructors and their students enrolled in college transfer programs. A modified version of the Purdue Teacher Opinionaire was used to identify teacher morale variables. Teaching effectiveness as perceived by students was determined using the Hinds (Mississippi) Junior College Faculty Evaluation Scale. A statistically significant relationship was found for the measures of satisfaction with teaching, community support of education, and total job satisfaction with the  teaching effectiveness rating by students. It was concluded that instructors' perception of satisfaction with teaching was positively related to their teaching effectiveness, instructors' perception of community support of education had a negative relationship to teaching effectiveness, and total job satisfaction was positively related to teaching effectiveness. Other identified measures of teacher morale were not significant predictors of teaching effectiveness. These results may indicate that the most effective teachers are those with the greatest morale and job satisfaction. A bibliography is appended. (JDS)",

The center offered \"start anytime\" open-entry, open-exit courses in English and mathematics at all levels, from basic literacy and numeracy through grade 12 equivalency. During 1975-76, 189 adults studied at the center. Of this group: (1) 165 were between 17 and 44 years of age; (2) 14 were unemployed; (3) the majority engaged in studies for the purpose of self-improvement and enhancement of employment potential; (4) 39 received a grade 12 diploma; and (5) 60 obtained or returned to a job. Overall, the project was evaluated as successful since it provided adult basic education service to individuals suffering educational  handicaps. In terms of the advisement function of the project, it was estimated that the Centre responded to approximately 1,200 inquiries during the year, and that in-depth advisement was performed in approximately 360 cases. Appended are a flyer describing the purposes and offerings of the Centre, a background and brief chronology of Centre funding proposals and difficulties, and a statement of operating expenses for 1975-76.

        "description":"A study was conducted to compare the faculty personnel policies of the nine City Colleges of Chicago with those of 31 selected urban community colleges across the country having enrollments of not less than 5,000. Areas examined included faculty salaries, overload compensation, compensation for faculty who substitute for absent faculty, nature of the administrative structure, role of the departmental chairperson, released time for union officers, faculty workload, restrictions on use of part-time faculty, class size constraints, outside employment limitations, leaves of absence, and fringe benefits. It was found that the Chicago colleges were at the upper end of the scale with respect to economic issues, required a light (12 hours) teaching load, unduly restricted class size,  made minimal demands of their employees, overly subsidized union officers' activities, had major differences in contracts for each college although all colleges belonged to one bargaining unit, and paid higher salaries than did non-unionized institutions. Numerous recommendations were made to the City Colleges' governing board so that, in upcoming negotiations, the board could attempt to bring their institutions into line with national or regional norms relative to contractual faculty personnel policies. A review of trends in collective bargaining and analyses of survey data for each issue area are included in the report. (JDS)",

Subsequent sections of this publication discuss the advantages and disadvantages of MBO; implementation of MBO in the college/university setting; alternative MBO models; reasons why MBO may fail in the educational  setting; procedures for establishing institutional mission, goals, and objectives; and procedures for establishing individual objectives within the institution. Definitions, flow charts, and examples are included throughout.

        "description":"Since the late 1960's, German studies, like foreign language studies in general, have been on the decline. Part of the decline in foreign language enrollments can be attributed to higher education's declining rate of enrollment growth, part to elimination of language requirements for degree recipients, and part to shifting program emphases. A review of German offerings in comprehensive community colleges show that German is offered at a minimum level with only 49 institutions offering German programs leading to the Associate in Arts degree. Despite depressed enrollment statistics and trends toward vocational/scientific studies, neither liberal arts nor German study is on the way out. Such factors as requirement of German for scientific study, the large number of Americans of  German descent with pride and interest in their ancestry, and Germany's rising political and economic status all work together to create demand for German studies. However, German departments must also do their share to attract and retain students. New techniques, laboratory resources, and curricula need development and implementation. Relevance and interest can be enhanced through study of German culture. Community college emphasis in German studies should be on practical speaking, reading, and writing. A bibliography is attached.

The planning subsystem, central to this process, begins with a determination of the needs of the service community and the resources and constraints involved, then moves to a projection of this environment into the future. This phase is followed by the development of strategic alternatives and the actual decision-making process. Information is fed into the total system from the data and evaluation subsystems and data are generated for future use. When college goals are finalized, the planning subsystem demands that each department  (academic and administrative) project its output based upon the college mission. Measurable objectives for departments, programs and courses are formalized so that their relationship to overall goals is clear. This function also requires significant amounts of information and generates more data to be used in evaluating performance. Since evaluation utilizes the measurable goals/objectives set in the planning process, planning can be seen as a cycle of events. A short bibliography is appended. (Author/JDS)",

Areas in which students have conducted research for their projects have included urban planning, welfare reform, rural vs. urban poverty, and ethnic and racial mobility. Among the more outstanding results achieved by students have been  production of a film showing rural/urban contrasts, cooking of a representative \"welfare recipient's dinner\", and publication of a study of occupational mobility for Blacks in the city of Saginaw, Michigan. Additionally, local community histories have been produced, as have been slide presentations and oral history reports. While the intent of an urban history course has not been to supplant the more conventional U.

        "description":"This paper reports the results of a study conducted to (1) assess the need for career mobility within the nursing program at Delaware County Community College (Pennsylvania); (2) demonstrate the range of complexity in nursing situations which require diversified educational programs; and (3) propose a model to assess the skills and knowledge of licensed practical nurse applicants to associate degree nursing programs. Sources of data for the study included college nursing program records, Pennsylvania state licensing laws, competencies expected by the State Board of Nurse Examiners, job descriptions, and a questionnaire administered to practical and associate degree nursing students, supervisory nurses, nursing instructors, and members of the community. Results of the study  confirmed that there was a need for diversified education for nursing students, that there was a basic core of knowledge for all health practitioners, and that development of a core curriculum would enhance potential health worker mobility. Terminal behaviors for the associate degree nurse were developed based on the findings, and a learning module based on one of the behaviors was developed to demonstrate the usefulness of criterion referenced testing to assess the competency level of the licensed practical nurse applicant. Recommendations for implementing an articulated licensed practical nurse/associate degree nurse program are presented. Survey responses, the learning module, an extensive bibliography, and other study materials are appended. (JDS)",

        "description":"Bakersfield College conducted a study to determine what type of academic year calendar would be most appropriate for that institution. The alternative calendars considered were an August to May calendar (early-start) and a September to June calendar (traditional). Primary considerations were: (1) enabling students to receive quality education and appropriate support services, (2) maximizing enrollment opportunities for students, (3) impact on administrators, instructors, and staff members, and (4) minimizing costs of running the college. Input was obtained from students, faculty, local business associations (student employers), high school students and counselors, and from the California Employment Development Department. Resulting data revealed distinct differences of opinion  regarding the alternative calendars. Students favored the August to May calendar by a nine to one ratio, the business associations were split on the question, and college faculty/staff and high school counselors favored the September to June calendar. The final recommendation was that the college should adopt the September to June calendar. Survey data and arguments on both sides of the issue are included. (JDS)",

Objectives were to create a system accessible to all professionals on all campuses, to provide a simplified system for funding of educational development activities, and to make provision for a uniform system of management for all grants whether funded externally or internally. District-level personnel, without benefit of individual campus or faculty input, established priorities for a grants system which included centralized control, uniformity of program management, establishment of a proper accounting system, better fiscal control,  and articulation of campus components of the system. A grant proposal submission subsystem was established following these criteria. An evaluation of the subsystem was conducted to determine administrative and user response to its provisions through a survey of selected users and support services personnel. Of 95 faculty-administrators and support services personnel surveyed, only 28% responded. Results showed that users were not confident about the system. User input in system revision was recommended.

        "description":"Beginning with the spring 1974 semester, all incoming students at Borough of Manhattan Community College (New York) were tested using the Reading subtest of the Stanford Test of Academic Skills, Level II. Students achieving scores lower than the fifth stanine on beginning grade 12 norms were required to take a remedial reading course. The objective of the remedial reading program was to develop minimal 12th grade reading skills in students requiring remediation. Post-test scores on the Stanford Test were compared to placement scores and midterm scores for 30 classes of remedial reading students in fall 1974 (n=760) and fall 1975 (n=623). Results indicated mean gains of approximately four grade levels for one semester of instruction. However, only 55% of the remedial students  successfully passed the course by meeting the 12th grade criterion. Data indicated that students with higher initial levels of reading ability had a greater chance of successfully completing the course than students with lower initial levels of reading ability. In addition, the percentage of students passing the course was found to have declined between spring 1973 and fall l975 from 68% to 55%. While the program was concluded to be at least 50% successful, further study of reading level and scholastic achievement was recommended. (JDS)",

The college adopted a school calendar for 1976-77 which provided for two sixteen week semesters and a three week intersession between the fall and spring semesters. During the intersession the college offered 63 intensive courses enrolling 800 students, and involved the total staff in instructional and non-instructional program development activities. Evaluation of the intersession through a questionnaire survey of 50% of the students and the entire faculty and instructional support staff revealed: the overwhelming majority of students were enthusiastic about  intersession courses; the majority of faculty reported they had achieved their personal intersession objectives and felt the experience had justified the effort required; counseling personnel found no disadvantages to be associated with the intersession concept; learning center personnel found the intersession to be a great success. Each of the evaluating groups noted several disadvantages of the intersession concept, most resulting from the time limit during which activities were conducted. The majority favored continued experimentation with a flexible calendar. (JDS)",

Following an overview of recommendations and summaries of the reports of subcommittees in the three areas, the bulk of the document consists of a detailed explication of the recommended funding model and the report of the subcommittee on state-local relations, presented in appendices. The funding model is based on a 50/50 division of responsibility between the state and local districts, including that for leisure-time courses, and is a criterion-based model intended to equalize  local tax bases and economies of scale. The model is presented in two sections: &quot;The Determination of Gross General Fund Investment Needs&quot; and &quot;A Method for the Allocation of State Funds Based on the Determination Needs Model.&quot; Measurement criteria, methodology, formulae, and sample applications of the model are provided. The state and local relations committee report presents an historical perspective, a discussion of areas of concern identified through a survey of community college presidents, an analysis of involvement patterns in the state policy decision-making process, outlines the state/local division of governance responsibility, weighs the advantages and disadvantages of centralized versus autonomous systems of governance, and concludes that the state should remain sensitive to  the need for institutional autonomy and that a more democratic, less bureaucratic system of statewide governance is needed. The survey instrument and definitions of terms are included. (BB)",

After initial orientation and background reading, project participants spent six weeks of intensive study and travel in Mexico, focused on development of individual curriculum projects. The project resulted in nine teaching modules dealing with Mexican history and culture and four teaching modules dealing specifically with Chicano Studies, two of which are addressed to the  important issue of helping Chicano students adapt to a college environment. Logistics, rationale, summative and formative evaluations of the project are presented in this report. Appended are a statement on coordination and dissemination of the results of Project Mexico by Carol Starcevic of the UCLA Latin American Center, and a theoretical model for curriculum development based on an interdisciplinary approach to Latin American studies by Allyn Sinderbrand.

        "description":"The major thesis of this paper is that the stimulation of children's intellectual development may require greater intensity in the relationships between adults and children in preschool programs than is typically the case. The author separates two variables in adult-child relationships: warmth and intensity. Warmth is generally defined as positive, accepting, nurturing and giving friendly responses to children. Intensity is used to refer to the child's feeling that what he does or is really matters to the adults. The two variables are used in combination to yield a typology of preschool programs showing where each of four preschool program models falls. It is proposed that the optimum preschool environment is one in which the relationships between adults and children are  characterized by high warmth and high intensity. Various factors impinging on teachers may make the optimum environment difficult to achieve. One of these factors is the adults' need to maintain an optimum emotional distance between themselves and the children. The risks of minimum distance are discussed as well as the difficult conditions under which preschool teachers and caregivers work, and the effects of these conditions on their ability to maintain optimum distance. Some recommendations for improving working conditions are outlined. (Author/BF)",

Home Start, a federally-funded 3-year (1972-1975) home-based demonstration program for low-income families with 3- to 5-year-old children was designed to enhance a mother's skills in dealing with her own children and to provide comprehensive social-emotional, health and nutritional services. Cost findings are presented in detail in Chapter II. Both OCD dollars spent on Home Start as well as &quot;in-kind&quot; levered resources from other government agencies and  private sources are presented so that a full comparison between projects can be made in terms of total monetized resources delivered to project families. Chapter III sets forth an analysis of intra-project efficiency in terms of technical efficiency (the home visit content and length) and cost efficiency. The chapter ends with a presentation of hypothetical model budgets for different project sizes located in different parts of the country designed to assist OCD in making future decisions about funding home based options. Chapter IV contrasts Home Start costs with Head Start costs at four sites. (Author/MS)",

        "description":"The efficacy of small group instructional activities dealing with transitive inference, conservation, and class inclusion of length was investigated in a sample of kindergarten (N=44) and first grade (N=45) children (mean ages of 5 years, 7 months and 6 years, 7 months respectively). The two instructional sessions (10 to 15 minutes each) employed a game-like atmosphere, peer-groups/teacher interaction, and positive feedback within a small group context. Assessment of instructional effects included pretesting, immediate posttesting, and delayed posttesting (three months subsequent to training) on the above concept domains in addition to a quasi-standardized series of tasks based upon the concrete operations period &quot;groupements.&quot; Preliminary analyses indicated a lack of order of  presentation effects, sex differences, tester and teacher biases, and pretest distinctions among the experimental conditions (six treatment conditions, three control conditions). The normative order of item difficulty and the associated differential instructional susceptibility indicated that concepts of transitive inference precede conservation which are in turn mastered prior to class inclusion understanding. Apparent task ceiling effects precluded transitivity instructional effects. Significant specific instructional effects were shown only for the conservation training conditions. Intraconcept transfer to the counterpart weight concept cases was not shown. In relative contrast, some evidence for interconcept generalization was demonstrated for the conservation and transitivity concept  domains and to the logical &quot;groupement&quot; performances. Little evidence was found for significant treatment/grade-level interactions. Implications of the present findings for the status of cognitive stages of development are discussed. (MS)",

        "description":"This paper reviews theoretical writings on the importance and function of imaginative play in the development of young children, and describes measurement instruments and instructional aids used for imaginative play in home and school settings. A historical summary of the function of play in the young child's life is presented. Early theories saw play as a way of dispelling physical or emotional energy, or as a socializing agent that prepared children for their adult roles. Recent research has stressed the importance of play as a process of mental representation and social collaboration, giving play an important role in learning and language development. The role playing element of imaginative play is described as a key to intellectual growth. A review of the literature includes  discussion of the work of Curry and Arnaud, Singer, Neumann, Yawkey and Blohm. Particular reference is made to the Singer Interview for Imaginative Play and the Language and Imaginative Play Experience Approach (LIPEA). Imaginative play is analyzed from four viewpoints; (1) educational, (2) cause and effect; (3) child developmental, and (4) creative communicational models. The roles of objects, actions, and situations in setting the scope and content of make believe play are discussed as an aspect shared by all viewpoints. (SB)",

Because these children are migratory, they have special social and physical needs. Therefore, programs developed for them cannot focus solely on academic needs and classroom activities. Comprehensive programs must consider and, if possible, include the family and the community in order to meet the children's needs as completely as possible. This monograph discusses the development of special programs for these Spanish speaking migrant children. Topics covered are: definition of bilingual education and English as a Second Language (ESL), judicial and legislative support, pre-program assessment, grade and age  level, children's length of stay, integration with or segregation from the regular school program, selection of program models (i.e., intensive ESL, pull-out ESL, transitional model, maintenance bilingual model, and supplementary model), establishment of instructional program goals based on the model, program staff, parent and community involvement, support services, instructional materials, student and program evaluation, and dissemination. Colleges and universities which offer bilingual education training, and bilingual education centers are listed in the appendices (NQ)",

This paper reviews and synthesizes research dealing with the educational abilities and ambitions of these youth. Specific objectives are to: provide a general framework against which youths' interests, abilities, aspirations and expectations are scientifically assessed within the context of educational settings; synthesize the  major existing literature relating to these characteristics of Black youth in the rural South for the use of educators and other concerned individuals; and stimulate a concern for and interest in research of Black youth in the South, suggest patterns of studying them, and suggest areas in which further research is needed. The report consists of two relatively independent sections of research synthesis reflecting &quot;educational abilities and interests&quot; and &quot;occupational and educational status aspirations and expectations&quot;.

They differed in: agricultural resources and history, the extent of nonagricultural employment growth since WW II, and the proportion of the population which was Negro. Data were collected from 236 persons. Complexity was measured by the extent or volume of the individual's participation in programs and organizations. Measures of coordination were the degree of generalization, represented by the number of institutional interest areas in which a leader  participated and the number and proportion of leaders involved in the major voluntary coordinating organization, and the awareness and opinions that the leaders had of each other. Measures of openness dealt with the characteristics and mobility of leaders. The leadership groups were compared by age, schooling, occupation, and race. Some findings were: in each community and in each type of participation, there was a high correlation between coordination and complexity of participation; and openness did not show as much difference between the communities.

From the beginning, the program set up career development training which would enable participating schools to increase the available certified personnel from the population served. Educational approaches which can be effectively taught by paraprofessionals are used. For the first time, Indian personnel are in the majority and the educational achievement of  reservation children has been &quot;dramatically&quot; improved. This report discusses: how Follow Through is improving the education of reservation children, what would happen if the program is discontinued, the involvement of parents on advisory committees and school boards, the ways the program has come to reflect the uniqueness of each Indian nation, and parent attitudes about the program on Indian reservations.

The nature and effects of local migration which occurred in a predominantly rural area during the period in which the development of urban settlements at the lowest urban hierarchy level was taking place, but in which there was no policy intended specifically to influence the settlement pattern, were examined. The communes differed topographically and in the number and size of agglomerated settlements. Data were obtained from: each commune's population register, migration notifications during the period 1962 to mid-1965, and published and  unpublished census data. Population registers consisted of a card index containing address changes and new addresses of the members of each household. Skjervoy was used as a trial growth centre. Findings included: between 40% and 50% of the migrants were between 15 and 24 years of age; migrants to growing villages were more evenly distributed over the age range than migrants to other places; single people were less prone to move locally than families; and an important element in the growth of villages and small towns in rural areas was immigration from other areas.

Objectives were to examine income differences between and within the three groups, and to pinpoint some of the socioeconomic characteristics that are important in predicting incomes of various groups. Data were obtained from 986 questionnaires of which 559 were from Puerto Ricans, 227 from whites, and 200 from blacks. Among the factors analyzed were: age, sex, salary, education, years worked for employer, weeks worked in agriculture, whether unemployment insurance was received, relation to present employer, years worked for wages, and families visited regularly. Findings included: the actual number  of weeks worked was the major variable in all total income equations; there was a statistical difference in the salaries between white farm laborers and those of blacks and Puerto Ricans; whites made larger yearly salaries in agricultural jobs while blacks and Puerto Ricans made larger yearly salaries in nonagricultural jobs; and age, years worked for present employer, and whether or not unemployment insurance was ever received were the next most important variables in explaining both agricultural and nonagricultural income.

Some of the functions of such a central network would be to (1) establish a clearinghouse and information center on programs, materials, personnel, events and other activities that are directly supported by migrant funds or are supportive of migrant efforts; (2) organize appropriate task forces or committees that would deal with relevant components of migrant education so that the profession would have an official voice at national, state and local meetings; (3) provide assistance to all major national, regional and state meetings to assure that the proceedings of these meetings are properly recorded and disseminated  to the appropriate people; and (4) establish a professional association for migrant educators to voice their concerns, lobby for changes, and improve the quality of the profession and services to the children. The establishment of such a central network would contribute to the creation of a desperately needed organized line of communication for migrant educators. It would also eliminate a lot of duplication of services throughout the profession. This paper presents a detailed explanation of each of the functions of this proposed central network. Migrant Directors in each state are listed. (Author/NQ)",

Orienteering can be a family affair or an individual fight against the clock. In its simplest form, orienteering can be described as a cross-country run, jog, or walk on a predetermined course, using a map and a compass to find several control points on the way. Orienteering realizes an ideal balance between the intellectual and the physical. It requires an integration of physical skills and conditioning with intellectual expertise. Since there are many ways to analyze and navigate land surfaces, orienteering incorporates a highly individualized combination of one's own abilities and judgment. This paper (1) defines &quot;orienteering&quot; for the educator; (2) acquaints the educator, whether  school administrator or teacher, with basic orienteering skills; (3) presents a rationale for the inclusion of orienteering in those areas of the school curriculum wherein it can be utilized advantageously; and (4) acquaints the educator with the factors that must be considered in establishing an orienteering program.

The project is different things to different people. To some, it is an FM radio station, operated mostly by high school students, over which they hear their favorite music, local school and civic news, and other items of interest. To others, the project is a monthly newsletter containing school and community news, humorous short stories prepared by local authors, and, perhaps too frequently,  local gossip. The project also is a career education program, a community center, a basic learning center, a recreational program, and numerous other activities. This paper briefly summarizes the project's evaluation, using data obtained from 65 questionnaires, 39 personal interviews, and 78 brief questionnaires designed to provide information about the FM radio station.

While emphasis on rural youth and mode of presentation vary considerably, these papers constitute state of the art reviews relative to the country under discussion and address three major areas of concern: (1) the problem of preserving traditional rural values uhile simultaneously incorporating the more modern orientations of a technological society; (2) growing recognition on the part of most countries of the interdependency  of social and economic development; and (3) the problem of preserving rurality and/or rural ethnicity while simultaneously meeting national goals. Differences between the orientations of developed and developing nations are presented in this collection, as is the general consensus that comprehensive, long term rural development policies and procedures are needed to deal with problems related to rural youth. Additionally, this bibliography presents subject and title/author indices, availability information, and a listing of current INRYR members by country, title, and address. (JC)",

Other studies have revealed that between 1950-73 over 50 million people (66% black) have migrated out of the 165 county primary impact area, projecting that employment in the TTW area will increase by over 1 million jobs (1973-2000) without TTW and by 126,200 additional jobs with TTW. As a result of a conference convened  in 1974 by the Federation, the Minority People's Council (MPC) on TTW was established. Forming a coalition with the construction craft unions, the MPC has engaged in: securing an affirmative action plan for minority employment in TTW construction; training programs to prepare minorities for employment; community education efforts to inform people of the TTW impact; involving educational institutions in the impact area; and conducting studies of available vocational program relevance to TTW employment opportunities.

Conclusions and suggestions re: future research objectives were made relative to the supply and demand for rural labor and the design/experience of rural employment and training programs. In general, the literature suggested: rural labor market problems were unique in origin, requiring population specific program responses; the role of poverty related economic development problems had been explored, but the causes of varying rates of economic development in  rural areas had not been clearly documented nor had the effectiveness of encouraging economic development via special efforts and geographic specific orientations been explored; rural labor force members behaved differently than their urban counterparts, but the reasons for the differences remained unexplained; the success of education/training programs was related to client motivation, and the most successful programs were those offering a variety of supportive services in addition to basic education; low wage rates influenced client motivation when welfare services were comparable; there was a rural youth emphasis; R&D literature was more oriented toward the research than the practitioner community.

Sections include analyses of achievement test scores, research conducted under the auspices of the Del Mod System, and a follow-up study of teachers' perceptions. Achievement test data analyzed (for a small sample of students) show gains for most samples of students. Forty-four teachers who had been involved with the Del Mod System over a five year period of time provided their perceptions of various elements of the program, what aspects should be retained, strengths of the program, and how the program could be improved. Evaluations are generally positive; the field agent concept in  particular was strongly supported. (RH)",

The objectives of the investigation were to (a) identify what has been done in the past in the way of nature trail design for the visually impaired, (b) compare this with what professional workers for the visually impaired consider important in the design of the facilities, and (c) to provide guidelines for the design of future trails for the visually impaired. It was determined that the &quot;typical&quot; nature center was over five miles from the nearest urban center, not on public transportation lines, and provided a single special trail for the visually impaired with guide ropes and braille signs. As a result of the literature search, the informal interviews with visually impaired  students, and the survey of Orientation and Mobility Instructors, the following suggestions are made for the design of future nature trails: (1) No special trails should be established, as these tend to isolate the visually impaired from the rest of the visitors; (2) all trails should be clearly differentiated from the surrounding environment so that the visually imparied can use residual sight or proper mobility techniques for travel; ropes are unnecessary and often vandalized; (3) special pavement is not needed; (4) railings should be provided at hazardous areas; and (5) interpretation should be offered through the use of portable cassette tape players, and booklets for the hard of hearing.

Organization and classification as parts of perception are emphasized, involving the introduction of the physical properties of matter as aids to organization. The first year program is not excessively formal or quantitative, based on the rationale that a new idea should proceed from an intuitive, non-quantitative experience to a more quantitative one. The Portland Project, intended to replace traditional courses in biology, chemistry, and physics, treats science as a  structure that proceeds from observation to the development of general principles and then to the application of those principles to more involved problems. A review of the development of the three-year program, a discussion of its rationale, and a three-year course subject outline are included in this volume.

        "description":"This teacher's guide is for the second year of the Portland Project, a three-year integrated secondary science curriculum sequence. The first of two parts in this volume, &quot;Motion and Energy,&quot; begins with the study of motion, going from the quantitative description to a consideration of what causes motion and a discussion of Newton's laws. There follows the development of the laws of conservation of momentum and energy, including a discussion of energy in biological systems, and culminating with a discussion of the kinetic molecular theory. Part two, &quot;Chemical Reactions,&quot; builds basic chemical concepts necessary for the analytical approach in the third year course. Topics considered in this part include the mole concept, equation writing, energetics associated with chemical  reactions, the dynamic nature of particles and their interactions, and the application of energy and equilibrium to chemical systems. The Harvard Physics Project textbook and the Chemical Educational Materials Study (CHEMS) textbook are used for most of the reading assignments in the second year course. A review of the development of the three-year program, its rationale and content, and a three-year course subject outline are included in this volume. Notes to the teacher, examples of data, and problem calculations are included. (Author/SL)",

Twenty-five studies have been selected from a comprehensive bibliography on population and family planning in Nigeria. The selection was based on three criteria - coverage of research topics, validity of scientific approach, and practical implications. The types of survey under review, some of the problems encountered in the search for information and the methodologies adopted for national, urban and rural and other types of survey are described. An analysis of findings related to specific population and family planning topics is followed by some recommendations. Much of  this information is also presented in tabular form, enabling the reader to identify surveys according to methodology and content. The opinions expressed are those of the authors. A background to the review is provided by notes on the historical development and financing of research in Nigeria, with lists of recent research topics and the researchers involved. (Author/RH)",

Included is a review of the literature on sex differences, the relevance of these differences to success in science, and evidence relating to the development of these differences. The author of the fourth paper reports results that show polarization in attitudes to school subjects between the sexes.

Project ICE is a five year environmental education project located in Green Bay, Wisconsin and funded by the State of Wisconsin under ESEA Title III. Begun in 1970, the project has developed a series of Supplementary Curriculum Guides for all subjects and all grades, K-12 based on twelve environmental concepts. Each lesson identifies a major concept, provides behavioral objectives, suggests instructional or student activities and lists available resource materials. The program emphasizes flexibility by providing numerous alternatives for each lesson. The sample consisted of students in grades 2, 5, 8, and 11 in 14 schools. Evaluation included cognitive assessment of student achievement,  teacher logs, teacher reactions, and parent reactions. Students were pretested in the fall and posttested in the spring. Data favored experimental schools in grades 2, 5, and 8. Data for grade 11 were not significant; this supported observations that the ICE program was not implemented in grade 11 experimental schools. Teachers were generally favorable to the program and many parents indicated they felt increased awareness of the environment in their children's questions, behavior, etc. (RH)",

The program, designed by teachers, aims to develop in the student a greater awareness and understanding of the community, themselves, and the earth. The program includes a number of environmental encounters. Topical themes lead teachers and students through main areas of awareness: Plants and Animals, Water, Air, Energy, Natural Resources, Land Use, and Aesthetics and Pollution. The conceptual schemes under each area of awareness increase in complexity according to the development level of the students. The activities in the encounters are action-oriented, student-centered activities which provide \"hands-on\" learning experiences. Each encounter provides background information,  behavioral objectives, activities, a resource reference listing, and value clarification strategies.

        "description":"Research in human genetics is now expanding rapidly, leading to increasingly precise ways of preventing or treating some of the 2,000 or more inherited disorders that afflict human beings. At the same time, it has produced a wealth of new ideas and techniques which are laying the groundwork for new medical science for the 21st century. Recent work with man-mouse hybrid cells, for instance, is making it possible to map which human genes belong on which chromosome; the hybrid cells are also allowing researchers to investigate how individual genes can be \"turned on\" and how the body reacts to viral infection. Much of this progress is due to scientists' new ability to grow and study live human cells. Hundreds of experiments which could not be done on human beings can now be carried  out on cells grown from small slivers of skin or other tissue taken from people with genetic disorders. This pamphlet describes how the National Institute of General Medical Sciences' new library of human cell lines (the Human Mutant Cell Repository in Camden, N.J.) grows, stores and distributes such cells, and how they are used to help geneticists in their research.

To discover evidence of poor reading affecting word problem success, the investigators asked each child to read aloud those problems answered incorrectly in which reading might have contributed to the error that was made. Children were asked to explain the situation in the problem, to identify the question being asked, and to tell how the problem should be worked. Findings showed that although many children did not know how to do the work, they could read and interpret the problems. Finally, audio reading times were measured to discover evidence that slow  reading caused failure; little such evidence was found. (DT)",

The seven models in Chapter II aim at teaching valuing processes. The topics deal with personal values, moral development of young children, decision in a village family, role playing, and life in a Japanese family. For each model, a social science generalization or a valuing approach is presented, followed by a listing of processes and materials, description of the model, and evaluation instructions.

Two purposes of the evaluation study were to assess developments in the Small House program and to develop a prototype or model for evaluating innovative educational programs that delineates the evaluation, design, and analytic techniques. Small House was a pilot program that students could elect as an alternative to traditional education. It was designed to humanely alter the administrative and psychological environment of public junior high schools through flexible modular scheduling and team teaching. This study evaluated goals that Small House teachers set for themselves: normal student achievement in reading and mathematics, positive student attitudes  toward school, and humane behavior in both students and teachers. A control group consisted of traditional mathematics classes at the junior high school. The California Reading Test, California Arithmetic Test, School Sentiment Index, and an attitude questionnaire were administered and student and teacher behaviors were observed. Evidence suggested that the program goals were achieved. However, variables such as administrative support, selection bias, team-cluster structure, and program newness confounded the evidence. Development of an evaluation model for innovative educational programs was not met due to methodological flaws and limitations in the study. However, a skeletal model was suggested that contains instructional, institutional, and behavioral dimensions. (ND)",

International Baccalaureate is a secondary school which offers a curriculum and examination system that is relevant to the needs of an international student body and that is recognized by the university systems in the home countries of participating students. Plans for the IB were first drafted in 1964 at the International School of Geneva. Goals of IB were to (1) work within the framework of various international schools to produce agreement on an IB curriculum, (2) develop an efficient and reliable examination structure, and (3) achieve acceptance by a number of  national universities to grant IB diploma holders the equivalent status of a student studying within the national educational system. Curriculum includes language; study of man (social studies); experimental sciences; mathematics; specialized electives; theory of knowledge; and cultural, aesthetic, and social services activities. Development of IB was completed in 1975 and it is now operating in almost 80 schools around the world. Appendices include notes and syllabi for a history course and a course on film making at the Copenhagen International School. (ND)",

The handbook is arranged in seven sections. After a brief discussion of the rationale for teaching concepts, the second section focuses on the meaning of concepts. Concepts are defined as abstractions that refer to a class or group of objects, qualities, etc., which possess certain common characteristics. This section discusses the components of concepts, such as attributes, classes, and symbols, and the relationship between concepts and generalizations. The third section discusses the advantages of teaching conceptual thinking and of  teaching students to generalize from one situation to another. The fourth section enumerates a number of principles for the teacher to keep in mind in order to facilitate the learning of concepts by the students, such as actively involving students in the learning process. The fifth section offers two strategies for teaching concepts. The deductive strategy is characterized by the introduction of the concept or generalization at the beginning of the instruction sequence. The student is then given the opportunity to verify the concept or generalization through experience or example. The inductive strategy begins with specifics and proceeds to generalizations which are then tested. The sixth section provides a checklist for evaluating conceptual teaching and learning. The self-checklist  helps teachers analyze teacher behavior, student behavior, and the curriculum. The last section lists articles, books, and parts of books dealing with the concepts and concept teaching and learning in social studies. (ND)",

Case studies illustrate several ways in which academic freedom can become an issue in elementary and secondary schools. Historical background demonstrates that the European university tradition has provided much of the basis for academic freedom in American universities, but has had little effect on freedom in elementary and secondary schools. Various definitions of academic freedom are categorized as upholding (1) no grounds for distinguishing academic from general freedom, (2) structurally  limited freedom, or (3) professionally limited freedom. Legal restrictions, formal regulations, and self-censorship are shown to be possible sources of infringement upon academic freedom. A set of seven factors that should be considered by teachers in determining a personal set of academic freedom principles are suggested: community attitudes, school and system attitudes, legal rights, professional obligations, historical precedents, responsibilities to students, and personal philosophies and ethical convictions. Several questions about the meaning and application of academic freedom in elementary and secondary schools conclude the document. (Author/ND)",

        "author":["Karma, Kai"],
        "description":"This report offers some general principles which are helpful for designing and constructing a test for measuring musical aptitude of persons from various age groups. A discussion attempts to clarify the concepts used within the psychology of music. The basic structuralist principles favored by Gestalt psychologists and structuralists are also discussed. The report suggests that many abilities measured by musical aptitude tests are effects of musical experience rather than musical aptitude. The concepts discussed--creative musicality, musical memory, musical intelligence, the sense of tonality, the sense of rhythm, and the sense of harmony--can be tested for their consistency with musical behavior, their circularity, and their importance. The report indicates that there are seldom  clear and simple answers to the questions about the domains of constructs in the psychology of music. The structuralist tradition in music psychology, which maintains that most of the meaning in music is its structure, stresses the following properties in any test of musical aptitude: (1) the test must measure the ability to conceive groups of relations; (2) the relations must be objective; (3) the relations must be relatively general; and (4) the items must be constructed so that there are substructures in them. Problem areas of research in musical aptitude are identified. (Author/DB)",

The major goal of this project was organizational change and renewal to influence the quality of classroom instruction. This was to be achieved by helping teachers and administrators to effect the changes they most desired which they believed were connected with the ultimate outcomes of improved educational experiences for children. Four phases of the program included the start-up entry, involvement, and training; support for teamwork and follow-through; skill development and application; and evaluation. Experiences and highlights from the program are presented. Chapters one through 12 describe the program in action; offer  some participant observations; discuss assumptions and guiding ideas about the program; explore how the participants organized the implementation; describe team training and how the program started; discuss the follow-through on plans and commitments; describe the development of the how-to-do-it skills; offer documentation and assessment of progress; focus on leadership skills and roles needed; offer some improvements and possible modifications; provide a resource list; and enumerate activity tools needed for carrying out the program. The tools, 32 class handouts, are included in chapter 12 as exhibits. (ND)",

        "description":"A typology of ethnic education programs is suggested and a case study is presented where separate education for an ethnic group has been used to maintain and defend a separate ethnic identity. The typology rates ethnic education programs both by degree of normative and structural change being sought and by degree of control by ethnic groups. Supplemental ethnic studies education programs have low structure change and low ethnic control; alternative programs, such as black, Chicano, and Native American studies, have high structure change and low ethnic control; defensive programs, such as the Amish who seek to control the content and ideological orientation of their educational programs, have low structure change and high ethnic control; and transformative programs, such as the  American Indian Movement which takes a militant approach, have high structure change and high ethnic control. The case study examines a declining elite group which is striving to maintain ethnic identity and boundaries through defensive programs--the Swedish-speaking community in Finland. The minority community uses a variety of formal and nonformal educational programs to sustain group solidarity and ethnic identity. History and description of the rationale, ideology, goals, organization, and various data of the social movement show how and why the group's educational programs are classified as defensive. Although the Swedish-speaking population has declined in numbers and influence since World War II, their separatist policy has defended their ethnicity. If decline continues, however,  ethnic integration might occur. An extensive bibliography is included. (ND)",

Participants were 400 persons who are interested or involved in political education. The conference involved speeches and papers from experts and leaders in the field, information dissemination about activities in key areas, task-oriented work groups, and improvement of the political education system. The report covers participant, leader, and evaluation team views of the conference, including conclusions, recommendations, evaluation of the Delphi process used at the conference, and followup activities. The evaluation format used the feedback process of a systems analysis model. Every major  activitiy was assessed while in action, such as registration, room arrangements, major presentations, and work groups. Questionnaires obtained information about participant background, involvement in citizen education, views of the conference activities, views of conference goals, and suggestions for conference improvement. Different questionnaires were used to query participants; participants/observers; work group facilitators/host recorders; and resource persons/presenters. The Delphi technique was used to seek closure on citizen education task definition. The conference was evaluated as a success. However, hostility was expressed toward the Delphi process as a time intrusion, which is indicative of complaints about time constraints, an overstructured program, and little opportunity for  interaction and exchange. Questionnaire return rate was 50%, but it was suspected that returns were received only from polite, submissive, and contented persons. Appendices contain the questionnaires and response data. (ND)",

        "author":["Fink, Cecelia H."],
        "description":"The teaching experiences of 25 student teachers of secondary social studies from Towson State University, Baltimore, Maryland, were investigated to determine if and why they were valuable experiences. Three kinds of data were compiled and evaluated during the ten-week student teaching experience. Student teachers kept records of their daily experiences and reactions in the classroom; supervising teachers and student teachers completed questionnaires; and an on-site observer watched, listened to, questioned, and noted classroom activity. The major finding indicated that student teachers became significantly more custodial toward pupils during their classroom experience. Pupil control was equated by the supervisors with ability to teach. Student teachers were evaluated on control  of the classroom rather than for conveying the subject matter, getting pupils involved, or helping students develop concepts and skills. Also, positive evaluations were written about teaching behavior, even though supervisors spent little time observing student teachers. Thus, it was determined that student teachers learned how to control pupils and model after their supervisors, but not how to effect teaching methods learned in their teacher education programs. Recommendations are made for making the student teaching experience more positive, such as rewriting evaluation forms to demand more observation by supervisors of teaching behavior. Appendices contain the questionnaires and log forms. (ND)",

        "description":"A research project in Alberta, Canada, explored the ability of elementary school students to understand and interpret infrared false color Landsat maps. Landsat maps are representations of the earth's land surface produced by orbiting satellites. Infrared is used to delineate vegetation. Accuracy and timeliness of Landsat maps make them useful for studying urban and rural developments, pollution problems, and agricultural conditions. Sixty-nine students and three teachers representing third, fourth, and fifth grade classes in Edmonton participated in the study. None had previous exposure to Landsat maps. Teachers were given preliminary training in map interpretation and possible ways of using the maps in class. No specific teaching strategies were imposed during the six to 11  instruction periods. Students were posttested with nonuniform teacher-developed tests, and three students from each class were interviewed by a researcher. Results indicated that children can work with Landsat maps if instruction is provided, and that the teachers themselves need greater familiarity with the principles involved in producing the maps. Children had difficulty understanding the extent of territory covered by the maps and the role of radiation. Further research should explore male-female achievement trends and whether children in grades 3-5 can apply Landsat map data to given problems. (AV)",

Personalized instruction is defined as relating subject content to the personal background, interests, needs, and abilities of the student. Students proceed at their own pace, use materials suitable to their individual abilities, and derive immediate practical value from academic work. Each student's degree program is developed with help from his faculty advisor. Courses, called contracts, could involve readings, writing tasks, projects, or related employment. Students work on one contract at a time and receive credits according to time involved. Various types of student evaluation are used; sometimes outside experts must be called upon to evaluate  unusual contracts. In addition, at the end of each contract period a digest and evaluation are written which briefly describe the learning activities and the materials used. Examples of personalized contracts are supplied for basic economics, consumer economics, economic geography, labor economics, money and banking, women in the economy, poverty, energy, statistics, business and economic history, management, advertising and marketing, accounting, and business law. Little data is available so far to evaluate the program. An extensive bibliography of research in individualized, self-paced, and personalized instruction in economics is included. (ND)",

        "description":"The role of geography in the elementary school curriculum is examined in this paper, which is arranged in four parts. Part 1 briefly sketches the characteristics of geographic instruction at different periods in U.S. history. Intellectual development and social education are identified as two widely accepted goals for elementary education today. In general, intellectual development means acquiring important information, mastering basic skills, comprehending significant ideas, and increasing thinking abilities. Social education means the analysis of social problems, the examination of personal and social values, and the ability to make choices and decisions. The objectives for geographic education, presented in part 2, are organized into four categories--objectives related to  factual learning, objectives related to skill learning, objectives related to ideational learning, and objectives related to more complex intellectual processes. A checklist for evaluating geographic education programs in elementary schools is provided in part 3. An introductory bibliographic essay follows in part 4, which is intended for use by social studies educators as they develop or reorganize geographic components of the elementary school curriculum. The essay lists sources on geography in the elementary school and on objectives and evaluation in geographic education. References are included. (Author/DB)",

The report can be used as a decision-making tool by local citizen educational-accountability committees who are examining forces inside and outside the community. The profile was prepared as an outgrowth of the studies described in ED 130 924. Six dimensions of community life are examined in the main body of the report. Discussed are the following: (1) potentialities and limitations of the community as influenced by the physical environment; (2) history and reasons for settlement of Rocky Ford; (3) the people--their age and income distribution, ethnic background, and educational level; (4) occupations and mobility of individual and family in relation to  economic trends within and outside the community; (5) political processes, resolution of issues, distribution of political power, and demands of citizens; and (6) community attitudes and expectations. Following the main body of the report is a section containing 22 activities which will enable students or adults to understand concepts related to the profile, such as industrial location and career choice. An appendix contains tables and listings of data including agricultural statistics, city government financial report, community health services, and annual police report. (Author/AV)",

        "description":"Elementary school children in Mounds View, Minnesota, were surveyed for their impressions of American Indians. The method used was to individually interview every fifth child on the kindergarten and grade 5 class rosters. The report is presented in two sections--data and conclusions. Each of 12 questions is considered separately in the data section, with the answers of the 238 kindergartners and 239 fifth graders appearing side by side on a chart for purposes of comparison. Sample questions include: Do you know who American Indians are? Have you ever seen an American Indian? What do Indian children do? A discussion follows each question, in which both unusual and frequently mentioned comments from each grade are presented. In the conclusion section, grade responses are considered  together. Among conclusions offered are that most children view Indian people as far removed from their way of life; many children view Indian people as warlike; most children do not recognize diversity among Indian people; and children's images suggest media influence. Six limitations of the study are identified, including the suburban nature of the sample, the use of 20 interviewers, and differences in verbal abilities of children. A bibliography and a list of instructions to interviewers are included. (Author/DB)",

Intended predominantly for use by teachers in developing curriculum for teaching about Indian people, the report is presented in two sections--an information test and an attitude survey. In section I, each of 44 information questions is considered separately and responses by the 986 ninth grade students and 632 twelfth grade students are compared. A summary of student responses indicates that students could correctly answer less than half the questions and that twelfth graders scored better than ninth graders on 36 of the 44 questions. In the section on attitudes, students were asked to respond to 26 statements. Students of both grades  responded positively toward Indian people, with a high correlation between higher scores on information questions and more positive attitudes. The conclusion is offered that a realistic portrayal of Native Americans should be incorporated into the curriculum to counteract social stereotypes, textbook distortions, and media influence. Limitations of the study are identified, including the suburban nature of the sample and differing abilities and attitudes of the students. A bibliography, instructions for administering the survey, and a copy of the survey are included. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"State departments of education were surveyed to determine the status of social studies in the United States. Supplemental background data were also gathered from local school districts and previous research. The purpose of the survey was to obtain information on course offerings, enrollments, and requirements in social studies. Some limitations of the study are identified early in the report, such as incomplete response (36 state departments replied), variability of data among states, and computer limitations. Findings show that there is a declining enrollment in social studies; a lack of interest in teaching social studies in elementary schools; a relaxation of state and local requirements in the teaching of social studies; and an increase in teacher creativeness, since teachers  now have more freedom to teach what they want. Although many teachers are familiar with approaches construed to be associated with the new social studies, such as inquiry, conceptual, and simulation-game approaches, there has been little resulting change in textbook selection, hiring practices, and creation of a basic social studies program. Factors most often identified in the survey as affecting the social studies include an increase in the number of courses taught other than social studies, reduced funding, specialized offerings in ethnic studies, and anarchial curriculum. Future scenarios are presented and a national social studies curriculum is recommended. Tables are included. (Author/DB)",

In the section on theoretical foundations of the taxonomy, it is maintained that task-oriented group activity requires rotating leadership, based upon sanctions, persuasion, or influence. Nine individual tendencies assumed as critical to achievement of role-exchange yielding and role-exchange asserting functions are listed. The profile of a socially and emotionally mature student who  would achieve mastery of the taxonomy objectives is presented, followed by a discussion of the types of learning environments which encourage mastery of the objectives. The relationship between the taxonomy and values education is discussed. The most significant functional value of the taxonomy is providing a structure for evaluating action learning.

Overcrowding, race, poverty, and drugs are suggested by social scientists to be among the causes for disruptions within school systems. The schools in this study include an entirely black inner-city school; a multicultural, economically diverse school in an old established suburban community; a private parochial school with tuition of $1,900 per year; a school with students from predominantly upper and middle income classes; and a school which serves five culturally different suburbs. A comparison of guidelines for student behavior as codified in student handbooks is made. Punishable infractions range from  excessive absences to abuses of property rights and use of dangerous drugs or illegal substances, i.e., guns and knives. Each school has different policies dealing with infractions: the private school institutes immediate expulsion for serious first offenses, whereas other schools hold conferences between school personnel and parents before expelling unruly students. The author points out that adolescents commit more crime per capita than any other age group. He urges that society as a whole must deal with problems of violence in order for the school to overcome discipline problems. (AV)",

The effects of the visual arts and poetry components on artists, poets, school administrators, students, and teachers in ten western states are discussed. Approximately 300 schools participated in the study, which made use of a general questionnaire, student survey, anecdotal survey, in-depth interviews, and a job ranking scale. Findings indicate that high percentages of artists/poets and administrators believe the program has fostered creativity among students; teachers and administrators rated cooperation between themselves and the artists/poets very high; and 70% of administrators and teachers  reported that artists/poets had good ability in classroom management and holding student interest. Student self-identity, discipline, and confidence appeared to grow as a result of the program, and student interest and achievement in other academic areas increased as well. Passive and problem students showed therapeutic effects. Ninety-one percent of administrators and teachers commented favorably on the tolerance of artists/poets for administrator, student, and teacher viewpoints. The study summary, highlights, and a technical report are available from state arts councils and commissions nationwide. (Author/AV)",

The relationship between schools and museums is investigated with respect to learning. Children must learn to learn--see, observe, conclude, and think--rather than memorize facts. Museums can teach this by offering an opportunity to look at the world from many realistic perspectives. An illustration of a good teaching-learning relationship is the use of a museum specimen to introduce facts in an interdisciplinary manner. A special advantage that a museum has, unlike schools, is its personal contact between students and the world. The Corpus Christi Museum is contemplating a comprehensive visiting program, called a \"window program.\"  Students would be offered a multitude of activities geared to individual student interests, such as working with specimens and making handicrafts. The major problem with this type of program is obtaining teacher interest in bringing students to the museum. For a special project, the museum arranged for a college student to fulfill his degree requirements by working at the museum. Based on that experience, a curriculum of 32 subjects and assignments was developed for future teacher training at the museum. The student's experiences are summarized in a short final report. (ND)",

        "description":"Twenty-one American educational researchers and policy makers present their impressions of education in Japan. Compiled as a result of a two and a half week Educational Staff Seminar tour of Japan in 1972, the articles describe public and private schools, factories, museums, educational television studios, monasteries, shrines, and the Japanese Parliament. As background for the study tour, the participants talked with Japanese scholars, politicians, labor leaders, students, government officials, businessmen, and Zen Buddhist priests. The first article discusses the social and political life and identifies the difficulties of perceiving Japan from a Western perspective. Subsequent articles discuss the role of the Japanese government in education, early childhood education,  education of the handicapped, educational research, science and vocational education, cultural education, social welfare services, the status of women, and educational television. Appendices include a directory of the staff of the Japan Center for International Exchange, a roster of participants of the study tour, and a listing of Educational Staff Seminar Programs in 1973.

        "description":"Background, rationale, and consequences of a plan for teaching introductory undergraduate psychology are described. The setting is a college where eight to ten members of the psychology department have traditionally shared the teaching of introductory courses. The faculty recognized that there was not consensus on the content of an exemplary introductory course in psychology, so each professor tended to stress his or her own specialized area: human learning, psychobiology, or motivation and emotion, for example. Ultimately, the faculty decided to name the sections according to their content, making certain that several fundamental topics were included in all sections. Also, one general course open only to freshmen was established for those with weak backgrounds. All other  students are required to take any two specially named introductory sections before electing a nonintroductory yearlong course in experimental psychology. The author believes that this fragmented approach to teaching introductory psychology is better than a core course approach because the field of psychology is a fragmented discipline. One problem which has been identified is the minimal transfer between method and content of the introductory courses to the experimental psychology course. A potential problem, that faculty would become more restricted to their interests, has not occurred. (AV)",

After having been controlled by various parties since the late 18th century, Polish education is now consolidated under two administrative bodies, one for elementary and secondary education and one for higher education. At all levels, education is free. Polish is the primary language of instruction. Four years of noncompulsory preschool are available, followed by eight years of compulsory elementary grades for which the curriculum is uniform throughout the country. During the four or five years of secondary education, students may attend general education lyceums and post-lyceum schools, technical/vocational schools, or basic vocational schools, depending on their plans for university  study or immediate entry into agricultural or industrial trades. Teacher education begins in special secondary level study centers and continues at the university level. Higher education requires four to six years of study for the first degree, depending on the institution and field of study. A table shows 20 general and technical universities with locations and with fields of study, called faculties. Admission requires a secondary school Certificate of Maturity and a passing grade on an entrance examination. Reforms planned for 1978 include equal eight-year elementary education for urban and rural youth, teacher training, and redesigned curriculum. (AV)",

The conflicting roles of church and state in administering education have been reconciled within the past two decades, with resultant increases in enrollment and government financing. Curriculum regulation, coordination, and supervision are centralized within the Ministry of Education, and implementation, evaluation, and technical aspects of programs are managed by eight regional offices. Private education exists separately. The present educational structure begins with a pilot preschool program being extended throughout the country. Following completion of the six-year primary school, students enter the three-year basic cycle of secondary school and continue to a  diversified cycle of either two years for general/academic education or two to three years for technical or normal training of primary and preschool teacher preparation. At the higher education level, qualified students enter either a five-year university program, a four-year program at a teacher-training institute, or a course in a polytechnic or technical junior-college-type institution. Approximately 80% of the students preparing for university study specialize in the sciences. Elements of the 1976-80 educational plan emphasize development of human resources and physical facilities and more effective financing of public education. (Author/AV)",

The discussion of strategy recommendations, reading materials, and record collections should be adapted to suit local preferences and individual skills. An opening section of general remarks suggests that AP music courses not be taught according to a chronological plan, but rather on a genre basis by a randomized period outline or according to elements of musical structure. Use of a relatively recent text, supplemented by other sources of information, is desirable. Listening to live performances, if possible, and discussion are also critical activities. Eight strategy recommendations stress focusing on the structure of each  musical composition as it is heard, preferably with visual guides such as flow charts and time lines. Cassette tapes can capture short sections and allow voice cues to be recorded over musical passages. Juxtaposed examples from widely different musical cultures effectively introduce non-Western music. Sixty-eight references to books and recordings include the following topics: listening guides and background; performance sources; allied arts; non-European, Asian, and Near-Eastern music, and folk and traditional music of American-English origins.

The interdisciplinary nature of population education makes it easy to infuse into existing curricula at all grade levels in social studies, geography, and history. One reason for studying population is that changes in fertility behavior are exerting an impact on the entire social system. This includes the operations of schools by changing the number of children who move through the educational system. Although many developing countries have recognized the need in the past decade for emphasis on population education, similar programs in the United States have moved  slowly due to lack of resources and competing priorities for innovative programs. There is a need for appropriate teacher training, material development, and research to develop curriculum content. In the nonfederal sector, some school districts are integrating population units into elementary and secondary level courses. The Population Reference Bureau effectively translates demographic and related phenomena into understandable materials for lay readers. Thirteen recommendations for federal involvement stress the role of agencies, such as the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Bureau of the Census, National Science Foundation, and National Institute of Education, in emphasizing population education priorities in annual program planning.

The first section includes a sketch of the present moral climate of the United States, including evidence drawn from a recent Gallup Poll of public attitudes toward education, recent magazine articles, results of educational research, and pronouncements from several state departments of education. The second section presents background information on the morals and values upon which the United States was founded and discusses the Mayflower Compact, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, and the Northwest Ordinance. The third section describes methodological developments which enable educators to mount effective moral education  programs and presents recommendations for combining efforts of parents, citizens, teachers, policy makers, and major educational institutions to improve education for citizenship responsibility on all levels.

More specifically, the entries represent controlled experimental studies which describe a treatment and measure treatment results. The document presents abstracts of over 1,500 documents published after 1960. The majority are published reports of research in professional psychology or educational psychology journals, others are unpublished dissertations or research findings, and a few are summaries of projects within elementary or secondary school classrooms. Most of the studies involve quantitative techniques of evaluation and populations of five or  more subjects. Direct or indirect relevance to the development of educational programs is indicated. The abstracts are classified by major effect areas, which are defined as general categories of reasoning, affective states, and skills and behaviors that are produced or affected by training in the moral/ethical/values area. The 15 effect areas are aggression, altruism, attitudes, conflict resolution, conformity, cooperation, empathy, moral development/judgment, reasoning and judgment, reaction to transgression, resistance to temptation, risk taking, role taking, self-control, and values. Effect areas are arranged alphabetically and studies are ordered alphabetically by author within each area. The definition for each effect area precedes the section and the treatment techniques are  identified in the heading for each abstract and used as entries in the subject index.

Intended for use by the public and, particularly, by the National Institute of Education, the document is presented in six sections. The first section defines ECE as an effort to teach students the knowledge, skills, and dispositions which enable them to realize in action the ethical-citizenship principles consistent with American democratic traditions. Section two presents a statement of need, outlining the societal imperative for ECE. In the third and fourth sections, the 1976 Moral Citizenship  Education planning activities and findings, which provided a background for the present study, are described. The bulk of the report, presented in section five, consists of the recommendations for future ECE efforts. Topics discussed in this section include youth as the ECE target, school-community advisory groups, ECE objectives and content, curriculum guidelines, teaching techniques and instructional models, public policy, dissemination, and television involvement. Tables of recommended ECE activities are included on public policy, theory building, research, development, and dissemination. In the final section, methods of obtaining and managing needed resources are discussed. References are included. (Author/DB)",

A section on Indian-white relationships includes drawings about conquests and treaties made by Spanish and colonial Americans, a description from an 1868 edition of Harper's Weekly about Indian prisoners taken by Custer, recommended readings, and a list of words which illustrate Indian contributions to English language and culture. Sections on European and Chinese immigrants focus on motivations for immigration, native opposition to newcomers, and restrictive  legislation. Drawings from magazines illustrate European families awaiting deportation, and Chinese merchants being harrassed by American legal restrictions. Readings portray the frustrations of immigration inspection on Ellis Island and political debates about allowing Chinese laborers into the country. Also recommended are techniques for analyzing social difficulties experienced by freed black slaves. All the materials are in field-test condition. (AV)",

Teaching strategies for this topic are presented in booklet form as one of a set of materials based on topics identified by the American Issues Forum. Readings and questions guide students through three areas. In &quot;Early American Experience in Land Use,&quot; students read documents which define provisions for postrevolutionary distribution of western lands. Then they consider effects of American land policy on the native American. For example, a speech by a Seneca chief indicates Indian concern about timber cutting by Americans on reservations in 1821. &quot;Land Use Today: Whose Decision?&quot; challenges students to examine government control of private  land, the role of the public in shaping government land-use decisions, and zoning standards. In a simulation, students assume roles of a town board that determines land-use policy for a 16-acre tract. Alternative strategies are outlined. &quot;A Case Study: Forest for Sale by Owner&quot; presents a controversy based on proposed construction of a dam in the Adirondacks. Students evaluate the issue by reviewing present forest management policy, water needs of New York state, and materials from the hearings on the dam construction. The materials are in field-test condition. (AV)",

        "author":["Brown, Richard H."],
        "description":"In light of changing trends in education since the 1960s, archives and manuscript collections are becoming more useful as primary educational resources on both secondary and higher education levels. One reason for this is the recent emphasis on inquiry learning with the subsequent development of collections of evidence, data, and documents for students to investigate. Another reason involves the movement of education beyond the formal classroom into the community. Experiential education allows students to come to repositories of educational materials; the materials no longer must be packaged and sent to the schools. The author discusses four ways in which archives and manuscript collections could be used as dynamic resources. As sources of curriculum materials, collections could  be selected and packaged according to media type, such as microfilm resource units, or subject areas, such as ethnic or community history. Training programs and institutes could be developed for teachers to learn how to use collections not only for research but also for teaching. Seminars could be offered to students using specific subject-matter collections as the basis for course outlines. Because the research role of archives goes hand in hand with its development as an educational institution, archive collections may expand into further research endeavors as further educational programs are offered.

        "description":"This study presents evidence that differences in mathematical career outcomes of males and females are the result of early socialization in the family. One reason fewer females than males elect to take high school mathematics courses is that during middle school years females perceive low parental evaluations of their mathematical aptitude and develop low self-concepts of mathematical ability. Traditional independent variables, intelligence quotient (IQ) and socioeconomic status (SES), do not explain the behavioral difference between the sexes in higher mathematics. Data are taken from a longitudinal study of 588 students in grades 8-12. Data analysis is based on path analysis models and tables of percentages which describe differences between males and females. Tables present  information on completed mathematics courses, perceived parental evaluation of mathematical ability, and self-evaluation. Three intervening variables are examined for path analysis: sex, IQ, and SES. Path analysis indicates that the intervening variables, perceived parental evaluations, and self-concept of mathematical ability are strongly correlated with subsequent behavior. That is, females are programmed by both parents and themselves for lower performance in mathematics than males, and they subsequently behave according to the self and parental concepts. Implications for social change are considered. (Author/ND)",

Ideas are given for teachers to involve students in the issues contained in existing curriculum materials related to U.S. history,  culture, and literature. Objectives for grades 10-12 include helping students to state alternative methods for resolving conflict in given situations, identify barriers to understanding between cultures, and recognize relationships between social change and conflict. Six areas which are typically covered in high school curricula are examined for relevance to concept teaching about conflict. These include career education, literature, civics, and world studies. Suggested teaching strategies stress student comparison of personal experiences with those of historical figures and community groups. (Author/AV)",

Among eight objectives are understanding the meaning of systems and interdependence, recognizing that people use and shape their environments, and appreciating relationships between one's immediate surroundings and the natural systems of the planet. In the guide, activities and related readings are suggested for achieving the objectives in specific subject areas: social studies, art,  science, mathematics, U.S. and state history, reading, and writing. For example, students use a globe to calculate how much of the planet is land and how much land is habitable. The handbook contains 11 lessons, many based on readings which emphasize comparison of human and environmental systems, the role of microbes, and environment-dependent communities such as a river town. Some activities involve the exploration of students' familiar surroundings; others focus on global issues. Each lesson contains goals, objectives, activities, and follow-up activities. (AV)",

Eight objectives, based on knowledge of systems, include understanding how population changes influence all other environmental issues, developing constructive attitudes toward one's surroundings, and comparing ways in which diverse human groups interact with their environment. The guide presents ideas and bibliographic suggestions for multidisciplinary study. For example, science classes could research major sources of pollutants, such as  carbon monoxide, and report their effects on natural systems. English and art classes could study folk art of various cultures and note the ways that people use art to express their feelings about the world in terms of food sources, homes, gods, and landforms. The handbook contains four activity units in which students study effects of a nationwide airline strike and analyze the role of noise as a by-product of some systems and a necessary component of others.

In another approach, students develop a television documentary perspective of rich and poor persons on environmental concerns.

These new measures, for use in institutions of postsecondary education, must: (1) be sensitive and relevant to important learning outcomes; (2) have general significance to a wide variety of career and life outcomes; (3) have practical utility for educators; (4) be methodologically and technically innovative, e.g., utilize operant rather than respondent behaviors; and (5) be quantifiable and thus amenable to rigorous determination of reliability, validity, and meaning. Keeping in  mind these concerns, innovative measures have been developed that attempt to answer the need for more operant measurement techniques to assess the factors of process, integration, and implementation. These measures are described and organized according to their particular outcome domains--cognitive, effective, or social. Of these tests and measures described, none is especially useful as a diagnostic or assessment tool in isolation. Thus, the General Integrative Model, involving the use of several of the tests and measures described, is introduced as one way of evaluating the meaningful integration of life skills. (MM)",

Seven conceptual guidelines are identified for test development and utilization: (1) new competencies must be identified and operationally defined; (2) new competencies should have general significance to a wide variety of career and life outcomes; (3) new definitions of competencies and measures developed for their assessment should be easy for faculty and students to understand; (4) competencies should be empirically linked to external realities; (5) the discovery of new ways of measuring competencies should acknowledge levels of performance required for entry into roles outside of academic settings; (6) standards for awarding  credentials should acknowledge levels of performance required for entry into roles outside of academic settings; and (7) new attempts to define and assess learning outcomes should not be guided solely by attempts to make them functionally equivalent substitutes for traditionally assessed school achievement. A number of measures were developed along these guidelines; they are organized according to three outcome domains--cognitive, effective, and social. Descriptions of these measures are presented, and their applicability for competency based education and use in postsecondary institutions is discussed. Finally, the critical concept of the meaning of measurement is discussed along with some additional problems to be faced by educators, researchers, and funding agencies if the problems of  assessment in higher education are to be adequately redressed.

Discussion centers on three aspects of assessment: (1) the identification and definition of competencies relevant to life and work outside of academia; (2) instrumentation, techniques, and processes of evaluation that provide reliable and valid measures of these competencies; and (3) standardization and/or establishment of levels of performance necessary and sufficient for awarding credentials. Technical problems in these three areas are identified, and directions for future research and development are suggested. Discussion strongly advocates an emphasis for competency  assessment and identification that centers on adult development and learning outcomes with special attention to the interactive nature of psychological variables and how skills and abilities are integrated (as is required in life outside of academia).

        "description":"One practical consideration in the implementation of individualized instruction is the development of a record keeping system. It should reflect the characteristics of the instructional system it serves by (1) tracking the progress of the learner through stated objectives; (2) providing diagnostic data of proficiencies and deficiencies; (3) preserving a record of learning activity selection processes; and (4) storing evaluations of instructional effectiveness. A basic record keeping system focuses on the first two requirements and should reveal the expected outcomes of an instruction and the actual results of the instruction. A system of record keeping for program objectives may be developed relating goals to the objectives supporting them, or to learning materials, or to  learning tasks. Appropriate evaluation forms should be reflective of the system chosen for recording objectives. More comprehensive systems of record keeping focus on data gathering, storage, and interpretation as means for promoting confident change in the instructional sequence. They should record information on degrees of understanding, ability, and learner preference in relation to the activities involved. An additional benefit of comprehensive record keeping may result by developing learner-kept records, enabling the learner to develop a sense of self-development and progress. No standard record keeping systems exist applicable to all individualized instruction settings; therefore, the \"goodness\" of a system is contextual: does it validate its worth in relation to the demands of the  system?

        "description":"This study was conducted to determine how instructional programming for individual students has been implemented to provide effective learning environments for elementary school students. The focus was on the processes and procedures used to achieve objectives of the Instructional Programming Model (IPM). A related purpose was to study the multiunit school organization as it relates to implementation of instructional programming. One Individually Guided Education (IGE) school was chosen for case study; the IGE system includes the IPM and a model for the multiunit school. The procedures and processes used in implementing instructional programming and multiunit organization in an actual school situation were compared with these models. Data collection procedures included the use of  questionnaires, a two-week observation period, interviews, and use of documents available at the school. Seven generalizations about the multiunit school and instructional programming were generated from the data: (1) the most difficult aspect of implementing the multiunit organization is organizing the students in multiaged teams; (2) a reading specialist is a valuable asset in implementing instructional programming in reading; (3) implementation of instructional programming follows most closely with the IPM when instruction related to the objectives is isolated from other content; (4) following the sequence of the IPM does not tend to encourage student decision making; (5) the successful implementation of instructional programming may depend on frequent informal interaction among team  members as much as on the more formal regular team meetings; (6) record-keeping procedures can be developed which are adequate and which do not require an excessive amount of time; and (7) implementation of instructional programming in three or more curricular areas can be achieved.

The objectives and motivational principles of the IGM system and the instructional programming model on which it is based are presented in Chapter I. Each of the four motivational-instructional procedures that comprise the IGM system is also described: (1) adult-child conferences to encourage independent reading; (2) teacher-child conferences for goal-setting; (3) guiding older children in tutoring younger children; and (4) small group conferences to encourage self-directed conduct. In Chapter II, the purpose, method, and results of the first survey are reported. Conducted  in the spring of 1975, it was designed to gather in-depth information from schools in which the IGM system was a viable part of the instructional program. Detailed descriptions of actual use of each of the motivational-instructional procedures were solicited, as well as information about those factors that school personnel judged important to successful implementation, factors that caused problems in using the IGM procedures in the school, and the methods used to cope with these problems. Chapter III reports the results of the second survey, conducted in the fall of 1975. Designed to obtain broad information about IGM utilization from a much more extensive number of school personnel, as well as teacher educators, the specific focus was on access to, use of, and reactions to the various  IGM print and film materials. The final chapter summarizes the findings of the two surveys and discusses their implications for the implementation and utilization of the IGM system.

Federal policy enacted in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (1965) promotes five distinct goals: (1) equal educational opportunity; (2) educational reform; (3) educational research; (4) employment preparation; and (5) limited general support. While the role of the federal government has remained basically unchanged since, policy debate continues, centering on (1) education's position in national social policy, with an emerging consensus that the federal government should concern itself with economic stabilization, income security, and health insurance, leaving  responsibility for educational support mainly to the states and (2) program management in the intergovernmental system, that is, the power positions of the federal and state governments and the local educational areas. Future trends indicate a heavy focus on state level activity involved in retrieving public confidence in the educational system and in managing decline due to shrinking enrollment, with new federal programs focusing on preschoolers, handicapped students, and adults. Implications for teacher training institutions involve: (1) responding to changed demographic factors (shift to inservice education, career preparation components, development of preschool and adult education services); (2) a planning effort to prevent a renewed teacher shortage in the 1980's; (3) concentration  on management problems; and (4) cooperation in those programs that the federal government does offer for facility extension and improvement (teacher centers, teacher corps).

        "description":"Title VII and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidelines on discrimination in employment are not always the basis for court decisions in individual cases where intent to discriminate is challenged. A number of employment discrimination cases over the last decade have invalidated employee selection practices of local school boards and licensing agencies following the guidelines. Applicability of Title VII and EEOC rules to state licensing agencies still has not been definitively resolved by the courts. The consistent invalidation of National Teachers Examination (NTE) as an exclusive employment selection by the courts over the course of the past five years is of great significance to those concerned with the general problem of teacher certification. In recent years,  many states have amended their teacher certification regulations to permit or require a Competency Based Teacher Education (CBTE) orientation in their approved program credentialling practices. The educational community should expect direct or indirect judicial application of specific validation standards to teacher credentialling regulations and practices. Licensing and certification authorities will increasingly be directly subjected to validation standards. However, standards are likely to be applied more \"flexibly\" in court cases dealing with equal employment opportunity issues. Increasingly courts will be requiring adherence to the reform principles that advocates of CBTE have established. (JD)",

        "description":"The National Education Association (NEA) originally focused on a consensual relationship existing between classroom teachers and administrators on one hand and governing bodies of public education on the other. Both administrators and classroom teachers belonged to the same organization. During the past decade, the NEA became more militant, emphasizing political action, collective bargaining, and teacher strikes for higher pay and better working conditions, thus dividing teachers from management. In the light of lower student enrollment, decreased financial resources, and over-supply of teachers, priorities of NEA action are changing. There is now pressure to bring weight to bear on schools of education, which have tended to emphasize training of administrators, to recognize the  needs and demands of the classroom teacher. In demanding greater professional status benefits for classroom teachers, the NEA is seeking to complement the economic gains achieved by their members. Greater teacher participation and more school-site inservice programs are urged to contribute to more effective program implementation and improved classroom learning process. In responding to demands of organized teachers, local district administrators and schools of education, by accepting partnership with organized teachers, can improve the professional standards of the higher-education-based teacher community.

        "description":"Eight predictions present a view of the near future (five to seven years) for schools, colleges, and departments of education (SCDEs). Prior to discussion of the predictions, five common errors in planning which undermine efforts to generate reality-based action plans are introduced. They are: (1) overgeneralization and oversimplifying; (2) overemphasizing external impact factors; (3) overestimating the malleability and/or negative consequences of contextual factors; (4) assuming the inevitability of futures; (5) practicing problem displacement. With these errors in mind, the following eight predictions are ventured: (1) there will be a decrement in real funds available in SCDEs to support the range of basic functions assigned to such units; (2) enrollment in teacher education  programs will continue to decline and funds to support the instruction functions of SCDEs will also decline; (3) fiscal support for knowledge production activities or research and development in SCDEs will decline; (4) fiscal support of SCDE involvement in knowledge utilization activities will increase; (5) program quality in SCDEs will decline; (6) current perceptions held by some clients and policy makers that SCDEs are not performing adequately in either teacher education and/or knowledge utilization programs will increase; (7) there will be a loss of autonomy for SCDEs in program development, operation, and evaluation; and (8) changes in the form and structure of teacher education will be more likely than changes in its substance. If SCDEs follow the course predicted above, the  upcoming five years can be defined, using economic terminology, as a recession. (MM)",

Parsons examines the notion of competence and competency as educational objectives, stressing the concept of specificity in stating educational objectives. Too general a statement provides little in the way of guides for program construction, teaching methodology, or evaluation criteria. Too detailed an objective results in reductionism. Miller in his article examines an Arizona competency assessment project designed to determine specific skills that administrators of community education programs need to be effective leaders. Greenfield  presents a schematic representation relating on-the-job learning to graduate training in administration in an attempt to improve upon previously published administrator training program models. Larson and Erlandson examine the concept of competency based education and, on the basis of their understandings of the way the concept should and does function, present their reasons respectively in favor of and against the movement.

        "description":"Developing teachers for multicultural education is an essential assignment for teacher education and school administration today so that educators might help their students learn to live in a multicultural society. In an earlier view, public schools were considered the \"great equalizers\" among America's social institutions. The assumption was that sameness resulted in equality. One of the problems with this thinking was that imposing assimilation upon different cultural and racial groups rarely achieved a sense of equality. The myth also existed that public schools encouraged upward mobility among the immigrants and minority groups. The death of the melting pot myth received official recognition in the United States with the passage of Title IX of the Elementary and Secondary  Education Act, popularly known as the Ethnic Heritage Studies Program. At the same time, the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education issued a comprehensive statement, entitled \"No One Model American,\" on the melting pot's successor, multicultural education. Multicultural education is the public school's response to a revitalized cultural pluralism, which has become a predominant value in the American social fabric. Cultural pluralism views the United States as a multicultural society and stresses a new interpretation of the word \"different\"--different means simply different, not better than or worse. The teacher is the key person in developing a program and curriculum that will meet the goals of cultural pluralism and multicultural education. (MM)",

The first study was done to determine what student learning outcomes are affected by teachers' use of probing and redirection techniques in classroom discussions. Another purpose of the experiment was to determine the relative effect on student learning of teachers' questions delivered in both oral and written formats. The second study was conducted to determine what student learning outcomes are affected by variations in teachers' use of higher cognitive questions. These questions require the student to state predictions, solutions, explanations or opinions, expanding on information presented in the curriculum and  interpreting it in his own way. This experiment was designed to test the belief that use of higher cognitive questions is important for developing students' ability to think. The finding of both studies was that discussion following critical viewing and/or reading of curriculum materials was effective in promoting student achievement. Writing responses to questions appeared to develop knowledge acquisition as effectively as participation in discussion. However, written exercises seemed less effective for improving higher cognitive response ability than oral discussion in which the students' responses are probed and redirected by the teacher. The methodology of the experiment is described in detail, and five appendixes list the statistical results of the two studies. (JD)",

The pupils are Mexican-American-Chicano children. Under the supervision of master teachers, the student teacher follows a curriculum designed to instruct in both English and Spanish. Central to the program is the premise that bilingualism represents, for the Spanish-speaking people, the essential ingredient for cultural maintenance and, for the Spanish-speaking student in public schools, a linguistically more harmonious learning environment. The curriculum for the student teacher includes teaching English as a second language as well as studies in Spanish phonetics. Emphasis is also placed on studies of the Chicano culture,  history, music and religion, and exploration of the myths, folklore, literature, traditions and beliefs of the old Southwest and Mexico. In order to train a teacher for a bilingual-bicultural classroom, this four-year course seeks to complement educational theory and professional education courses by developing skills that will prepare the potential teacher for a situation in which both Spanish and English will be used in actual classroom teaching.

        "description":"To more nearly relate teaching skills or enabling competencies to the real performance world of the teacher, the Teacher Corps program at Emporia State College proposes that the intern demonstrate teacher competencies through a series of performance projects in each of five performance areas. These performance areas, selected from the real experience world of the intern, are: (1) facilitating the growth and development of individual students; (2) providing instruction and facilitating group processes with a group of students; (3) promoting a positive climate in the school; (4) facilitating school involvement in the community and community involvement in the school; and (5) communicating ideas and experiences to others in the teaching profession. The individual in training  contracts for projects and is responsible to the training team for demonstrating that (1) the objectives of the project were achieved and (2) that a systematic learning process was used in planning and implementing the project. The key to the successful completion of a performance project is the Systematic Learning Process Model involving 12 stages: initial search; debriefing and clarifying goals; data collection and initial write-up; strategy development; consideration of skills and resources; final write-up; competency development; project approval; project implementation; project write-up; project evaluation; and sign-off or recycle. Possible performance projects in each of the five areas are illustrated, and some specific comments about performance projects are presented.  (MM)",

        "description":"This paper focuses on various settings in an intermediate school--the library, the gym, art class, and the homeroom--described from the point of view of a participant observer. It reports the results of a year-long study conducted at Longbranch, an experimental school associated with the Learning Research and Development Center at the University of Pittsburgh, with the aim of relating pupils' activities to the varying school settings in which they take place. Pupils were interviewed to elicit their shared cognitive map of the activities domain. Five major categories emerged: working, helping, making, playing, and fooling around. The first section of the paper offers a description, based on the year-long participant observation, of the various settings in the school. The second  section presents data that give an indication of the actual frequency of the major pupil-named activities and the relative frequencies of these activities in different settings. In the third section, the pupils' cognitive map of their activities is contrasted with the teachers' view of the same activities. There is some difference in the views of the pupils and the teachers. Conclusions drawn are that: (1) pupils play a role in the management of their school life; (2) they do not always behave in conformity with the expectations of the teachers or the planned agenda of the various settings; and (3) their view of and justifications for their own behavior have not been taught to them by their teachers. Appendixes include a weekly schedule of classes for a fourth-grade section, a pupil  behavior observation schedule, and an excerpt of an interview with a fourth-grade teacher. (MM)",

The continuum of actions through which the agency might relate to various aspects of the field are analyzed from functional, cross-functional, and scenario analysis methods. Comparative analyses across functions are directed toward NIE and its role in developing a systems context approach,  toward the leadership requirements for systems building and orchestration of efforts in the field, toward areas of communality and differences between the areas of concern for NIE and field-based groups, and toward nonprocurement strategies the NIE might use in effecting systems development. The report concludes with two scenario analyses examining (1) alternatives to NIE-directed competitive procurements and their implications, and (2) unsolicited procurement mechanisms, and options that might be considered in funding R/D &amp; I activities initiated through the unsolicited route.

        "description":"This paper originated as part of the early phases of internal planning within the National Institute for Education (NIE). A status study was conducted of the existing system of educational research and development (R&amp;D) which (1) provided a framework of information as an initial context for framing policy and (2) examined a major mandate, given to NIE in its creating legislation, to build an effective educational R&amp;D system. Three parallel courses of action were followed to gather information on the status of the R&amp;D system: (1) data collection; (2) development of a larger framework of analysis to guide subsequent work (the present paper); and (3) design of a plan for an administrative unit of NIE charged with monitoring the development of the national R&amp;D system and sponsoring  studies related to its operation. The discussion here, centered on the framework development, divides into three major sections. The first section presents a framework of discourse on modelling. A specialized vocabulary is introduced and basic concepts of monitoring are presented. A &quot;bridge&quot; is provided between the simplified discussion of modelling presented here and a number of models not discussed. The second section presents a set of general criteria for tracing boundaries of educational R&amp;D systems and expands the concept of educational R&amp;D beyond usual acceptation. The third section deals with a specific framework for modelling the R&amp;D system and reporting on it that is sufficiently comprehensive to accommodate most current models of R&amp;D and the great majority of data available from  either large-scale sampling at the national level or research on portions of the system. A concluding section relates the framework to NIE concerns. Appended is the author's view of how R&amp;D fits into the world of knowledge. (MM)",

Many individual differences exist in the area of needs, strengths, and weaknesses related to effective child-rearing and parental competencies. Program goals for parent education would emphasize the following: (1) a primary concern for strengthening the family unit that recognizes and acknowledges the complexity of relationships, needs, and unique goals; (2) public recognition and acknowledgment of the complexity and importance of the parenting role to our present society and future survival; (3) development of strategies that would involve parents in the process of specifying goals and objectives relevant to them, their children, and their hopes and aspirations; (4)  development of materials that are directed to social and emotional goals for children and parents as well as the somewhat narrower school-related goals and concerns; (5) developing training programs for personnel that take into account appropriate strategies for working with families, adults as well as children; and (6) developing strategies that would facilitate the coordination and full utilization of all existing delivery systems for parent education.

Among them are: (1) the symptoms of aging (fat accumulation, lowered basal metabolic rate, loss of muscular strength, reduction in motor fitness, reduction in work capacity, etc.) are not the result of disease but disuse; (2) society conditions the individual to believe that at age forty he is on the way down hill, at fifty he is old, at sixty he should be preparing to die; (3) American men and women could improve their life expectancy from seven to eleven years by practicing good health habits; (4) women are twice as likely as men to exercise to lose weight, but men are more likely to exercise for health reasons or because it makes them feel good. Implications of these views for improving physical  education programs and persuading people to exercise regularly, include: (1) expanding physical education programs into elementary and junior high schools; (2) expanding intramural sports programs for both men and women; (3) concentrating on lifelong sports; (4) improving public facilities for jogging, swimming, bicycling; (5) promoting jogging and weight training for adults; (6) providing information on scheduling exercise into a daily routine; (7) changing the concept of old age as a barrier to exercise; (8) using arguments toward health, vanity, and pleasure as motivation techniques for physical exercise; (9) providing information on kinds and amounts of exercise necessary for developing and maintaining physical fitness. Studies have shown that physical fitness scores (which have not  improved for boys or girls in the last decade) can be raised by giving added emphasis to physical activities in the public school system.

The program was designed to evaluate cardiopulmonary function and improve cardiopulmonary efficiency through exercise programs on the basis of performance feedback from periodic exercise stress test evaluation. Data were collected annually, and CHD risk scores were developed using the following variables: age, serum cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin, relative body weight, cigarette smoking, and ECG patterns. Risk scores for the two groups as a whole did not differ significantly upon entry into  the program, but for each year of participation in the exercise stress test program, scores for the comparison group were significantly greater than those in the test group. Conclusions drawn from the study are (1) probability estimates for quantifying the likelihood of CHD development are beneficial in identifying individuals for examination or treatment and for observing difference in risk among groups of people; and (2) sedentary individuals who participate on a regular basis in an exercise program have a significantly lower probability of developing CHD than individuals who do not participate in such a program.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine what behaviors would be accepted by cooperating teachers in the public schools as indications of success in sixteen broad areas of teaching competence. In order to determine the behaviors most appropriate for judging effectiveness, a modified Delphi survey involving two contacts with the survey population in the form of Probes I and II was conducted. The jury was selected from among those most active in judging teaching competence. Behaviors suggested in Probe I responses were synthesized to form Probe II. Those statements not stated in sentences or phrases using active verbs and those that were obvious duplications were excluded from the second probe. Means and modes were derived for each suggested behavior. Those having both means and  modes of five or above were selected as primary behaviors indicating success in the category for which they were suggested. Each behavior is presented in its appropriate category in rank order, preceded by its mean and followed by its mode. The volume of primary behaviors identified (1,129) renders the lists too cumbersome for actual use in a teacher education or student teaching program, but may be made more manageable in two ways: (1) by determining apparent general areas of behavior identified as being of concern to teachers, and (2) by clustering the suggested behaviors that may be called enabling behaviors or objectives to form terminal objectives. Fifteen such terminal objectives enabling behavior syntheses are presented to illustrate the simplification technique.  (Author/MB)",

        "description":"This experiment on teacher effectiveness focuses on the causal effects of teacher behavior within the classroom recitation. Each of four teachers used one of eight treatments in teaching an ecology course to eight sixth-grade groups. The treatments differed at two levels of teacher structuring, soliciting, and reacting. High structuring consisted of reviewing, stating objectives, outlining the lesson, indicating important points, and summarizing. Low structuring was the absence of these behaviors. High soliciting consisted of asking a large percentage of \"thought\" questions and waiting about three seconds or more after a student's response before calling on a second student. Low soliciting asked a low percentage of \"thought\" questions and waited only a short time after response.  High reacting consisted of praising correct responses, providing reasons for wrong answers, and prompting. Low reacting consisted of using neutral feedback after correct response and not providing reasons for wrong answers. Tests were given to the students before and after the experiment. Results suggest that uncontrolled and unmeasured teacher behaviors and characteristics influenced student achievement and attitude. Analyses indicate that student perceptions mediated the effects of structuring and reacting. A follow-up study showed that merely reading the materials contributed substantially less to student achievement than the combination of reading and teaching. Statistical tables are included. Five appendixes outline the elements of the nine-lesson unit used in the experiment.  (Author/JD)",

A partial-response bias analysis of the same data indicated that there were similarities between the biases of non-response and those of partial-response, but that different subsets of the partial-response data were not necessarily consistent in the kind, amount, or direction of partial-response bias. It was conjectured that similar inconsistencies might be found among nonrespondents, and that descriptors such as \"educational level\" might not be pervasive in characterizing differences between respondents and nonrespondents. Such terms as\"educational level\" probably require reification and objectification as well; when educational level is defined as the number of semesters of coursework taken in certain designated subjects, higher numbers of courses taken are not always positively associated with the tendency to respond. It was also conjectured that there might be a continuum of completeness of responding, from nonrespondent through partial-respondent to full-respondent, with bias existing between any two points on the continuum.

Two basic questions addressed are: (1) what roles did competing interest groups play in the development and utilization of statewide assessment? and (2) has the controversy over the Educational Assessment Program (EAP) changed the impact of any of these groups on the future development of assessment policy in New Jersey? The paper follows the standard presentation of a case study analysis. First, the setting of the controversy is examined by tracing the development and application of statewide testing in New Jersey from 1970 to the present. The primary sources in this effort were court decisions in Robinson v. Cahill and Chappell v. Commissioner of Education and newspaper accounts. Second, the actors involved in  the controversy over statewide testing are delineated, and from interviews with these actors their positions on the use of EAP to evaluate education in New Jersey are related. Third, the role of these groups are explored in four events--the reappointment of Carl Marburger as Commissioner of Education, the Chappel v. Commissioner of Education case, the legislation of statewide minimum standards--in order to ascertain how they influenced the development and use of statewide tests. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the consequences of the EAP controversy on future assessment activities and the effectiveness of the EAP. (Author/RC)",

Test forms were administered to 48,000 California drivers license applicants. The variables analyzed were subject's sex, age, education, annual mileage, and prior six year driving record in relationship to test form and item scores. New test forms were created and were compared to DMV forms. For each test form, the highest test score correlation obtained was with applicant's education, although education had no relationship to accidents or convictions. For all DMV test forms combined, correlations of total scores with  driving record variables were all significant, indicating renewal applicants with better prior driving records obtained higher test scores. Original drivers license applicants scored lower than renewal applicants. HSRI items and test forms were more related to applicant's biographical variables than were DMV items and test forms. Forms created with HSRI items from the initial HSRI item pool screening were less related to driving record than DMV forms. Final forms, created with items that were the most accident related, were no more or less related to driving record than DMV forms. A summary is appended. (Author/RC)",

        "description":"Due to the small samples and variance of the Tests of General Educational Development (GED) requirements in the reported research, it is difficult to generalize the obtained results in counseling situations. It is the purpose of this study to set up multiple cutoff norms for the General Aptitude Test Battery (GATB) using the statistical techniques employed in GATB research. A secondary purpose is the verification on a larger sample of the results obtained in three reported studies in Missouri, Wisconsin, and Nevada. The analysis showed that the multiple cutoff battery norms G (General Ability)-90, V (Verbal Aptitude)-85, and Q (Clerical Perception) -95 coupled with special regard to high G and V scores can be very useful in the prediction of success on the GED with the Minnesota  requirements, and useful although to a somewhat lesser degree, for the higher Missouri requirement. This study has duplicated some aspects of the results of the three reported studies, in that the G and V aptitudes have the best predictive possibilities for use with the GED, and that scores of 110 or greater on either of these aptitudes indicate almost definite passage. It is not reasonable, obviously, to discourage GED attempts by persons scoring less than ll0 on these aptitudes, and observation of this score should only be made in combination with the aptitude battery norms.

        "description":"The purpose of this dissertation is to provide evidence bearing on the question of the influence of the grades students receive on their ratings of the college teachers who gave them those grades. Specifically, certain characteristics of the grade distribution within each course section are evaluated as predictors of the students' ratings of the teacher of that course section. Multivariate techniques were employed to evaluate data across an entire university. Over 30,000 anonymous student ratings of 2,360 course sections were collected after students had received final course grades, and without student or administrator knowledge that the ratings would be used in the study. Factor analysis was used to reduce the eight-item rating instrument to a single criterion variable.  Subsequently, stepwise multiple regression analysis was used, both to reduce an initial battery of predictors to an optimally reduced subset, and to test the incremental importance of certain grading variables as predictors of the criterion.. The primary implication of the study is that there is a relationship between grades and ratings, but it only accounts for about nine percent of the variance in the ratings. There is a significant bias, but factors other than grades must also be influencing student ratings. Whether or not these other factors are valid measures of teaching effectiveness remains to be determined, but one seemingly invalid factor (the grading bias) has been identified. (Author/RC)",

The Nursery School Leadership Observation Schedule (NSLOS) was so devised as to cover all the relevant behavior patterns which could be recorded within a five-minute observation period. The Nursery School Leadership Rating Scale (NSLRS) consisted of the same set of behavior units as the NSLOS in  order to secure correlations of the two schedules. Each scale was a seven-point graphic series. The correlation of the observed and rated behaviors fulfilled the function of adding or subtracting further confidence in the validity of the instruments. The findings of the observation recorded on the NSLOS showed a relatively high and significant intraclass reliability among four observers. However, the ratings as graded by the raters on the NSLRS indicated that the intraclass reliability among the raters was high and significant, but the intraclass reliability of the fellowship ratings was comparatively lower. Possible explanations are offered. It can be assumed that the NSLOS and the NSLRS are in general valid and reliable for the measurement of leadership characteristics among nursery  school children. Both instruments are appended. (RC)",

        "description":"The development of environmental process measures marks a significant step forward in the assessment of environment quality. As Bloom (1964) predicted, these measures have made it possible to more clearly delineate the relationship between environment and development. Although factorial structure of many process instruments is open to question, there is evidence of substantial empirical validity for most. Greater attention now needs to be paid to establishing the validity of process instruments for specific purposes such as screening, diagnosis, and program evaluation. Environmental process measures have been used with a variety of age and cultural groups. Most of the studies done outside the United States were not reported in this paper. Adaptations of instruments for use with  other groups should be made with caution with emphasis given to establishing the appropriateness of each item for use with a particular age group in a particular social context. While much additional work needs to be done in developing good environmental process measures, it is concluded that these measures can be usefully employed for a variety of research and applied purposes. Particular attention should be given to designing short, easy to administer instruments for use in educational and clinical settings. Significant improvements in research instruments may be more dependent on the development of more adequate theories about the relationship between environment and development. In both cases, the use of environmental measures is likely to make a substantial contribution to the  adequacy of the information obtained. (Author/RC)",

It defines the requirements of effective formative evaluation as (1) a link between evaluation and decision making (provided by continuous assessment and feedback), (2) involvement of all who will be affected by decisions based on evaluation, (3) a theoretical framework to support the evaluation, and (4) close attention to the school's social and political setting. On the basis of this discussion the paper suggests a survey-feedback approach which provides objective information and a process involving all  relevant constituencies in a dialogue with natural work groups in the school to define school problems and develop strategies for their solution. This formative evaluation strategy is aimed at institutionalizing problem solving in a school, and in this regard the paper examines the problems and prospects of the approach. (Author/RC)",

        "author":["Brumet, Michael E."],
        "description":"Bayesian statistical inference is unfamiliar to many educational evaluators. While the classical model is useful in educational research, it is not as useful in evaluation because of the need to identify solutions to practical problems based on a wide spectrum of information. The reason Bayesian analysis is effective for decision making is that it defines probability as a measure of opinion or belief, rather than as long-term frequency. Defining probability as a measure of opinion or belief enables the Bayesian investigator to consider a wider range of information than is possible with the traditional model. Personal expertise, logical analysis, and soft data from a wide variety of sources serve to shape opinion about a state of nature, with experimental data providing additional  information either for or against the prior opinion of the evaluator. In classical statistics, prior knowledge or opinion is ignored. However, when practical decisions must be made the Bayesian stresses that all knowledge should be brought to bear on the problem rather than just an isolated set of data. Because of the decision-making orientation of the evaluator, the Bayesian model should be considered as an alternative to classical inference. Since the Bayesian model views probability as a measure of opinion rather than as a long-term frequency, the statistical requirements for it are actually greater than for the classical statistician. Use of a wider range of distributions than with classical statistics demands more statistical skills than many evaluators currently possess. However,  the questions raised by the Bayesian model are useful even if the model is not totally adopted. (Author/RC)",

But the relationship between these traditional skills and grades appears not to have changed. It is speculated that, despite the increase in average grades, the reliability of the grades awarded by college professors has not diminished. If either grades or test scores had decreased in reliability, then the correlations between the two would probably have decreased. The test score reliability is carefully maintained. Whatever the case, the impact of grade inflation and score decline can probably be anticipated. Already  there is evidence that grades are beginning to deflate. And with the wide-spread public concern about test score declines, it may be expected that these will begin to level off and even to rise in the next few years.",

        "description":"A summary is provided of the rationale for questioning the applicability of classical reliability measures to criterion referenced tests; an extension of the classical theory of true and error scores to incorporate a theory of dichotomous decisions; a presentation of the mean split-half coefficient of agreement, a single-administration test index designed to measure the internal consistency of dichotomous classifications; and information concerning the properties, under varying conditions, of this new coefficient and several other single-administration test indices, as well as their interrelationships. Simulated data were used to provide answers to questions about the behavior of coefficient beta relative to variations in score distribution, criterion level, number of examinees,  number of items, and certain basic test statistics. It was determined that coefficient beta increases as the number of items increases, but in a manner different from that predicted by the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula. It was also shown that the value of the coefficient increases as the bulk of scores departs from the criterion cutoff. Relationships between coefficient beta and other test indices are presented. Most prominent among these is the indication that for unimodal score distributions, coefficient beta and Livingston's criterion referenced reliability coefficient have similar ranges of value and fluctuations over criterion level, whereas this relationship does not hold for bimodal distributions, since coefficient beta is sensitive to the mode(s) of the score distribution while  Livingston's coefficient is sensitive to the test mean.

        "description":"This report examines how selection fairness is influenced by the item characteristics of a selection instrument in terms of its distribution of item difficulties, level of item discrimination, and degree of item bias. Computer simulation was used in the administration of conventional ability tests to a hypothetical target population consisting of a minority and a majority subgroup. Fairness was evaluated by three indices which reflect the degree of differential validity, errors in prediction (Cleary's model) and proportion of applicants exceeding a selection cutoff (Thorndike's model). Major findings were: (1) tests with a uniform distribution of difficulties had fairness properties generally superior to tests having a peaked distribution of item difficulties; (2) subgroup  validity differences can be expected to occur when test items are biased against one of the subgroups; (3) when differential prediction is used, the Thorndike model reflects varying degrees of unfairness due to item bias and other test characteristics, while the Cleary and validity models do not; and (4) differential prediction provides fairer selection than the use of majority prediction only, regardless of the internal characteristics of the test, although substantial degrees of unfairness still exist under certain test item configurations. It was concluded that the internal characteristics of a selection instrument will affect the fairness of test scores in specific applications and that further research is needed to delineate which testing strategies and/or item characteristics are  optimal in reducing unfairness.

        "description":"The Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills (CTBS/S) was the nationally standardized, norm-referenced test selected for the Idaho Statewide Testing Program for 1976-77. It provided basic skills measures in reading, language, mathematics, total battery, reference skills, science and social studies. Students in the 4th, 8th and 11th grades from 51 of Idaho's 115 school districts were selected on a random basis for participation in the testing program. The sampling procedure provided a sample representative of the state's students both by geographic location and by size of school attended. Analysis of the data compared the mean (average) performance of Idaho students on the CTBS/S measures to the mean performance of the national norm group, and compared Idaho's upper and lower students  to their counterparts in the national norm group. Out of the analysis came three major findings: (1) The mean performance of Idaho's students at the 4th, 8th and 11th grades was either equal to or better than the national norm on each of the 19 CTBS/S total scores for reading, language, mathematics, battery, reference skills, science and social studies. (2) On 4l of the 43 CTBS/S scores reported at the three grade levels, the mean performance of Idaho's students was either equal to or better than the national norm. The two exceptions were 4th grade spelling and 4th grade mathematics computation. (3) Idaho's lower achieving students in the 4th, 8th and 11th grades consistently performed better on the CTBS/S than their national counterpart, with the exception of 4th grade spelling and 4th  grade mathematics computation. The relationship of Idaho's upper achieving students to their national counterpart varied from test to test and across the three grade levels. (RC)",

        "description":"This state-of-the-art paper is one of several volumes which describe the characteristics, quality, and costs of services to severely mentally retarded, severely emotionally disturbed, deaf-blind, and severely multiply handicapped clients age 21 and under. Part I of the volume consists of a subjective distillation of the concepts and research reported in Part II. It discusses many of the issues for which documentation and research support are later provided. It also includes an historical context for the three major categories of handicap and treats some issues on which little research is available. The final section of the first part presents some of the speculations as to the direction that provision of care for the severely handicapped will be taking in the future. Part II is  the research review containing five sections. The first four represent the handicapping conditions of interest to this study: severe mental retardation, severe emotional disturbance, deaf-blindness, and severe multiple handicaps. The research is discussed under the same basic rubrics wherever possible. For the three major handicap categories (mental retardation, emotional disturbance, and deaf-blindness), there are the following subsections: problems of definition and classification; prevalence studies; research and demonstration; measurement; guides to providers; and bibliographies. The treatment of the fourth category, multiple handicaps, is much shorter and has fewer subsections. The fifth and last section covers research studies which are concerned with more than one type of handicap.  (RC)",

This volume includes the development of data collection instruments and a mail survey of potential providers of services to severely handicapped children and youth. The survey was conducted for the purpose of creating a pool of providers from which 100 facilities could be selected for site visits. From the 1,550 respondents to the mail survey, 100 providers were selected who serve severely handicapped clients aged 21 or under. This selection was accomplished by grouping the respondents into eight sampling categories according to the number of clients they served. Providers were also selected based upon  whether they served a majority of clients who are either severely mentally retarded, severely emotionally disturbed, severely multiply handicapped, or deaf-blind. Some providers were selected who served a mixed severely handicapped population. The volume contains discussions of the procedures and methodology used in conducting the study; characteristics of the 100 providers; client observations; costs of services; the relationship of expenditure and quality; a summary of major findings; and specific policy questions and suggestions based on the present data base and/or the expertise of project staff.

After participating in the series, youth demonstrated more knowledge about nutrition-related activities, and exhibited a dramatic increase in their awareness of 4-H. The series generated only minimal changes in the nutrition behavior of youth; while those who viewed the series appeared to eat more for breakfast, their selections from the basic food groups seemed to remain unchanged. After participating in the series, youth in all three grades tended to select fewer empty  calorie items when given free choice on a menu containing a large number of foods. As measured by reading ability, the series worked well with both the good student and the poorer student. While the series appeared to be effective with youth in all three grades, overall the program had a somewhat stronger impact on fourth and fifth graders than it did on sixth grade youth. The comic workbook and viewing situation appeared to be important variables; although at-home viewing was good, in-school viewing generated larger changes; and while the series worked well without the comic workbook, Mulligan Stew was more effective with the comic.

This volume is a detailed elaboration of the study findings as well as a description of the study design, instrumentation, and procedures. The study consisted of three general segments: (1) impact evaluation of the series on children; (2) case studies of delivery system and associated cost data; and (3) content analysis. The impact evaluation explored the hypotheses that children who viewed the series would exhibit positive changes in knowledge about nutrition and changes in nutrition-related behaviors and that these children would show an increased  amount of awareness of and interest in 4-H. Although the impact evaluation focused on children, information was also elicited from their teachers. The case studies segment focused on the distribution system associated with the program, i.e., delivery and costs. While the delivery system, organizational arrangements, and associated cost data were not critical to the impact study, they did serve to provide context data for other purposes. A content analysis of the films was conducted to assess the nutrition information contained in the films, the pedagogic approach used, and the production techniques employed. The three major sections of this volume examine each of the aforementioned segments separately. A concluding section presents a summary of major findings from each of the evaluation  segments and recommendations based on these findings. (RC)",

The obtained relations between the Moral Judgment Scale and the Sexual Moral Judgment Scale replicated previous research. The Objective Moral Judgment Scale was not found to validly assess the Kohlberg stages. The maturity of Moral Judgment Scale scores were strongly related to the subjects' classification on the Kohlberg stages, and the scale appears to offer a reliable, quickly scored, and valid index of mature moral thought, although the scale's continuous  scores do not permit clear stage classification.

The research-instructor prepared an evaluation form for students to use in subjective grading of other students' performances on 12 points. The evaluators also furnished numerical scores of their overall impressions of the performances. It was found that students gave lower grades when using the evaluation instrument than on the general impression. Students also  graded their friends higher by both methods. The study indicated that a more realistic evaluation can be obtained by using an instrument requiring evaluation of several specific points rather than basing the grade on a general overall impression. It was concluded than when an instructor wants assistance in subjective evaluations he may use student evaluations if an effective evaluation instrument is prepared and the students' evaluations are averaged with those of the instructor. Appendices include the instrument used, analysis sheets, summary of scores, and summary analysis sheets. (MF)",

The Syracuse Environmental Awareness Test was used to measure both cognitive and affective changes. In the experimental group the contract plan of evaluation was utilized. Subjects were evaluated on the number of course objectives which were completed satisfactorily. In the control group, a traditional type of student evaluation was used. The students were evaluated on the scores they received on three examinations. Although there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups when compared, there were several factors which gave credence to the hypothesis  that the traditional method was superior to the contract method. First, there was a significant increase in cognitive knowledge for the control group between the pretest and the posttest, while in the experimental group there was no significant increase. Second, the experimental group had a larger percentage of Health Science majors than did the control group. If it is valid to assume that Health Science majors would be more highly motivated to do well in a course in their major field of study; then the experimental group should have demonstrated greater increases in cognitive and affective behavior.

Based on the various analyses, a profile of the individual student most likely to be a high achiever has emerged. While the profile does not hold true in all cases, students exhibiting these characteristics seem to generally exhibit high achievement as measured by the ITBS: female, majority race, family not eligible for free hot lunches, has attended only one or two schools by the time they are enrolled in sixth grade, living with both natural parents, the father has completed at least some college, teacher ratings are high in  virtually all areas, the number of brothers and sisters is fairly low, and the student has a higher than average IQ. Overall this study tends to confirm the findings of previous studies which indicate that the factors students bring with them to school are more influential in attaining high achievement, as measured by the ITBS, than any factors over which the school has control and which were included in this study.

This information is primarily summative in nature and is designed to help those who may be considering the system as a training tool. Upon completion of the system, the PETC-I trainee is expected to be able to work with small groups to assist in improving process skills such as goal setting, problem solving, communicating, influencing, and decision making. The series is based on the rationale that educators with these process abilities can help schools continue to grow in organizational effectiveness by facilitating development of a climate supporting  application of the process skills. The materials of the system include training strategies and procedures plus participant instructional materials. The PETC-I training consists of a two-week workshop. The first week is designed to familiarize participants (skills trainers) with the skills, concepts, and knowledge needed for conducting training in group process skills. The skills trainers also are acquainted with the Group Process Skills (GPS) workshop materials and instructional strategies. The second week consists of a 35-hour practicum experience in which teams of skills trainers (usually in groups of three) conduct a GPS workshop. (RC)",

        "description":"1973 Florida legislation requires each community college to evaluate the performance of former students in the activities for which they were prepared by the college. This project developed and implemented a follow-up system for community college graduates in Associate in Arts programs. The system assessed former students' achievement of the goals of the academic program for which they were prepared by the community college, in performance or competency-based terms. Specifically, the system should provide means for determining whether the goals of transfer programs, as defined by the community colleges, are being realized. It should also provide data for improvement of the program and/or curriculum where necessary. The results of the implementation of this model indicates that it  is a viable model that will be expanded at Hillsborough Community College to include other programs. This model may also be adopted by other community colleges in Florida, and nationally. (RC)",

This booklet explains the general provisions of the act, including the following: voter qualifications, civil suits and attorney's fees, and the criminal provisions. In addition to the general protections that apply throughout the United States, the Voting Rights Act contains special provisions that apply only in the States and localities that meet certain conditions and statistical tests spelled out in the law. These special provisions are explained in the booklet. The discussion focuses on the four different coverage formulas or &quot;triggers&quot; by which the  special provisions of the act may be applied to jurisdictions throughout the country. The original Voting Rights Act of 1965 provides for three kinds of direct Federal involvement in the electoral processes of jurisdictions These provide for the authority for the use of Federal examiners and Federal observers and for the requirement of Federal clearance of changes in a covered jurisdiction's election laws and practices. These provisions along with the minority language provisions are also explained. (Author/AM)",

There was improved achievement in basic academic areas such as communications, skills and math. There was a reduction in the over-all drop-out rate at Hilo High school, and there was more student participation in school and community activities. Among the recommendations made for the future are the following: An effort must be made to stabilize staffing assignments; Serious consideration must be given to the type of personnel  appointed to the staff; The 50 question student evaluation questionnaire or other similar instrument should be administered in September and in May to determine value changes among Hilo High and SWS students. Finally procedures should be implemented to improve the relationship between the SWS staff and the Hilo High School administration. (Author/AM)",

Voucher recipients were allowed up to six weeks in which to decide about a training occupation, locate an appropriate school, and make arrangements for enrollment. Relationships between the WIN staff and WIN clients were restructured: Whereas staff members had given directive counseling to their clients, they now gave information and personal support in a nondirective manner. Three quarters of the voucher recipients were women. One hundred fifty four voucher recipients were interviewed when they committed their vouchers to training schools (i.e. in the commitment phase). Equivalent questions were asked of 163  trainees who did not have vouchers. Responses of voucher recipients and trainees without vouchers were compared. These responses dealt with such topics as: the characteristics of institutional trainees; the trainee's predispositions toward occupations when they entered WIN and the ways in which institutional training was presented to them initially; the extent to which trainees engaged in decision-making about participation in institution training as well as about training occupations and schools; the occupations and schools chosen; and, the factors which influenced decisions in the Portland WIN institutionalized training program. However, the changes that did occur in the commitment phase were judged desirable. (Author/JM)",

This basic difference in cultures, when not considered carefully, makes it impossible to increase the educational performance of blacks over an extended period of time. Basic tenets of black culture are explained in terms of eleven criteria sociologists use to define culture. These criteria are: history, life styles, society within the culture, communications, work occupations, sexism, time, child rearing procedures, recreation, protection. Various manifestations of black culture are discussed and include clothing, music, language, body language,  concepts such as good and evil, and black middle class behavior. This study indicates that &quot;If blacks are to be taught and educated it is imperative that methodology, processes and procedures that are buried in the cultural aspects of ones being be considered.

An analysis of pre- and post-test data indicates that students in the reading programs made satisfactory progress; however, in many cases, the student gains did not reach the expectancy gains as established by the local school district officials. An analysis of pre- and post-test data indicates that students in the mathematics programs made satisfactory progress. Student gains exceeded the expectancy objectives as established. Data reported by school district officials revealed that mean deficiencies were greater at the high  school and junior high school level than the primary or intermediate school level. (Author/AM)",

The project participants included fourteen elementary schools. The project was evaluated in various ways. First, the Percentage Gain Study Design was conducted to  determine whether or not the gains in achievement by the various components reached expected levels as stated in the project proposal. An evaluation of the program variables (i.e. Home visitation program), and an evaluation of process variables (i.e. monitoring components of programs) were also part of the evaluation design.

Of the 845 public schools and 191 private schools in the state 697 provided services under Title I. The state Title I staff conducted a pilot evaluation of selected school districts in Mississippi. A comparison of reading and mathematics revealed that students made higher gains in mathematics than in reading in most instances; however, an analysis of expenditures revealed that more Title I funds were spent for reading than for  mathematics. Some concern was expressed that disadvantaged children tend to fare better at learning number concepts as opposed to learning reading skills. (Author/AM)",

According to the paper, historically, the neighborhood school has lost its position as a viable means of carrying out the necessary educational functions. At the same time, the neighborhood school concept has been used as a tool at various times in American history to slow down or halt proposed social reforms, such as the desegregation movement of present times. Many educators and social commentators have noted that the concept is deficient when viewed from the perspective of its intrinsic educational value. Regardless of this fact, the concept has been perpetuated because it functions as a barrier to integration and busing, and because it has been supported  by several contemporary political figures, including a former President of the United States, Richard Nixon.

The argument is made that the religion of the poor contributes in significant and positive ways to the processes of identity formation and to the development and maintenance of cultural values and norms. The immediate social environment of the religious service provides a context in which identities are dynamically and dramatically conferred, developed and reinforced. With regard to the larger social environment, the religion of the poor offers a challenge to the hierarchical structure of the general status system and offers an understanding of tragedy and suffering that is frequently lacking in  the sensibilities of the religious nonpoor.

Project participants developed a plan with four major components: A consortium of  medical record baccalaureate and associate arts degree programs in the northwest region, workshops, newsletters, and an advisory committee. The plan was to undertake the project at a regional level. The media included correspondence, research, development of guidelines for use in gathering and comparing information, and making a comparative study of a local community college medical record technician program with the Seattle University program. Curriculum revision did result from the project and a curriculum ladder has been implemented at Seattle University (SU). Medical record technicians who have associate arts degrees can transfer into the program and receive full credit for 90 hours of their associate arts degree work plus approximately 10 credits towards the 45 credit hours of the  professional health information curriculum at SU.

Two questionnaires were used. The first, a status survey, contained 211 questions regarding aspects of consumer education programs. Significant response differences were noted among (1) various types of secondary schools, (2) schools that do not offer any consumer education; that offer separate courses only; that offer only consumer education components integrated in regular course offerings; and that offer both separate and integrated courses, and (3) schools with varying enrollments, annual expenditures per pupil,  and percentages of minority students. The second questionnaire, a criteria survey, contained 18 criteria which were largely based on a review and synthesis of criteria and standards for consumer education programs already developed in a number of other States. Analysis of data included differences in the responses of various types of secondary schools. Results of both questionnaires are reported in tables and questionnaires are included in the appendix.

In order to examine the possibilities of achieving stable ratings in some suggested job aspects (categories), a work operation (shortwood logging) is analyzed into 17 units which in turn are described in 10 aspects by means of ratings from 140 forestry teachers in the Swedish gymnasium/school. Five of the 10 aspects (work aspects) refer directly to the job while the remaining five aspects (pedagogical aspects) concern the students' possibilities of receiving natural feedback in the learning situation. A profile is presented for each aspect showing the medians for all the 17 units. The structure of these profiles is shown to be more  stable for the work aspects than for the pedagogical aspects when the size of the judging group is varied. The correlations between work aspects and their corresponding pedagogical aspects are found to be negative. The author concludes with a suggestion for the use of the results for educational planning.

Data was collected (through surveys) from public secondary schools; district directors of vocational education; community colleges regarding personnel recruitment policy, hiring policy, sources of personnel; preservice and inservice teacher education programs; and the utilization of teacher education  institutions. Results showed that with one important exception, supply and demand for vocational and technical education personnel in Florida are fairly well balanced, and that current productivity of teacher education institutions in Florida is not creating an oversupply of vocational and technical teachers. The health and public service program area proved to be the one serious exception to the general finding of equilibrium between supply and demand forces. The study also indicated that (a) inservice programs are not distributed in proportion to vocational teaching personnel, (b) most inservice activities are of a professional rather than technical nature, (c) most inservice activities were offered for more than one vocational program area, and (d) funding for inservice activities was  not equally distributed throughout the State.

The project focused on two objectives: (1) Compilation of self-study programs leading directly to certification or licensing, and (2) development of general and specific information about licensing and certification procedures for those occupations in which vocational competence is determined through examination. The survey was conducted by mail, soliciting information on both independent study courses leading to licensure or certification and the licensure or certification procedures themselves. Information was solicited from State governmental agencies, home study schools, colleges and universities,  companies, labor organizations, professional and trade organizations, and other groups and individuals. The most consistent finding was the general inconsistency among both licensing and certification agencies across States in their procedures, policies of reciprocity, and prerequisites. Information collected showed a disarray of licensing and certification procedures and policies that must be seen as impenetrable to those seeking direct ways of demonstrating their occupational competence. Evaluation of the information collected revealed that very few independent study courses lead to recognition of achievement through award of certificate, license, or academic degree. Tentative conclusions derived from the project work are discussed in detail. (TA)",

Subjects were 519 students representing 12 programs of study (with greatest representations coming from auto mechanics, building trades, and electricity/electronics) from six vocational centers in Maine. Three types of data were gathered: (1) Information about program of enrollment, expected job, retrospective vocational aspirations, and feelings about school gathered by an eight-item questionnaire developed by the authors and completed by the subjects; (2) indicators of academic and intellectual abilities  (grade averages and scores on an ability test administered in conjunction with the project); and (3) standardized measures of interests, values, and attitudes related to career development gathered with the Work Values Inventory (WVI), the Ohio Vocational Interest Survey (OVIS), and the Career Maturity Inventory (CMI). Results were found to support the hypothesis that standardized tests differentiate among students in various vocational training programs.

        "description":"The Career Exploration/Industrial Arts program guide is based on experiences at two Oregon junior high schools. The program is unique in two respects: the learning is student-managed and the facility is a general open shop in which students plan and develop projects in a variety of activity areas. Student management consists of a notebook kept by each student of his activities and progress, allowing student experience in setting and achieving goals and in accounting for expenses. This system also saves many hours of recordkeeping for the instructor and provides for periodic assessment of students' work. Student-managed learning is reinforced through self-instruction when feasible. The open shop facility accommodates wood, metals, and drafting areas plus a range of other  activities. Each activity area is self-contained with all tools, supplies, and instructional materials for the area. The open facility also increases opportunities for career exploration. The first third of the volume includes information on establishing such a facility by remodeling, new construction, and furnishing and installation. The second third consists of a series of worksheets for planning special projects. Appendixes, the last third, contain plan sheets for 10 basic project areas and student management system forms.

        "description":"This developmental project with a research component was initiated at the Laurel County Vocational School with the major objective of determining if 2-hour instructional blocks could be operated in programs enrolling only secondary students. Subobjectives involved data gathering and statistical analyses on (1) student achievement, (2) ratings of instruction/instructors by students, and (3) ratings of performance of various factors by teachers. During the 1973-74 school year, class schedules were changed from three hours to two hours in length in the instructional areas of automotive mechanics, carpentry, drafting, industrial electricity, and air conditioning/refrigeration. Major concerns included scheduling problems between the county high school and the vocational school, the  increased work load of the vocational school staff, and equipment use and repair necessitated by enrollment of new students. The overall conclusion was that the five program areas offered can be taught on the 2-hour block. The teacher's attitudes remained stable overall. Evaluations of teachers and instruction by students did not vary significantly even though the five program area teachers' ratings were not exactly alike. Student achievement was overall acceptable with significant increases in achievement test scores being noted. Although no specific products were developed as part of the project, other schools would be offered available information and assistance in revision of their traditional 3-hour programs. (HD)",

The opening section outlines the rationale for financial aid, the research design, the characteristics of the participants, and the urban setting in which they lived. The second section assesses the influence of financial aid and employment assistance on different types of postrelease behavior. Reflecting a review of court records, as well as the results of prerelease and monthly postrelease interviews, this section explores first- and second-year arrest and conviction rates, employment experience, and the contrasting  lifestyles of financial aid recipients and nonrecipients. The third section provides three composite portraits of &quot;typical&quot; participants and traces their experiences in the 13 weeks following release. The final section offers a summary analysis and some concluding observations concerning the possible role of financial aid in reducing the economic and social costs of criminal recidivism. The appendixes combine the research design and a sample prerelease interview form. (HD)",

(The scope of those studies covered seven major southern SMSA's--Atlanta, Birmingham, Houston, Louisville, Memphis, Miami, and New Orleans--and sought to determine and analyze the patterns of black employment with the ultimate purpose of arriving at policy recommendations aimed at the sources of the problems.), (2) to determine whether migration patterns for Southern SMSA's have widened income and occupational discrepancies between blacks and whites in them, and (3) to determine whether the income and  occupational gap between the races widens as the educational level rises, as is commonly supposed, and if it does, if the discrepancy is becoming more or less pronounced. After the introductory section, which gives the background of the project, the seven SMSA's are discussed in separate chapters, which cover the sociological, economic, and political characteristics of the cities, the black and white 1970 census data relating to education, occupational status, and earnings, and the educational and occupational status of in-migrants to the SMSA's. The report concludes with a summary which focuses on the extent to which the analyses and conclusions of the NES study are modified by the 1970 census data. (SH)",

        "description":"This volume brings together the thirteen papers delivered at the Conference on Improving Labor Market Information for Youth, conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor and Temple University in 1974. The papers focus on assessing the role of labor market information in the process of helping to endow young people with what they need to transact with the school-work connection. The beginning papers discuss several of the issues surrounding high unemployment among youth, followed by a factual review of where the United States is and where it is expected to be in the immediate years ahead in some important dimensions of the population, labor force, and employment trends relating to youth. The latter series of papers contain a discussion of the potentialities of improving labor market  information for young people, not only in the kind of information but in the manner in which it is made available. Titles of the papers are &quot;The Rites of Passage,&quot;&quot;Approaches to the Transition from School to Work,&quot;&quot;New Developments in Career Education: A National Perspective,&quot;&quot;Proposal for Educational Work Experience,&quot;&quot;The New Worker--Implications of Demographic Trends,&quot;&quot;Youth Employment and Career Entry,&quot;&quot;Youth Employment Opportunities: Changes in the Relative Position of College and High School Graduates,&quot;&quot;Improved Labor Market Information and Career Choice: Issues in Program Evaluation,&quot;&quot;Improved Job Information: Its Impact on Long-Run Labor Market Experience,&quot;&quot;Occupational Data: The Foundation of a Labor Market Information System,&quot;&quot;Application of Information Systems to  Career and Job Choice,&quot;&quot;The California Experience,&quot; and &quot;Organization of a Career Information System: The Oregon Approach.&quot; (SH)",

        "description":"Upper Iowa University implemented a staff development project to increase teacher competency in the education of adult students with learning disabilities. Participants were teachers of adult education classes throughout the State. The need for a staff development project for teachers with students at Level I (the concrete, beginning level) was revealed through requests by the teachers to the area coordinators for materials and techniques for working with students at this level. The project provided methods, materials, and teaching techniques in all areas of the curriculum with emphasis on reading. Characteristics of the learning disabled student were examined and commercially available tests to help diagnose Level I skill needs were demonstrated. Information was also  disseminated through handouts, overhead projection, slides and cassette recordings, books, participant involvement, demonstration items, and specific take-home products. The project was carried out in four phases. The first phase was devoted to research and materials accumulation. The next three phases were workshops spaced approximately two months apart. Descriptions of the three workshops, other aspects of the project, and project outcomes are included in this report. (SH)",

        "description":"This report examines the economic effects of formal military vocational training and on-the-job training acquired while working in a military specialty. The hypothesis advanced is that investments in different types of military training have a significant effect on productivity and thus on wages if individuals are employed in civilian occupations in which they are able to use skills acquired during their military services. The findings of the study support the economic and statistical significance of military training in explaining differences in the postservice wages of separates. (Formal vocational training in the military tends to have a significantly positive effect on postservice wages if individuals enter civilian occupations related to their military specialties. On the  other hand, on-the-job training in military specialties parallel to the current civilian occupations of separatees does not have a significantly positive effect on the postservice opportunities of separatees.) The report also offers evidence on several related issues. Using data on the type and amount of both civilian and military formal and informal vocational training acquired by individuals in the sample, the study evaluates the extent to which the returns to various types of training were overestimated or underestimated by previous studies. The appendixes provide information on sample selection and data, characteristics of separatees by employment status, and characteristics of separatees by occupational groups. A selected bibliography is also included. (WL)",

        "description":"As part of a program to test the feasibility of vouchering institutional vocational training in the Work Incentive Program (WIN) in Portland, Oregon, previous findings from a March, 1975 study of 27 public and private schools in which WIN participants were enrolled were checked against the experiences of 113 students surveyed in the summer and fall of 1975, after they had completed or left the program. (Selected data from interviews with vouchered trainees are presented on such areas as admission procedures, counseling and guidance, placement assistance, evaluation of instructional staff, and overall satisfaction.) In both the public and private schools the majority of the students indicated that they did not have the bad experiences sometimes encountered by vocational trainees,  gave their instructors relatively high ratings, and were either highly or moderately satisfied with their training. The conclusions of the earlier study are essentially supported, although the data reflect some weaknesses of the private relative to the public schools. Private schools were rated slightly lower by the students, largely due to unfulfilled expectations from private recruitment practices and advertising. It also appears that private schools need to upgrade the quality of their instructional staffs. An executive summary of the earlier school report is appended. (MF)",

        "description":"Research was conducted to determine how well the Management Audit Survey (MAS), an evaluation system used in the U.S. Employment Service (ES), could predict various ES performance criteria. (The purpose of the system is to give all levels of management an analysis and review of management procedures and of certain organizational climate characteristics to stimulate higher levels of performance through better use of human resources.) Effects of management practices on productivity of ES offices were examined through employee responses to the 100-item MAS questionnaire. The primary statistical analyses were done on 265 offices from six States. Fifteen criterion measures and fifteen control scores were examined to assess productivity of the ES system. Six criterion measures were  identified as being most relevant for analyzing ES performance. Two control scores--workload (applicants available/ES positions) and UI claimants as a percentage of applicants available--explained the most variance on selected criteria. Workload had a positive impact on placement per position and a negative impact on percent of applicants placed. Unreliability of criterion measures and effects of control variables made prediction of ES performance criteria with the MAS scores difficult. The MAS scores with the most significant validities in predicting ES performance criteria were operational efficiency, performance, feedback, work satisfaction, morale, and satisfaction with pay. Study results indicated that further research is needed, but that management practices assessed by the MAS play  a significant role in the productivity of the Employment Service. Included in the report are background research reviews on organizational climate and effectiveness and a description of previous research of the MAS. (Author/WL)",

A cover letter and questionnaire (in card form) were mailed to the 667 dropouts of occupational programs (with pre-paid, pre-addressed envelopes for return). Responses after a second mailing were 25%. A telephone followup raised the response to 48%. Responses provided eight categories of  reasons for withdrawal from school and eight categories of reasons for not enrolling.

The area chosen for review in the project was Planning Region Four, which consists of seven northeast Florida counties. The methodology developed for the study consisted of a five part procedure: (1) An overall economic analysis of the planning region and its potential for economic and population growth was set forth, (2) alternative  methodologies for projecting the demand for labor in a given urban area were developed and tested, (3) a methodology for projecting the supply of labor by occupation for an urban area was developed and tested, (4) procedures were developed for meshing forecasts of occupational demand and supply for urban areas, so that prospective shortages and surpluses of manpower could be readily identified, and (5) extensive field surveys were conducted of the Vocational-Technical Education (VTE) programs, facilities, teachers, students, and administrators. The most important conclusion drawn from the study's field work was the existence of vocational program unevenness within Region Four. Unique results were claimed by the study in three areas. First, the report showed how existing manpower  projection techniques for an urban labor market area can be improved, expanded, and made more meaningful for VTE planning. Second, a systematic and comprehensive procedure was developed to project the future supply of labor by occupation. Third, a format was developed to relate occupational supply and demand forecasts to VTE programs codes in a more easily understandable and usable form. (HD)",

The project staff limited its study to one area of the State, which included two prime sponsor counties and one county under the sponsorship of the Governor (a &quot;balance of the  State&quot; county). Data gathered from the prime sponsors relating to the CETA training programs were used to derive benefit-cost ratios. The principal conclusion was that when measured on purely economic grounds the CETA title I vocational training programs are marginal. The two most important explanations offered for the findings were (1) the program is designed to try to reach the most unprepared, untrained clients possible, and (2) the recent dismal performance of the State's economy. Another finding brought out by the study was that full-time equivalent (FTE) vocational students receiving CETA funding support were not separated for accounting purposes from regular non-CETA FTE's. This full report of the study includes a detailed description of the procedures used in arriving at  benefit-cost calculations for the CETA programs, and four appendixes also relating to program expenditures.

(The procedure will result in a set of tables providing information on interest in job training for use in planning educational programs. It is designed to be flexible enough for use in areas as small as school districts or as large as whole States and for use with a minimum of formal training by persons unfamiliar with survey procedures.) An introductory chapter discusses the purposes of people's need assessment. Chapter 2 discusses activities, materials, staffing and costs required for making a study. Descriptions are based on experiences in conducting studies of the same type in Steele County, Minnesota (rural), South St. Paul and  Minneapolis (urban), and in Minnesota's Economic Development Region IV (regional). Chapter 3 outlines the basic procedure for drawing a sample of individuals to be contacted during the assessment study (a modification of the procedures outlined by the U.S. Bureau of Census in its Current Population Survey). In chapter 4 the procedure for contacting households and coding questionnaire responses is explained. Chapter 5, on analysis and summary of collected data, provides an explanation of the summary tables which result from the analysis of returned questionnaires. A summary of the procedures is appended along with a sample questionnaire, an index for hobby and special interest programs, and other aids. (JT)",

        "description":"The past and present economic and social problems and cause-effect relationships are major factors in the development of education at the community and junior college levels. Internal redesign of public junior colleges during the 1960's and early 1970's transformed them from liberal arts institutions into administratively flexible institutions offering a comprehensive array of services that stray considerably from the lock-step curricula of traditional educational institutions. The most astounding feature of the community college is that it evolved from catalytic forces in communities and not as a result of a community college act passed by Congress. Simultaneous with the emergence of the community college as an institution is the gaining impetus of vocational education and  training, and community colleges and technical institutes have become the primary delivery vehicle for this type of education in most States. As we look at the developments of the past, we find the insights to serve as the basis to guide our speculation about the future. The third century without doubt will produce new demands on junior and community colleges. The cumulative effect of the demands will be that the researcher will be called upon to stray quite a bit from what is known as institutional research into what might be called community research. The extension of the community college out into the community serving new clients under new kinds of arrangements and performing new roles will require the research office to develop new skills and to take on new assignments. Continued  success of junior and community colleges to a large degree will be contingent upon their capacity to respond to changing conditions and to demonstrate in measurable terms their effectiveness as community institutions and the validity of their programs and services.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine the actual tasks performed as compared to those tasks perceived as important by a selected population of postsecondary vocational-technical teachers in 40 public Texas community colleges. Prior to actual research methodology, the state-of-the-art of vocational teacher education, the competency-based movement in teacher education, and research studies in vocational teacher education were reviewed. Then a job inventory of 94 tasks was mailed to a population of 700 teachers; 461 usable responses, distributed among five vocational areas, were received. The overall finding was that differences did exist in the rated perceived importance and the percent of respondents actually performing the tasks. The report also contains a section devoted to  approaches suitable for developing teacher education curriculum. Appendixes include a table of tasks ranked by mean of perceived importance; tables of the lists of 94 validated competencies for each of the five major areas, indicating percent of respondents performing the task, average time spent, and rank by percent of respondents; a table providing comparisons of ranks of tasks by perceived importance with ranks of tasks by the percentage of respondents performing the tasks; and a sample of the job inventory.

The WOIS project organization and operation is concerned with the three major areas of information development, delivery systems, and service to users. Oregon's career information system was used to develop occupational descriptions and computer programs for Washington's system, as the labor profiles of the two States are very similar. This report describes the development WOIS and its functions. The process evaluation section discusses WOIS development, utilization, and influence  (cooperation with key State agencies) and recommends that those implementing an occupational information system allocate ample time for inservice training and detailed planning. The evaluation also notes that substantial time is also needed to convert and thoroughly test the computer software system before demonstration. The five appendixes, covering approximately half of the document, present the WOIS table of organization, the past schedule of WOIS demonstrations throughout the country, outlines of two WOIS inservice training programs, 13 WOIS exhibits/forms, and the WOIS second year plan.

        "description":"A project focusing on the assessment of the educational system in adapting people to technological change considered the problem of adaptation for the whole person, not simply the work role, but also the family, consumer, citizen, and other roles for which educational activity is potentially instrumental. There were two major objectives: Development of a formal theoretical framework by which the problem could be defined, and application of that theoretical framework in terms of the educational needs of several selected groups. The analytical framework emerged from the interaction of a multidisciplinary team and may be characterized as a formal treatment of role-theoretic concepts in social psychology, using the welfare-maximization techniques of microeconomic theory. The  usefulness of this model of adaptation to technological change was explored in terms of the problems of adaptation to technological change faced severally by engineers (role conflict), physicians (role conflict), married women (role sequence), and the elderly (role loss). The model was useful in structuring a review of the literature relevant to each of the groups considered, but the paucity of literature posed a major difficulty. Little research has been conducted on the nature of the adaptation problems of these groups, the resources at their disposal, and the effectiveness of various educational interventions. In addition to the summary and introduction the report is in four chapters, each with its own bibliography: (1) A General Model of Adaptation, (2) Professional Obsolescence in  Engineering and Medicine, (3) Technological Change and Role Sequences: Special Problems of Women, and (4) Problems of Adaptation Among the Elderly.

In conducting the study, a cooperative plan was developed for pre- and posttesting and evaluation. The evaluation concluded that the occupational information is of value and is useful to the physically handicapped; however, an alternative method  of access to the WOIS system should be developed.

Some of the basic conclusions presented (as derived from data received) are (1) CETA is not significantly impacting on institutional vocational education--at best the system is merely being maintained as it existed under the Manpower Development and Training Act and the Equal Opportunity Act, (2) there exists a great deal of confusion and lack of understanding among local prime sponsors due to the lack of direct involvement prior to CETA, (3) the communication between States and local prime sponsors needed for  CETA to positively impact on vocational education is inadequate, (4) CETA title I money is not being used to any large extent to increase the training being provided at existing vocational education institutions, (5) the system of negotiating nonfinancial agreements with the State for the provision of vocational education training and services through the use of the 5% supplemental vocational education funds often does not afford local prime sponsors adequate flexibility, (6) the CETA rules and regulations are vague regarding allocation of the 5% supplemental vocational education funds within the States, and (7) the confusion, complexity, and restriction of local prime sponsor flexibility has resulted in frustration among many local prime sponsors and has made it difficult for the 5%  supplemental vocational education funds to impact in local jurisdictions. The appendix includes city profile data for 100 cities selected for surveying, list of cities included in analysis, survey instrument, and signature sheet and instructions for completing the nonfinancial agreement.

Seventy-four percent responded. Some of the conclusions from analyzing responses were (1) over 50% of the prime sponsors included in this study reported more effective working relationships with their respective vocational education communities in FY 1976, (2) improved working relationships generally did not result in increased CETA title I funding of  institutional vocational education, (3) the allowable uses of the 5% vocational education funds are still causing problems between prime sponsors and vocational education in negotiating nonfinancial agreements, (4) differences in philosophy and the continuation of turf protection are the largest coordination problems that exist at the local level between the vocational education system and the CETA system, and (5) the main local incentive for increased coordination between the vocational education community and CETA prime sponsors is &quot;CETA money.&quot; This report discusses the rationale of the survey design, analysis of survey responses (which covers program administration, program operations, and program coordination), and conclusions.

Topics include approaches to correcting the underrepresentation of women in the health care professions; improving the utilization of women in health occupations in which they are numerically well represented; organization of nurses and allied health and support personnel; new roles for women in health care delivery; and the role of women in  health care decisionmaking. A list of conference participants provides their professional addresses. Summary viewpoints of some conference participants reflecting the needs of women health care workers and consumers are included along with a copy of the conference program. (LAS)",

        "description":"The project was developed to improve career guidance services for adults, particularly ethnic minorities and women. General objectives for the project were (1) to identify viable career guidance, counseling, placement, and followup approaches being used with adult populations, (2) to implement and field test two of these approaches and design prototype materials based on the identified models, and (3) to disseminate a catalog of viable adult career guidance approaches. One of the selected programs was offered in a San Jose, California, neighborhood with a high ethnic minority population. It was based on a program operating in Huntsville, Alabama, and consisted of a 5-week class on career decisionmaking. The second program, an 8-week career exploration workshop, focused on the  special concerns of women and was based on a program developed at the University of Kansas. A kit, containing materials used during the implementation as well as the evaluation instruments, was prepared for each program. (These kits and evaluations are included in this final report.) Evaluation data revealed that the ethnic model (the first program) was successful in helping individuals who participated to reach program objectives, but attracted very few individuals. It was suggested that presentation and format of the program be revised if it is to be a transportable model. Evaluation of the women's program (the second program) was positive and the program was considered a viable, transportable adult career guidance program. (TA)",

(The survey was a first step in a project to demonstrate the transferability of existing career development programs from other school areas to designated need populations within the MAEP area.) A random sample of 320 women were interviewed. Their responses comprised survey I. An additional 41 women were surveyed by telephone. These interviews comprised survey II. Questions asked in the survey attempted to assess the identification of women with occupational choice, recognition by women that any woman may need to work, preparation already made for work outside the home, and self-identified career  development needs. Priority career development needs that were identified include the following: Women want and need to continue learning; women need to become more realistic about their future life situations; women need to learn how to make career related decisions; they need more career information and supportive services in order to continue their education; they desire a personalized atmosphere in continuing education courses; and some women (widely scattered) need citizenship classes. The report contains general findings of survey I and survey II including, conclusions, personal characteristics, career status, and preferences. Findings of survey I are also reported by district. An appendix contains the survey instrument, random walk instructions, a table on selected characteristics  of sample census tracts, and census tract data. (TA)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine whether the school and work related attitudes of students enrolled in model programs for training disadvantaged differed significantly from those of their counterparts who had no chance to take part in vocational education programs. Another goal of the study was to compare the affective characteristics of disadvantaged students from exemplary vocational programs with those of nondisadvantaged students in regular vocational education programs. Students came from schools in four geographical regions in rural Mississippi. Twenty attitudinal variables including 15 work values assessed by Super's Work Values Inventory, the Attitude Scale of Crites' Career Maturity Inventory, four attitude scores from Kilbane's Survey of Pupil Opinion, including  perceptions of self-as-student, perceptions of teachers, social perceptions, and overall school attitudes were measured for the 278 subjects in the three groups. In addition, the overall attitudes of the disadvantaged group toward vocational education and instructors' rating of their progress in vocational classes were collected. Nine research questions probing inter-group relationships and within-group relationships for attitudes held by students in the quality programs were utilized to structure the study. Data were analyzed by use of a variety of univariate and multivariate statistical models. Special needs programs in Mississippi were found to be associated with development of more positive attitudes in disadvantaged students. Disadvantaged students in quality programs expressed more  positive attitudes toward their vocational studies than were observed for regular vocational students. They also exhibited a profile of attitudes more like those of regular vocational students and less like those of disadvantaged youth in nonvocational studies. (LAS)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to identify placement and followup practices common to successful programs, and to strengthen those aspects of pre- and/or inservice training which prepare local counseling and guidance personnel to function more effectively in implementing local placement and followup efforts. A total of 3,218 schools from 26 states were initially surveyed. Detailed data were collected from 130 of these schools or school systems. Followup visits were made to 11 of these. Additionally, information gathering visits were made to three State Departments of Public Instruction. Review of the data collected from these sources indicates that school placement and followup programs, regardless of size or setting, still place more emphasis on curricular and college placement and  followup than on employment placement and followup. The more successful placement services seemed to proceed by (1) appointing advisory committees; (2) undertaking surveys of student needs and employment opportunities; (3) communicating the program to students, parents, and employers, as well as to school faculties; and (4) organizing and administering the actual placement and followup of students. It was found that the majority of those responsible for employment placement had little specific training and often limited experiences relevant to this activity. A placement handbook entitled &quot;A Guide to Developing School Based Placement and Follow-Up Programs&quot; was prepared and distributed. (TA)",

        "description":"Since speaking, writing, listening and reading are used daily in the performance of virtually all jobs for which vocational training is available, a project was conducted with the following objectives: (1) To determine basic communication skills that are common to jobs in seven occupational fields, (2) to identify the basic communications skills needed for employee entry level competency, and supervisor level competency, and (3) to disseminate the project results. Employees and supervisors from 30 occupational clusters answered written questionnaires about the communications skills involved in sending communications and receiving communications. Skills were divided into ways of communicating, kinds of information, and effectiveness of communications. Job categories were selected  on the basis of existing programs, projected programs, and an Employment Security list of projected needs. In general, it was found that questionnaire respondents relied heavily on oral communications for both sending and receiving communications on a job. Talking and listening to one person face-to-face was reported as the most frequent way of communicating. Communication curricula, based on a task analysis of the job, should be developed in all vocational fields and should emphasize the development of one-to-one, face-to-face talking and listening skills and informal writing skills. The bulk of this report consists of tables and graphs depicting results for the seven occupational groups as well as for individual occupations within those groups. Major occupational categories are  agricultural, business and office, distributive and marketing, health, home and family life, technical, and trade and industrial. Appendixes contain the questionnaires used with employees, supervisors, employee advisory groups, and supervisor advisory groups. (Author/HD)",

The first segment, designed for six class periods, emphasizes making a business plan. The second segment designed for nine class periods, emphasizes continuous business planning. (The entire game focus is on the importance of marketing and financial planning in successful business management and the importance of participation in community and business organizations. The simulation experience is intended to assist the  students in developing planning skills by providing an opportunity for them to make a plan, receive an evaluation of it, put the plan into effect, see the results of the plan, and revise the original plan in response to changing condition.) Included in the game manual are (1) the game description (overview, objectives, the game model, and evaluation of players' performance); (2) the teacher's guide to daily lessons (complete instructions for preparation, materials, classroom setup, student activity, discussion, etc.); and (3) the complete game materials.

Project objectives focused on community involvement, career awareness, career exploration, career preparation, guidance and counseling, dissemination, and teacher education. During the first two years emphasis was directed at development of personnel (teachers, counselors, and principals) working at the four pilot schools. The second  year was devoted to preparing coordinators to assume responsibility for the installation of career development in Fayette County. The third year was totally devoted to diffusion of career development activities to other schools, and preparation for continuation of project activities.

Improvement strategies were grouped under two major headings: (1) The regulatory approach, in which attempts could be made to better prevent or control abusive types of conditions, policies, and practices, resulted in regulatory and accreditation user guides. (2) The non-regulatory approach, in which improvements could be made in the education of student consumers themselves, to identify, avoid, or deal properly with institutional abuses, resulted in the  student's consumer guide. Information collection and analysis instruments and procedures were developed, pilot tested, and field tested. Major products of the project (the information collection, analysis, and use mechanism guides for its use by accreditation and regulatory agencies, and the student's consumer guide) represent preliminary, partially-validated strategies. These strategies can contribute to meeting several immediate needs of institutional self-study, setting minimum eligibility standards, an &quot;early warning&quot; system, and the basis of a formal communication network in the tripartite eligibility system.

Within the latter category, reviewers of the token economy literature (e.g., Kazdin &amp; Bootzin, 1972) have suggested that behaviors instigated within token economy mechanisms rarely generalize to alternative conditions, and this issue of generalization is perhaps one of the major criticisms of the token format. The present paper attempts to define and examine generalization in the light of recent research. Within  the presentation, the author integrates certain of his own findings and personal speculations as the various methods and issues for examining generalization are presented. (Author)",

Since many Asian-Americans have been stereotyped as being \"well-adjusted\" very little research has been conducted on their psychological needs. Also, little effort has been made to determine whether current counseling strategies are relevant to Asian-Americans. It is the contention of this paper that the traditional models of counseling ignore the cultural background of Asian-Americans. This is the primary reason why Asian-Americans do not utilize counseling services. The Cultural-Milieu counseling approach is a theoretical position that takes into consideration  the psychological, sociological, environmental, and cultural factors affecting the counseling process. Finally, the paper discusses the future goals and needs of Asian-Americans in relation to mental health professionals. (Author)",

The technique employed to discover the aptitudes of these special students was work sampling, which is a vocational evaluation procedure utilizing &quot;hands on&quot; experiences, interest and basic academic skills testing to assess the client's vocational potential. Two vocational technicians were responsible for the implementation of the project. Twenty hours of work sampling was administered, followed by parent, student and teacher conferences. An in-service component consisted of an initial orientation to parents, visitation of the facilities and a staffing session with teachers and evaluation staff. It was felt that  the work sampling was effective in most cases in delineating students' aptitudes and, to a somewhat lesser extent, their interests. Follow-up, consisting of placement in classes, training programs and/or additional counseling, was difficult due to the time limitation. The project indicated a need for further work and research in this area, and was for the most part supported by students, parents and teachers. (Author)",

Dyads of male college students were randomly assigned to one of four conversation situations: no table-close distance, no table-far distance, table-close distance, and table-far distance. Following a structured 20 minute conversation, subjects separated by a table perceived their partners to be better adjusted and felt more distant from their partners. Although both intent to disclose and number of topics discussed were significantly correlated with objectively rated disclosure, neither was highly  correlated enough to be considered the functional equivalent of objective ratings. The correlations among dependent measures of disclosure and non-verbal involvement supported a reciprocity rather than a distance-equilibrium hypothesis concerning dyadic interaction. (Author)",

The study assumed that if the individual's behavior on the relevant topic was consistent, then behavior on the other issues should have no impact on persuasiveness, but if a consistent style of behavior was necessary, then the individual must be consistent on all issues. Results indicated persuasiveness was maximized when a consistent style of behavior was manifested across all items. The individual was perceived as more internally directed, more confident and more persuasive when either consistent or variable on all issues. It was concluded that maximum persuasiveness is attributed to a person who  exhibits a consistent pattern of behavior, rather than consistent behavior. Response style is thus a component of social influence. (KS)",

The review indicates that, despite a large number of studies, particularly in the area of women's career commitment and goals, very few conclusions can be reached. The research literature has been plagued by the lack of control of potentially influential variables, and a lack of studies using national samples. Some of the original measures of career commitment are now outdated. With career commitment increasingly widespread among college women, there is evidence that women's goals have become increasingly unrealistic and that many women are still ambivalent  about homemaking and careers. A study of 85 Ohio State University women students using a questionnaire, the Rosenberg Sex-Esteem Scale, and the Spence and Helmreich Attitudes toward Women Scale (AWS) is reported in detail.

The study investigates correlation between organizational size and perceived value, as well as determination of significant difference between social and industrial organizations and those who hire predominately degree recipients and those who do not with respect to this legislation. A survey questionnaire was developed and mailed to 125 randomly selected industrial and social organizations. The responses were analyzed according to the aforementioned areas. Sixteen percent of the surveys received indicated a decrease in perceived value. There was no correlation between organizational size and mean value  of credentials, and no significant difference in perceived value of credentials between organizations who hire predominately degree recipients and those who do not. The results did indicate that industrial organizations place less value on student credentials than social organizations. It was recommended that the student credential forms be modified in order to allow students to waive their right to view these credentials. It is recommended that studies be carried out in this area to determine what areas of concern organizations have with respect to student credentials. The results shall further be utilized with respect to job placement counseling. (Author)",

        "description":"This study is concerned with an examination of the area counsellor services in Vancouver elementary schools and the support program of training for area counsellors. Information, opinions and suggestions were sought from a wide number of individuals and agencies having some connection with or interest in the services. It is recognized first of all that the area counsellors are providing a service which it would be difficult or impossible to replace. Several things combine, however, to hinder it from being as effective as it could be. These are dealt with in the recommendations which suggest an adjustment of the work load. This involves a careful setting down of priorities, greater understanding among staff and other specialists of the role of the area counsellor, and avoidance as  far as possible of duplication of effort. Continuity of service at each school is also an important factor. The flexibility and continuing revision of the training program are commended. The practicum, recently introduced, is an important addition, and should be developed and extended, so that the trainee is able to experience as far as possible what it means to be an area counsellor. The program can offer a unique in-service training providing as it does practical preparation through involvement with the working operations of the schools and their related specialists and agencies. In sum it can be said that Vancouver elementary schools would be much the poorer without the area counsellor services, supported as they are by a preparation program virtually impossible to parallel.

        "description":"High attrition in technical training courses in Army Service Schools was found to be a major problem during the years 1962 to 1965. Data obtained at the U.S. Army Air Defense School showed that students who volunteered specifically for their training had significantly lower attrition rates than students of comparable aptitude who were assigned to the courses without having volunteered. These data were highly suggestive of a motivational factor in the prevalently high attrition rates and indicated a need for improving student motivation. The objective of this Work Sub-Unit was to evaluate group competition as a means of improving or maintaining student motivation. It was hoped that the tendency of American males to compete would lead to strong group identification, and a resultant  improvement of performance. Group, rather than individual, competition was thought desirable for two reasons. First, as a member of a group the weaker student has more of an opportunity to win than he would have functioning as an individual. Secondly, it was felt that the competition might lead to the tutoring of weaker students in a group by the stronger students. The results of the research are discussed in relation to the validation of the assessment devices, the factors related to motivation and the implications to be drawn from these experimental findings.

Thirty Centers were selected for on-site study. The criterion was a program directed to older adults, meeting at least once weekly on a regularly scheduled basis and providing some form of educational, recreational or social activity. Sites included at least one Center within each of the 10 HEW regions. Selection of 20 other Centers was determined by systematic examination of two mail questionnaires submitted by Senior Centers themselves. From intake data supplied, NISC staff members assigned to the project selected, at random, persons to be interviewed at the Center. Appointments were arranged in advance.  Interview time averaged 50 minutes per individual over a period of five man-days. Case studies of the 30 sites visited reveal implications of the findings, policy recommendations made -- and problems, possible solutions and topics in need of further discussion. It is anticipated that the findings reported here may be useful to those responsible for planning and implementing Senior Center and other group programs. (Author)",

The course is designed to impart information about human sexual function and dysfunction, and to provide some exposure to the basic methods of treating common sex problems. To accomplish these goals, students are asked to assimilate the information given, and to practice the prescribed home assignments as though they were individuals receiving sex counseling. The approach is based on the belief that positive changes in the counselor's personal comfort with sexuality will enable him or her to respond more objectively to the diverse patterns of sexual behavior  encountered in practice.

Thirty-six male undergraduates watched a six-minute portion of a boxing film and a six-minute portion of a nonviolent sporting events program. Heart rate and skin resistance were monitored and the highest, lowest, and average skin resistance and the number of skin resistance responses for each of the 12 30-second segments of each film were obtained. Subjects were divided into the following four groups on the basis of pre-experimental questionnaires and logs they had kept of their TV viewing behavior: high/low viewing time x high/low  preference for violent programming. The results supported the study's hypotheses: heart rate and average skin resistance differed between high and low viewing time and viewing preference groups, and the effects were stronger in response to the violent than to the nonviolent film. For the boxing film, both heart rate and average skin resistance were greater for low viewing time and high preference for violence subjects. The directions of the findings are interpreted within a habituation-sensitization inverted &quot;U&quot; model. The implications of the findings for human aggression and their relationship to aggression research done by experimental social psychologists is discussed. (Author)",

This report presents the finding of research that compared high and low aptitude men--classified on the basis of scores from the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT)--on two form discrimination tasks that required both intramodal and intermodal functioning. One experiment required the men to make a simultaneous discrimination of meaningless forms, using vision and touch. A second experiment repeated the first and introduced a delay period between the presentation of the standard and comparison stimuli. The results showed that, as a group, high aptitude men performed consistently better than low in both experiments. Analysis of verbal  reports of the subjects indicated that the majority of the high aptitude men used higher order processing or learning strategies that enabled them to make more accurate matches. The results indicated that training in the organization of stimulus inputs into mediational units holds promise as an approach to helping low aptitude people improve their organizational and information processing skills.

Subsequent study supported somewhat the validity of the scale, but also indicated several areas where the scale could be improved. The scale was shortened and given a checklist format; validity was again supported in further studies. Finally, the scale was converted to behavioral items, submitted to a large sample for item and factor analysis calculations. This form yielded high reliability, and 11 factors from an image analysis solution. Extensive  forthcoming research to further investigate the reliability and validity of the scale was outlined. It was concluded that the scale assessed a number of small factors relating to effective functioning in interpersonal relationships which facilitate intimacy. (Author)",

        "description":"Learning is not a simple unitary process. This paper identifies three qualitatively different phases of the learning process. In one phase, the learner acquires facts and information, accumulating more structures onto the already existing knowledge structures. This phase of learning is adequate only when the material being learned is part of a previously understood topic: the appropriate memory schemata already exist. In a second phase, the learner must devise new memory structures to interpret the material that is to be acquired. This is the most difficult and the most significant form of learning, for it marks the acquisition of truly new conceptualizations about a topic matter. The third phase of learning involves a continual process of modification: both constraining and  generalizing the knowledge within the schemata of memory. This stage of learning does not increase the formal content of one's knowledge, but it makes the use of the knowledge more efficient. Thus, although a beginner and an expert might both perform a task with perfect accuracy, there is a marked qualitative difference between the performance of the two. Three different mechanisms that seem to be responsible for the different phases of the learning of complex topic matters--accretion, restructuring, and tuning are proposed. (Author)",

        "description":"A method of factor extraction specific to a binary matrix, illustrated here as a person-by-item response matrix, is presented. The extraction procedure, termed ERGO, differs from the more commonly implemented dimensionalizing techniques, factor analysis and multidimensional scaling, by taking into consideration item difficulty. Utilized in the ERGO procedure is the calculation of a dominance matrix which, for either persons or items, has the important attribute of allowing directionality to be inferred between relations. ERGO iteratively adds items together, resulting in the construction of various sets of implicative chains representing dimensions. Having constructed these chains, the ERGO procedure orders the chains in terms of maximal number of items contributed. The chain  evaluation procedure can best be explained as an attempt to maximize the number of items accounted for in a given dimensional solution. To give additional understanding of the ERGO process, an empirical example which utilizes social distance items (Bogardus, 1925) paired individually with three ethnic groups was analyzed for respondents representing four ethnic groups. The results demonstrated the ability of ERGO to (1) group items referring to the same ethnic group; (2) uncover hierarchically graded orders within each chain; (3) select the three chains that corresponded to the three ethnic groups; and (4) cluster individuals by ethnic group according to their scores.

Performance on the relational assessment task, (Hierarchical classification of subsets and superordinate sets) was better than performance on the traditional task where subjects compared subordinate and superordinate sets.

The document includes a review of theoretical approaches to the explanation of slowing on cognitive tasks that occur with age, and reviews the methodology of a two-part experimental study of 45 subjects. The study reports a letter-matching reaction time task to investigate the relative contributions of attentional factors, pathway effects, and motivational factors to the overall slowing seen with age. Older subjects (mean age 63.5) are found to be more accurate than younger subjects (mean age 20.0) who demonstrate greater speed but more errors. Feedback is shown to affect performance on the part of younger subjects who report pacing themselves. Statistical treatment of  the data by cost benefit analysis indicates no significant difference in the time course of costs and benefits between younger and older subjects. (Author/SBP)",

The sample consisted of 55 college women in the first study and 145 women in the second study. Correlational analysis examined the relationship of vocational maturity, using the Career Maturity Attitude Scale, to career orientation variables. The career orientation variables included a measure of work role salience, the Desire to Work Scale, and three measures of occupational role innovation; level and traditionality of occupational choice, and educational aspiration. While no significant relationship between career orientation variables and vocational maturity was obtained in the first study, work role salience was positively  related to vocational maturity in the second study. Correlation matrices of the career orientation variables in both studies revealed that the two dimensions of career orientation are independent in college women. Results are discussed in the context of Crites' theoretical model of vocational maturity and current expectations for female career participation. Implications for further research in female career development are presented. (Author)",

Previous researchers' findings were confirmed, showing that the desire to have only one child is not common. However, no significant sociodemographic differences were discovered differentiating women desiring various family sizes. On the positive values of parenthood, women desiring an  only child feel intermediate between those desiring no children and those wanting two or more children. On the negative values the findings generally supported the hypothesis that women desiring only one child were more concerned about additional children reducing their freedom and alternative role options than were women wanting two or more children. Finally, it was shown that women desiring only children rated the personal benefits of parenthood involving the relationship between parent and child as high as did other women. (Author)",

Chapter one outlines data gathered from the 161 respondents' questionnaires, as well as from in-depth interviews conducted at 50 of the schools: a majority of the recommendations were reported to be in effect. Chapter two assesses changes in teacher preparatory programs: over four-fifths of the respondents indicated that changes in scope and content of reading programs and in related experiences did take place. Chapter three details recommendations for the future as determined by  respondents: slightly less than one-half provided suggestions. Chapter four introduces two descriptions of teacher education programs at the undergraduate level: a carefully planned competency-based alternative for the single reading course offered by one school and a program, based on suggestions from several schools, which reflects a number of promising practices. Appendixes list the schools surveyed, outline study procedures, and provide a copy of the questionnaire used. (KS)",

An understanding of this issue is crucial to theory, since the existence of major psychological differences between the comprehension, learning, and memory of sentence lists and connected discourse would make a unified theory covering both types of materials exceedingly difficult to formulate. While offering no final resolution of the issue, the present paper examines the evidence, considers the implications of several major theoretical developments, and poses questions amenable to experimentation. It is hoped that the paper will serve as a springboard to a  higher level of understanding of how people process these two common types of experimental materials. A list of references is included.

Two aspects of memory for prose were investigated: the amount of information remembered and the semantic interpretation assigned to ambiguous paragraphs. Task instructions and exposure duration of the passages were manipulated to induce different levels of processing and to affect the amount of information retained. In order to influence the interpretation of the ambiguous paragraphs, different contexts, in the form of titles which would create bias, accompanied the text. Recall and recognition measures indicated that students remembered more information and more context-consonant information when given instructions which required processing the paragraphs at a  semantic level. Thus, context determined which meaning was remembered from polysemous paragraphs only when incoming information was processed at a deeper, more semantic level. Tables of findings are included.

The findings were that concretization dramatically influences both the probability of recognition of the subject noun phrase and the probability of recall of the predicate, given recognition. These results were taken to mean that a concrete phrase makes a good conceptual peg because it is likely to be given a specific, stable encoding and because it tends to redintegrate the whole sentence. Regression analysis showed that the concreteness effect could not be attributed to an influence on comprehensibility. A model of sentence memory is offered which can account for the results.

The results indicated that a particular term naming the expected instantiation of a general term was a better cue for the recall of a sentence than the general term itself, even though the general term had appeared in the sentence and the particular term had not. This could not have happened if people encode and store the core meanings of general terms.

The first passage could be perceived as describing either a prison break or a wrestling match, while the second could be understood as detailing either an evening of card playing or a rehearsal session of a woodwind ensemble. Scores on multiple-choice tests, the content of written themes, and comments in free recall of the passage indicated a striking relationship between the subjects' backgrounds and their interpretation of the selections. These results indicate that high-level schemata  provide the interpretive framework for comprehending discourse.

Overlap between each achievement test and each reading series is reported in terms of achievement test grade equivalent scores that would be expected, given mastery of the words which appear both as content in a reading series and as achievement test items. Results indicate clear discrepancies between the grade equivalent scores obtained, both between tests for a single curriculum and on a single test for different reading curricula.

One week later, each child read cloze passages corresponding to that child's highest or lowest rated topics. Cloze responses were scored both for exact replacement and for use of synonyms. Results indicated that children comprehended more of high-interest than of low-interest material, suggesting that the interest effect is not dependent upon selective response to the more appealing passages in a mixed set.

        "description":"The aim of this study was to determine whether a general or specific context facilitation mechanism should be incorporated into information-processing models of reading. General facilitation models claim that a context can facilitate recognition of any word that is related to it. Specific facilitation models claim that a context will facilitate recognition of only those words that are highly expected on the basis of the context--that is, a subset of words predicted by general models. Three experimental procedures were used. The first required a lexical decision (word or nonword) about a test item sometimes preceded by a context, the second used a successive lexical decision procedure with two words, and the third used a sentence acceptability judgment task. Overall, the  experiments provided some evidence for a general facilitation mechanism but did not eliminate the possibility that a specific facilitation mechanism was also operating. To determine whether these results should influence the construction of models of reading, tentative criteria were proposed for deciding whether an experimental effect needs to be accounted for by a model.

These prospective teachers should learn what cultural differences to expect and how to analyze cultural data concerning environment, nonverbal communication, family structure and relationships, and community structure and relationships. Dialect should then be studied, as dialect can affect a child's reading progress if the teacher is not aware of dialect features or the relationships among all American English dialects.

In a Stroop task of this kind, distractor words that are not congruent with the names of the pictures on which they appear are known to interfere with picture-naming, even when subjects are asked not to attend to the distractors. Instructions in the present research required subjects to ignore the distractors, to read them silently, to pronounce them covertly, or to say them aloud. The phonetically novel nonwords retarded picture-naming performance more than did real words when phonetic processing was explicitly required by task instructions, but  not during silent reading.

The older children, as had adult subjects in previous studies, showed a greater tendency to recall serially with a four-letters-per-second presentation rate than with a half- or one-letter-per-second rate. Grade-three children, however, showed evidence of serialness in their recall with all three presentation rates. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that there is an auditory-specific store enduring for perhaps 15 to 20 seconds which holds relatively unprocessed material according to the initial temporal organization. Operation of this store would be most evident when the opportunity or ability to rehearse and recode  are minimal, that is, in older children's and adults' recall with a fast presentation rate and in young children's recall with all rates.

Results were interpreted as indicating that content fragmentation and frequent regroupings tend to desynthesize and depersonalize courses, and that a high degree of classroom  camaraderie may be more essential to psychological adjustment than is course content or the school calendar.

A content analysis of essays written about the region's press was used to obtain empirical indicators of press performance. The findings suggest that management decisions are related to newspaper performance in several ways. The number and kind of editorial staff, their training and experience, and the salary given them, all predict press performance. In addition, those newspapers which participate in professional seminars and workshops, as well as those which invest in self-study, are better papers than those which do not. Large papers, those with large news holes to fill (the estimated amount of  space devoted to news), and those which are part of large media corporations are better than those with small circulations, small news holes, and independent ownership. There is only limited evidence that the community is a stimulating or restricting force in producing a good newspaper, though better educated and more diverse communities do have better papers.

        "description":"Using data published by \"Editor & Publisher,\" annual reports, and confidential material made available by publishers, this paper examines budgets for papers of varying sizes from 1947 to 1974. While expenses have been increasing more rapidly than revenue since 1947, newspapers are above average in rate of return on revenue. Earnings of 15% after taxes are not uncommon, though large metropolitan papers and papers with fewer than 25,000 circulation are much less profitable. The chief change in revenue over the past 27 years has been in advertising. In 1947, advertising typically accounted for two-thirds of total revenue, and national ads made up more than 12% of the total. Local and classified ads now have grown to nearly 70% of total revenue, while national ads have declined to  less than 4%. Subscriber revenue has dropped from around one-third of total revenue to around one-quarter. The most startling increase has been in administrative and general expense. For the composite paper, this category represented 11% of all expenses in 1947, but 27% in 1974. Budget data are presented by circulation and a cost/demand curve for circulation and advertising is estimated. (Author/AA)",

Evidence indicates that the newspaper industry has tended to overestimate the elasticity of demand for newspaper circulation. This study analyzed price changes, circulation changes, and population changes for all daily newspapers in the United States between 1970 and 1975. Results strongly supported the hypothesis that the demand curve is highly inelastic and that newspapers have been grossly undercharging for their product in relation to the market. The estimate of elasticity for all newspapers during the six-year period studied indicated that a 50% increase in price resulted in only a 1.25% decrease in circulation, with percentage change in population of the publishing city or metropolitan area held  constant. Projected potential loss to the newspaper industry because of past reluctance to raise per-copy price from 10 to 15 cents is estimated at more than one billion dollars a year. There appears to be no evidence that daily newspapers have yet approached the point of diminishing returns from price increases to the audience consumers of the industry. (Author)",

The decision-situation model postulates three dimensions which, taken together, may predict the course of communication behavior: level of involvement, problem recognition, and structural constraints. Grunig and others draw upon a coorientation model to evaluate traditional public relations practices. As with the decision-situation model, many of the more empirical studies of external communication can be incorporated into the coorientation constructs. Ideally, the decision-situation model and coorientation model should work together: the former to prescribe the scope and direction of a public relations campaign and the latter to  evaluate its success. In conclusion, the decision-situation model was found to serve two functions: by identifying those segments of the population most likely to benefit from promotional activities, it can improve the efficiency of public relations campaigns and, by providing a general paradigm for future research in external communications, it represents a first step toward professionalization of the public relations industry.

At the outset, all children were reading English at least one grade level below grade placement, were experiencing difficulty in speaking fluently in English, came from homes where Spanish was the dominant language, and had similar English syntactical performance. The pretest and posttest sequence measured English morphology and syntax. Results of the posttests supported the null hypothesis--that there would be no significant difference in morphological development.  Tape-recorded samples of oral language (the children telling stories) showed that the control group gained two more T-units than did the experimental group but that the control group remained static in the number of words used per T-unit, while the experimental group increased by two words.

Three factors increased interest in implementing media coverage of such meetings: feasibility of televised coverage, public cynicism and hostility generated by misinformation and information gaps, and the realization that television would effectively shift power from the president, who has made increasing use of the medium, to the Congress. Opponents of the use of television cite the disruptive effects of television cameras, bright lights, and microphones as reasons for rejecting media coverage. A report prepared by the Congressional Research Service at the request of the Joint Committee indicated, however, that these  objections could be overcome. Steps toward legislative resolutions which would allow televised coverage of committee meetings and open floor debate have not been acted upon, despite the fact that a recent Roper poll of television viewers indicated that more than 50% of those interviewed felt that deliberative sessions should be televised.

This paper examines the diversity present in research concerning marriage and family units and suggests that these differences stem from the false assumption that &quot;the family,&quot; as commonly perceived, represents a heuristic unit of analysis. Criteria based on observations of behavior in other social groupings can be used to predict the differences in interactions which occur between families. The implications of this paradigm for conflict resolution within kinship groups are also examined. (KS)",

        "description":"The women's movement has made the issue of language usage an important part of its ideology and an even more important part of its rhetoric. Generally, the position assumed is that English is biased in favor of the male in terms of both syntax and semantics. Much of the work which women have published on this issue reflects a close adherence to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which asserts that language determines thought. Recent limitations which have been placed on this hypothesis have important implications for the rhetoric of the women's movement. Since linguistic bias is actually a symptom rather than a cause of social bias, feminists risk a loss of credibility by asserting a causative relationship between thought and language. Analysis of linguistic biases can, however, help to  uncover the nature of underlying social biases, help to keep feminist issues before the public, provide a concrete index of progress toward eliminating social biases, and serve to boost women's morale and to improve their self-concepts.

For the major investigation, two student groups--naive subjects (undergraduate, introductory theatre course students) and expert subjects (doctoral students in theatre)--viewed nine theatre productions and answered a five-part questionnaire. Results showed significant differences in the way in which the groups perceived the nine productions. In addition, the majority of the experts' responses were consistently less favorable than were responses of the naive group.  Significant relationships between the semantic agreement of groups and the preferences for settings suggest that designers do communicate specifically, through settings, to the audience.

It was also concluded that because zero-sum games (a form of competition in which one wins at the expense of another) narrowly restrict opportunities for decision making, human relations would benefit from a shift to non-zero-sum games.

The 1940s saw open warfare between the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and broadcasters, as a result of the FCC expanding its powers. In 1946, the FCC issued its &quot;Public Service Responsibility of Broadcast Licensees,&quot; which became known as &quot;The Blue Book.&quot; During the 1950s, the FCC investigated broadcast performers and station owners for alleged communist activities and affiliations. Also in the fifties, concern developed over the relationship of television and juvenile delinquency and the control of advertising in the broadcast media. In 1961, with the appointment of Newton Minow as chair of the FCC, the Kennedy administration made clear its concern about the  quality of television programming, and social scientists followed in an attempt to quantify and qualify the effects of television programming. By 1970, the theory of social responsibility of broadcasters had been thoroughly established by FCC Commissioner Nicholas Johnson, and under his direction the mass media concentrated on serving public interests.

The data analysis was based on a Quality of School Life scale, which consists of separate subscales for evaluating students' satisfaction with school in general, students' commitment to classwork, and the quality of student-teacher relations. Results of the study show that openness of the instructional program has greater positive impact on students' perceived  quality of student-teacher relations than on other dimensions of the quality of school life. Openness of the instructional program appears to involve a basic change of the school authority structure but may not involve as much change in the social task structure. These results are discussed in terms of the potential of subjective indicators for monitoring the progress and effects of educational innovations. (Author/JG)",

The second part consists of a descriptive account and analysis of the primary inspection system in each of the  five states visited as it relates to the current educational situation in those states.

Participation observation is used to understand how the intervention process is incorporated into everyday patterns and norms of the school. No individualization of instruction occurred. The findings suggest that basic teaching assumptions of the middle school staff remained unchallenged. Teachers saw the problem of reform as maintaining control and discipline so students would acquiesce to the authority of professionals. The IGE/S activities made the prevailing school orientations seem psychologically appealing. Further, the reform functioned externally to legitimate the school program within the larger communities.

The first chapter provides a historical review of public school finance. The next three chapters deal with the source of public education funding, the general nature of local taxing authority, and the manner in which state taxing authority augments local taxes. Two of the chapters deal with costs and cost influences. Chapter 5 deals with federal aid. Chapter 6 provides a layman's understanding of the sometimes complicated Pennsylvania school subsidy system. It also provides some comparisons with other state subsidy systems. Chapter 7 provides comparative financial statistics at the national, state, and local levels. Chapter 8 presents existing  and possible future options school officials may consider as they examine public school costs. The final chapter offers some alternatives and suggestions for improved school district business practices. (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"This study was intended mainly to examine the effects of class size on the reading and mathematics achievement of first graders and also to determine the effects of teacher inservice training on student achievement. Data were gathered from 25 pairs of first-grade classes from 23 South Carolina school districts. Each pair of classes was made up of one experimental and one control class of similar racial and socioeconomic background but different size. Experimental classes contained an average of 19.9 students, while control classes contained an average of 26.7 students. Approximately half of the 50 teachers received inservice training; within each pair of classes, either both teachers or neither teacher received inservice training. Results indicated that the overall achievement of  first-grade students in small classes was substantially greater than overall achievement of students in large classes. However, neither teacher inservice training nor the interaction of class size and inservice training had any significant effect on overall achievement. (Author/JG)",

A committee was appointed to make a thorough study of the facilities and the future needs of the school district and make recommendations. The task was divided into two phases. The first phase was to conduct a study during the 1972-73 school year to assess the adequacy of instructional space in the elementary schools. Space was found beyond the requirements needed to house the declining student population. As a result, the committee developed a set of criteria for a school closing index to be applied to each elementary building: (1) location in relation to neighboring schools, (2) adequacy of facility, and (3) factors affecting  enrollment. Twelve alternatives for solving the excess classroom space problem were studied and reviewed; however, the committee recommended closing three schools. The rational for closing schools from the point of view of economics and educational efficiency and the reasons for selecting the three specific schools to be closed are presented. Other factors considered in the report are a schedule for closing, implications for redistricting and transportation, receiving schools, and disposal of closed schools. (Author/MLF)",

In the first phase, faculty, custodians, secretaries, administrators, and guidance counselors are surveyed to determine which students are frequent discipline problems. In the information-gathering phase, the student's previous record is checked in three areas--attendance, academic achievement, and attitudes. The third phase is a meeting in which an administrator, the student, and his parents discuss the student's record and outline a plan of action. The administrator has the parents and student sign a conference confirmation sheet that explains the areas discussed and the goals established and that notes there will be a follow-up. The student is also given an  appointment with a counselor at which time he can go over his schedule for the upcoming year. The follow-up hinges on a survey of teachers after the first five weeks of the next term and a review of the student's grades at the end of the first grading period. If the student does not make progress, further conferences are scheduled. (Author/IRT)",

Each child rated each component of the meal (main dish, bread, vegetables, dessert, and milk) on a five-point scale. The students handed in their forms at the waste return line in the lunchroom before they left their tray at the return stand. At that time the amount of waste for each of the five food items remaining on the returned tray was recorded by an observer. The report presents rank order tables for both food  preference and plate waste scores.

Four elementary schools in Columbus, Indiana, are examined. These schools, designed by nationally prominent architects, were completed in 1962, 1966, 1969, and 1972. The two older schools contain traditional classrooms; the two more recent utilize semi-open (1969) and open (1972) educational and design concepts. The schools are similar in size (500-600 students) and in the social characteristics of their students. Technical studies have been carried out in the following  areas: exterior walls; roofs; interior walls; floors; ceilings; acoustics; lighting; and heating, ventilating, and air conditioning.

The five are a continuum of alternatives and services for students with problems, human relations and interpersonal training for all segments of the school population, expanded counseling services, a community diagnostic-treatment center, and training programs for teacher specialists. The continuum of services includes an extensive school-based program, a special day school for children for whom an intervention in a special setting seems essential, residential placements in group homes, and a medical facility that may be residential but also provides out-patient therapy and medical  intervention. The human relations training focuses on communication and intergroup and intercultural conflict. The expanded counseling services have a tripartite thrust--indirect prevention, direct prevention, and direct remediation. The diagnostic center focuses on early identification of developmental problems due to physical, emotional, or learning difficulties and includes professional and parental cooperation. (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"Presented are 11 papers discussing the following six models of emotional disturbance in children: biophysical, behavioral, psychodynamic, sociological, and ecological, models, and counter theory. Emotional disturbance is defined as a distinctive human state having multiple manifestations and involving disability, deviance, and alienation. All the models consider the disrupted pattern of human-environment exchanges resulting from emotional disturbance. Discussed in the biogenetic model are genetic, developmental, arousal, perceptual, neurological, and biochemical factors. The behavioral model of both learning and behavior theory discusses major divisions among the connectionist theorists, contiguity theorists, various reinforcement theorists, and applications of learning theories  such as behavior modification. The literature review of the theory of psychodynamic model includes the Freudian perspective, changes in psychoanalytic theory, ego psychology, phenomenonological perspectives, and psychodynamics and education. The sociological model discusses such topics as mental illness seen as social deviance, the sick role, Emile Durkheim's theory of anomie functionalism, and socialization failure in children. The ecological model drives from plant and animal ecology the sociological, psychological, and medical principles of human ecology. Counter theory is discussed in three papers considering the educational institution and counter culture alternatives, the ideas of Paulo Freire and the Illich-Reimer alternative, and a description of a counter culture and sources of  objection, respectively. A final overview paper toward synthesis concludes that the models are not necessarily competitive systems, but rather represent different facets of the community problem of emotional disturbance.

Each type of institution is described extensively in terms of the history of its delivery systems in the United States; its current organization and operating principles; and the way in which it handles children in a fictional, typical community (Noah). Examined are such historical developments as the growth of public school involvement circa 1915-1946, the evolution of an independent juvenile court apparatus, the emergence of mental asylums in the Jacksonian era, and the antecedents of American colonial poor relief. Subtopics considered in  relation to the structure of various service delivery systems include client population; personnel; programs, facilities, and intervention techniques; informational resources; power and political structures; and patterns of interaction with other systems. The roots of counter institutions (for example, free health clinics and communes) are examined in the context of historical radicalism, cultural rebellion, trancendentalism, and Bohemianism. The authors stress the importance of client focus (through cooperative interdisciplinary professional efforts to provide improved service), of advocacy for the whole child (rather than emphasis upon particular services provided by individual agencies), and of the need for schools to fulfill central roles as clearinghouses for clients of alternative  systems.

The &quot;orthophoniste&quot; is said to be a language specialist concerned with speech and hearing problems, while the &quot;psychoeducateur&quot; is described as being concerned with the reeducation of emotionally disturbed students and juvenile delinquent teenagers with learning disabilities. The fourth specialist discussed is the school psychologist, whose role is seen to be changing from a medically-oriented diagnostician to a classroom observer and  consultant. (CL)",

Respondents were given two field questionnaires to evaluate the PRICE career education competencies listed, to identify other major competencies important for retarded students to acquire, and to determine which personnel were felt to be most appropriate to teach each of the competency categories. Results led to conclusions such as the following:  that career education of retarded students should involve a wide variety of school discipline (all categories of counselors/teachers indicated that their discipline was appropriate for teaching at least some of the 24 competencies), and that occupational guidance and preparation appears to be the most deficient curriculum area.

Cerebral lateralization was measured for linguistic material (digits) using the dichotic listening technique. No difference was found in mean lateralization score between normal and dyslexic groups; however, the distribution of the lateralization scores of the normal Ss appeared unimodal whereas that of the dyslexic Ss appeared bimodal. The results suggested support for both the weak and the strong lateralization theories of dyslexia. (Author/IM)",

The initial sample of 295 students who entered either program in 1970 or 1971 were followed up by tracing their educational path from 1971 to September, 1975. By 1975, about half of the students still remaining in the Toronto system had been reintegrated into regular programs. The effect on later placement of age on entry to the program, sex, and length of time in the program was examined. Students who were found in regular programs in January, 1976,  were examined further by collecting and comparing teacher ratings for those students and two matched groups. Generally, ratings were similar for the target group and the group matched on age (generally over-age for grade). However, ratings were lower for the target group than for a random group of class peers, especially in areas related directly to the problems which warranted their former special class placement.

Discussed are the following study recommendations: the need to develop a procedure for auditing reimbursement claims, the need to adopt a cost concept and measurement technique which provides a more meaningful estimate of the excess cost of educating handicapped children, the need to identify specific purposes and objectives of state financial aid, and the development of financial and  statistical record keeping procedures. Two alternative reimbursement formulas to replace the current formula are proposed, one of which is an excess cost approach, while the second approach (which is advocated) is based on actual costs incurred (assuming controls for reporting costs are established). The financial and statistical data on which the recommendations are based are included in a series of tables covering cost by type of handicap, costs for selected cost categories, costs and daily class hours per teacher by type of program, sources of funds, number of pupils and teachers by type of handicap, and regular program data.

        "description":"Relatively few studies have been made of the history of the international language Esperanto, although materials for its study are fairly complete. As a linguistic phenomenon, that is, a language in continuous use for almost a century but without national roots, it has also had little systematic study, though a considerable literature on the subject exists in Esperanto itself. There are now several native speakers of Esperanto, who might merit special investigation. It would also be useful to have more extensive study of psychological and sociological aspects of the Esperanto speech community. Esperanto has an extensive literature, original and translated, little known by outside scholars. There is also a need for the study of Esperanto's practical application and its potential  as a solution to international language problems. Some attention has been given to the pedagogy of Esperanto, but more work is needed. The language is seldom mentioned in major reference works or adequately represented in libraries, and for these reasons it is often overlooked by scholars. The largest collections of Esperanto materials are in London, Rotterdam and Vienna. (Author/CFM)",

        "author":["Sole, Yolanda Russinovich"],
        "description":"The most basic and simplest act of communicative competence in Spanish involves the appropriate decoding and selection of the pronominal address forms \"tu\" and \"Usted.\" Their selection and semantic value are not, however, determined by linguistic criteria alone. Since \"tu/Ud.\" mark the relative status of each speaker in a given context, their selection is primarily dependent upon sociocultural factors. If students of Spanish are to gain some insight into the distribution and potential value of each form, they must first be made aware of the factors that determine it. They may understand that \"tu/Ud.\" mark the relative status of each speaker, that formal contexts may require a symmetrical \"Ud.,\" and that symmetrical and asymmetrical uses are possible. But they must also realize  that these concepts are relative to a given time and place and as such may be differentially elaborated and perceived from one setting to another. While the misuse or misreading of \"tu\" versus \"Ud.\" may be inconsequential in classroom exchanges, in true interactions it may have considerable social repercussions. Although their basic value and usage can be taught by rule specification, their semantic polivalence and social significance can only be apprehended by long and intense exposure to a Spanish-speaking setting rather than by formal training.

        "description":"The objective of this thesis was to colligate the various strands of research in the literature of computational linguistics that have to do with the computational treatment of semantic content so as to encode it into a computerized dictionary. In chapter 1 the course of mechanical translation (1947-1960) and quantitative linguistics is traced to demonstrate the limitations of computational linguistics without semantics. Chapter 2 covers linguistic research in the l960's, which was essentially an offshoot of transformational grammar. In chapter 3, various classification schemes are examined as a body of experience from which to draw conclusions on the constraints to which the construction of a computerized dictionary is subject. Chapter 4 is a synthesis of all this data in the  form of a model dictionary entry. In chapters 2 and 3 the approaches to semantics are of two types. In one, the semantic categories for each dictionary entry were in the form of unordered elements, and the means of applying them in text was placed within the realm of grammar. In the other type, syntagmatic relationships occurred between the encoded components of dictionary definitions just as they did between those of utterances in a text. The conclusion reached is that the latter type of approach provides firmer foundations upon which to set up a computerized dictionary, as it shows how information is structured in terms of its application in text.

Since media vary in their \"relating power,\" that is, their ability to involve students, standards of quality also may vary in the ways certain production technique parameters, such as lighting, sound, and exposure, are manipulated. Some media, such as video, are seen as having great relating power, and yet these require careful technique in order to keep the medium's inherent characteristics from generating unintended \"messages,\" which in many cases become distracting noise. Specific techniques for maintaining high quality and, thereby, high effectiveness in the media of video, audio, and photographic slides and prints are discussed. (Author/CFM)",

The first group is composed of Anglophone students studying French in a relatively monolingual setting, while the second group represents Anglophone students in a bilingual (English/French) setting, and the third group, Francophone students studying English in a bilingual (French/English) milieu. Measures of a number of attitudes, motivation,  classroom anxiety, and language aptitude (I.Q. in the case of the Francophone sample) were subjected to a series of correlational analyses which also included five variables representing possible linguistic and non-linguistic outcomes of second language programs. Both first order and semi-partial correlations were used to demonstrate that the major role of attitudes in the process of second language acquisition appears to be one of providing support for the motivation required to sustain the student in formal second language programs.

The linguist attempts to establish a model of the workings of these distinctive sounds in a language. Utilizing an historical basis for discussion, this general survey of the distinctive feature principle illustrates the formation of the concept of these phonemic entities (the distinctive features) and their refinement and incorporation into structuralist and transformational-generative phonology. It is suggested that the development of the principle sheds light on the question of how a language utilizes sound matter, the adaptation and utilization of certain sounds in the workings of a language, as well as their representation  in language models and theories. The phonological assumptions of Jakobson, Fant, Halle, Bloomfield, Chomsky, et.al. are discussed in an attempt to understand the concept of \"sounds\" as utilized by linguistic theory since its origin as a modern-day science.

        "description":"Recent interest may indicate increasing use of radio in foreign language learning despite some of the very realistic obstacles that face the beginner. Shortwave radio can be used imaginatively in a variety of ways, including: (1) increasing the reality, currency, and accuracy of listening comprehension skills; (2) actual communication with speakers of the target language; and (3) stimulating real interstudent communication in the target language. Some of the problems associated with the use of the shortwave radio in the foreign language classroom include: (1) the need for enough money to invest in quality equipment; (2) the need for classroom and non-classroom time; (3) unexpected problems such as differentiates between the skilled and the non-skilled listener, but this problem  can be a valuable element in developing listening comprehension skills. An addendum describes the steps in obtaining an amateur license. One must: (1) pay an application fee; (2) pass a Morse Code test; and (3) pass a written test on radio theory and regulations. (AM)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the issue of whether and how data from dialect surveys provide insights into women's language. The Linguistic Atlas projects of the United States and Canada, the Dictionary of American English project, the Arkansas Language Survey and smaller projects are considered; and it is stated that in order to get at conversational interaction, only interviews which are truly conversational in nature should be used. The research reported is based on twenty tapes made in Newton County, Arkansas in l970, and specifically on interviews with two elderly married couples. The working hypotheses, similar to those of Hirschman (1972) and Eubanks (1975), are: (1) males talk more than females in conversational situations, (2) males tend to control conversations by signalling  beginnings and ends of conversations, (3) males make more judgmental, analytical statements, (4) males and females signal their perceived roles by the use of standard and non-standard verbal forms, and (5) females make more rewarding and encouraging remarks, or show agreement or indecision. Results at this stage of the research indicate that rules for conversation in interview situations should be determined before differences on male-female conversational interaction cues are defined, since the interviewee's perception of his or her role in the interview as the primary or supplementary informant affects the interview, independent of sex.

Goals of the project were to assess whether or not the study of Latin and classical civilization will: (1) expand the verbal functioning of sixth grade children in English, and (2) broaden their cultural horizons and stimulate an interest in humanities. The project was directed towards approximately 400 sixth graders in six schools, all studying Latin and classical civilization in a program coordinated with their regular classes. They received a thirty-minute lesson each day 5 days per  week taught by a Latin specialist. The present program evaluation report shows overall gains in word knowledge, reading, language, spelling, math computation, math concepts, math problem solving, and social studies after the first year, and gains in spelling, reading, and math concepts following the second and third years of the program, as seen from results on subtests of the Metropolitan Achievement Test. Teachers' evaluation of the program were generally favorable. (CLK)",

The latter position holds that a human being starts out with a mind which is basically empty and receptive to, subject to, and the natural product of experience. The nativist position holds that the mind is endorsed with fixed learning principles which, in the case of language, predetermine the form of language learning. Argumentation in support of this position, which comes from Chomsky's speculations about what the nature of the human mind must be in order to acquire language, is examined. Four of Chomsky's basic claims are outlined and questioned: (1) human language  is quite unlike all other forms of animal communication and possibly represents a case of evolutionary development for the human species; (2) the human organism brings to the language learning process a special set of processing principles which must be assumed to be innate; (3) language is represented in the genetic code; and (4) unique anatomical correlates are linked to unique language development in man. Little literature is devoted to what the actual processes and mechanisms of the hypothesized innate capacity of language learning are. (CLK)",

        "description":"This paper examines the formal means by which Czech distinguishes transitive and intransitive verbs, and specifically the role of the particle &quot;se&quot; in the process usually called &quot;derived intransitivization.&quot;&quot;Se&quot; is shown to perform a number of functions which preclude its being called simply an &quot;intransitivizing particle.&quot; By way of comparison, a study by Babby is cited which, using Russian data, transformationally introduces the intransitivizing particle &quot;-sja&quot; onto verbs whose object noun phrase has been preposed, deleted, or otherwise vacated. Parallel examples are drawn from Czech illustrating reflexive, passive, and middle voice constructions, and special attention is paid to middle voice forms in Czech which fail to introduce &quot;se.&quot; Furthermore, examples of Czech active  voice verbs using &quot;se&quot; which take apparent &quot;direct&quot; objects in the accusative case are discussed. The suggestion is made that in some cases there is competition between verbs occurring with the particle &quot;se&quot; and those taking &quot;si&quot; (the enclitic dative reflexive), and specifically that the presence of &quot;se&quot; (like &quot;si&quot;) is sometimes felt as merely a modality element, a point of reference, or a means of emphasis. It is concluded that the sources for Czech &quot;se&quot; are more varied than those for Russian &quot;-sja,&quot; and the attempt is made to describe some of these other sources. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"The prelinguistic child's attempts at communication cannot be viewed as rudimentary language. More than cataloguing overt acts, we need to understand the functional character of both language and non-language communication capabilities, and in particular the maturational stages of the internal communication systems that produce overt behavior in human beings. To describe the child's behavior without considering the nature and organization of the neural systems that produce the behavior is unreasonable. Above all, it must be realized that the child's observable behavior is only the tip of a neuropsychological iceberg. The conclusion that developmental stages are mere theoretical constructs, abstractions from a process that is actually continuous in nature, could only result from  ignoring this fact. The forebrain limbic systems that became elaborated in primates constitute the primary level of human communication. The second arises at about 12 months in the form of neocortically based conceptual systems, including gestural behavior encoding components of propositional elements such as agent, patient, dative, etc., until recently largely ignored by psycholinguists. Only from about 20 months does the child use syntactical and morphological indicators to systematically encode components of the underlying conceptual message, and only at this point can the acquisition of a language system be said to have begun.

        "description":"The syndrome of childhood autism is typified by major abnormalities in language development, yet there are few systematic descriptions of autistic children's linguistic systems. This paper represents the beginning of a comprehensive investigation of the language of verbal autistic children and concentrates on comparing the syntax used by ten verbal autistic children matched for nonlinguistic mental age with a group of mentally retarded subjects and normal controls. Two different means of assessing syntactic development were utilized: Lee's developmental sentence analysis and Chomsky's transformational analysis. The autistic group was found to rank significantly lower than either the mentally retarded or the normal group in terms of Developmental Sentence Scores. When a  transformational grammar was used to describe the language samples of our subjects, the autistic children were typified by a higher error rate and lower level of complexity compared to the other two groups. However, the results also indicate that the grammatical system of autistic children is rule-governed and probably not unlike that of young normal or retarded children. In conclusion, it appears that the syntactic abnormalities characteristic of autism are attributable to an extreme delay in language development as well as to an impaired ability to make use of linguistic rules.

Full passives were classified as reversible (The dog was chased by the girl), instrumental non-reversible (The lamp was broken by [or with] the ball), or agentive non-reversible (The lamp was broken by the girl). The agentive non-reversible did not appear until after age 9; and until age 11, no child produced both reversible and non-reversible passives. All the children used the passive in a semantically restricted way, but not in the same way. The possible developmental course of the full passive was traced for children who initially used only reversible passives versus those who initially used only instrumental non-reversible  passives. From this study, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) language acquisition is not complete by middle childhood; (2) individual differences exist in language learning &quot;strategies&quot;; children use analogy to learn grammatical rules; (3) the relationship between comprehension and production is complex; and (4) the distinction between semantics and syntax is often arbitrary.

        "description":"This paper examines the question of language loyalty in the United States and explores the implications that the institutional teaching of modern languages may have for ethnic language maintenance. The education of United States ethnics has always resulted in the loss of the ethnic tongue as a resource. However, although negative attitudes toward ethnicity, on the part of both ethnics themselves and non-ethnics, have been diminishing, ethnic cultural recovery does not automatically imply mother tongue recovery. In the past foreign language departments have treated U.S. ethnic tongues only as foreign (or second) languages. They are prepared to attend to the needs of those ethnics who are English-speaking monolinguals and who want to acquire as a second language the tongue of their  cultural group but not to the needs of ethnics who are either monolingual in the ethnic tongue or bilingual in any degree. If the U.S. were to adopt a language planning policy that had as its specific goal the maintenance and development of ethnic tongues, it could not turn for expertise to the modern language field. The methodology for teaching ethnic language arts is still in its infancy and there is no general movement on the part of conventional language departments to aid in its development. However, if some significant attitudinal and methodological changes were made, no place would be more adequate than a language department to train teachers in the language and culture of a group or to turn students into educated users of their own native language.

        "description":"A return to basic inductive research methods is recommended. Specifically, the scientific method of \"strong inference\" ought to be applied in attempts to prove hypotheses concerning the relationship that may exist between attitude variables and the learning of a second or foreign language. These hypotheses, drawn from the literature and discussed here, are: (1) the strength of the relationship between attitudes and achievement increases with increments of time; (2) the relationship becomes weaker under the same conditions; (3) the relationship tends to remain unchanged; (4) the relationship between attitude variables and variance in second language learning is quite strong; variance which could be accounted for by attitude variables might be above 25%; (5) the variance might be  much less, below 10%; (6) the relationship may be substantially stronger in contexts where many opportunities to communicate with the target language group are available; (7) the more a learner is self-confident, extroverted, and friendly, the more rapid will be his progress and the higher his ultimate level of attainment of proficiency; (8) the direction of causation is from attitudes to learning and achievement; (9) high levels of attainment or rapid rates of learning may cause positive attitudes; (10) the direction of causation is both from attitudes to attainment and the reverse; (11) the relationship of attitudes and achievement will be the same in foreign and second language learning contexts; (12) the contrast will reveal a stronger relationship in foreign language contexts; and  (13) an integrative orientation will produce more efficient learning and a higher level of attainment than an instrumental orientation.

        "description":"The idea of semantic features has taken some force within psychology and a number of research workers have suggested that semantic acquisition is, in some manner, determined by semantic components. This notion has come to be called the &quot;semantic feature hypothesis&quot;. An examination of the semantic feature hypothesis was made by testing 80 New Zealand children (40 Maori and 40 European), four years of age, for comprehension of the semantic components, as specified by Manfred Bierwisch, of a set of spatial adjectives. Results indicated that a componential analysis does not offer a valid model for the acquisition of either words or of word meaning. The problem would seem to be that it is impossible to derive a theory of semantic processing or of semantic acquisition solely from one  level of analysis. The acquisition of the words of the spatial set (big - little, high - low, etc.) can best be dealt with by a multi-level model of processing which postulates as its elements verbal forms (signifiers), perceptual preferences, and cognitive operations.

Open education is defined as a humanistic approach designed to offer support to the children in their move towards self-realization. More than classroom structure, open education is a way of thinking about children, learning, self and knowledge. Key concepts of openness are (1) play, the vehicle through which children order and learn about the world they live in; (2) an affective view of education, the awareness of the child's self and inclusion of feelings and responsiveness in the educational milieu; (3) social interaction, giving children ample opportunity to experiment with way of relating to their peers, (4) an emphasis on the learning process, (how one comes to  know) rather than on the right answer; (5) the teacher as facilitator of learning helping the child to go where he/she wants to go; and (6) the classroom as an environment reflecting the teacher as a person.

Ten of the infants were males, 10 were females; approximately 70 percent were first born; 60 percent were bottle-fed. All had normal Apgar scores. Infants were administered the Brazelton Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale after their two o'clock feeding. During the five o'clock feeding, two observers watched the mother feed her infant and observed maternal and infant behaviors using a 10-second time sampling procedure. Sex differences in both infant and maternal behavior were apparent during the  feeding observation. Correlational analyses done among all variables of both the Brazelton examination and the feeding observation indicated multiple significant correlations among the Brazelton items. Results also indicated significant correlations between several Brazelton examination items and one maternal behavior (looking at infant) during feeding, and between behaviors of the feeding situation. A discussion compares the study findings to results of earlier studies on mother-infant interaction. (SB)",

There were 13 adopted grandparents averaging 77 years of age and thirty 6-, 7-, and 8-year-old children. Objectives were to stimulate sharing of talents, knowledge and skills, to encourage caring and helping relationships and to help children recognize and accept the aging process. The children visited the nursing home regularly, wrote letters and read to grandparents, helped plan parties, music, games, and arts and crafts activities and planted a flower garden. A detailed log book was kept which included happenings, conversation and comments of the children, the elderly and the nursing  home staff. During the 1974-75 school year a study was conducted to identify the effects of the program on children's attitudes toward the elderly. Pretests and posttests were given to children in the program and to a control group. Although no statistical differences were found between the two groups, it appeared that both the adopted grandparents and the children benefited from the contact and that the experimental group more frequently had attitude changes in a positive direction toward elderly persons.

Mean looking times were shortest for familiar slides, longer for categorically similar slides, and longest for categorically novel slides. Females showed generalized habituation from the  familiar slides to the categorically similar slides, but looked significantly longer at those from the novel category. Males looked significantly longer at new slides from either the similar or the novel category than at the familiar slides, but on unfamiliar slides did not significantly discriminate between the similar and novel categories.

A time sampling technique was used to monitor the interactions of 8 children (3 males, 5 females) in two settings in the DARCEE Head Start classroom. Information pertaining to task orientation, verbal content, and use of props within an interaction, in addition to the modality (verbal, physical, gestural) and affect (positive, neutral, and negative) of both initiator and respondent was recorded on a checklist. A series of analyses were performed to determine effects between and within settings on the frequencies and patterns of interactions for three initiator-respondent pairings  (child-child, child-teacher, teacher-child). A number of results are presented and discussed. The use of interaction analysis appeared to be successful in achieving the goal, providing systematic assessment of the application of specific DARCEE principles in the classroom. (Author/MS)",

        "description":"This a report of several studies of children's artistic behavior carried out at Cornell University with 3- to 5-year-old nursery school children. The studies involved: (1) taping comments children made while painting at nursery school; (2) determining if there was a difference in difficulty between two- and three-dimensional representations; (3) seeing whether giving a child an opportunity to handle an object before drawing it affected the finished drawing; (4) training children in copying a square to see if improvement could be brought about; (5) studying the relationship between matching, recognition, tracing and copying of geometric forms; (6) determining whether meaningfulness of a form affected children's ability to copy it; (7) comparing children's drawing and writing  ability; (8) comparing children's drawing of geometric forms on various shaped backgrounds; (9) determining the effect of selected experiences upon children's drawing; and (l0) making videotapes of children using art materials. Implications include the importance of the teacher as a catalyst in the drawing process, especially if the teacher is a non-interfering one; the greater importance of process rather than product to the child; the clear developmental differences between 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds. It is suggested that little can be done to speed up or change a child's ability or developmental level in artistic expression. Improved drawing ability seems to result from something other than improved motor coordination or perceptual skill. (MS)",

        "description":"This paper describes early childhood education programs in Sweden, focusing on their history and development, administration, goals and objectives, admissions policies, structure, expenditures, program of activities, facilities, staffing, daily routine, problems and criticisms. Beginning in 1902, legislation provided for the care of abused and foster children. Government involvement increased steadily, blossoming in the 1960s and '70s when labor shortages, increased interest in women's roles and emphasis on enrichment of the preschool environment led to the establishment of a law requiring municipalities to offer free preschool services. Day care administration presently starts at the national level with the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. Individual child centers are run  by municipalities, which, though fairly autonomous, must implement state decisions and regulations. The theoretical base of preschool education in Sweden is a combination of theories and practices from Germany, Britain, and the U.S. In addition to meeting the needs of children, centers are designed to meet parental needs. The centers also serve the society's goal of eliminating class distinctions. Many center staff members are politically radical and ideologically oriented in their work at the centers. Different forms of child care are available with the daghem, or day home, being the most common and structured. Problems in the system include high staff turnover, inadequate coordination between the centers and educational institutions, and a lack of parental involvement. Criticisms  include concern over the amount of time children spend at the centers, and differing views as to the role of the centers. (SB)",

The Arizona Center originated with a commitment to the systematic analysis, continued development, validation and modification of a new, existing program. The Tucson Early Education Model was a 3-year program on the intellectual development of young Mexican-American children, conducted in response to a high rate of school dropouts. A new educational program was evolved and gradually implemented in 68 classrooms, grades 1-3, in eight Tucson public schools. Four instructional goal areas were  emphasized: (1) language development, (2) intellectual base, (3) motivational base, and (4) societal arts and skills. Initial research efforts of the Arizona Center attempted to study the effects of basic learning variables associated with the Tucson Early Education Model, such as modeling and discrimination. These studies later led to a formalized program of research, comprising three basic areas of study: (1) intellectual skills, (2) environmental influences, and (3) instructional methods and techniques. In the area of intellectual skills, sequential memory ability was shown to be influenced by stimuli grouping. In the environmental area, influences of socialization on intellectual performance were investigated. The concluding section, on research-practice interaction, covers curriculum  evaluation, open classrooms, parent child training and models for educational decision making. (BF)",

A survey instrument was developed for the collection of data. Analyses were made of the information in the responses for frequency, percentages, and significant differences. The findings indicated that 95 percent of the teachers perceived themselves as competent to identify children with learning problems by informal observation. The study compared attitudes toward the effectiveness of the two methods of identification. A chi-square of 2.53 was found, which  was not significant at the .05 level of significance, with 1 degree of freedom. Thus, the major hypothesis was supported. Analysis of related factors revealed perceptions of advantages and disadvantages of the two methods. It was recommended that resources be redirected toward delivery of services to children and that the structured observation instrument be revised.

Results were expected to aid the staff in developing a more comprehensive and functional nongraded school. The controlled variable was the method used in grouping pupils. Six homogeneous age and seven multiage classes were established with pupils in their first, second and third years of school. Both groups were pretested and posttested in reading and mathematics achievement and self-concept. First-year pupils' achievement gain was significant at the 0.03 level in favor of the multiage group. Pupils in their second and third years of school showed no significant  gain in reading achievement; however, the mathematics gain favored the homogeneous age group and was significant at the 0.02 level. Self-concept gain was significant at the 0.02 level in favor of the multiage group. The data were computed from a random sample of 120 pupils, approximately one-third of the population. A comparison of the two methods of grouping indicated the multiage method to be more appropriate for primary students in the school.

The children were observed over a 6-week period during a 2 1/2-hour free-play time. Results showed that both sexes equally apportion all types of free-play time behavior, show the same amount of make-believe play, and identically utilize a given play area (such as householding or blocks/trucks) for make-believe. Different play areas generated different amounts of make-believe, with the household areas generating the most make-believe. In addition, make-believe in the household area was found to elicit a greater proportion of social interaction than other types of behavior and other play areas. The only sex difference  found was that boys engage in more make-believe than girls in nonstructured areas like open floor spaces. It is suggested that these findings seem to disconfirm various modeling hypotheses. Educational implications of the findings are discussed. (MS)",

Subjects were 172 middle class children evenly distributed across the two age groups. Experiment I investigated the effects of individual strategies (perceptual exploration, organization of distinctive features, or verbal cues) and reinforcement on retention by children of both age levels after a 3-minute interval. Experiment II investigated the effects of a constant sequence of all three strategies (perceptual exploration, organization of distinctive features, and verbal cues, in that order) and reinforcement on retention after 3-minute, 1-week, and 1-month intervals. Item recognition and reaction times were recorded for all  recognition tests. The results indicated that training in both individual strategies and a sequence of strategies facilitated 5- and 10-year-old children's retention of patterns at all intervals. Reinforcement at the time of training was found to be effective in the retention of patterns. Item recognition diminished with lengthening intervals, but decreases were smaller for trained groups. The 10-year-old children had shorter reaction times than did 5-year-old children. Implications for classroom learning are noted briefly. (Author/MS)",

        "description":"A series of three studies investigated the role of play materials in supporting social interactions of nursery school children. Subjects were 14 boys and 11 girls, 4 and 5 years of age, who came from a variety of socioeconomic and racial backgrounds. Observations were made for 16 days, during the free play hour at each of four play centers: art, games, blocks, and dramatic play. The first observational study indicated that, for 4- and 5-year-old children (1) assertive-disruptive interactions occurred most frequently in block play center and least frequently in the art; (2) boys were more often involved in assertive-disruptive interactions than were girls. A second observational study confirmed these results for 4- and 5-year-old children, but not for 1- and 2-year-olds who were  also observed. In the third study, available play materials were experimentally manipulated for groups of boys and groups of girls. The behavior of the girls was as expected. The boys, however, showed more assertive-disruptive behavior in art than in blocks. This result is interpreted as supporting the view that the effect of play setting on social interaction is not intrinsic to the play materials but depends upon the child's expectations and knowledge of the situation.

        "description":"The traditional kinship organization of the Dakota Indians was compared with contemporary patterns of family living on the Pine Ridge Reservation. Effects of the cultural change on the economic and social conditions of the present day Pine Ridge Indians were evaluated. The study revealed remnants of the traditional kinship pattern and the nature of the changes which had taken place in the family organization during the transitional process, and offered suggestions to guide the direction of future change on the reservation. Three communities, located in a contiguous area on the Pine Ridge Reservation, were characterized as traditional, transitional, and transpositional. During the summers of 1956 and 1957, information on 86 families from these communities was gathered, using a  series of previously prepared questions. Among the findings were: the traditional community had the smallest average family size and number of children per family and had most nearly retained elements of the Dakota kinship pattern; in the transitional community, over half of the families were broken by divorce, separation, or death; the transpositional community had the largest average family size and number of children per family and had most fully accepted a non-Indian family system resembling that in non-reservation areas; and although changes in Dakota culture were tremendous, many child-rearing practices and sharing patterns were retained.

        "description":"Designed to complete a cycle begun in 1946, the 1950 Service-Wide Testing Program examined: the progress and achievement made by American Indian students in various educational situations, and the factors thought to affect their educational development. Tests were administered to all students in grades 8 and 12 enrolled in day, mission, public, nonreservation boarding, and reservation boarding schools located in nine geographic areas--Alaska, Dakota, Mountain, Navajo, Oklahoma, Pacific, Pueblo, Southeast, and Southwest. The tests included: Pressey Diagnostic Reading, Grades 3-9, Form A; Arithmetic-Factor Abilities, Form USIS--FA-A-1-47; Free Writing Test, Form C, USIS--FWA-C-48; Use of Resources--USIS-3-46; Pressey English, Grades 5-8; Gates Basic Reading, Grades 3-8; Orleans  Arithmetic Computation, Form I, Grades 3-8; and Health and Safety--USIS-HS-A-47. These tests were not all administered in both grades. The mean, standard deviation, plus one standard deviation, and minus one standard deviation were calculated for 360 distributions. Data were also obtained on the student's degree of Indian blood, language spoken at home, home stability, place of residence, kinds of friends, late entrance to school, size of school attended, regularity of school attendance, and academic ambition. It was found that as the cultural and educational backgrounds of Indian children became more like those of white children in the public schools, the educational achievement of Indian children matched that of white children more closely.

Demographic data were obtained from Bureau of Census publications and unpublished maps and statistical tables. Sociological data included research on employment patterns, housing, economic impact of Indian consumers, and settlement patterns within urban centers. Anthropological information was gathered on inter-group attitudes, view of city living by Indian residents, acculturative processes obtained in the city as shown by participation in town life, and descriptive categories of Indian urban residents. Interviews were conducted with about 50 non-Indians in employment, housing, business, and other professions (35 were from Flagstaff) and about 45 Indian residents (10 were from Winslow).  Additional data sources for all three areas were newspaper articles, field observations, and participation in various events involving Indian residents. Findings included: more Navajos resided in both communities than Hopis and other tribal groups; although Indian residents were found in nearly every employment category, many were unskilled or semi-skilled workmen; the reservation-based consumer trade was quite important to the economies of both towns; and Indian residents disliked such aspects of city living as available housing and money needed for daily life.

        "description":"While practicing medicine in the Harney Valley of southeastern Oregon, Dr. W. L. Marsden became interested in the language of the Northern Paiute Indians. From 1891 until his death in 1913, he collected linguistic material. His principal informant and teacher was &quot;Patotzi&quot;, known as Captain Louey or Captain Louey Crook. A member of the Wadatika band of Northern Paiute, Louey was known as a good story-teller among his own people. As the volume of material increased, Marsden turned to the faculty of the Department of Anthropology, University of California - Berkeley, for guidance. Professor A. L. Kroeber was a member of the faculty. In 1914, Professor Kroeber asked Gilbert Natches, a native speaker of Northern Paiute from Pyramid Lake, Nevada, to help him complete Dr. Marsden's  work. However, Natches spoke a slightly different dialect than Louey and was, therefore, unable to follow the narrator's style. He did provide his own original data. This publication consists of 59 documents obtained from translations accompanying the texts recorded by Marsden from Louey and by Kroeber from Natches. These documents have been literally translated using the best English possible. Some explanatory notes have been added to some of the translations. The documents include Louey's autobiography, myths, songs, stories, accounts of various Paiute rituals, and religious prayers. (NQ)",

Unfortunately, language is only one facet of the total problem. In any discussion of education involving people who are culturally and linguistically different, various factors come into play, factors which enjoy an interlocking type of relationship rendering isolation of a single element difficult. These include language, community, socioeconomic status, as well as parental and community attitudes to education. To some extent it is necessary to deal with these factors in order, ultimately, to be able to make intelligent, informed decisions about language policy in the schools of Northern Alberta. This study reviewed the literature pertaining  to the question of whether to begin instruction of elementary school children in English using an English as a second language program or to use the Native language for instruction initially, with English gradually introduced. Topics covered are: place of language in education, factors affecting the choice of language for use in the school, bilingual education models, opinion regarding the language of instruction, factors affecting the bilingual child's education progress, language problems and the school, and language policy and the reading process. It would appear that there is greater long term advantage in beginning the school program in the child's dominant language. (Author/NQ)",

Baseline data (1969) derived from 1,500 fifth and sixth grade children and their mothers are compared with data obtained after a social intervention experiment in 1971 (a subsample of mothers involved in a series of lesson/discussions on helping children with career planning) and with data derived from 1975 interviews with the same respondents. Additionally, 1975 data on new samples of fifth and sixth grade students are compared. Among the major questions addressed are: rural-urban  differences; sex differences; racial differences; differences between the economically disadvantaged and others; educational and occupational aspirations and expectations. Among the generalized results presented are: youth from deprived backgrounds now have aspirations as high or higher than others, with low income preadolescents projecting aspirations as high as those of the affluent youth, blacks higher than whites, girls higher than boys, and rural about as high as urban; and status projections decline substantially from pre- to late adolescence but are still unrealistically high. Finally, this paper presents questions relative to the purpose and value of this kind of rural research. (JC)",

Since ethnomethodology is concerned with the immediately observable social situation, a central concept posited is that ethnomethodology calls into question the normative organizational focus of rural sociology as exemplified in the study of social structure. Emphasizing the difference between objective and subjective reality, rural schools and reality construction are discussed in terms of reality differentials, transmission, and reaction and internalization. Essentially, this paper calls for a humanistic sociology; wherein, researchers open their eyes to the world with a &quot;natural attitude&quot; and perceive the world as an ongoing accomplishment rather than as a &quot;taken for granted facticity&quot;.

The variables employed were: achievement-advancement; security; work with people; service to society; hard work; and money. The questionnaire included 11 sets of 3 alternatives from which the single most desirable condition was chosen in each set. Results indicated: the sex-role factor accounted for an enormous amount of the observed variability in the patterning of career desiderata among rural youth in both societies and  in much the same way; social class origin contributed little to career patterning and the class differential hypothesis was not supported; certain distinctive orientational themes tended to be associated with specified career plans operationalized in status terms, indicating that a general valuational configuration constituted an integral part of the status attainment process (girls were more inclined toward the social aspects of work career and boys toward the extrinsic rewards); in both societies and for both sexes, the service/people theme clearly characterized the orientational pattern of the upwardly mobile.

Since rural China has suffered from excessive urban migration, rusticated youth are perceived as the catalytic agents needed to transform the countryside and agriculture. Avoiding the collectivization of the 1958 Commune Movement, rural peasants migrated to the cities where excessive natural increase, the search for a production breakthrough (the Great Leap Forward), and the Sino-Soviet split were causing severe food and infrastructural problems. Consequently, in the early sixties,  some 20 million people were transferred to the countryside, and in 1963, the government officially decided to stabilize China's urban population at 10 million. The result of insufficient numbers of youth in rural areas with appropriate training for rural employment, the Cultural Revolution of the sixties revolutionized education in China by emphasizing practical skills and agricultural orientations at the expense of intellectualism. Therefore, the policy of rusticating the youth constitutes the core of Chinese economic development, and its success will depend upon whether or not Chinese youth remain in the countryside. (JC)",

Major points of discussion include: (1) Ghana's young and growing population (in 1970, 63.9% of Ghana's population was under 25 years of age, a phenomenon that is creating serious economic and employment problems); (2) Ghana's youth policy (while there is no comprehensive youth policy, the urban oriented National Youth Council constitutes the central controlling body for youth affairs in Ghana and includes over 20 national organizations); (3) rural-urban  differentials (while Ghana is predominantly rural with 71.1% of the population living in rural areas on 80% of the land, the distribution of doctors, dentists, and other social services favor urban areas and the death rate is higher and the life expectancy rate lower in rural areas); (4) problems of rural youth (organization, education, employment, and migration); (5) conclusions (Ghana's rural youth have been: neglected by the youth organizations; subjected to the insecurity of poverty, disease, and poor living conditions; victimized by inferior educational measures; and alienated by urban oriented decisions and decision makers).

        "description":"The new Youth Act passed by the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in 1974 assumes that the interests of young people concur with the interests of their socialist society and state, for it reforms the rights and conditions for the further development of young people and defines their duties and responsibilities in terms of State contributions. Consequently, a 10-year comprehensive polytechnical school is compulsory for all youth, and all citizens in responsible positions have the statutory duty to entrust young people with overall social tasks comparable to their knowledge/capabilities. In view of various sociological analyses indicating that improved material and cultural living conditions and practical experience in the socialist democracy are primary  concerns of GDR youth, the State has provided on-going educational opportunities, cultural centers, a voting age of 18, socialist youth participation mechanisms, etc. While there are no fundamental features separating agricultural from other youth workers, sociological studies show agricultural youth attitudes include: a positive appreciation of their work; a direct correlation between their role in agriculture and the industrialization of agriculture; and a genuine desire to use the knowledge gained via their education. GDR agricultural emphasis is on training youth for modern machinery, responsible jobs, and management. (JC)",

The game incorporated the following five units or groups of restraints: (1) learning activity (over 50 learning institutions restrained via location, type, and governing rules); (2) working activity (50 jobs restrained via location, migration potential, educational requirements, age and sex, working hours, and initial and maximum wage); (3) family (restrained via age of husband, housework time, marital status, number of children, and community type and size); (4) leisure (restrained via sleep, work, learning, housework,  and community type); (5) migration (restrained via learning institution, training quality, system of jobs, organization of services, transport, leisure, and subsistence minimum). While there were similar attitudes toward obtaining middle and vocational/technical training, marrying early, and having a large family, players tended to either want to complete urban vocational training and remain in the city working in industry or complete junior college training and return to the country. The game revealed that both alternatives presented problems in terms of value orientations, job availability, and rate of industrialization. (JC)",

These provinces included the traditionally rural Cosenza in southern Italy, the more developed Treviso and Reggio Emilia in the north, and the heterogeneous city of Latina in central Italy. The latent and more general connotations associated with agricultural and industrial work were surveyed via a questionnaire consisting of 2 series of 15 adjective scales (independent, secure, simple, prestigious, original, requiring initiative, free, monotonous, requiring sacrifice, remunerative, risky, satisfying, sanitary, technical, and specialized). Four  factor analyses were made for each occupational orientation. Essentially paralleling the four provinces, the factors were: physical strength required; technological specialization; self-realization; remunerativeness as a source of satisfaction/security; simplicity as source of security; remunerativeness and/or simplicity as giving security. Results indicated: vocational images did condition adolescent choice; Treviso and Reggio Emilia adolescents were motivated by personal self-realization in the job; in Latina and Cosenza, instrumental motivations were operative which were both external and internal to the job itself as well as to degree of self-realization.

        "description":"When evaluating the potential of a developing nation's rural youth, a distinction must be made between youth living in the countryside and those of rural origin migrating to the cities. Moreover, consideration must be given to the effect of: geographical mobility upon national development requirements; rural vertical mobility upon the modernization and democratization of the social structure; and the rural mentality and skill level upon the larger society. In the development of a country there is an initial extensive period followed by an intensive period, the former requiring manpower and the latter requiring skills. In Poland, there is currently a higher than average number of rural migrants working in the building materials industry (16.6%), the wood industry (18.2%), and  public roads (32.6%). In 1970, among these rural to urban migrants, 14.4% were manual laborers, 8.7% intellectual workers, and 5.5% handicraft laborers. These figures indicate that upgraded schools are needed in the rural areas to accommodate the sophisticated skills demanded by technological development in the cities. While studies have indicated attitudinal differences between rural and urban youth, these differences are not nearly so important as the educational differences manifest in knowledge and skill differentials, for these differences impact upon the total qualitative development of Poland's economy.

The needs assessment was viewed as the process of ascertaining the decision areas of concern. This was accomplished by establishing potential educational goals or objectives, determining which of these were of highest priority, and then determining the extent to which the existing educational program met these objectives. Discrepancies between intended outcomes and actual performance outcomes represented the area of needs. A needs assessment model was developed by the BIA's Division of Evaluation and Program Review. This model included the following steps: determination of goals by Indian people, selection of goals, selection  of appropriate objectives by the school, assessment of learner behavior on selected objectives, and plans and programming to meet the needs.

On May 24 and 25, 1972, a general on-site evaluation was conducted. Evaluation objectives were to: examine the documented basis on which the project was approved and funded in terms of the original proposal and contract, program and project objectives, and performance criteria as reflected in the proposal and contract; evaluate the 1971-72 school year program; and provide formative evaluation data on which to make effective  and efficient planning decisions for the 1972-73 contract year. The evaluation was conducted within the following categories: needs assessment and establishment of overall objectives, administration, staffing, student and program data, materials, facility and support services, and community support and involvement. It was found that impressive progress was made toward their objectives. This progress was observable in many aspects of the community and school, but most significant was the fact that together the Board and school administration were making rational and informed decisions toward systematically improving the educational programs for Ramah youth.

Findings indicated that Ramah Navajo High School in its third year was beginning to overcome many of the early problems that face a contracted community-controlled educational venture of this type. Many school employees and members of the Navajo community expressed confidence in the continuing development of the school and in its role in the  Indian community. Evidence indicated that the Ramah Navajo High School student body had shown an increasing interest in education and a more positive attitude toward schooling. Evidence of student social development showed that students initiated conversations more readily; they voiced their opinions and made their wishes known; and they expressed greater confidence and pride in themselves, in the school and in the community.

Encounters between peasants and functionaries can be conceived as ceremonies incorporating ritualistic forms (actions, gestures, movements, etc.), the times and places in which these forms occur, and the instruments of ceremony. Analysis of these ceremonial forms reveals social roles and acts which demonstrate that the peasant-functionary encounter is invariably under the functionary's control and constitutes an asymmetrical interaction, manifest in peasant ceremonies of submission. When these ceremonial forms of encounter are couched in the  ideology of the dominant society's &quot;truths&quot;, the &quot;inferiority&quot; of the peasant is construed as a question of lifestyle, mentality, and overall expectations. The conception of rural development programs as sets of expectations should provide opportunity for both the State and the peasants to develop a currency of expectations, but given the asymmetry of the peasant-functionary encounter, the peasant may engage in ceremonies of submission for purposes of maintaining his &quot;underlife&quot;, while the State may create the illusion of change and use the bureaucracy to dampen peasant demands.

In order to accomplish these goals, Nigerian agriculture is going to have to engage in a comprehensive modernization effort that takes into account the institutional, technical, social, economic, and educational factors currently impeding change. Among these factors are: a communal land tenure system that deters land sales and new ownership, population mobility, investment of improvement capital, and agricultural  innovation; a population drain from the rural areas caused by urban migration, farm drudgery, low farm profits, and the poor status rating of farm occupations (the average age of Nigerian farmers is 45, as the youth are seeking other occupations); an extension service that lacks qualified personnel, (one agent to 10,000 families), problem specific research, and peasant oriented personnel; a poorly structured credit system which lacks accessability, sufficient operating capital, professional management, etc.; and a social system that discourages the influence of &quot;strangers&quot;.

By November 30, 1974, several important considerations had prompted various modifications in the original scope of work. These included: discontinuation of the learner and family centered components; integration of the community, school, and family centered components; arrangement  for a site for installing the integrated strategy; procurement of a second field test site; development of an evaluation plan for measuring the extent to which the strategy could produce desired outcomes; and addition of a diffusion planning component. As of November 30, 1975, the integrated RFD Strategy was being installed in a field site in Southeastern Utah; proto-type versions of the six specified products had been developed; the specifications for a seventh product had been prepared; a second field test site had been procured in Northeastern Washington; the evaluation plan had been developed; and a nine-state diffusion effort had been initiated.

The values examined (via mail questionnaires) were: intellectualism; kindness; social skills; loyalty; academic achievement; physical development; value of status; honesty; value of religion; self-control; creativity; and independence. Results indicated: consensus concerning values  was not generally higher in rural communities than in non-rural ones, with the possible exceptions of physical development and the value of religion; rural communities placed a higher value on the importance of loyalty, honesty, religion, and self-control, but the remaining 8 value dimensions did not exhibit such a relationship; the model was substantiated and explained to some degree failure of the data to support the other hypotheses, since the degree of rurality was directly related to only 3 of the 12 value dimensions. It was concluded that as rural communities become more diversified, the probability of identifying a rural value system will decrease. (JC)",

In September 1974, the BIA established student rights and due process procedures. All BIA schools were to develop a student rights and responsibility (SRR) program, initiated at the local school level and submitted through channels to the Indian Education Resources Center (IERC) for review and filing purposes. The program was to be implemented by January 1, 1975. The IERC was to conduct conferences in Student Rights and Responsibilities, maintain an accurate filing system, review the SRR programs, and conduct a follow-up and evaluation of the programs in the BIA. A SRR school report instrument was designed to determine if each  school had developed and incorporated the basic guidelines established for SRR. To date, 206 SRR programs had been received, reviewed, approved, and filed by the IERC. Copies of the review guide, SRR Check Sheet, and school report form are appended. (NQ)",

Hoksila lived a long time ago on what is now the Rosebud Sioux Reservation. He was growing up when the old Indian ways and culture were still intact but threatened. Winona was to be gifted in medicine and healing. It was not uncommon among the Plains Indian groups for women to have skills and gifts in medicine. These women were honored and respected. They played an important role among the people. Winona was to be one of these highly respected women. The Hoksila stories are: &quot;Hoksila&quot;, &quot;Hoksila and the Wolf&quot;, &quot;The Peace Pipe&quot;, &quot;The Vision&quot;, and &quot;The Wasicu&quot;. The Winona stories are: &quot;Winona&quot;, &quot;Winona and the Fawn&quot;, &quot;Winona at 'On The Tree'&quot;,&quot;Winona Becomes a Woman&quot;, and &quot;Winona and the Sacred Medicine&quot;. The two teacher manuals accompanying the readers give: motivational information to present prior to reading each story; discussion questions to stimulate thought and to assure that all children learn from the story; a worksheet to be used by the children individually to further reinforce their learning; and suggested activities to correlate with the story. The suggested activities do not require special materials or equipment. (Author/NQ)",

This decision was based on two reports which gave the following reasons: adequate facilities existed at schools on or near the Navajo Reservation to meet the students' needs; the Navajo Tribe's policy that Navajo students be educated on the reservation; and the high costs for operating the school. Tribal Councils and Indian leaders and organizations opposed the BIA's decision. In January 1973, an All Indian Study Commission was formed to determine &quot;whether or not adequate need existed by students of Tribes other than Navajo to permit maintaining the Intermountain school at the 800 student level  for the 1974-75 school year&quot;. This report presents the: All Indian Study Commission's report, BIA's response, and Navajo Area School Board Association's resolution. Updated information is given on: the Intermountain school's monthly enrollment and attendance; off-reservation boarding school enrollment for 1972, 1973, and 1974; off-reservation boarding school admissions policies regarding program planning and development, attendance boundaries and student eligibility; the House on Appropriations instructions regarding the Intermountain school; and BIA's school facilities planning policy.

Four of the non-Indian children lived on the Yakima Reservation and attended the same preschool program as the Yakima children; the other five lived in the Palo Alto, California, area. Recording time varied from about 20 to 40 minutes, depending on such activities as recess and lunch time. Conversation topics were selected by the children using colored pictures. Discourse features examined were answering and asking questions, interruptions, pauses, and organization of material. It was found that Yakima children: were more eager to engage in conversation but failed to respond to more  questions than the non-Indian children, guessed at answers less often, paused longer before answering, never interrupted, asked more questions, never corrected the investigator, and used a narrative register where the non-Indian children used a discourse register. The differences found were attributed primarily to cultural differences. (NQ)",

The shift to compulsory secondary education as accomplished during the 1971-75 five-year period has established education as a major factor in the socioeconomic development of the USSR; wherein, education is perceived as both a means and a goal. The combination of economic necessity and social need for increased education is evidenced by the current growth rate of USSR education, and scientific and technological change in agriculture and the decline in rural population has made increases in the educational level of the rural population a State goal of primary importance. Currently,  rural schools lag behind urban schools in terms of qualified educators; materials, facilities, and technological equipment; transportation; cultural advantages; and diversified curriculum. However, if perceived in terms of its own potential, the rural school could afford numerous advantages. Among these are opportunities to teach via: immediate closeness to nature; practical application; economic initiative and independence; diverse skills in classes of technical instruction; etc. Since rural education is inevitably associated with urban education, programs must be oriented toward future possibilities and the needs of the society rather than toward maintaining the status quo.

While agricultural technology has improved the quality of life in the Romanian village, the schooling network has been structured according to urban models and the professional aspirations of village youth have been geared to urban pursuits thereby depriving the villages of their human potential. The program for modernizing rural patterns assumes youth settlement in the villages, as this would provide for demographic balance and the initiative of a young labor force in both agricultural and non-agricultural rural jobs. Transformation of agricultural work into a variant of industrial work and the  normalization of rural-urban values constitute the fundamentals of the modernized rural patterns necessary to avert rural to urban migration among the young. Employing favorable propaganda, rural modernization should encompass: gradual implementation of industry; agrarian-industrial high schools which incorporate area-specific curricula; encouragement of both farm and worker activities; development of the village as a social community capable of embracing industrialization and preserving traditional values; and application of economic benefits toward better rural housing, cultural institutions, and social services.

A survey of BIA Central Office was conducted to: determine the total scope of Education Information currently being reported; identify the methods being used in developing the information; determine those developments that will add to and/or replace existing information; and provide an analysis of Education Information with recommendations. The existing situation was divided into three groups of systems: Education Information System, extant sub-systems created and maintained by administration, and extant sub-systems within education. Together these totaled 30 sub-systems. As a result of the survey, the BIA's  computer modernization program was begun. An Education Information System was proposed. The proposed Education Information System is composed of 6 Information Categories and 23 sub-systems. The six Information Categories are: School Operations, Facilities, Public School Assistance, Career Development, Education Research and Evaluation, and Building Maintenance. Although the Bureau's computer modernization program is having some frustrating moments for Fiscal Year 1976, there is spontaneous support throughout BIA, at all levels, for modernization.

In the order of their popularity, the major Polish research methods are: inquiry; the memorialist approach; a combination of inquiry and free statement; monographic research; and synthesis. Major methodological disparities involve standardization of definitions re: activities; age differentials; educational and socio-occupational groups. While most Polish researchers recognize the barriers to leisure time participation as incorporating psycho-social, cultural, temporal, spatial, and financial factors, they do not treat these factors equally. Despite the lack of standardized  research procedures, research results on leisure time and rural youth indicate the following general trends: (1) the higher the educational level of rural youth, the greater the leisure aspiration; (2) cultural barriers are more persistent than spatial barriers; (3) cultural interest is most frequently expressed via TV and movie leisure time activities; (4) while accepted as a growing rural value, leisure is by no means universal due to poor and unevenly distributed facilities; (5) youth best capable of utilizing leisure are the better educated with non-agricultural jobs and the socio-politically oriented young farmers who are members of the Rural Youth Union.

The size of the rural youth population is considerable (25,013,948 out of a total youth population of 93,313,518 in 1970). The majority of rural youth are white (85%) and concentrated in the southern states; blacks constitute the second largest proportion, but rural American Indian youth constitute one-third of the total Indian population. Significant cultural and social variations have been observed in studies reflecting occupational aspiration differentials among rural youth of ethnic groups living in comparable areas. Prior to 1950, rural youth differed qualitatively from urban youth in their  occupational aspirations and were not generally college oriented. By the late sixties, rural youth had adopted the success ethic of the middle class, and current available evidence indicates U.S. rural and urban youth do not differ significantly in their basic values and aspirations, though some scattered research indicates rural youth may differ generally in social behavior patterns, cognitive skill development, and normative roles. Longitudinal studies indicate a shift in the values of rural youth (lowered occupational/educational aspirations, earlier marriage and smaller families, and decreased urban migration). The development of rural youth should center upon policy aimed at educational equalization. (JC)",

Information was gathered via self-administered questionnaires from: all graduating seniors in Ontonagon County, Michigan (1957/58, 1968, and 1974); 21 high schools serving 4 selected areas of Kentucky and West Virginia (seniors in 1968, 1969, and 1970); and the terminal classes of 15 ungdomsskole serving 3 selected areas in Norway (1968, 1969, and 1970). Major variables examined were: socioeconomic status; plan for further  education; scholastic performance; and normative parental support. Results indicated: that among the Norwegian and the Kentucky/West Virginia study populations, both socioeconomic status and general parental interest exerted a marked influence upon educational success, with sex differences in educational plans being most disparate at the lower socioeconomic levels and among those perceiving strongest parental support; in Ontonagon County, the traditional sex differences and patterns of influence observed in 1957/58 had radically altered by 1968, with females demonstrating higher aspirations than males but enjoying less opportunities.

Instructional unit sequences included a Structure Based Unit Sequence (SBUS) and a Test Determined Unit Sequence (TDUS). The SBUS was based on an analysis of major concepts; units including concepts considered prerequisite to other units were put into the sequence on that basis. The TDUS began with the unit on which students scored highest on an achievement pretest and moved progressively to units represented by lower mean achievement scores. The two forms of control for within-unit experience sequences were Teacher Directed Experience (TDE) and Student Selected Experience (SSE). TDE subjects followed a teacher-prescribed sequence while SSE subjects  used lists of objectives and related activities to select within-unit sequences. The findings included: treatment groups did not differ significantly in biology achievement or attitude toward the biology course; subjects in all treatment groups made highly significant gains in achievement; and SSE subjects used significantly more time than TDE subjects on two instructional units. A combination of factors which included SAT-mathematics score, grade point average, and the score from a biology achievement pretest were the best predictors of biology achievement. (Author/MH)",

Two courses utilizing two instructional approaches were used; 62 students were enrolled in Fundamentals of Algebra I, and 39 were enrolled in Intermediate Algebra at two urban community colleges. Two instructors were involved. All students were given lists of behavioral objectives during the first week of the  semester and those who received instruction by the individualized approach were given additional literature describing individualized instruction. All students took pretests and posttests during the first week and last (fifteenth) week of the semester, respectively. During the fourteenth week, all students were given a problem solving task. Data were submitted to an analysis of covariance with pretest scores serving as the covariate. Results indicated no significant differences in attitude or achievement for the two groups.

A questionnaire administered to the experimental group the last week of each semester provided information on student acceptance of the PLATO method of instruction. At the conclusion of the study, preliminary data indicated that PLATO had the potential to become an effective educational adjunct by: (1) increasing student comprehension of lesson material; (2) actively engaging students in learning processes; (3) significantly reducing the amount of time spent by  students on lesson materials; and (4) contributing to higher examination scores. Data tables and graphs and questionnaire items and responses are included. (Author/MH)",

A descriptive language for juggling movements is developed and a taxonomy of bugs is presented. The remainder of the paper is concerned with an empirical determination of the characteristics of an ultimate theory of juggling movements. The data presented are relevant to the computational issues of control structure, naming, addressing and subprocedurization. (Author/SD)",

Initially all students used the \"Turtle\" sequence; in latter portions of the course participants selected or designed their own projects; most investigated the juggling sequence. Results of the study indicated that the teachers learned the materials, and were able to apply their knowledge. They differed from children using the system in that they generally knew what they wanted but sometimes did not know the appropriate LOGO vocabulary. On the whole, they were less  willing to try new ideas than children were. In general, they were enthusiastic about the system and anxious to have their students use it. (SD)",

A sample of 120 students was divided into three groups of 40; group members received a questionnaire concerning concepts covered, a questionnaire about sections of the unit, or a test on the material. Approximately half of the students in each group returned the questionnaires. The concept questionnaire asked students to rate their prior familiarity, effort needed to understand, and current understanding of each concept identified in a conceptual analysis of the unit. These ratings were submitted to a multivariate analysis of variance. The sections of the unit were rated, and data  analyzed similarly. Several relationships were uncovered: difficulty of concepts was predicted by amount of effort, and the time needed per section of a unit was related to level of concepts, number of diagrams, and number of lines in the text.

Subsequent to the AERA meeting the papers were revised. The paper by Fox reviews results of several contests to identify junior high school students who were precocious in mathematical ability, and subsequent instructional experiments aimed at improving the mathematical achievement of able girls. Aiken's paper presents factor analytic data concerning sex differences in attitudes toward mathematics and discusses several hypotheses to explain these differences. Armstrong's paper discusses results of factor analytic studies of sex differences in mathematics achievement and intelligence. Fennema's  paper focuses on the role of spatial ability in learning mathematics and the relationship of this ability to sex differences in mathematics achievement. (SD)",

Four treatment groups, ability grouped and open teaching, heterogeneous and open environment, homogeneous and self-contained environment, and heterogeneous and self-contained, were employed. The first two groups were team taught. Data were analyzed utilizing an analysis of covariance for the four groups. The pretreatment mathematics subscore served as a covariable for analysis of the post achievement mathematics subscores. Chi-square was used to determine differences in interaction patterns. Results indicated no differences between the groups on achievement  of mathematical concepts, but a small difference favoring the groups which were not team-taught. Students in homogeneous classes reported more friction in their classrooms than those in heterogeneously grouped classes. There were no differences on the competition scales. (Author/SD)",

The divergent interpretations of science of several science philosophers are examined and used to develop five dimensions of the analytical scheme. Selected philosophical analyses of the concept of teaching are described and interpreted, yielding six more dimensions. An initial assessment of its applicability is made by using the analytical scheme to examine arguments in eight passages selected from a sample of textbooks which discuss methods of teaching science. As developed, the analytical scheme may be used by science teacher educators in the design and evaluation of various aspects of their programs; several possible applications are  noted. The theoretical perspectives developed in the study provide a sound conceptual basis for research concerned with views of science and teaching actually held by teachers, views implied by teachers' teaching behaviors, and processes by which views or teaching behaviors actually do change.

The procedures for each instructional group included both watching a discrepant event until six acceptable hypotheses were written and individual discussion during which the investigator evaluated each of the six hypotheses according to standards that reflected the type of reinforcement and instruction the student received. The seven dependent variables determined by this study were: both the quantity and quality of written hypotheses following intensive instruction, both the quantity and diversity of written information search questions following intensive instruction, the diversity of information  search questions during the group discussion, and both the quantity and quality of written hypotheses after the group discussion. The conclusions included: (1) participants who received intensive instruction which emphasized either differentiated reinforcement, criteria, or both, generated a higher quality of written hypotheses, following intensive instruction, than participants who received undifferentiated reinforcement or no intensive instruction; and (2) no form of hypothesis generation intensive instruction improves the participants' ability to generate a greater quantity or diversity of written information search questions following intensive instruction.

In two other papers, the mathematics that provides the goals for instruction is considered. In the fifth paper, a model for learning mathematics that is similar to the traditional models used in the physical sciences is presented; the use of clinical interviews in  building an adequate model of learning mathematics is discussed in the next paper; and in the final paper, several major principles in a Piagetian-oriented model are examined.

All of the students in grades 5 through 8 in one school system (a total of 6186 students) were given a questionnaire to determine their algorithmic confidence and a computational test for each of the four basic arithmetic operations on whole numbers. Addition and multiplication tables accompanied the test. Data on 5440 responses were used in the analyses. \"Low achievers\" on a particular computation test were defined as those students scoring more than one standard deviation below the mean of that test. There were a total of 267 low achievers on the  addition test, 734 on the subtraction test, 735 on the multiplication test, and 985 on the division test. Of these low achievers, 226 expressed high algorithmic confidence in addition, 576 in subtraction, 513 in multiplication and 440 in division. The investigator concluded that for each arithmetic operation there were a substantial number of low achievers who expressed high algorithmic confidence. (DT)",

The purpose of the present study was to follow up the results through interviewing low achievement-high confidence students in order to ascertain if they believed in their high confidence and to discover their reason(s). The test used in the previous study was administered to all 126 students in grades 5, 6, and 7 of one school and 19 students were selected to be interviewed personally. The interview consisted of re-administering of the confidence test on all four operations and retesting, as well as questioning each subject on some of the items of an operation in which he was high in  confidence, but low in achievement. Results showed that the confidence test appeared to give a consistent measure of the students' confidence. Students interviewed did believe in their high confidence. The report closes with a list of ten reasons given by students for their high confidence. (DT)",

On the basis of population growth evidence, the author presents the following opinions: (1) the potential of education as a policy instrument to influence family size is great but ignorance of the mechanisms through which education may affect fertility is also large; (2) economic policies that directly influence wife's wages, a couple's contraceptive behavior, and the early health and nutrition of children may be a more effective and quicker means of reducing family size than support of adult education; and (3) the trade-off that parents appear to make between the number of children they want and the investments they make in each child may be the key to middle- and  long-term population policy in developing nations. The author concludes that the scarcity of economic resources makes continued research on policy instruments, like education, essential. A bibliography is included in the document. (Author/DB)",

Each choice is followed by several options, all requiring the player to turn to another page and encounter yet another set of options. All game options eventually lead to seven questions: (1) Do you feel the failure was Debbie's fault? (2) What do you think will happen to Debbie next? (3) What groups and  agencies in Debbie's community could have given her information, encouragement, and moral support? (4) How could Debbie's situation have changed? Who could have changed it? (5) How could Debbie's parents, teachers, and counselors have prepared her to become an independent, confident, self-fulfilled woman? (6) How could they have halped her avoid getting trapped?

        "author":["Vallance, Elizabeth"],
        "description":"This paper proposes that curriculum theorists replace abstract language with more descriptive terms in order to achieve productive criticism, and it examines issues inherent in such a change. American educational discourse, traditionally focused on technical rationales, encourages theorizing, but a descriptive, aesthetic rationale might facilitate better an understanding of the immediacy of the curriculum experience. Similarities between curricula and \"works of art\" strengthen this innovative idea. Inherent assumptions, which must be verified empirically, involve (1) appropriateness of considering curriculum and a work of art in the same context, (2) educational significance of curriculum materials' aesthetic qualities, (3) ability of a critic's perception to illuminate  perceptions of others who encounter the work, (4) capacity of curriculum material quality to indicate quality of the experience, (5) similarity of critic's and student's experiences, (6) validity of artistic terms when applied to curriculum materials, and (7) identification of critical aesthetic terms beyond those derived from art criticism. Accuracy of critical perceptions must be studied. This new approach can be justified if more practical attempts at aesthetic criticism are made, if insights are found useful in practical situations, and if audience judgment has an influence on quality of school experience.

Children ranging in ages from 9 to 16 and elderly adults ranging in ages from 60 to 90 were grouped by age into small and large rooms. Each group sat silently for 30 minutes in the rooms while skin conductance equipment measured their level of stress. The results indicated that crowded children had greater increases in stress than did their uncrowded peers. Both boys and girls reported great discomfort from the physical proximity of others in the crowded room and expressed greater feelings of annoyance following crowding. In contrast, elderly adults in the crowded room did not indicate feeling confined but regarded their room as cozier than did the  uncrowded subjects. These subjects felt less aggressive, less afraid, less scrutinized, and friendlier in the crowded room. In addition, the adults in the crowded room characterized members of their group in a more positive light than did those in the uncrowded room. The implications of these findings on housing for the elderly are mentioned. (Author/DE)",

Although pictures which depict cultural and natural landscape conditions are readily available, the methods by which pictures should be used in the classroom to produce the greatest impact on learning need to be carefully considered by the teacher. This publication describes procedures for classifying, grading, and using pictures in the classroom for maximum results. The basic criterion for the selection and use of a picture in geography instruction is its geographic quality. Pictures may be classified as possessing primary, secondary, or tertiary geographic quality on the basis of the portrayal of cultural and natural landscape items and the geographic relationships shown or suggested.  Gradation in picture study is based on the degree of interpretative ability required to make the desired use of the picture. Pictures can be used for presenting either reconnaissance or detail. Reconnaissance use may be helpful for the introduction of material, presentation of disconcerting data, diagnostic testing, and cross-country presentation. Detailed pictures may be useful for creating a learning situation, orientation, definition, interpretation, checking, summary recall or review, and testing. The still picture from photographs and slides is easier to use for teaching geographic concepts than the motion picture, and captions can sometimes be helpful. Pictures cannot stand alone in geographic study, but need follow-up study and research, interpretation, and classification.  (ND)",

        "description":"The booklet is designed to acquaint geography teachers with a variety of projected media materials and with effective techniques for their use in the classroom. Projected media include slides, filmstrips, opaque and overhead projections, and motion pictures. The use of projected media helps teachers simplify, clarify, analyze, and synthesize relationships between man and his environments. Using media in the classroom helps students form clear mental pictures of geographical principles, patterns, and concepts. One major advantage in using projected media is that teachers can prepare materials in advance that are specifically suited to the presentation of a particular topic. For media to be used successfully, teachers must adequately plan and relate the medium to the chosen topic.  This booklet is divided into sections on various media, each containing discussion of the nature of the medium, advantages, disadvantages, special considerations, and selected references. Slides are flexible, available, inexpensive, easy to use, and combinable with other projected media. Filmstrips require a minimum of commentary, present a sequential development of an idea, are inexpensive, and contain informational captions. Overhead projectors allow the teacher to maintain eye contact with students, project many objects, and control the pace of the presentation; however, they are costly, require special storage facilities, and create distortion of images. Although motion pictures add realism to learning, offer technical flexibility, and are easily available; they are complex and  expensive. The use of projected media involves principles of selection, introduction, facilities, presentation, and follow-up. (ND)",

The author suggests that the home community should be the base of operations in geographic learning at all geographic levels. The home community, the place where people have common interests, is discussed as a geographic region. The following five major elements of a community are briefly described: physical, spatial, human, cultural, and social. The elements can be studied through surveys, field trips, study of documentary materials, resource persons, map recording, preparation of pictorial and graphic materials, and participation in service projects. Suggestions for employing the techniques are provided. The use of a scientific method is  proposed for studying the home community. Steps involved in the scientific method include exploring, selecting, measuring, classifying, recording, synthesizing, interpreting, and applying. The success of home community study depends on the acquaintance of teachers with the content and methodology of geography and on their concern for social improvement. (ND)",

A discussion of the lines on a globe includes number and spacing of grid lines, parallels of latitude, meridians of longitude, direction in latitude and longitude, finding locations on a globe, and the great and small circles. How the earth is illuminated by sunlight involves its position in space. The discussion about  illumination covers artificial illumination of the globe, summer solstice, winter solstice, equinoxes, length of day and night, subsolar point, tropic lines, natural illumination, sunrise and sunset, and location of the subsolar point. The concept of time is presented in relation to light and space by describing earth as a timepiece, noon and the meridian, equation of time, analemma, time and longitude, standard time, effect of repeated time changes, international date line, and time changes on the globe.

Some of the theoretical implications of the Cuban educational reform model for other Latin American societies are examined. Prerevolutionary Cuban education was crucially deficient in its orientation to professional training and a near total rejection of practical, work-oriented skills required for national development. On taking power, Castro began a massive educational reform movement by instructing schools to mold the socialist &quot;new man&quot; dedicated to self-sacrifice and to the struggle against injustice and exploitation. The highest priority was placed on rural education and creating educational programs for urban youth which combined theoretical learning and  actual work experience in agricultural work-study programs. Six years of primary schooling has been made available to almost all rural children. Two major problems in the new educational system are (1) that over half of the children in primary schools are grade repeaters and (2) that the majority of students, even though education is available to them, continue to drop out at an early age to work or to loaf.

Settlement in southern Illinois and establishment of Jackson County are discussed briefly. The study of the educational history of the county is divided into three chronological sections. The educational heritage section, 1818-1854, investigates the first schools. It discusses the school law of 1825, subscription schools, and financing of the schools. The section on the middle period in school development, 1855-1900, presents information about town schools, school life, educating the Negro in Jackson County, the teachers, school buildings, and special schools. The section covering the modern period, 1901-present, discusses the history of country schools, teaching,  parochial schools, high schools, and consolidation of the schools. Historical data are sketchy because many records from Jackson County have been destroyed; thus, the case study is based on original research. The author believes that the case study of Jackson County can provide generalizations that are applicable to other locales. (ND)",

First, the structure of Soviet secondary and higher education is outlined. Then, a description is given of the July 1973 Fundamentals, a legislative statement of principles focusing on the Soviet ideal of the education system. Equal educational opportunity, free tuition for all education after kindergarten, and citizen right to enroll in higher education with appropriate prior education are emphasized. Comparative statistics are given for Soviet and U.S. education in terms of specific education levels, nationality groups, and women. Trends in Soviet education include the (1) growth of nursery, kindergarten, and upper-secondary school enrollments; (2)  increase in the general education component in vocational schools; (3) large role of secondary schools for technical specialization; and (4) continuing focus in higher education on developing specialists to serve the needs of the national economy. Soviet educational needs include revising the curriculum, improving the teaching quality, and broadening the training of specialists. (AV)",

        "description":"The author briefly examines how educational reform attempts in Cuba since 1959 have taken place and how they have been related to social, economic, and political change efforts in the society at large. The Cuban educational system makes a significant contrast against the failure which characterizes the other Latin American educational systems. Cuban efforts have made important strides toward creating a new socialist man upon whose deeds and accomplishments Castro's Marxist society can rest. On taking power, Castro instructed all Cubans on how inequities and inefficiencies in the educational system reflected the consequences of economic and cultural domination. Education has been selected to serve as the instrument of individual and social change. Both the formal school system and  the out-of-school educational sector have been vastly expanded and reoriented. In the formal school system, elimination of private schools after 1961, increased budgetary inputs, community pressure, and vigorous enforcement of extended attendance requirements have all contributed to skyrocketing public school enrollment figures. Revolutionary Cuba has, for the first time in Latin America, created a social context where aspirations of educational reform have been brought into harmony with work opportunities and national development goals. It remains to be seen whether other Latin American countries will be able to draw from this experience. (Author/DB)",

Written as an historiography exercise by students at Chelmsford High School, the study is intended to acquaint residents and students of Chelmsford with the town's past and its relationship with surrounding communities and the United States. Chapter one, &quot;A Colonial Settlement Develops,&quot; describes geographic features and records Chelmsford's economic, political, and social development into a typical Puritan community. Chapter two, &quot;Chelmsford Prepares for Independence,&quot; provides information on the town's prerevolutionary political activities and on its war experience. Chapter three, &quot;Chelmsford at the Edge of Industrial America,&quot; chronicles the town's economic development during and immediately following the  Civil War, at which time Chelmsford lost much of its most promising industry to larger towns. Chapter four, &quot;Twentieth Century Chelmsford,&quot; describes the town's &quot;coming of age&quot; with the post World War II growth in defense and space industries. The authors conclude that Chelmsford presently is a mature suburban community facing the continuing task of preserving and improving its quality of life. A postscript, bibliography, and summaries of each chapter are included. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"Types of land-use issues which form current problems in urban areas are discussed in this paper. The majority of these environmentally based issues revolve around the management of water. The five most often encountered water-oriented issues are denoted in rank order of importance. First, an ample water supply which is free from contamination must serve as a finite limit on municipal growth. second, sewage disposal needs to be provided by on-site systems such as septic disposal and spray irrigation or by off-site systems such as lagooning, small package plants, or large regional sewage treatment plants. Third, storm runoffs, generated by development, need to be controlled. Fourth, erosion and sedimentation, occurring at an enormously accelerated rate due to the activity of man,  need to be managed. Fifth, flood plains must be managed, which becomes increasingly necessary as each new structure built in the flood plain obstructs the stream flow and reduces the area available to the stream to convey flood waters. The pervasiveness of water as an element in land-use issues necessitates rational management of the hydrologic cycle in a reasonable urban planning goal. (Author/DB)",

The bill proposed that the center be directed by a board of 12 trustees which would include four members appointed by the President and eight members appointed by the Librarian of Congress. The subcommittee hearings reflect the opinions of 18 representatives of Congress, numerous librarians, chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, folklorists, artists, musicians, and students. Also submitted for the record were six letters supporting the bill.

The first issue deals with the application of competency-based curriculum to teacher education, focusing on teacher growth and evidence of pupil progress. The second issue, on public doublespeak, features an interview with a member of the National Council of Teachers of English in which the relation of language to public policy is discussed and classroom techniques for preparing children to cope with commercial propaganda are presented. Historian Willa K. Baum explains in the third issue how the methods of oral history can help students gain both social skills and a concern for  social action in addition to academic skills. In the fourth issue, on the subject of death and dying, Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross maintains that inclusion of more courses in death education would encourage students to adopt less judgmental, destructive, and materialistic standards. The format of each four-page bulletin differs slightly, but generally each includes a definition of the topic, interviews with leaders in the field, abstracts of ERIC documents related to the topic, a book review, descriptions of related games and learning activities, classroom activities, and a bibliography of books and multimedia products in the field.

Thirteen activities are designed to help secondary students develop an understanding of the status of women in U.S. society as compared with other cultures. These activities show how toys and books promote sex stereotyping for children, and how advertising and merchandising techniques promote images of the housewife versus the working man. Students are encouraged to ask grandparents about their life-styles, compared with current styles. Readings and statistical charts show how women's legal rights and literacy vary among countries. Nine additional activities focus on women as significant factors in the  world population. Activities include readings which illustrate the childbearing attitudes of women as the result of social pressures. For instance, career opportunities in the United States encourage women to have few children, but in developing countries large families are regarded as economic assets. In view of differing social roles of women in various countries, students assess their opinions about population control. (AV)",

A survey of students' opinions about old people is given at the beginning and end of the unit in order to determine if attitude change has occurred during the learning activities. Students are encouraged to go into the community to talk with elderly citizens, study the types of merchandise available to various age groups, and  survey attitudes toward growing old in our society. Stereotypes of old people are identified in cartoons and greeting cards. Advertising is shown which instills values to stay young. Readings about other cultures point out differences in dealing with old people.

        "description":"This unit examines four topic areas related to police: rules and enforcement, police discretion, variety of police tasks, and police differences among societies as products of certain social pressures. High-school students learn about the police as an institution that responds to social and historical pressures. Students study police systems in several countries. Recognizing that these institutions vary, they begin looking at the police in terms of what a police system can be in the future. Teaching methods involving role-play, newspaper articles, and an inquiry process are employed. Thirteen learning activities are described. First, an examination of classroom rules followed by staged infractions provides insight into the relationships among rules, laws, enforcement, and  discretion in enforcement. Students then experience the policeman's role directly through classroom role-play with comments from an invited officer. Comparisons of police in the United States with those of other countries include a study of British unarmed police and a discussion of the implications of Chinese marriage laws. Understanding of the structure of police forces is developed through comparisons of national and local forces in various countries and through study of a chart showing the relationship of U.S. police forces to the entire U.S. criminal justice system.

Nine activities are presented in which students collect, label, analyze, and generalize about the relationship of death customs to the attitudes and needs of the living. The first activity involves completion of a checklist of fears. Next, a questionnaire is used to identify students' attitudes about death and to facilitate comparisons within the class. After a study of funeral notices from several countries, students make a chart of Indian, Chinese, and Mexican death customs based on readings. Generalizations are made, based on the data already collected. Verification is  acquired by consulting other sources such as books, professors, and films. Students then prepare a checklist of American death customs based on their own knowledge and compare it to the generalizations about foreign customs. Gravestone rubbings and kamikaze letters are used to explore various attitudes toward death. In the final activity, students practice writing eulogies. (AV)",

Most activities take the students out of the classroom and involve a study of family and community components of work and leisure. Some are individual activities, some require partners or small groups, and all are performed without continual supervision by the teacher. Activities which help students develop an understanding of a variety of ways in which time can be spent include brainstorming, doing something new with an unfamiliar person, and choosing occupations that would be useful in specific situations. The cost of leisure activity and entertainment is estimated by researching prices  at local public places. Comparisons of students' family vacation habits and distribution of chores at home provide insight into differing attitudes toward work and the roles of men and women.

Psychologists look at the individual's adjustive procedures and the evolution of those adjustments within a species. Anthropologists inquire into the behavioral similarities and differences of human cultural groupings, from earliest man to the present. Sociologists investigate the behavior of people in groups and organizations, including the patterns, regularities, variations, and developmental changes in human relations, customs, and institutions. Political scientists study the behavior of human individuals and groups, with an emphasis on the distribution and attainment of political influence and power and on the function,  organization, and connections among the political units, institutions, laws, and customs. Other disciplines examined in the book are economics, history, jurisprudence, linguistics, game and decision theory, information theory and cybernetics, and general systems theory. The book devotes a chapter to each field. In addition to the discussion, a selected bibliography and a listing of germane journals are provided for each discipline. (Author/RM)",

The following schematic expression of a comprehensive educational system committed to a humane education provides one viable educational alternative to present systems. It is intended for consideration by elementary-school personnel committed to helping pupils know people as opposed to teaching them to know about people. The system is divided into the following five phases: (1) goals which might include development of a healthy  self-concept, assuming responsibility for one's own actions, accepting self and others, and taking advantage of educational experiences; (2) theoretical base which encompasses social interaction, curricular development, community and parent involvement, and student and teacher personal growth; (3) objectives which should be decided on by the school staff and by parent and community committees; (4) instructional program which can best be devised by the school staff; and (5) evaluative design which will include input from teachers, children, administrators, and parents.

It contains five sections of the instrument: (1) Product Characteristics; (2) General Educational Quality of Materials; (3) Ethnic Heritage Content; (4) Adaptability of Materials to Conditions of Use; and (5) Overall Evaluation. The questions in section 3, Ethnic Heritage Content, focus specifically on the treatment of ethnic groups  in the materials and they analyze issues such as stereotyping, realism, accuracy, and appreciation of other cultures. Part II is an abbreviated edition of the CMAS to be used when a quick evaluation is necessary. The book is included in an Ethnic Heritage Studies Kit, along with other books, a filmstrip, and a cassette. The kit is available from the SSEC for $29.00. (Author/DB)",

The design of the classroom sessions is described in detail to help other teachers use or adapt it to their own situation. Three benefits to the students of such a project are cited: (1) appreciation of methods behind research conclusions and heightened critical awareness as consumers of research findings, (2) involvement in a work experience which could become a career or some aspect of a career, and (3) shattering of the \"egocentric fantasy\" through empirical testing of their assumptions about reality. General issues about conducting the project are explored, including scheduling during the course, permissions for students to interact with groups within or outside the school, and evaluation.  Project sessions occur during two or three weeks with five class periods a week of 45 minutes each. Steps which can be followed in organizing a research project are given. The focus of the first week is on establishing interest and rapport among student groups, choosing a topic, and developing hypotheses. Development of a survey, selection of a sample and the survey method, practice administration of the questionnaire, and actual administration and data collection occur during the second week. In the third week, students tabulate data, create summary matrices, draw conclusions, summarize and distribute results, and evaluate the project as a learning experience. (Author/AV)",

It is hoped that stereotypes about the primitiveness and simplicity of African cultures can be counteracted by the study of the complexity and variety within their oral traditions. The important roles of the oral tradition are socialization and transmission of values. Inclusion of the study of oral traditions will expand the scope of black studies into other subject areas--art, literature, music, drama, and speech--thereby facilitating greater student involvement in black culture. Also, students will see different kinds of relationships between various countries of the Americas, their black populations, and Africa. Extensive  descriptions are given of the five general types of African oral literature: prose; poetry; drama; drum; and contemporary forms, such as popular songs and films. For each general type, the author suggests books appropriate for secondary-school curriculum and he stresses the importance of hearing the literature, not just reading it. (Author/AV)",

The series is intended to contribute to a better understanding of the educational process and the relation of education to human welfare. Chapter one provides an historical perspective of the role of alternatives in education. Chapter two discusses resistance to alternative programs and describes characteristics, purposes, and types of alternatives both inside and outside the public school system. The development of alternative schools in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and the reasons for their success are examined in Chapter three. Contained in Chapter four are a discussion of programs that combine school and  community learning and an examination of the societal and educational issues which have led to the development of these programs. The search for solutions for equal education in a pluralistic society, the right to learn, and the importance of choice education are discussed in chapters five, six, and seven. The book concludes with a discussion of current developments in educational alternatives. (Author/RM)",

The book is divided into four chapters. The first chapter, \"Growth, Change, and Values,\" explains how environment affects learning and it explores the importance of establishing coherent educational values. The second chapter, \"The Realm of Theory,\" explores basic human needs which should be considered when creating an educational value system, and it discusses American education's present dependence on psychology. Chapter three, \"The Heavenly and Earthly Cities of Education,\"  discusses reasons for various types of discontent with education, investigates educational politics, and questions whether human development or socioeconomic improvement is the proper concern of education. The last chapter, \"Toward a Values Theory,\" reviews traditional and modern educational theories and provides guidelines for a values synthesis. The author concludes that the goal of education should be to learn how to establish an education for the whole person in his/her life span. (Author/DB)",

A noncompulsory preprimary level is followed by a compulsory 6-year primary level, in which both public and private schools teach a standard curriculum of basic skills, arts, and physical training. A bill introduced in 1970, but not yet adopted, proposes more emphasis on emotional and social development and determination of curriculum by a new method. The secondary level consists of general/academic and vocational programs, and it follows a policy of flexibility whereby students can change from one kind of program to another in response to the changing educational and social situation. Programs last from 2 years (lower general secondary) to 6 years (pre-university).  Vocational education, which includes teacher education, spans the secondary and higher education levels. Trends in the universities and institutions of specialized fields include the integration of higher technical and vocational education with university education and provisions for lifelong educational programs.

The author believes that the only things that are needed to develop an inquiry-oriented unit on mapping are a good map, a small group of students, and a perceptive teacher who can ask relevant and stimulating questions. In the first activity students study topographic and aerial maps of their home town, road atlases, and physical landform or physiographic maps. They discuss questions, such as \"What does the map tell about the river running through town?\" and \"For what purposes is an aerial photograph better than a topographic map?\" In a simulation activity students assume the role of a leader of a wagon train  who plans a trail from New York to the west coast. Other activities and questions involve students in decision making, analyzing the differences between maps, drawing maps of their own town and of the United States, collecting resource maps from the local community, and constructing three-dimensional models of cities and parks. The publication also contains a philosophical rationale for the inquiry approach and an annotated listing of mapping resources. (Author/RM)",

Following the Systems Approach for Education (SAFE) curriculum development model, a curriculum for the junior-high General Music course was designed, based on performance objectives. A teacher test booklet was developed which includes items written for each objective, criteria for achievement, and a selection of musical examples required for aural and/or visual stimuli. Student pre- and posttest booklets were compiled from the teacher test booklets, 3M Datronics test scoring forms were selected, and audiotapes were made for each of the tests. All materials were analyzed for content validity, mastery, and hierarchy. Results of field testing show  that (1) participating students improved their musical skills and knowledge, (2) participating teachers favored installing the curriculum, and (3) administrators approved extending the curriculum to all junior-high General Music classes. Extensive appendices include a course description, performance objectives, all the developed materials, requirements and constraints of the project, and an assessment system for music curricula.

        "description":"In this study of the treatment of Egypt in elementary and secondary school literature, the content of 109 textbooks and 180 supplementary works is analyzed and evaluated and recommendations for specific corrections and additions are presented. The purpose is to alert the authors of educational materials and teachers about the imperfections in literature on Egypt currently available in the United States. Specific comments are made about educational literature concerning geography; history and politics; art, architecture, language, and literature; society; and religion. A general conclusion is that the practice of presenting information which has omitted certain facts on Egypt results in the creation of negative images. Egypt is generally depicted as passive and unchanging, as  shown in discussions of ancient Egypt and the modern fellah (farmer). It is depicted as being aggressive, as shown by Nasser's purported attempts to dominate the Arab world, his attacks on Israel, and his relations with the West. It is recommended that foreign area study programs be funded, textbook publishers confer with area specialists, and authors and teachers become better informed. To encourage this, annotated booklists and lists of films are provided which give a background on Egyptian history and culture. Almost 300 books with a note on educational level, and over 200 films with a note on length are listed. Most materials were developed or published in the 1960s and 70s. (AV)",

In the first paper, \"Unraveling the Problem of Origins: An Anthropological Search for Feminist Theory,\" Rayna Reiter reviews what is known and what is not known at the present time and provides a feminist critique of the gaps in our knowledge left by a male-oriented tradition of learning. She points out that modern capitalist social organization clearly depends on the continuance of a certain kind of female subordination, but it cannot be seen as solely responsible for its origins. Although more research is required, Reiter emphasizes that there is already much evidence to suggest the ways in which the establishment of the gender hierarchy is linked to other forms of  power structures and is an inherent part of their development. The paper by Elaine Pagels, \"When Did Man Make God in His Image? A Case Study in Religion and Politics,\" shows in considerable detail how the process of establishing an orthodoxy in the early Christian Church, both in terms of correct theology and in terms of how the church hierarchy and membership are to be organized, is linked intimately to the process of taking away options for women.

Current biological research has reached the point where we must now ask such questions as: What should be the nature of the human in the future? Who should make these decisions? How should humans interact with the universe? The problems and possibilities of the biological revolution cannot be compartmentalized because they affect all areas of life. Teachers from social studies, biology, health, and humanities have found that these issues cannot be examined through the narrow perspective of only one discipline. Examining the biological revolution through the futures perspective enables students to take a multidisciplinary approach to tomorrow's critical issues today. This report describes a  series of values questions which, combined with media, materials, and activities, can be used to form a unit to help students examine the biological revolution through the futures perspective. This unit can be added to existing courses, or portions of it can be inserted wherever teachers think it would be appropriate to involve students in values clarification activities. Because the approach is multidisciplinary, materials are included that can be used in biology, psychology, government, science fiction, humanities, and futures classes. (Author/MM)",

        "description":"This publication is a collection of supportive material to aid educational personnel in planning programs for staff development and improvement. It is the result of an effort in 1973 by the Georgia Teacher Education Council's committee on staff development to devise a plan that would allow local agencies to: (1) identify student needs and the competencies needed by educational personnel to meet these needs; and (2) plan training activities for teachers, administrators, and other school personnel to prepare them to meet the identified needs. Out of this effort, Georgia's educational community was able to clarify its position on improving education, and the concept of continuous improvement of education personnel was formulated. This concept was further developed to incorporate  three beliefs: (1) that the direction of local staff development ought to be determined largely by the needs of the local students; (2) student achievement is greatly affected by the competencies of teachers and principals; and (3) the continued certification of educational personnel ought to be based on how well they demonstrate proficiency in the competencies needed for student improvement in an actual educational setting. All of these staff development efforts culminated in the development of a set of standards for certification renewal. The discussion of these standards is the heart of this publication. Included with the statement of the standards are: (1) the operational definitions of several pertinent terms not directly defined in the statement of standards; (2) a discussion of  each standard with suggestions for implementation; (3) a suggested developmental timeline; and (4) references to relevant resources that might aid in the planning and implementation of a similar program.

        "description":"During the past two decades legislatures and courts have reshaped public educational policy. The increasing public awareness of the role of law in all aspects of society and the growing complexity of the educational enterprises have catapulted teachers into litigation to an unprecedented degree. As this trend shows no signs of diminishing in the near future, teachers need to become more informed about the legal facets of their jobs. With the current emphasis on guarding students' and parents' rights, teachers often feel that they are being pressed from all directions and have practically no rights themselves. Legally, this is not true. Although an undergraduate course in school law would offer no immediate panacea, it would furnish a forum for teachers to explore the perimeters  of their rights and the legal implications of alternative courses of action open to them. Those charged with preparing future educators need to direct some immediate attention to the long neglected area of undergraduate instruction in school law. (MM)",

The Purdue Student Teacher Opinionaire (PSTO) was administered to students involved in three different types of student teaching experiences to measure the student teacher's feelings about the principal's professional competency, interest in student teachers and their work, ability to communicate, and skill in human relations. The highest ratings of rapport with the principal  were given by student teachers in conventional programs, followed by those in the Reading and Language Arts Teacher Education Program (RELATE), with the lowest scores given in the Professional Year Program, a cluster program. Five suggestions for principals to improve rapport with student teachers are given. The classroom teachers were generally positive in their evaluations of student teachers and rated the cluster student teachers high on overall preparation to teach in comparison with the preparation of noncluster student teachers they had seen or worked with previously.

The thrust of the experiment was to instill more realism in the professional courses at the Education Department and simultaneously to assist in instigating changes in the public schools. A document proposing the field experience program was submitted to persons within The Education Department. The proposal was sent to a subcommittee of a local teacher center, the local Advisory Council of Arlington, principals, and teachers. Personal interviews were arranged with principals in grades 7-12. Four basic questions were asked: (1) After having an opportunity to read the proposal, have you found any problem areas? (2) What particular aspects  need to be addressed during the orientation? (3) What ways would you get feedback from teachers in your school? and (4) Would you want to participate in such a venture? The information was collected and revised in proposal form, and the program began in the spring of 1974. The experiment for many students was a positive experience, acting as a catalyst for making a more intelligent decision about teaching as a career. It also increased the university's sensitivity towards student needs, interests, feelings, ideas, and learning styles, and helped the public schools involved to actualize many programs. An appendix contains a preservice field experience program questionnaire. (DMT)",

The overall concern of the program is to develop teachers who, in the real world public school classroom setting, obtain the best possible results from elementary age children in special and/or regular classroom settings. The MHP program enables students to obtain a B.S. degree in elementary education with (1) major certification in elementary education and (2) special education endorsement in two areas--mental retardation and emotional disturbance/behavior disorders. The MHP is thus a teacher training program designed to prepare teachers to provide educational services to regular class students and to children thought  to be mildly handicapped in the exceptional child areas of mental retardation and behavioral disorders. Other goals of the program include preparing teachers to meet the cognitive abilities and affective needs of children from different social areas. In addition to the major objective of preparing teachers who can efficiently teach a wide range of cognitive abilities and behavioral styles, MHP objectives are: (1) to specify the changes in the attitudes, knowledge, and skills of regular educators which would facilitate mainstreaming and responsiveness to the needs of the mildly handicapped children; and (2) to provide a training environment where graduate students of special education can acquire teacher training program development, implementation, and evaluation skills.

        "description":"This discussion is based on the assumption that current practice in teacher education is not working very well, but that teacher education programs can be considerably improved with some relatively minor changes. It is important that solutions for the problems identify critical weaknesses in current practice that can be overcome with relatively modest and inexpensive reforms. Chief among suggested recommendations is one for earlier field experience. Different but related reasons for implementing classroom practice very early in the training process are: (1) to develop a base of concrete perceptual images of classroom life on which later theoretical knowledge can be built; (2) to accelerate the passage through the developmental stages of teacher concerns; (3) to help the novice  decide early whether he wants to be a teacher, and (4) to reduce the number of functions student teaching is expected to fulfill. It is stated that early practice should be an intense and realistic experience recognizing the limitations of the student teacher and the functions he can be expected to perform. The chief drawbacks to early teaching experience seem to be the lack of a model of a good teacher and the danger of adopting an apprenticeship program. (JMF)",

To achieve this higher priority, alternative modes for inservice education must be developed and both universities and school systems must find ways to work cooperatively to make inservice part of the regular school day and program. Such a model was developed cooperatively by John Carroll University and the Cleveland Heights-University Heights school district for the purpose of retraining veteran teachers to move from traditional elementary classrooms to new open space elementary schools. The first phase of this project consisted of a needs assessment conducted by the University. This was carried out for each  teacher by University consultants, and the final contract, objectives, and schedule were negotiated. Based on this, the second phase consisted of three training days where teachers were released all day to work with consultants on interpersonal relations skills and classroom environment analysis and diagnosis. In the third phase clusters of three to four teachers met for an intensive planning day. Phase four was designated as the simulation experience where teachers and students tried out new environment and teaching learning styles in a simulated setting. Phase five consisted of a day away from the school on the University Campus where teachers and consultants formally evaluated the positive and negative aspects of simulation experience and set future goals. Phase six involved  implementation of the program in the new setting based on work done in phase five. (JMF)",

These experiences for preservice teachers are cooperatively planned and evaluated by teachers, administrators, parents, professional educators, and scholars from the various disciplines.

The assignment involves administering three to four Piagetian-type tasks to a child, analyzing the  child's responses according to Piagetian theory, noting the relationship between the child's cognitive skills and mathematics ability, and planning a program in mathematics instruction based on the child's apparent level of cognitive functioning. The prime significance of this assignment lies in the prospective teacher's questioning, probing, and discussion of the child's responses and, thus, a refinement in the teacher's understanding of children's thinking skills.

The model CBTE program is the primary concern of this discussion; however, arguments are mentioned for and against other such programs to give perspective to the components chosen for inclusion in the model program. Based upon current evidence, it seems that a major weakness of many CBTE programs may be that they seek to establish a singular, univariate examination of teacher performance and an isolated, oversimplified explanation of the learning situation. The model CBTE program, therefore, is developed so that the interaction of a number of variables which influence the teaching/learning situation can be observed. It takes into account  the facts that teaching performance is a complex of knowledge and teaching skills extending over a long period of time and that teaching performance can only be adequately and effectively assessed by multiple and multileveled observations over an extended period. Presented here, the Multiple Measure Model of Teacher Performance is an attempt to measure the same goal or objective by different techniques and under varying circumstances. The multiple measure approach utilizes various learning objectives (cognitive, performance, consequence, affective, and exploratory), and the criteria for performance can be derived from these objectives. In addition, the approach allows for the assessment of a single objective in two dimensions--the learning condition and the learner response.  (MM)",

The first step involves a meeting with university faculty to discuss the implications of such a program. Step two involves meeting with the elementary school principal and selling the proposed program. Step three requires approaching the elementary school faculty, describing the program to them, emphasizing both pros and cons. The final step requires that the principal have latitude to make his decision. He should make the final contact either accepting or rejecting the proposal. Additionally the paper stresses a number of points crucial to the successful selling and functioning of a field based education  program: (1) in the discussion with university faculty it is essential that they realize that they have no authority over public school teachers and their students, or the school building, and that they internalize the concept of working with elementary school faculty; (2) in talking with the principal, present a full assessment of the advantages college students in the program provide for the school; (3) in talking with the elementary school faculty, it is important to be brief, emphasize the cooperative nature of the venture, and present the list of services from which they will benefit; and finally (4) ensure that the supervising faculty and the college students involved become immersed in the elementary school environment through such activities as reading the school bulletin and  joining the PTA.

        "description":"This study examined the expressed orientations toward education of (1) preservice teachers who opted to participate in student teaching programs in minority settings; (2) preservice teachers who selected conventional student teaching placements; and (3) inservice supervising teachers from both settings. Four student teaching programs provided the subjects over three semesters (three replications). The participating student teachers were placed in Latino, American Indian, Afro-American, or Regular (white midddle class) settings. The study was designed to control for random variations from semester to semester and to consider whether or not the student teachers who selected a particular student teaching assignment shared orientations that were different from the orientations of  those who did not specify placement preferences. The large enrollment in the regular student teaching program facilitated the formulation of a random sample of 39 student teachers to serve as a control group. The Educational Preference Scale was chosen to measure the student and inservice teachers' expressed orientations toward education. An analysis of the data revealed that student teachers tend to become more like their supervising teachers with respect to their expressed orientations toward education. When student teachers were placed in cultural settings where the role expectations were contrary to their expressed orientation, it appeared that the presence of the conflicting role expectations facilitated changes in their functioning roles.

        "description":"The purpose of the two studies reported in this paper are (1) to extend knowledge about the effects of longer field experience with multiple role models (supervising teachers) upon student teachers' value orientations toward education and schooling; and (2) to document the effects that the student teaching experiences have upon the educational value orientations of these preservice teachers. Cognitive dissonance theory provides a conceptual model that allows formal discussion of attitude change effects in the student teaching situation. If a perceived disparity exists between the student and the teacher, the student will tend to adjust his value orientation in such a way as to minimize that disparity. The extent of this adaptive shift is expected to be a function of the duration  of the situation. Empirical evidence presented in this report validates the predictability and general usefulness of the dissonance model. One study took place during the 1974-75 academic year. Fifty-four student teachers taught daily, on two grade levels under two classroom teachers, and observed in the rooms of other teachers. Methods instruction was provided at the cluster schools. The cluster arrangement and diverse observational and instructional activities permitted the student to become well acquainted with many teachers in the three schools. The value orientations toward education held by the student teachers were determined three times during the program by administering the Educational Preference Scale (EPS). The EPS instrument has been shown to discriminate accurately between  groups of persons known to hold different opinions about the nature of education. During the 1973-74 year, a similar study was conducted with the same group of supervising teachers and different student teachers. (MM)",

        "author":["Wallen, Carl J."],
        "description":"A central problem in teacher education is the lack of curriculum integration in both competency-based and traditional teacher preparation programs. Curriculum integration is achieved when students are able to perceive a meaningful relationship between what they have learned in the different educational experiences in the program, and between those learnings and their subsequent performance as classroom teachers. These two relationships suggest two dimensions of curriculum integration: (1) integrating instructional experiences; and (2) integrating instructional objectives. Instructional experiences can be integrated in two ways--horizontally and longitudinally. A horizontal integration can be achieved by organizing the courses and the activities around unifying threads that  provide a basis for the students to perceive relationships. A longitudinal integration can be achieved by designing the experiences in a way that facilitates transfer of learning from an earlier experience to a new, but similar, situation. Instructional objectives are satisfactorily integrated when students are able to perceive a relationship between what they learn in a preparation program and what they do on the job as teachers. Integration of instructional objectives can be achieved through (1) utilitarian integration of instructional objectives (identifying as objectives only those behaviors that have a high likelihood of being useful in teaching) and (2) generalizable integration of objectives (designing program objectives so that they can be widely applied in classroom teaching).

        "description":"Although it has been the practice of the University of Manitoba to place the majority of student teachers in metropolitan schools, recently there has been increasing pressure to place students in rural school divisions as well. One rural school division, however, has given some evidence of distrust in the university faculty and in its methods of student teacher placement and supervision. To overcome this difficulty and establish an atmosphere of mutual trust, it was decided to conduct a two-day workshop in supervision where division principals and university faculty members could cooperatively develop a model of supervision techniques that would be useful to the principals and that would ultimately benefit student teachers placed in the rural school divisions. A model for the  analysis of instruction was developed based on the hypothesis that the observable part of the teaching act is comprised of a finite set of learned behaviors that can be identified, isolated, and practiced. Supervisory personnel could evaluate the teaching act by assigning values to these behaviors. Five elements of instruction included in the model are: (1) a statement of entering behavior describing the present status of the learner in reference to a future status the teacher thinks the student should attain; (2) a statement of observable behavior describing what the student will be able to do after mastering an objective; (3) instructional procedures utilizing exposition, questioning, demonstration, and discussion; (4) performance assessment; and (5) continuous evaluation carried on by  the teacher during actual presentation of the lesson. The workshop participants felt that they accomplished their goal of developing a structure for the analysis of instruction and that an understanding of the interpersonal relations between principals and teachers was achieved.

        "description":"An investigation of the relationship between appearance and psychological development is presented in this paper. The central hypothesis of the investigation is that appearance is an important stimulus property in the psychological development of children, and as such has an effect on an individual's response to his environment as well as the environment's response to that individual. Children are thought of as possessing stimulus as well as response properties, and development is viewed as a function of the interactions of the child and the environment. The results of the investigation support a hypothesized relationship between stimulus properties and psychological development--that appearance, self-concept, peer acceptance, IQ, and report card grades are all related. The  stimulus property is related to the performance dimension characterized by IQ, total report card, and total achievement scores. The stimulus qualities of a child are variables that not only relate empirically, but logically. The data received may be interpreted in the following way: attractive children tend to have higher IQ's, more friends, better self-concepts, and more favorable report cards than their less attractive peers. The variables, represented by the stimulus property dimension, are moderately correlated with the performance dimension. One of the limitations of this investigation is that the social status of the children was ignored. Other studies have shown achievement differences to exist within different social strata. It is possible that appearance and socioeconomic status  are positively correlated to a high degree, and that the socioeconomic status should also be considered as part of the stimulus dimension.

        "description":"The present and future conditions of elementary teacher internship programs were considered in this study. A questionnaire was mailed to 67 California teacher preparation institutions and 43 institutions selected from other states. A follow-up study was conducted one year later to determine any program revisions that were occurring in the internship programs surveyed. It was found that intern programs exist in many different forms. Some are very nearly like student teaching-- the intern works closely with a certified teacher, has limited teaching responsibility, and minimal salary. Interns in other programs resemble the regular beginning teacher-- they have full teaching responsibility and commensurate salary. Automatic placement is provided in some programs, while in others the  intern must compete with credentialed teachers for teaching positions. One institution offers the internship as the only means to becoming an elementary teacher; whereas in most cases the percentage of interns is small compared to the total number of credentials granted through the institution. Few substantial changes seem to be occurring that would suggest trends in internship programs. Most notable are those related to the over-supply of teachers and, in California, to certain requirements of the recent Ryan legislation. The elementary teaching internship exists in a great number of individual patterns. Although internships are regarded by many educators as being of limited value in times of teacher oversupply, others see them as a most promising means of teacher education.  (MM)",

The new program evolved from the professional roles that the team envisioned for its graduates and the behavioral competencies needed to fulfill these roles. A model was designed to characterize the eight primary roles performed by an effective secondary education teacher. In the reorganized program, the secondary teacher is viewed as: (1) an instructional programmer; (2) a manager; (3) a diagnostician; (4) a decision-maker; (5) an expert on human relations; (6) an evaluator; (7) an exemplar; and (8) a professional. The new program is devoted to the acquisition of teaching skills that can be viewed as the &quot;know how to&quot; objectives of  teaching, focusing on practice rather than theory. Teaching skills are identified and explained either as instructional skills or managerial skills. General understandings of education neccessary for effective teaching are identified covering eleven broad areas: philosophy, history, sources of information; organization; legal aspects; administration; secondary school teacher function and role; secondary school student characteristics; secondary school curriculum and extracurriculum; role and function of guidance; and accrediting agencies and their impact. Specific understandings restated general understandings and listed specific areas of study with performance objectives. Other areas covered in the reorganized program included: attitudes; content vs. courses; use of faculty resources;  field experiences; program evaluation; and professional experience. (MM)",

These are quite divergent and vary from school district to school district and often within individual schools. The successful operation of each teacher aide program depends on the development, implementation, and utilization of an adequate preservice and inservice educational program. Each training aspect of preservice and inservice training programs should be based upon the needs of aides, teachers, and administrators. To solicit information pertaining to the problems and issues confronting teacher aides, 50 aides in a paraprofessional training program (Career Opportunity Program) at Indiana University at South Bend were  contacted and asked to identify their most pressing concerns. They indicated that they desired clarification of their roles and duties, additional training, and they indicated a need for the development and implementation of an adequate preservice and inservice educational program. The development of preservice and inservice training programs for teacher aides is valuable in that interaction and cooperative efforts on the part of each aide, teacher, and administrator can be strengthened. A typical program should provide opportunities for each of these groups to work as a team in facilitating learning for all students. (DMT)",

The evaluation procedures formulated for the study include a process product design in combination with a modification of Pophan's performance test paradigm and Gage's adaptation of the microteaching concept. Ten preservice elementary education majors were randomly selected from the MMP and from the Mathematics Education Component of two alternative programs of teacher education (Contrast I and Contrast II) at Indiana University. Each preservice teacher (PST) was placed in a videotaped miniteaching situation where pupil learning was the criterion of effectiveness. Three teaching variables--Clarity,  Questioning, and Involvement--were analyzed, and PST mathematics knowledge relative to the teaching topic was assessed. The model yielded consistent and useful information in a short time span and in a relatively objective manner. The three dimensions of teaching style correlate highly with pupil achievement and MMP trainees achieved higher mean performance scores than other PSTs on teaching style and pupil achievement variables. Finally, pupils taught by MMP and Contrast II trainees achieved higher adjusted scores than those taught by the Contrast I group, which had no field experience in conjunction with their program of training.

        "description":"This paper develops and presents a scheme to facilitate the organization of inquiries in teacher training, and it reviews current research conducted by the faculty at Indiana University, Bloomington, in the area of teacher preparation. The paper is organized into two major sections: (1) &quot;A Scheme for Organizing Information Within Teacher Training&quot; and (2) &quot;A Review of Recent Inquiries in Teacher Training at Indiana University with Implications for Further Study.&quot; Selected criteria for organizing the collection of information in teacher training are given: (1) the necessity of documenting the characteristics of the participants in any educational venture; (2) the importance of specifying the settings in which training takes place; (3) the requirement of noting all relevant  parameters with regard to the objectives, materials, and procedures that define the educational treatment employed; (4) the indispensability of obtaining performance data that summarize the product; and (5) the inescapable responsibility of making a judgment about the merit of the educational instrument in terms either of relative or of absolute, or both, standards of excellence. Inquiries in teacher training conducted at Indiana University attempt to identify, describe, or study the major variables of instruction. They are of three general types: inquiries attempting to identify dimensions of a major variable, e.g., instructional personnel; those attempting to look at a relationship between major variables; and those attempting to look at the relationship between training variables and  training outcomes. The intent of these types of inquiries in teacher training are seen as an effort to optimize training outcomes. (DMT)",

Students spend two summers on campus pursuing graduate course work. During the academic year between these summers, students earn internship and independent study credit while working in an alternative public school. The sequence of course work is organized into four phases: Personal Exploration; Surveying Alternative Schools; Teaching Internship; and Students Teaching Students. The program has two clusters of objectives: one deals with the training of teachers, while the other focuses on public school renewal. By the time the program is completed, teachers must  demonstrate their ability to: (1) provide a comprehensive personal analysis of their abilities and conceptualize their goals as educators; (2) develop and complete an individual program of self-development designed to move them toward their goals; (3) develop a comprehensive rationale for alternative education and be able to describe and critique the types of alternatives presently in operation; (4) successfully complete the process of obtaining a field internship; (5) complete an internship in an alternative school; (6) create and implement a new educational component for the school district in which they are interning; (7) participate in the professional development of future interns; and (8) obtain a position in public education. The objectives for school renewal vary among school  districts but include the conceptualization, development, and implementation of entirely new schools, courses, and programs. (DMT)",

        "description":"Presented in this paper is a selection of qualitative indices for four educational innovations (cultural pluralism, individualized instruction, open classroom, and team teaching) prepared by participants of a continuing action lab of the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development. Participants estimated that over 65 percent of the curricular and organizational innovations in elementary schools today are falling short of their educational potential. They realized that innovation involves not only instructional materials, equipment, time redistribution, and structure reorganization, but that it involves changes in the behaviors of teachers and pupils. Participants were asked to consider specific teacher and pupil behaviors that should accompany particular innovations  and to prepare priority indices for teacher and pupil observable behaviors. These indices were to represent only behaviors that would merit inclusion on a checklist for evaluating the actual classroom success of innovations. The indices were consolidated and converted into a scale conducive to rapid, brief responses that could be used in an informal, self-evaluative manner. For each innovation, indices are provided for teacher and pupil observable behaviors relative to an evaluative rating continuum from one to five (from many observations of desirable indices to many observations of less desirable indices). A brief synthesis of the thinking of the action lab members is offered by way of eight recommendations for change for the consideration of school faculties, curriculum and  organization supervisors, teacher educators, and consultants.

        "description":"Educational institutions have at least two major functions: education and certification of competency. This paper examines the educational strengths and limitations of the mastery learning instruction model with respect to fulfilling these functions. The components of the mastery model are contrasted with components of other instructional models, and their relative advantages and disadvantages discussed in the nine sections of the paper. Components of the mastery model are identified as: (1) formal specification of a comprehensive set of cognitive objectives; (2) instruction; (3) frequent formative diagnostic evaluation; (4) corrective or remedial instruction measures to remedy learning deficiencies identified in formative evaluation; and (5) criterion referenced summative  evaluation. The advantage of mastery instruction is primarily its effectiveness for teaching basic skills and knowledge to slow learners and students who have not learned how to learn. Consequently, its optimal usefulness is in the elementary grades, especially primary grades. The model reduces competition among students and reduces student failure and frustration. It is also effective with disadvantaged students and slow learners at all educational levels. The model does not do well when implemented in traditionally organized schools with time-fixed instructional units. It does not maximize learning for all students. However, the inclusion of an idea of mastery speed along with mastery certification would make mastery grades useful for educational and vocational decision-making.  (DMT)",

        "description":"Competency Based Teacher Education (CBTE) proposes changes in the traditional teacher education system, which include establishing behavioral objectives for student teachers and modifying basic teaching tools that all students must learn to master. CBTE also proposes that teachers colleges be conducted without failure. Critics of CBTE question the effectiveness of behavioral objectives as opposed to the traditional goals of teacher education. They point out that research has not yet identified those explicit, overt teaching behaviors CBTE claims necessary. Another concern of critics of CBTE is the apparent lack of consistency among individual advocates and disagreements over principles. Despite the widespread acceptance of the theories of CBTE, there are still those who maintain  that solving the problems of teacher education is not through the learning of behavioral objectives. Their advice for reform of teacher education rests on an avoidance of the spurious claims of CBTE and a categorical denial of its questionable assumptions. Teacher education can be reformed only if entrance requirements to teacher education are stiffened- not abolished, if basic theory courses are infused with academic substance, and if methods courses remain in the curriculum. The establishment of these kinds of standards may move teacher education out of its academic morass. (DMT)",

Part one describes the design, and then summarizes the findings, of the initial phase of the center study by providing the answers to the six specific questions investigated. Part two includes possibilities and recommendations for subsequent phases of the study. Part three is speculative and questions the adequacy of current models serving as bases for teacher information from eleven separate audiences: early preservice students, cooperating teachers, student teachers, university supervisors, and principals of schools--both in and outside of centers--and center coordinators. The  professional induction experience is reflected through a variety of specific training options, supervisory behaviors, and levels of concerns. The analysis of the data consists of comparisons between center and noncenter settings, elementary and secondary levels, and between school systems and individual center locations. The basic question underlying the study is whether there are observable differences between centers and noncenters and, if so, what are the distinquishing features. For early preservice students, student teachers, and inservice personnel there appear to be a greater number and variety of exposures to training practices and instructional experiences in centers than in noncenters.

The study also laid the groundwork for a series of trait-treatment studies. During the fall of 1974, 400 Indiana University students, randomly selected from a total of 700 registering for an education course, were asked to complete a questionnaire packet including four instruments: (1) a survey of background information; (2) a measure of interpersonal needs; (3) a measure of attitude toward open and traditional education; and (4) a measure of  perception of the role of the teacher. The findings suggest that while entering preservice teachers exhibit variance in the learner characteristics of interpersonal need, attitude towards open and traditional education, and perception of teacher role, this variance is not related to the background characteristics surveyed. Background characteristics, therefore, are poor predictors of the learner characteristics of entering preservice teachers. While there are some apparent exceptions, the considerable variance found in the learner characteristics suggests that the presumption of homogeneity implied in current teacher education practices is largely unfounded. This variance suggests that uniform modes of teacher education need to be seriously reexamined and, specifically, that teacher  education would profit from individualized practices. (MM)",

A questionnaire was constructed, containing 39 items,  to yield information concerning program implementation. Personal visits and interviews were made by the principal investigator. Questionnaire responses provided information in four areas of planning and program development: (1) personnel; (2) program; (3) evaluation; and (4) major problems. In addition to this information, interviews with the administrative and faculty personnel and with officials of the Texas Education Agency identified several areas of general agreement concerning competency-based teacher education.

It is necessary to look at both cognitive and affective outcomes whenever we want to evaluate the effectiveness of teachers, or an educational program. 2. There is a need for more research on the reciprocal interactions that constitute the learning process, e.g., the ways in which student behavior and teacher behavior affect each other. 3. There are important differences in the dynamics of the learning process among students from different cultures and no single teaching style works equally well with all of them. 4. Differential educational strategies must be designed that will somewhat equalize the educational outcomes between middle class children  and the lower socioeconomic level children. 5. The emotional adjustment of students often has a powerful facilitating or deterrent effect on their mastery of cognitive skills. 6. To study each of these problems requires a research design that looks at the interacting effects of teacher and student characteristics on multiple educational outcomes. 7. The most effective learning systems deal with each student's individual learning needs. 8. The major task of the future is the implementation of these educational strategies. (JMF)",

The two ETEP studies concern the effects of teacher use of probing and redirection and teacher use of higher cognitive questions on student achievement and attitudes. The four approaches to application of the research are: (1) application through development of teacher training  programs and materials; (2) application through use of new knowledge by teachers to modify how they structure the teaching/learning situation and how they interact with students; (3) application through use of data collection procedures as instructional vehicles and as self-development tools; and (4) application through teachers serving as researchers who validate and evaluate findings as they are applied in the classroom.

        "description":"The study presented here examines whether an ethnographic approach to the study of teaching yields new insight into the teaching-learning process. Two-hundred teachers, who differed in measured effectiveness, were recruited from thirteen school districts in the state of California. Each teacher taught two experimental teaching units (ETU's) of two-weeks duration. Each ETU included an introduction to the teacher, giving a rationale for the unit; performance objectives; pre- and post-examinations for students; and a variety of instructional materials and activities. After test data were collected, posttest scores were regressed on pretest scores for each grade level. Based on class pretest means, three strata were created: low, middle, and high-achieving classrooms within each  subject area and grade level. Twelve observers were selected and trained. This included learning to read educational ethnographies, practicing in classrooms, and observing films of classrooms. The ethnographers were trained to provide both reading and mathematics protocols each day; give informal protocols based on observations during recess, talks with principals, and conversations with peers; and asked to give a summary protocol emphasizing important anthropological concepts useful for studying education. Six raters were brought together for two weeks to read a pair of protocols a day, describing a more effective and less effective classroom. They were asked to describe as many ways as possible that the two classrooms differed using any desired terminology. They generated 211  dimensions. This list was revised to 61 variables and used to do a more extensive study involving 20 raters using specially constructed rating forms. (DMT)",

The seven programs selected for study include two behavioristic models, an open school model based upon English Infant School Theory, and three other models based on particular combinations of theory and practice drawn from Piaget, Dewey, and the English Infant Schools. To study sponsor implementation, two questions were asked: (1) are the individual models consistently implemented in accordance with the sponsor prestated philosophies and objectives? and (2) do meaningful differences as planned exist among the individual sponsor  models; that is, have the planned variations actually been achieved? Another question asked is central to the primary objectives of the follow through evaluation: How are children affected by the different approaches within these planned educational programs? Four first- and third-grade classrooms were observed in 36 towns and cities. The projects included in the sample represented all geographic regions, urban and rural areas, and several racial and ethnic groups. The SRI Classroom Observation Instrument was employed to gather data about classroom environment and processes. It consists of five sections: (1) Classroom Summary Information; (2) Physical Environment Information; (3) Classroom Checklist; (4) Preamble, and (5) Five Minute Observation. The study concludes that what occurs  within a classroom does contribute to achievement in basic skills, good attendance, and desired child behaviors. (DMT)",

        "description":"Two primary lines of investigation are involved in this study of elementary school teacher effectiveness. The first focuses on individual differences in students and how these affect teacher expectations, attitudes, and behavior, and the process involved in the formation and change of expectations and attitudes. The overwhelming conclusion that the data supports is that the vast majority of teacher perceptions are accurate and based on student behavior. In those rare cases where persistently incorrect and dysfunctional perceptions are formed, the problem can be solved by building a data base to create understanding and awareness of how these problems develop. The second line of investigation focuses on the question of teacher effectiveness, particularly in producing student  learning gains. The results of the analyses indicate that relative differences in teacher effectiveness were statistically significant and reaffirmed the feasibility of identifying highly consistent teachers and studying them to seek associations between classroom process variables and student outcomes. In studying the correlates of teaching effectiveness, one basic finding was that, for many variables, teacher behavior optimal for producing student learning gains in low socioeconomic status (SES) schools was different from teacher behavior optimal for producing learning gains in high SES schools.

Before researchers can adequately establish those relationships they need to deal with the problems of instrumentation, methodology, and statistics. Workers in this area must come to grips with the inadequacy of standardized tests, the unknown predictive validity of tests from special teaching units, the problem of building multivariate outcome measures, the problems of measurement of appropriateness of teacher behavior, the lack of experience in choosing an appropriate unit of analysis for describing teaching behavior, and the  lack of stability of many teacher behaviors. Also discussed are the problems of how student background affects measures of teacher effectiveness, what subject matters should be examined, how normative standards and volunteer teachers affect what can be said about teachers and teaching, how individual students react to teaching skills, and how students monitor and interpret a teacher's behavior in ways that may or may not coincide with how educational theorists interpret the phenomena.

Florida COTE held an invitational involvement conference with approximately 200 representatives from statewide organizations of teachers, administrators, and lay persons to determine ways that twenty-three identified competencies might be included in state policy on preservice and inservice teacher education and certification. COTE drafted five recommendations to the Florida Commissioner of Education in January 1976  that would facilitate implementation.

        "description":"Teaching in a community college is unique because of the range of student goals, age levels, and backgrounds, which is greater than in most other institutions of higher education. Liberal arts instructors in the community colleges must be able to intelligently digest and rationally order the research of others, not conduct their own research projects. Reading, evaluating, and synthesizing research findings, as opposed to conducting one's own research, are unique skills. A program for preparing liberal arts instructors for two-year institutions must recognize the difference. This paper outlines a program for the preparation of teachers in academic fields at two-year colleges which should involve two years of full-time graduate study: one year to complete a master's degree in an  academic field, and a second year for student teaching at a community college, graduate courses in education, and a systematic evaluation of research methods in the academic field. Some obstacles to the implementation of such a program and their solutions are also discussed. (JMF)",

A heirarchy of levels of attitude development reveals that there is an interactive relationship betweeen knowledge and attitudes. Attitudes in the form of bipolar constructs can be changed only with hard knowledge. Credibility must be achieved for both the subject matter and the training style.

Content validity was established by having a second group of classroom teachers determine the observability of selected classroom behaviors and having faculty members match observable behaviors to children's characteristics. Concurrent validity is being established by comparing observer results to teacher ratings. Observations in the first trial run showed that teacher and researcher checklist results disagreed on an average of only seven percent of the items per child;  however, each researcher checked only those behaviors that were clearly observable during the observation period. Initial data analysis to establish interrater reliability showed observer agreement to be 85 percent. (Author/BW)",

It called for instructional groupings containing students of several grade and age levels. Teachers were to be activity coordinators for individualized instructional programs designed to strengthen students' individual skills. Curriculum content was to emphasize communication and mathematics skills taught through four symbol systems: mathematics, music, art, and reading. To facilitate their functioning in a nongraded, multilevel, multiage setting and their use of a multidisciplinary approach, teachers in the summer program were to be provided with relevant staff development. An  evaluation was carried out by the Division of Research and Evaluation in order to determine the extent to which the evaluation objectives were met and to provide information useful to future summer program planning. It included a Principal's Interview Guide, a Staff Survey Form, a Student Data Form, and an Attendance and Grade Form. A summary of the findings is reported. (BW)",

Data for the study was gathered from the administration of pre and post anxiety tests, given in conjunction with an in class psychology exam. Students in the control group used conventional IBM answer sheets, while students in the experimental group were furnished with self-scoring answer sheets. The following hypotheses were tested: (1) For the group of students using the IBM answer sheets, the pre-and posttest anxiety scores significantly differ from one another. (2) For the group of students using the self-scoring answer sheets, the pre-and posttest anxiety scores significantly differ. (3) For both groups the posttest anxiety  scores significantly differ from one another. (4) For the two groups, the mean performance scores on the psychology exam significantly differ from one another. The results indicated that none of the hypotheses were confirmed. Therefore, it was concluded that answer sheet design has no significant influence on test anxiety. (Author/BW)",

A list of competency items was compiled from the state requirements for certification, the course descriptions in the university catalog, the faculty involved, and a critical incident questionnaire completed by a sample of students. The items were placed on the backs of cards; students were asked to sort them as to relative importance; and teachers were asked to sort them using their own level of adequacy as the criterion. In this way, the level of  adequacy for each competency for each teacher can be determined and compared with the results of the student data, identifying gaps between what the students feel is important for the faculty to be competent in and what the faculty feel they are actually competent in.

        "description":"The unbiased estimate of a \"treatment effect\" reached by analysis of covariance in a nonrandomized experiment would often require that a different covariate be used in each treatment. A sufficient but unlikely condition for an unbiased estimate is that the covariate for each treatment is (1) the complete covariate that predicts the outcome as fully as possible from initial characteristics of the case, or (2) the complete discriminant that fully represents differences between group means on the initial characteristics. When the covariate for a treatment is a weighted composite of (1) and (2), the adjusted outcome mean may have positive or negative basis, the bias being a nonlinear function of the weights. If (1) and (2) do not wholly account for the covariate, the adjustment to  the outcome mean is reduced in absolute magnitude. A procedure is offered to correct for error of measurement when there are two or more fallible covariables. Specification errors as well as errors of measurement have an attenuating effect, however. Since the parameters of the specification errors are unknown, no correction procedures can be counted on to provide an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect. (Author/BW)",

The present paper reports the implementation of a statistic requiring less restrictive underlying assumptions but more computation time and a related Bayesian procedure designed to adjust the standard error estimates to counteract the effect of the presence of a substantial proportion of cheaters in a sample. The Bayesian adjustment did reduce the bias; however, the original index appears to be the most accurate and least expensive in terms of processing cost. With either method, results suggest that cheaters may be conclusively identified when they copy more than 50  percent of their answers from anyone answering less than 90 percent of test items correctly.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between student demographic and academic characteristics, including expected course grade; faculty characteristics such as rank, teaching load, and experience; and student ratings of these teachers. Using the Student Instructional Report (SIR), data were collected from undergraduates in 3600 liberal arts and professional education courses toward the end of each of four semesters in six colleges of a large urban university. The findings seem to suggest  that a student's expected grade in a course does account for the largest amount of variance in student ratings when compared with the other variables. However, even when combined, these variables were found to account for comparatively little variability in student ratings. (BW)",

A working group consisting of personnel test experts from all of the military services was set up to study the feasibility of such a test battery, and to develop a prototype. The Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) was developed from this effort. The essential purpose of the present study was to  develop information on the relationship between performance of high school students on the subtests and composites of the ASVAB, and their subsequent performance in civilian vocational curricula. Approximately 4300 high school students took the ASVAB in 1973-74, and the validity of each subtest was established through multiple regression analysis of the test scores and the corresponding students' grades.

But, since background noise did have a significant effect on postnoise task performance, it was concluded that the perception of having no control debilitated the quality of postnoise performance. Later studies indicated that the intensity of the noise can influence task performance, whether it is presented prior to or during the task. The main concern of this experiment was to determine whether cognitive factors would be more influential than the intensity variable in a reaction time experiment. It was found that at 105  decibel noise levels, intensity was the crucial variable, whereas at 70 decibel levels the predictability of the background noise was of primary importance. (BW)",

A portion of the data from Phase II is used to illustrate how the research was designed to answer these policy questions and how the data implies provisional answers to them. To answer the question of what is awry between the world of policy and the world of research, two answers are proposed. The first is that the failure to understand the political nature of policy making leads to irrelevant research which offers policy makers solutions they cannot use. The policy alternatives available to the policy makers should be carefully laid out as a first step in planning research. The second answer is that since policy  making is decision making, the decision making process also has to be laid out to see what kind of decisions need to be made to develop and implement a policy. An analysis of these decisions should indicate the kinds of information that policy makers will need. These needs should determine which research needs to be done. (RC)",

        "description":"In April and May of 1975, the Research and Evaluation Department of the Minneapolis Public Schools conducted a needs assessment at the request of the Leadership Development Committee (LDC) to determine what kind of help MPS administrators need to do their jobs better. Two methods were used to collect data. First, a one-page questionnaire was sent to all MPS administrators. Second, a 15% random sample of administrators from elementary, secondary, central office, and special locations was selected to be interviewed. The most frequent requests for training were in the areas of management techniques, interpersonal relations and personnel management, administration, and curriculum theory and development. About two-thirds of the questionnaire respondents said that they would probably  or definitely participate in courses in 1975-76 if they were offered at convenient times. About four out of ten questionnaire respondents said that ample opportunity exists to meet their professional growth needs. Over one-third said more opportunity for obtaining professional growth units through the MPS or obtaining college or university credit is needed. Secondary administrators more frequently indicated these needs and, in addition, were more likely to say they needed assistance in pursuing an advanced degree. Over two-thirds of the interviewees said they thought the LDC could provide them with the kind of training they really need. (Author/RC)",

Several of these models are judged to contain logical contradictions because of their use of the wrong conditional probability within the context of the probabilistic structure. In the final section of the paper, these models are shown to have highly objectionable practical implications. Two of the models studied are based on the correct conditional probability, and these are noted to be special cases of a more  general and more useful model. (Author/RC)",

The definition conceptually equates test bias with measuring different things in different groups, and operationally equates test bias with a difference in item fit to the Rasch Model, greater than one, between groups. It is suggested that the proposed definition avoids confusing etiology with measurement by capitalizing on the &quot;objectivity&quot; property of the logistic Rasch Measurement Model. Application of the definition, to 914 applicants (black = 367; white = 547) in a &quot;real&quot; selection situation is described and resulted in identifying two items as biased. The two items so defined, were different than the two items identified as biased by comparing the item success rates (i.e., item difficulty) of black  vs. white candidates. A content evaluation of the items by two black, female reviewers was subsequently performed. Their comments lend preliminary support to the proposed psychometric test bias definition. Additional encouraging support is provided by the match between the content comments and the item bias index values, for other items in the test. Implications for future applications and research are presented. (Author)",

Widely prevalent disagreement about terminology reflects a lack of conceptual clarification and may inhibit the development of theory and practice. Distinctions commonly made between criterion referenced and norm referenced tests turn out to be inaccurate, since it appears that both content and norm referenced interpretations can apply to scores on any type of achievement test. Rather, the particular manner in which a given test can and should be interpreted turns out to be a  function of the mode by which test content is specified and the function for which the test is to be used. All approaches to the interpretation of achievement test scores are classified as either domain referenced or norm referenced, with reference to a criterion or standard viewed as a special case of the former. Finally, it is argued that normative interpretations can and in many instances should be made of scores which are referenced directly to content, including mastery scores. (Author/BW)",

The ecological approach requires that the person, the environment, and the relations between them be conceptualized in terms of systems, and subsystems within systems. The experimental situation is not limited to being unidirectional and dyadic, allowing only first-order effects. Two or more environmental settings can and should be included, and these environments should be studied and described along with the subject. An ecology of human development must be concerned not only with the developing child, but also with the developing ecology; that is, changes both in the micro- and macrostructures which envelop the child and those in his immediate environment. Finally, the  author urges a reversal of usual experimental procedure, beginning the experiment by trying to change one of the environmental elements in order to get some idea of the delicate balance between the developing organism and its surroundings.

        "description":"Because of the diversity, range, and combination of disabilities at the Center for Multiple-Handicapped Children, operated under the auspices of the New York City Board of Education, a unique instrument was needed for assessing functional levels, setting goals, and charting progress of handicapped children in special education facilities, regular schools, and institutional settings. The major functional areas brought into play in a child's daily life were defined and the following categories were delineated as parts of the Individual Pupil Profile (IPP): (1) Intellectual Functioning, (2) Academic Achievement, (3) Perceptual-Motor Skills, (4) Physical Functioning and Self-Help Skills, (5) Communication, and (6) Social-Emotional Development. Building on existing studies, and by  consulting with area specialists, rating scales were devised in areas where existing measures were inadequate. Specifically, scales were constructed to assess achievement, communication, and social-emotional development. For the areas of intellectual functioning, perceptual-motor skills, and physical functioning, pre-existing tests were modified and incorporated into the overall structure. The IPP designed to (1) help to focus each professional involved on the specifics of the child's behavior and function, (2) encourage group thinking and lead to a comprehensive diagnostic picture, and (3) establish current levels of functioning and lend itself to both ongoing assessment of progress and to prescriptive teaching. Both the instrument and manual are included here. (RC)",

Therefore, the goal of the Community Affairs Training Evaluation (CATE) project was to develop a set of procedures which provide practical information to decision makers for making program decisions and judging goal attainment. The result has been the development of a prototype for a Decision Oriented Evaluation System (DOES), involving evaluations of the training procedures and materials, the trainee's job performance, and the community impact of the program, to be done in three stages: the input stage, the process stage, and the outcome stage.  A prototype user's handbook has been developed and will allow the pilot testing revision, field testing, extension, and development of a supporting training system which are necessary before a comprehensive installation can be made.

The objectives of the present research were threefold: (1) to develop a short rating scale and associated diagnostic checklist; (2) to examine the construct validity and reliability of the scale; and (3) to assess the relationships between selected student demographic data and ratings on the scale. After a pilot test, there appeared to be little advantage to using an observed/preferred behavior format, so that format was discontinued in further revision of the scale. A  repeated measures analysis of variance indicated that discrepant groups, i.e., those whose actual grade was two or more letter grades away from his/her expected grade, should be omitted from computations to increase the validity of student ratings. Further research was suggested to determine whether demographic variables interact with group discrepancy to influence evaluations of teacher behaviors. (Author/BW)",

        "description":"Two types of student response inventories for appraising instruction, the Student Instruction Report (SIR) and the Inventory of Student Perceptions of Instruction (ISPI) were administered to 554 students in 30 classes at two Georgia colleges. Mean responses to items were used in principal components analyses with varimax rotation. The two instruments were then administered to 525 students in 31 English classes having a common final examination. Results of multiple regression analyses produced a significant multiple correlation with one instrument and self-reported cumulative grade point averages, with end-of-course grades in English as the criterion variable. Results of this study suggest that student appraisal of college instruction using SIR in conjunction with self-reported  grade point averages are of some help in predicting end-of-course final examination scores. If the effectiveness of an instructor is measured in terms of end-of-course achievement of his class, then college administrators should proceed with caution in using student ratings to gauge instructor effectiveness. Moreover, results of this study lend some support to the use of instruments developed empirically over those developed rationally. (Author/BW)",

Results indicated a lack of presentation order, slelctive survival, repeated measurement, sex, and content area significant main effects or interactions. Analyses of the longitudinal sample subjects' conservation task performances over the annual interval indicated significant grade-level distinctions, year one versus year two differences, and type of conservation distinctions. Identity conservation scores were consistently  superior to equivalence conservation scores and this superiority was most notable for the younger subjects. Transitive inference tasks were significantly less difficult than equivalence conservation tasks. Most importantly, evidence for a developmental mastery sequence (transitivity to conservation) was demonstrated. Pass/fail comparisons indicated a lack of regression effects and greater growth for the conservation abilities as contrasted with transitivity task mastery. Identity/equivalence conservation task distinctions were most apparent for the without verbal justification response criterion.

        "description":"Rasch calibration permitted the development of short achievement tests that were economical in testing time, and could be developed in a series of difficulty levels to suit student individual differences. Furthermore, these tests were of adequate reliability for practical educational measurement when individual students were assigned to tests of appropriate difficulty level. A variety of test placement strategies were considered and several were tried. Two formal procedures involving the use of a pretest screening tool for level assignment show promise of effectiveness but in the research described here tended to place many children in a test which was somewhat too difficult for them. The use of screening tests still is considered very promising although it is recommended that in  the future criteria for test placement be modified so the students would be placed one, or perhaps two, levels lower than they were in the field test of these prototypes. It is further recommended that any students who get raw scores under 5, or over 25, immediately be retested with a more appropriate level to forestall the dramatic measurement error increases which occur when those limits are exceeded.

        "description":"The general objective of a research program on adaptive testing was to identify several sources of potential error in test scores, and to study adaptive testing as a means for reducing these errors. Errors can result from the mismatch of item difficulty to the individual's ability; the psychological effects of testing and the test environment; the inability to extract enough information from the testee's response; deviations from unidimensionality; and an oversimplistic conceptualization of ability. Several different strategies of adaptive testing are discussed, along with the information level they yield, and the bias that can result from various scoring methods. In a discussion of the unidimentionality of test items, the consistency of the testee's response is analyzed.  Finally, group differences are examined in terms of the psychological effects of receiving immediate feedback, especially on low ability groups. The author concludes that adaptive testing and immediate knowledge of results may be able to provide testing conditions more conclusive to each person's ability to demonstrate his/her fullest capacities in test performance.

In this study, 64 three-year-old children were tested individually to investigate (1) whether there is a correlation between chronological age and geometric form reproduction for three-year-olds, and (2) whether three-year-old boys score lower than three-year-old girls. The results indicated a correlation between age and geometric form reproduction for girls, but not for boys; boys did score significantly lower than girls. While this study more than tripled the original number of three-year-old children tested, the sample is still too inadequate to determine if  this test has predictive value at such an early age.

Because these ratings are measured on a different scale for each specialty, this methodology cannot be generally established and applied. To overcome this limitation, a series of benchmark scales is being developed for the measurement of task factors against common frames of reference. This report establishes the concept of the scales and describes the method to be used in their development and validation. It then reports on the development phase of the scales for specialties with either an  administrative or general aptitude requirement. The completed scales would have various applications. They could be used for the initial design of a training program, the validation of an existing program, or for the redesign of an existing one given new constraints such as change in course length. At all times it must be remembered that this methodology is an advanced aid to course design, always subject to human override where such can be justified. (Author/BW)",

Change scores were computed by subtracting the proportion of students getting a test item correct during the experimental quarter from the same proportion in a baseline quarter. Analysis showed no significant difference in the change scores for handout-treated-difficult items and untreated-difficult items. Since objectives had been shown to improve performance on difficult items in a previous experiment, the hypothesis was  advanced that the effectiveness of an instructional improvement effort may depend on the learning situation in which the effort is made.

Analysis attrition occurs when subjects included in the design are not deemed valid subjects for the analytic design. Using the evaluation of Project Follow Through as an example, attrition in the data collection process is discussed.

The Naval Academy classes of 1971, 1972, and 1973 took the SVIB, and an empirical criterion keying approach was used to select those items having the 75 best responses for each of four different academic major groupings. Twenty alternative item response weighting methods were evaluated. For each of the four problems, a number of different response weighting methods had essentially the same effectiveness. A parsimonious  conclusion would suggest the continued use of the common procedure of assigning positive or negative unit weights to the responses. However, scale test-retest reliability and scoring costs are two pertinent factors which should be included in an overall evaluation of alternative item response weighting procedures for a particular application.

However, the major purpose of criterion referenced testing is to estimate the true capabilities of examinees to perform specific tasks. Hence, the problems of true score determination assume critical importance. Four measurement models which have potential for evaluating the results of criterion referenced tests are discussed here. The proportion correct model assumes that the proportion of sample trials scored correct is an unbiased estimate of the proportion correct in the infinite domain for that individual. The binomial error model adds the specification of the conditional distribution for the observed score for the  given true proportion correct. The third model applies the philosophy implied in the binomial error model to Bayesian statistical theory, and the final model is the Rasch one parameter logistic model. Advantages and disadvantages of each are discussed, but the final choice of a model is to be based on the needs of the testing program and the resources available to analyze the data. (BW)",

Bayes' Theorem is a mathematical expression which allows the combination of information about the quality of the examinee population so as to produce a probabilistic estimate of mastery for a specific examinee. This approach can give the most accurate ability estimate for each examinee by using the fewest number of test items, provided that accurate estimates of the &quot;quality parameters&quot; have been made. A method of estimating  these parameters from commonly available information is also explained. (Author/BW)",

Policy attrition, the administrative dropping of a unit; program attrition, loss of subjects due to mobility, dislike of the treatment, etc.; and sample attrition, units omitted because of deficient data, have been defined, but were not distinguished in this research. The relationship between attrition, pretest score, and income level were studied. In the few cases where additional variance was accounted for by the interaction of pretest  or income with treatment within-site, an interpretation of the possible biasing effects of attrition was made in the evaluation of the specific site.

TSKCAT generates a user-specified vector of 1's and O's to identify tasks of interest. FACSUM selects, sorts, and prints task-factor information, and computes new vectors based on differences between vectors, maximums or minimums of vector sets, cumulative percentages, and categories of tasks developed by six arithmetic operators.

Testing which occurs within the training sequence is particularly vulnerable to inefficient use of both trainee and instructor time, but computer-based instruction system can provide a means for monitoring and scheduling the routings. Both branched tests and short linear tests have been used, but both have disadvantages not present with the use of the sequential testing model. The sequential test may be described as one in which an examinee is given a test item, the response to the current item as well as previously administered items is evaluated in a certain way, and the examinee is either assigned to one of a number of  classes and testing stopped, or judgment is suspended and testing continues. If single items from a test are employed for the derivation of discriminant functions, then functions could be computed to provide classifications after a small number of test items had been administered. This technique results in probabilities of group membership every time a linear combination is computed, and may be adapted to sequential testing by the addition of a termination rule. (BW)",

        "description":"During the 1974-1975 school year eight itinerant French teachers travelled among 20 elementary schools teaching oral French to Grade 6 and Grade 7 students. Each teacher was responsible for two or three schools, The course was based on the book Le Francais Partout-Cours Preliminaire (1967) ed.). The study described in this report was initiated to provide a baseline of data for evaluating and monitoring the program in subsequent years and to describe the 1974-75 program and provide information for changes and improvements. The results of this study indicated that there were definite gains in the students' aural skills in French. A large percentage indicated that they felt the program should continue, and slightly fewer wanted to take another French course in the following year.  The itinerant teachers expressed general satisfaction with the program. They all said they would be willing to devote as much time to it in the following years, though the travelling, large class sizes, and carrying materials around with them were disadvantages. The question of whether this course should be taught by resident teachers or itinerant teachers has not been resolved and should be addressed in the next years of this study. (Author/BW)",

This report is a survey of opinions from students, employers, parents and teachers regarding various aspects of the Work Experience Program. The purpose of the program is not to create job skills as much as it is to help students become self-directed, confident, and mature adults. The majority of survey respondents favored the program, and the objectives of the program were met. Weakness in the program is seen in some of the placements of students, and some students wished to be provided with more information regarding their placements and the program. Some employers desiged placements longer than half days, and some teachers commented  that there was too much lost class time. (Author/BW)",

The project called for investigating the educational effects of the program on both Head Start and middle class children. The impression was that children participated in the project differentially. That is, they had unique patterns of work and play when they were given a choice of different activities. The evaluation procedures spanned the entire school year. Tests were administered to a total sample of 58 children, divided equally by social class during the first and last month of the school year. The classroom observations were recorded for a subset of this group, which contained 43 children. This sample of 43 children was also equally  divided by social class. Each Head Start child was pair-matched to the extent possible on age, sex, classroom, and previous school experience with a middle class child. Twenty six of these children were above four years of age and received the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence and the Stanford-Binet, L. M., the remaining children received the Merrill Palmer Scale of Mental Tests and the Stanford-Binet. Classroom observations were conducted during the period between testings. Findings are discussed in terms of the observational data, the test data, and the relationship between the two. (RC)",

Factors considered were: ACT scores, college grades, race, sex, socioeconomic status, financial aid, and employment. It was found that ACT scores were effective predictors of college grades among white students, but not among black students, regardless of income level. ACT scores were also effective predictors of attrition/persistence only among regular students in large samples, college grades being more potent for  this purpose. The special program appeared more successful than the regular program in preventing attrition, especially among men and blacks; and receiving financial aid was better than not receiving financial aid.

Separate lesson plan kits have been developed for each of nine grade levels: kindergarten, six elementary grades, junior high school, and senior high school. Tattletooth consists of a number of components in addition to the curriculum package. This report makes six conclusions: (1) teacher training was satisfactory; (2) curriculum  materials were generally successful, and educational progress was made in all grade levels; (3) in all cases the field test groups made better dental progress than the respective control groups; (4) teachers used the curriculum materials with their own augmentations; (5) teachers liked the program; and (6) much regional variability was found.

The purpose of the program is to determine the feasibility of assessment centers for the Army. The project described in this report was designed to contribute to two particular objectives of the pilot program. These objectives were (1) to identify potential uses of assessment results and techniques in accomplishment of the leadership development mission of the Infantry School and the Army, and (2) to develop ways of improving assessment procedures and methodology for use by the Army. To fulfill these objectives, four discriminable tasks were undertaken: (1) to investigate potential uses of assessment results; (2) to identify potential uses of assessment methods for training;  (3) to develop procedures for training assessors to use observational and recording techniques; and (4) to develop a model for designing assessment exercises, or situational tests.

The Tests of Scientific Thinking are performance tests that simulate aspects of the job of a behavioral scientist. The tests are: Formulating Hypotheses, Evaluating Proposals, Solving Methodological Problems, and Measuring Constructs. The examinee proposes a number of solutions--not only the one considered best, but also others that should be considered. A scoring method was developed that requires the scorer to assign values to categories of responses rather than to make subjective  evaluations. Six scores were studied: (1) average quality of the responses the examinee thinks are best; (2) average quality of all responses; (3) average quality of the best response by category scoring; (4) number of responses; (5) number of unusual responses; and (6) number of responses that are both unusual and of high quality. The tests were administered to about 4,000 graduate school applicants using an item sampling procedure. Test difficulty was found appropriate for advanced students and reliabilities were high enough to be useful. Factors analyses were performed to clarify the structure of the interrelationships among the various scores for the four tests. The tests seemed face valid, but evidence of construct validity is needed. (RC)",

Results showed that both definition and instance presentation had a significant effect on students' ability to correctly classify novel instances and their confidence in their responses. It was shown that heuristic definitions produce patterns of confidence that differ from those of other definition types. It can be concluded that: (1) definition and instance presentation both play an important role in concept acquisition, (2) students can benefit both affectively and instructionally from the expository presentation of classification  algorithms and heuristics and (3) confidence is more closely related to definition than to inquisitory instance presentation.

Study I involved Mexican-American students who were given a 25-item questionnaire concerning their perceived educational environment. Students were asked to what extent each condition existed in their school and to what extent it should exist. A discrepancy between the two responses indicated an area of perceived isolation. A factor analysis was conducted on the discrepancy scores to investigate clustering of areas of isolation and to verify the construction of the instrument into social, academic and extracurricular areas. In study II a 26-item instrument for assessing perceived student needs in various areas of  cultural specifics was administered to 200 students in grades seven through twelve. The instrument allowed for the identification of perceived student needs through a comparison of their responses to each item across the response columns. The first column response indicated how strongly the student agreed with the proposition contained in each item; second column response indicated a perception as to the extent that the proposition contained in each item is presently being taught in the school curriculum. Results are reported on the basis of the total sample analysis, of an ethnicity analysis and of a sex analysis. (RC)",

With rare exceptions, regression equations for the prediction of grades for Mexican-Americans did not differ from those for other students at the freshman, sophomore, or junior level. The prediction of senior year grades did require different equations for Mexican-Americans, but the direction of the difference was reversed at the two universities involved. The need for separate prediction equations for Mexican-American applicants to college is not supported. Nevertheless, the modest size of the multiple correlation coefficients, usually in the range from .30 to  .50, suggests that considerations other than test scores and prior grades should enter admission decisions. The few comparisons across universities did not indicate a need for different equations for different institutions, but a difference in grade distributions at the two institutions compared suggests that the question be examined again with more substantial data. Men and women differed in their prediction equations, although neither sex was consistently over or underpredicted. Men, however, almost invariably showed higher test scores and lower grades at all levels than did women.(Author)",

Statistical analysis included the means and standard deviation of the two tests, correlation of scores between these tests and the Certification Examinations and Written Registry Examinations, and an item analysis of the two tests. In retrospect, the original delineation of roles did not provide sufficient behavioral specificity for the derivation of criterion referenced examinations. At this time, a project to&quot;define&quot; respiratory therapy competence is in development to supplant the original delineation of roles document.

Again, the Metropolitan Achievement Test, the Sequential Tests of Educational Progress, and the School and College Ability Test were used. The 1975 results supported the 1974 findings that North York achievement in both reading and mathematics compared favorably with the American norms in all the grades tested. They also indicated that the average growth of the schools sampled was wider in both reading and mathematics than in previous years. (Author/BW)",

In preparing such products, developers have come to rely on competency-based achievement tests. Unfortunately, expertise for constructing reliable and valid competency-based instruments is not currently available in a form than an instructional developer can readily translate into practice. The formulation of objectives to guide instrument construction is problematic for the developer because few dependable rules exist to help select and state them. Formulating items is also difficult because many developers lack training in test writing. Further, major issues arise when the developer must establish the meaningfulness of the scores that  result from competency-based instruments, a difficult and costly task that requires psychometric skill and a generous budget. Finally, a discerning developer knows in advance of instrument validation that little assistance will be available from psychometricians who have long been arguing over the designs and statistics to be used validating competency-based tests. Data derived from competency-based instruments must therefore be used with caution and confirmed with additional sources of information like observations and interviews. Developers should also require test construction and psychometric expertise. (Author)",

Standards may be constructed in three ways: surface standards force the definition into a model shaped by scientific procedure; deep standards include information on the inputs, processes, and outputs for each component and subcomponent; and profound standards reach deeper into the organization than its task structure and exhaustively covers all dimensions of organizational functioning, and are set by the program staff. In this situation then, the role of the evaluator includes expressing and explicating the standards set by the program staff, and confronting management with the decisions they must make. The evaluator must also look at the  broader environment of the educational organization, i.e., the sociotechnical systems of which schools are a part. This broader perspective implies that the ability to build models, and the ability to be able to gather data relative to a large variety, of different phenomena, and to report this data using print, verbal, nonverbal, visual and auditory media be included as part of an evaluator's training.

A multicultural curriculum incorporates a systematic group of courses or sequence of subjects using text books, resource books, and other instructional tools that are appropriate and have no stereotyping and misconceptions. Instruction centers around the individual needs of students and, because of the wide range of abilities among children at all grade levels, the curriculum and approach are modified to meet varied needs. The advantage of a multicultural program is that it can avoid the risk of ethnocentrism and provide for the self-worth of each individual in the student population. Since language and culture are inextricably related, appropriate curriculum materials should be developed for  the areas of language and cultural development. Within the framework of multilingual education, there are many possibilities for a multitude of programs and approaches, all of which require different strategy models. There are many types of bilingual education and many types of language situations with different linguistic cultural aims and objectives. What are needed, therefore, are descriptions of different types of bilingual alternatives to be adopted by local educators, considering the appropriate community, family, and school contextual settings.

        "description":"Three issues are discussed in the beginning of this paper: general trends of urban population growth among blacks since 1930, regional variations in growth and distribution from 1950 to 1970, and urban growth and metropolitanization. The remainder of the paper examines the growth of the black urban population by size of place from 1950 to 1970. Size is seen to be related to black growth and this view is held to be reasonable, as size, if anything else, makes a city visible especially to potential migrants. Most studies of urbanization do not focus on size of place but on that segment of population defined as either urban or metropolitan or they focus on urbanized area growth. After looking at overall growth by size of place for the South and the remainder of the nation, a major  component of city growth, that of in-migration is discussed. Here the role of migration in the growth of cities by size is analyzed for the 1965-1970 portion of the 1970 decade. Migration analysis concentrates on patterns found in the South and non-South, and in addition, gives some attention to the selection of city size on the part of the city-bound migrant according to his region of origin. A summary section presents the overall trends found in the research, the research of others, and discusses implications for the future growth of black urban America. (Author/AM)",

The program included: (1) the consecutive concentrated study of five individual cultures and (2) a comparative multicultural approach built around five basic themes. While it is believed that it is essential to develop positive self-concept and intergroup relations, multicultural awareness is seen as necessary to understand the different human experiences of people who come from different cultures and ethnic groups. In the school, multicultural awareness was attained through implementation of the following areas: cultural curricula, multicultural curricula; curriculum based on classroom cultural  and ethnic population; integration of multicultural awareness into basic subject areas of math, reading, language; and chronological recognition of events and holidays across cultural lines. This project was developed for elementary grades as a formal approach to begin or enrich multicultural studies.

This is seen to be a problem. The thrust of the argument that follows is that in the absence of a closer relationship between aggregate black family consumption spending, and their aggregate investment, through time, black families as a whole will become worse off economically relative to white families. This is hypothesized on the observation that conditions that generate a fall in the real income of the families in the black community relative to the nation are not countervailed by the potentially positive impact of black household consumption and investment behavior on the growth rate of black family  income. In support of the hypothesis, the following questions are raised and answered: (1) whether the black community is an economy, (2) what the normal expectation of the growth of family income in an economy is, and (3) what the present consumption and investment situation of black families is. The basic solution to the problem is that the black community needs to be reorganized and restructured so as to raise the income of black families through their own aggregate consumpation and investment spending.

This document presents the new legal requirements for parent involvement in Title I projects. It begins by describing what Title I now says about parent involvement and presents the new Federal law which will affect the Parent Advisory Council (PAC) membership selection procedures. This law is called the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, commonly named the Buckley  Amendment. The Buckley Amendment may prohibit certain procedures that have been used in the post to recruit Title I PAC members. Reports indicate that many practical problems, such as the lack of guidelines for local school districts to follow to establish parent participation, have developed since the Buckley Amendment became law. It is stated that this amendment has created some difficulties in complying with the new parent involvement provisions of Title I, but that ways to obtain consent and identify Title I parents for PAC membership can and should be devised by school systems.

Several results are described. (1) The level and distribution of income vary widely among the SMSAs. (2) A majority of the SMSAs experience an increase in inequality during the 1959-1969 period. (3) Differences among the SMSAs in both income level and degree of income inequality narrows. (4) Higher rates of growth of income are associated with smaller increases in inequality. While this paper is descriptive, the author hopes that the data set will be useful for testing theories that relate the income level and income  distributions of metropolitan areas to their urban problems--for example, whether increases in SMSA crime rates or the incidence of urban riots or urban fiscal problems can be explained by changes in the level and distribution of metropolitan area incomes.

This trend analysis has import for two reasons. The progress made toward eliminating the old pattern of racially separate school systems is assessed. Thus, the degree of compliance in one city with Federal court policy on school desegregation is examined. Detailed analysis of changes in the racial composition of schools over a period of time, by giving some basis for understanding what has happened in the past, generates a factual basis from which to project probable patterns of future change. Further, this factual base provides some information to guide policy making on and planning for school desegregation. Sections of the report  focus on: segregation indexes, racial composition of schools, racial distribution of students patterns of change, tipping points, and unresolved questions. The study's major finding is that segregation in Nashville's schools decreased only slightly during the 1960's. Limited support for the &quot;tipping point&quot; hypothesis is found. However, changes in school composition tend to be in one direction -- toward a higher proportion of Negroes. The study also indicates that metropolitan government has not been the structural panacea for bringing about meaningfully integrated schools. (Author/AM)",

Allowing for gene-environment correlation, Jensen (1975) reports that under a wide range of assumptions, the twin data show that one-half to three-fourths of IQ variance is accounted for by genetic factors. This conclusion falls when an arbitrary specification is relaxed. The present study presents Jensen's model, along with a modification. (Author/AM)",

The project was established as an educational setting for the many students in the Providence, Rhode Island secondary schools whose opportunities for diverse learning experiences were limited. It includes aspects of history so the current staff will not completely rediscover old learnings or repeat past mistakes; concurrently, the history is included so that individual memory and the oral tradition are not the only sources of knowledge. The handbook clarifies practices so that the entire staff can systematically  make the school a humane learning setting that empowers its students with skills and self-worth. The following is a listing of the areas discussed: (1) general explanation of the Alternate Learning Project; (2) participants in the school: responsibilities and rights; (3) governance and decision making; (4) counseling; (5) curriculum; (6) general policy and everyday procedures; and, (7) calendar.

In particular, the study investigates the extent to which black students attending public schools in America which harbor &quot;de jure segregation&quot; acquire negative self-concepts and negative attitudes toward an understanding of the educative process -- which attitudes could be detrimental to their psychoeducational development. One of the salient findings derived from this study is that black students in predominantly black schools involved in the study exhibit higher self-concepts and more favorable attitudes than black students in predominantly white schools. It is recommended (1) that the study be  replicated and expanded to include a large cross sample of all senior high students and (2) that research should also be conducted to compare the changes in self-concepts exhibited by a group of black students only in just one racial composition.

From the beginning, the major portion of the Title I program was intended to supplement the education routine provided by local school districts for disadvantaged children. Each school can shape its Title I project in whatever way it feels necessary to meet the specific needs of the children in its classrooms -- provided that it meets the requirements of the law. In the beginning, Title I tried to provide everything to everyone, but with time the program has become more selective. Today, assistance is focused mainly on instructional services. About 90 percent of the nation's school districts participate in the  basic Title I program, with about 15,000 school districts receiving Title I funds. One problem in making an objective assessment of Title I effectiveness has been in inequitable distribution of local and State funds in many school districts. Also in the early days of the program, testing was unsystematic, and few resources were available for evaluation. Today, a uniform evaluation reporting system is being developed, as well as improved Title I evaluation models. Reports indicate that the Title I child is achieving better in school. The program has raised the mathematics and reading scores of hundreds of disadvantaged youngsters across the nation. (Author/AM)",

Some of the highlights of the analyses conducted on Title I programs are as follows. In the area of administration, enrollment in Title I classes has been concentrated in grades one through four. Enrollment in these grades increased six percent over 1973-74. The total number of teachers and other educators participating in Title I funded inservice training nearly doubled over the previous year. Of the factors that contributed most toward accomplishing Title I objectives, use of teacher aides was ranked by the LEAs as number one, as it has been for the past five years. During the past year, the greatest emphasis had  been placed on reading and mathematics. In the area of reading, comparable data suggest that eligible Title I pupils gain about .68 in grade equivalent when not enrolled in Title I reading programs. Title I participants gained more than four additional months in grade equivalent than would have been expected were they not participants in Title I reading programs. In the area of mathematics, comparable data indicate that pupils would have been expected to gain about .72 months in grade equivalent per month of instruction had they not been enrolled in the Title I mathematics program. California Test results indicate the gain was doubled when students participated in the Title I program. (Author/AM)",

There were 512,755 reported project participants receiving supplementary activities. The activity participants included 364,945 in mathematics, and 34,166 in aural/oral facility in the spoken English language for pupils whose first language was not English. Approximately 61 percent of the monies budgeted for projects was directed at remedial reading. Nearly 66 percent of the budgeted resources were directed at pupils in the elementary grades (1-6). The State obligated  or expended approximately $200 million of fiscal 1974 carry-over and 1975 ESEA Title I monies for supplementary instruction for low income youngsters. The effort purchased the services of 649 administrators, 10,819 teachers and 16,159 para- or nonprofessionals. Among the staff, about 36 percent or slightly over 10,000 received some form of inservice training. Overall, about one-half million educationally disadvantaged youngsters received supplementary remedial activities from the efforts of about 27,000 staff. (Author/AM)",

The foci of the report include the following: program overview (data source, participants served, teacher-pupil ratio and inservice training); project characteristics (project session, project location, grade levels served, and needs assessment); program effectiveness (procedure, constraints, reading achievement overview, reading achievement summary, mathematics achievement overview, mathematics  achievement summary, exemplary projects, and achievement summary). The report concludes that the available achievement data in reading and mathematics suggest that a certain measure of success is being obtained by projects serving neglected and delinquent children. Among the recommendations made are the following: the improvement of data collection procedures, the isolation and dissemination of alternative measurement devices for assessing pupil achievement, and the substitution of a more valid test instrument for the Wide Range Achievement Test used in the testing program.

The model program included occupational orientation, occupational preparation, and on-the-job training experiences. The program was designed so that it might serve as a terminal education point for 16 year old students. Instructional materials linking vocational and related education to individual student needs were utilized. Instructor workshops were a very important aspect of the program. Student selection was refined. An instructor's guide to facilitate transportability of the program from one school to another was developed. The model was tested experimentally  and evaluated with respect to six specified objectives by comparison of the model group with a control group and with a stratified random sample of comparable students during the semester preceding initiation of the model program. Implementation of the model program as the county-wide junior high school work experience at the beginning of the 1975-76 school year is noted to be an indicator of practicum success. (Author/JM)",

From the county to the local school district the state may choose any option or allocator deemed consistent with the overall objective of concentrating the funds in districts with a large number of students from low income families. It appears that a more even distribution of priorities in compensatory education across low income students living in a variety of population densities may be desired. Whether or not the present allocations are consistent with these priorities is a question of judgment. To support such judgment, this report provides an analysis of the effect of alternative allocators on school districts in selected  counties in five different states whose demographic characteristics and available data base permitted highlighting the magnitude of the effects of different choices. The sample was selected mainly to look at counties that contained a large city, suburbs, and rural areas. The analysis is stated to be quite complicated because there are various factors impacting on allocation and their effect could not be analytically combined. (Author/JM)",

The group's mandate is to investigate and develop ways to provide high quality education for those with limited educational opportunities. The Educational Equity Program focuses on educational problems faced at all levels by substantial numbers of children and adults who are not well served by the nation's public schools. The Fiscal Year 1977 program focuses on students with any of the following characteristics: live in a milieu of low socioeconomic level; have little or no knowledge of English; are restricted by sex role stereotypes;  are participating in the process of school desegregation; belong to an ethnic or racial minority; have learning styles and behavior patterns that differ markedly from school norms. Five NIE units--whose programs are discussed in this brochure -- have become the Educational Equity Group: the Compensatory Education Division, the Desegregation Studies Staff, the Multicultural/Bilingual Division, the School Discipline Studies Staff, and the Womens' Research Staff.

        "description":"Among the many attempts made to document value patterns in American society, Robin Williams' analysis might be meaningful for investigating dominant values. A major problem with Williams' approach is that it never labels specific values but only describes general areas of conceived preferential behavior in which values might be discovered. Nor does it deal with the relative importance of different values. The purposes of this paper are: (1) to operationalize Williams' value scheme for empirical investigation; (2) to describe the relative priority accorded to various dominant values; and, (3) to differentiate value systems according to several major stratification variables. Data were gathered during the spring of 1973 from 3,115 heads of households in North Carolina, who returned  mail questionnaires. The findings indicated that a high degree of similarity existed among the studied segments of society in the relative priority attached to most social and personal dominant values. However, the divergent priorities and intensity of concern between whites and nonwhites (regardless of educational attainment or income level) towards values concerning equality, achievement, and patriotism suggested a possible tension which could indicate potential value conflict.

When the combined effects of history and demographic characteristics are examined, it is concluded that the Southern black belt remains unique. It has continued to shrink in size, and even when size is held constant, considerable black population loss has occurred through massive out-migration of youth and young adults. This has resulted in the remaining  population being increasingly composed of elderly persons and young children. Although the loss of black population relieves many employment problems, there is no doubt that declines in the proportion of working age blacks has had deleterious effects on the welfare of the elderly and children, since they require a minimal labor force for their support. This they do not currently have. (Author/JM)",

The definition of who is bilingual is an important issue. Bilingual programs currently in existence vary between the widely used transitional model (where instruction is conducted in both languages for the first three years schooling, but in the third year instructors make the transition to a sole reliance on English as the teaching language) and reciprocal bilingualism, where children of the mainstream are exposed to instruction in two languages in their early years. The large majority of programs currently in existence lack effective parental participation. New approaches to assessing language  proficiency are now being developed. Established programs are now pioneering in the development of culturally relevant and interesting materials; a national network of Materials Development and Resources Centers is in service. The trend in current evaluative efforts in bilingual education is in the direction of a narrower set of objectives, for a uniform and standardized assessment of outcomes is now required for federally funded programs.

Other research foci addressed here are: the relationship that exists between parental-nonparental or husband-wife positional locations of disabled family members and the magnitude of internal family interaction; and the influence that community type (rural-urban) or family type (nuclear-extended or complete-incomplete) has. Data for this study came from interviews with 553 black homemakers conducted during the summers of 1970 and 1971 in a large metropolitan center, a small town, and two small open-country villages in East Texas. Four major abstract conclusions are drawn: disabled families generally experience lower levels of  internal family interaction than nondisabled families; there are no universal relationships between the degree of family membership disability and the degree of internal family interaction; neither community nor family type significantly influences the impact of the incidence of family membership disability; and certain community and family types influence certain relationships between the degree of family membership disability and the degree of internal family interaction.

Stanley Pottinger, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights Division (CRD) of the Department of Justice, was invited to testify before the committee concerning the existence and extent of discrimination in the public broadcasting industry. The Justice Department was concerned with the Civil Rights Act, Title VI. Members of his Federal Program Section met with officers of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) during the latter of 1974 to discuss their responsibilities under Title VI, and to attempt to develop an enforcement program. Title VI prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. The General Counsel for CPB expressed the view consistently that, because  CPB is not a government agency, it is not subject to the requirements of Title VI. CRD's position was then, and is now, that while CPB may not be a government agency, this means only that they are not required to adopt the regulating procedures envisioned by that section; but the corporation, being a recipient of Federal funds, is still subject to the nondiscrimination provisions, and more importantly, is responsible for their subrecipients' use of subgrants.

This training includes both the necessary technical skills and employability skills. This document, the Employability Skills Guide, is Duval County Schools' part of such a plan to meet this need. The performance objectives utilized in this guide are designed to aid students in learning ways to become more effective in both work and life situations. More specific objectives of the Work Experience Program are to develop skills in the areas of job finding, job retention, proper attitude, money management, and buying practices. Career exploration is a necessity and is stressed. The course in this guide is designed to involve students in Grades 7, 8 and 9 in the employment-finding  procedures, employer-employee relationships, and experiences that will directly benefit the student in choosing a future vocation. During the one hour instruction period that this course runs, the student will learn about the world of work, personality traits, attitudes, appearance, and job information. (Author/JM)",

This staff is directing research and development activities aimed at answering three broad questions of knowledge, policy, and practice. The staff has focused its efforts on an understanding of the social processes involved in the desegregation effort. It has done so with a desire to provide answers to those questions most central to achieving stable and humane integrated education. The following are suggested as factors that, in fact, are contributing to the present unsettled situation: (1) the problem of the apparent random policy of desegregation in the North; (2) the problem that segregated metropolitan housing patterns has made  desegregation nigh unto impossible in some large cities; (3) the problem of de jure segregation; (4) the problem of resistance to Federal control; and (5) the problem of many remaining unconvinced of the educational merits of desegregation. There are a variety of both short and long run policies available and which relate to effective and viable integrated education. A discussion is presented of the alternative both at the Federal and state/local levels. (Author/JM)",

It is organized into the following four discussions: (1) a portrait of black youth, given as background information; (2) specific portions of deviance theory as it relates to black youth; (3) black youth as deviants; and (4) interactions between mental health professionals and black youth. It is concluded that black youth are in no need of any particular types of social interventions. What is at issue here is the role assigned to them by contemporary society. Inasmuch as they tend to be treated by persons who share negative attitudes about their values and life styles, this denies them access to equal justice and human dignity under the law.  This problem is addressed by understanding. Understanding the social and psychological damage of negative stereotypes which black youth must contend with assures the good law enforcement professional and the effective mental health worker that their chances of success will be greatly improved when working with any population defined as deviant.

These issues are school suspensions, the distinctions between youth and adult crime, the question of who is to blame for student actions, and which institutions and individuals should be held responsible for what takes place in schools. Youth crime in the schools is high and on the rise. The cost of this crime to the public schools is estimated to be about $600 million a year. While this side of the coin is presented, the series of court decisions and a number of reports which criticize the public schools for the way they handle disruptive students is given as well. These place added burdens on public school officials and fail  to grapple with the inadequate resources and facilities of the public schools, especially in a period of an economic crunch. Another aspect of the problem relates to a reanalysis of how the courts should deal with youth crime. While not particularly a school question, the two are closely related. It is concluded that school violence is not simply a school problem, but it is tied to large social problems. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"The equalization of educational opportunity, the achievement of a greater degree of equity, is a central concern of educators today. The way in which this concern is conceptualized can have a great influence on the extent to which the concern is translated into programs, and on the way programs ultimately address the problem that gave rise to the concern in the first place. The national problem posed by a concern with equity is that of making educational and social development as well as participation in society and survival, independent of the backgrounds from which differential status group members come. Educators must rise to the challenge by manning a two-pronged effort: to insure equality in the distribution of educational resources, and to insure equal protection in the  distribution of resources in relation to social group characteristics. This would also be in relation to functional group characteristics as may be determined by mental, physical, and social conditions and as may be reflected in the processes by which learning behaviors and developmental choices are mediated. A concept such as equal opportunity may not be sufficient to make educational and other achievements independent of ethnic groups, race, or sex, and a concept such as human diversity with social justice is preferred.

The model draws from both the human capital and the job competition theories of the labor market in the emphasis it places on the industrial structure of the metropolitan area. Then, the impacts of changes in racial, educational, and industrial composition on the level and distribution of income are analyzed. This paper differs most from earlier works in its emphasis on the determination of both the income level and its distribution. It is shown that many of the variables have opposing effects on the dependent variables. It is held that the results can be used, with caution, to speculate about the likely effects of  changes in industrial composition and other attributes of an area and its labor force on the level and distribution of income. The results are seen to establish a case for further analysis of the relationship between income levels and the degree of inequality across metropolitan areas. (Author/AM)",

Seven chapters address the following topics: the problem and procedures for the study, school district organization and administration (history, review of the literature, and other issues), confrontation, politics, and conflict in urban school  systems models of large school system organization, alternative models for large school system organization, consequential analysis, and the summary of findings, conclusions, and implications. A series of appendices, tables, and figures are also included. There is indication that the intensity of conflicts in many urban school districts may divert too much of the energy of school administrators and other personnel away from the primary goal to provide quality educational programs. Also indicated is the need for a system that is more flexible and more responsive, for increased communication, and for the increased opportunity to participate in decision making. (Author/AM)",

Recent commission initiatives which resulted in data gathering included hearings and meetings in Boston, Denver, Tampa, Louisville, Berkeley, Minneapolis, Stamford, and Corpus Christi. The main body of the report focuses on and discusses such topics in relation to school desegregation as: the role of leadership, preparation of the community, restructuring of school districts, desegregation and educational quality, minority staff concerns,  classroom integration, extracurricular activities, student attitudes, and discipline in desegregated schools. At the end of the evaluation, the report asserts that the one conclusion that stands out above all others is that desegregation does work. The commission recommends that the following be kept in mind if the \"substantial progress being made in school desegregation is to be built upon\": (1) leaders must accept that desegregation is a constitutional imperative; (2) the Federal government must strengthen and expand programs designed to facilitate desegregation; (3) there must be vigorous enforcement of laws contributing to the development of desegregated communities; and (4) a major of investment of time and resources must be made in order to deal with misconceptions relating to  desegregation.

Data on family socioeconomic status, family structure, parent aspirations for the son and parent-child relationships were obtained by interviewing the father, mother, and son in each family. Results indicate that although levels of aspiration do not differ by race, the determinants of these aspirations do. Among black adolescents, the mother was the most influential in the determination of aspirational levels, while among the whites it was the father. This finding is not to be construed as a negation of the other parent's role, however, since in both cases the overall parent effect on son's aspiration was positive. Parent aspirations for  the son explains nearly half the variance in adolescent aspiration for both races. (Author/AM)",

Specifically, its aim is to define the role of bilingual education for the Filipino immigrant student. Educational goals are considered first. In deliberate planning, goal setting precedes assessment of the situation. The discrepancy between goals and what is actually obtained reflects the needs. The educational goals in the bilingual program are not to be different from those in the regular program except for the inclusion of the development and maintenance of bilingualism. The Filipino student's needs are discussed next. Basically, Filipino Americans need bilingual education, and Filipino bilingual teachers are best able to communicate the encouragement and  understanding needed by students who have recently immigrated. Maintenance of Filipino can be achieved without implementing a curriculum wide bilingual instruction scheme. A frame work for bilingual education is proposed in the second half of the paper. Adoption of this model will allow the Filipino language to be kept as an alternate tool of communication. The bilingual scheme proposed discusses the elementary and high school programs, and staff development. (Author/AM)",

Also discussed are the ensuing community struggles for the right to fashion the appropriate relief mandated by the Supreme Court and for the right to have quality bilingual bicultural education for students of all language and cultural backgrounds. The suit of Lau v. Nichols relating to San Francisco Unified School District was the last resort after all known channels for seeking equal educational opportunity had been exhausted. Paralleling the deteriorating situation in the school district were the accelerating juvenile delinquency rates in the 1960's in the Chinese community. The significance of  the Lau v. Nichols decision nation-wide was immediately felt. There are, according to the U.S. Office of Education, approximately five million school children in the U.S. covered by the decision. Beyond its impact on public education, this decision has long-range legal implications on both the effectiveness and quality of government sponsored social and legal services now provided to non-English speakers across the nation.

The areas addressed are: the economy, employment, housing, health, education, legislation, crime, and social welfare. By any of the accepted indicators of progress-employment, housing, education, etc.--many of the gains blacks made over the past decade were either wiped out or badly eroded in 1975, and the portents for the future are not encouraging. The report is replete with facts that support the league's contention that 1975 was most destructive to black progress. In addition to the moral failures underscored, the report reveals unwholesome social policy trends. Basically, the Nation'sunwillingness to face up to the seriousness of the problems that years of racism have created, and the  unwillingness to deal with those problems with the intensity and commitment their solution demands is emphasized. The report concludes with a number of recommendations that the American people should seriously consider in addressing the problems that are cited. (Author/AM)",

These were grouped into four categories: interracial contact, background characteristics of the respondents, perceptions of the racial attitudes of reference groups, and psychological attitudes. When bivariate relationships were inspected, tolerance among whites was shown to be related to frequent interracial contact, higher status, extensive parental education, and 12 other variables. Among blacks, fewer variables were associated with racial tolerance and the  relationships were weaker. These were: high educational aspirations; being older, female, and urban; having good grades, high self-esteem, and anomie; and perceiving tolerance. Among family, friends, and community, the relative importance of the correlates of racial tolerance was assessed through step-wise multiple regression. Perceptions of the attitudes of parents was generally the most important variable. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"Family life among black people in the United States has its roots in Africa. Many distinctive features of African family life were carried out in modified forms in the early African settlements in this country. The importance of the extended family, communalism, the important role of the grandmother, the collective responsibility of the care of the children and the adaptability of family structure are prominent features of Afro-American life today. Although many of the most prominent features of slavery were antithetical to the condition of viable forms of family life among the African people, black families always maintained patterns of family life even during slavery. These patterns often diverged, but not always, from the dominant patterns prevalent among the Europeans.  Underscoring that the concept of family is culturally determined and culturally bound, the factors that define and condition family life are considered in relation to the black family. After the Civil War, the elements of family life, which had survived and been modified into distinct patterns in relationship to slavery, came into full fruition. The family, along with the church and the school became the three institutions most responsible for black progress. Two sources of achievement of black families after the end of slavery are the acquisition of land and the opportunity to save money through the Freedmans' Savings Bank. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"Historically, the education of some slaves established a middle class within the black population. By the beginning of the 19th century many ex-slaves were able to establish their own business enterprises, using the skills learned. This skilled group became the proponents of freedom for their people and participated in the establishment of schools for black children. Funds from various sources helped support the institutionalization of the freedmen's educational system. Common schools were first established, then high schools, and by 1868, the school system was virtually completed. As the school system stabilized, so did the methods and programs of instruction, and soon it became apparent that higher education institutions were needed in order to supply more teachers. Blacks  played a large role in the establishment of free public schools through their participation in politics. As opportunities for political participation declined, black faith in formal education grew, and the school population increased. Although the move to equalize educational opportunity for black people extends from the 1880's the fight to desegregate began in 1935 and led to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A little more than a century ago, it was illegal to educate blacks, and today black people are still struggling to enjoy the basic right to a quality education that all other Americans enjoy.

        "description":"The main purpose of this study is to measure the attitudes of teachers toward speech varieties used by speakers of Black English and to determine whether there is any evidence that those attitudes are linked to pupils' classroom performance in reading. Also investigating is whether exposure to information about and experience with varieties of Black English will bring about a change in the attitudes of teachers, and whether teachers tend to transmit their own attitudes to pupils. The research was conducted in grades 4-6 in three sites with a total of 456 pupils and 37 teachers. Among the main conclusions of the study are the following: (1) that teachers and pupils tend to agree in their attitudes toward black speech varieties on certain crucial attitude dimensions, such as the  greater likelihood of the Standard Black English (SBE) speaker's success in school; (2) that exposure to new information appears to have no significant effect on apparently well-established attitudinal characteristics; (3) that teacher attitudes have little documentable effect on actual reading gains made by the pupil, but appear to have some relation to the grades assigned by the teachers. It is concluded that teacher attitudes do have an impact on pupils--on their achievement and perhaps most directly on their attitudes -- but the nature of the impact is influenced by many factors.

It is noted that, in order for the learning disabled individual to have the opportunity to develop potentialities to his fullest and to minimize any dysfunction of perception, cognition, etc., a carefully structured school program and a  specially trained teacher are the prime requisites. Priority given in an approach to the education of the learning disabled individual should include the following four basics: (1) control of attention and misdirected activity through a structured environment; (2) building competence through adjusted task and presentation; (3) improvement of deficit functions; (4) mastering of academic skills within the individual's ability range.

        "description":"Eight years ago, official resistance to desegregation of the public schools in South Carolina was still firm. Due to the pressure applied by the Federal Courts and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) Office of Civil Rights, more desegregation began to occur gradually during the years after 1966. In January 1970, the Greenville and Darlington County schools were ordered to eliminate their dual school systems in midyear. HEW made it clear to South Carolina school officials that freedom of choice was no longer acceptable in those districts where they had clearly failed to eliminate segregation. At present there are 57 school districts which are operating under voluntary desegregation plans and 36 under Federal court order. A host of these court order districts are  operating under obsolete, unlawful desegregation plans. The movement for &quot;structural desegregation&quot; of the schools in South Carolina is over. While the system of dual schools has been substantially eliminated, the same energy has not been devoted to eliminate the barriers which still block the road to a quality education for black and poor children. These barriers assume the form of the continuing costs of desegregation and new inequities unforeseen and unanticipated five to ten years ago. (Author/JM)",

Nor have they considered the history and reasons for black sensitivity on the subject of planned family size. This bulletin puts some of these issues and concepts into context within the American scene. It explores the present spectrum of opinion among black leaders and the cultural and political backgrounds that have influenced current thought. The responses of blacks in putting family planning into practice are also outlined, together with some probable trends in family size. It is concluded that, at present, black women are more influenced in the practice of rejection of  family planning methods by the practical considerations of bearing and raising children than by any abstract political and philosophical questions on either side. But, some black men may look at issues differently. A New England study indicates that black males under 30 are both more likely to concur with the genocide-conspiracy theory and be more hesitant about condoning the limitation of black family size than are older black males.

The major directional change for Georgia's ESEA Title I has occurred not in dollars allotted or in numbers of children served, but in concentration of effort. Since 1973, the funds have been concentrated in reading, language arts, oral and written communication, mathematics, and preschool education. Improvements in Title I include the following: a shift from serving all students who are eligible to serving younger children, the improvement of instructional quality through the use of inservice education and teacher aides, the involvement of community and parents, and an emphasis on quality programs for a few children  rather than a smattering for many. Evaluation efforts began in 1970 when a sample was drawn from second, fourth, and sixth graders and in both Title I and non-Title I elementary schools in the State. Data analysis showed trends that many more students were in need of instructional services than were receiving them, and that students who were receiving Title I help in reading, mathematics, and English recorded gains slightly higher in those areas than non-Title I pupils in the same school; however, they remained behind in non-Title I schools. Subsequent evaluations are based on local school officials perceptions of the programs as to the degree they are successful or unsuccessful. (Author/AM)",

Neither of these grasp essential components of young children's ethnic attitudes or prejudices, nor do they detail the major developmental factors leading to the growth of tolerance and the decline of prejudice. To explain these features of children's ethnic attitudes, a cognitive-developmental view is elaborated in this paper. This theory undertakes to explain why prejudices tend to be formed by young children in almost any cultural milieu; to explain why prejudice tends to decline with psychosocial and cognitive development in most cultural milieus, and to explain why children or adults of a given chronological age  vary in prejudice in terms of environmental factors leading to development or retardation psychosocially. Prejudice in young children is primarily the active interpretation of physical and other crude differences between races and groups to which the child is necessarily exposed. Some typical seven year old second grade interchanges are presented to illustrate how prejudice emerges from the basic characteristics of the young child's thinking about social roles and groups. The educational implications of this theory are that efforts to develop interethnic tolerance should be parts of broader efforts at moral and civic education designed to stimulate moral stage development.

This course of study is then used in an experiment that employs nonstandard English to improve communications in mathematics. Subjects are members of two seventh grade general mathematics classes. Sixty-two students participated in the study -- 35 females and 27 males. Control and experimental groups are statistically the same for intelligence quotient scores, reading scores, and pretest scores on a standardized mathematics achievement test. The experimental group uses the 30 mathematics lessons developed for  the study, while the control group uses a mathematics textbook. Both the experimental and the control group receive the Metropolitan Achievement Test -- Advanced Arithmetic as the posttest. After the posttest has been administered, the mean gain score for the experimental group is found to be 2.20 higher than the mean gain score of the control group. One of the major conclusions made from an analysis of the data is that a set of general mathematics problems designed specifically for the disadvantaged student can be written in nonstandard English if suitable precautions are taken.

Questionnaires eliciting self-conceptions and responses to hypothetical feedback are administered to 772 students, a five percent random sample from the eight comprehensive and academic high schools in a large city. Using a symbolic interactionist approach, internalization and externalization of feedback are studied to test hypotheses derived from assumptions about self-enhancement, self-consistency, and distinctiveness of feedback. Results indicate that self-consistency has more impact than  self-enhancement on the attribution of causality for evaluations in school. Hypotheses based on a tendency toward self-enhancement are more successful in predicting attributions to ability -- and internal attributions in general -- than are hypotheses based on self-consistency. Academic self-concept is affected by the social context of the school. Students in low achieving minority groups or in low achievement schools are less likely to attribute low grades to lack of ability than are students in high achievement schools, for whom low grades are distinctive. These results are said to help to explain why more students from low achieving groups believe they are average in ability than would be expected on the basis of their grades. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"The ethnic factor in public education is the main focus of this paper. Among those playing leading roles in the society, there is a general tendency to underestimate the importance of ethnicity as a factor in group life, and usefulness of knowledge about ethnic groupings in America as an aid in coping with social problems, and, perhaps more vital, as a resource available for strengthening and enriching our national existence, including the educational experience. Along with down grading of ethnicity, a series of other issues is addressed: the public school's failure to live up to its expectations to serve as a means of upward mobility for the lower socioeconomic classes, the necessity of ethnic studies, the salience of ethnicity, and ethnic succession. The relative neglect of the  historical and contemporary fact of the very close correlation in American life of both class and ethnicity has led to a lack of preciseness and a lack of appreciation of the relative importance of differential ethnicity. It is suggested that perhaps the single most important goal a complicated, dynamic, and diverse society must learn in order to achieve and to educate its young to strive for, is the fostering of a new pluralism.

A listing of central issues dealt with include the following: (1) quota and affirmative action--the most dramatic and most far-reaching in its implications; (2) ethnic studies--with the current rising demand of white ethnic groups to be included in the curriculum revision, there is real confusion among educators as to how to respond to the new surges and militancy that have arisen; (3) bilingual  education--Spanish speaking groups have long perceived bilingualism as a key to their survival, and Chinese demands are currently litigating in the Supreme Court; (4) government reorganization--overlooked in the past is that there is no plan for the reorganization of municipal power which does not affect ethnic group relations quite dramatically; (5) racism--it has the most devasting consequences on intergroup relations in America; and (6) group identity--it has extensive public policy ramifications and is seen as deserving serious attention.

The program utilized techniques borrowed from related programs and reflects recent social sciences findings on the continued impact of the ethnic factor in American society. The project's Workshop on American Pluralism established a number of innovative precedents in the contemporary movement to make American education more responsive to the cultural needs and new assertiveness of minority groups in American society. This essay sketches the scope of this undertaking and, at the same time, places the program in both its historical context and philosophic framework. This program provides a small group experience for a  selected cross-section of Americans from diverse ethnic, religious, regional, and social backgrounds. Ethnicity and other collective identities are assumed to be important factors that generate differences in attitude and outlook among Americans. Consistent with this fundamental assumption, the program aims to increase the number the range of cultural differences within each workshop group. Among the topics discussed are the following: the origins and forerunner of the Minnesota program, the importance of analyzing each individual's particular communication style, and the reexamination of the rules that come to govern different cultural groups.

The document includes a brief summary of the program. The morning sessions were devoted to an exploration of issues surrounding ethnicity in education. Following the keynote address, the participants divided into 12 groups for small round table discussions where immediate concerns and problems relating to the broad agenda of ethnic factors in education were addressed. A series of questions revolving around the key areas of (1) generating attitudes in teachers and school personnel conducive to fostering  racial and ethnic group understanding; (2) outlining specific educational goals and designing methods to implement the new pluralism in the curriculum and in the school environment; and, (3) recognizing the legitimate demands of diverse ethnic groups while avoiding fragmentation, were raised and later answered by a multiethnic response panel. The afternoon session was devoted to programmatic workshops in which the participants defined the issues with even greater precision and proposed recommendations to meet many of the pressing needs. The recommendations which appear in the second part of this document were given as responses to the major questions posed in each workshop. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"In reviewing statistics of the racial patterns in the recent history of the Cleveland public school system, as well as all of the evidence included in the voluminous record in this case, the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio sought an answer to a single question of constitutional law: to what extent, if any, were the defendants in this case, public officials and public agencies, responsible for creating or for maintaining or both the segregated situation in the Cleveland public schools. In interpreting the evidence in the record, the court faced a number of recurring questions or problems. While the evidence in this case was voluminous, one question which it did not answer directly was what the racial composition of any given residential area was at any specific  time. This information was crucial in assessing the intent and effect of many of the local defendents' actions. Another issue that became one of the most sharply disputed was that of the capacity of any given school. Much documentary evidence was submitted to the court concerning specific assignment decisions of the local defendents. This evidence has, purportedly for clarity's sake, been analyzed by geographical area and within such analyses, generally in chronological order. Following this detailed examination, the court addresses the general issues of relay classes, intact busing, special transfers, faculty assignment, housing, and neighborhood school policy.

The six case study districts are: Birmingham, Durham, Ewing, Goldsboro, Minneapolis, and Orangeburg. The introduction addresses the following topics: background and significance of the study, definitions, procedures, criteria for selecting school districts, site selection,  preparation for site visits, and debriefing. A section on methodological considerations examines methodological problems involved in the descriptive case study approach to research in the area of desegregation. These are sampling, documentation analysis, and generalization--areas for which existing research and evaluation methods are seen as not providing answers.

The student objectives are: (1) To identify the social contribution of workers at different socioeconomic levels, (2) to identify ways in which society is benefited by the willingness of individuals to utilize their abilities in vocational tasks, (3) to give examples of ways in which business and labor organizations operate on the principle of private interest versus  social responsibility, (4) to describe the personal values and the social contributions of participation in community affairs as part of one's career, and (5) to describe how work in America may help to overcome the social problems threatening mankind. This package is one of a series developed for use at the high school level and may be implemented through the traditional subject areas or taught by teachers and/or counselors as self-contained mini-courses or group guidance units. Activities related to the enabling objectives are appended. (TA)",

A sample of fourth formers in four different schools was used (281 boys and 162 girls): (1) 53.0% of the sample--co-educational school, largely executive-type suburb outside Wollongong; (2) 21.9% of the sample--co-educational school, in a good socio-economic area of Sydney; (3) 12.4% of the sample--boys' school in largely executive-type suburb of Sydney; and (4) 12.6% of the sample--boys' school in a working class area of Sydney. Results are presented in percentages for the total sample, followed by note of major deviations from the total group. Where subgroups existed percentages of those who answered the  question or section are reported. The results include age, country of birth, family composition, fathers' occupations, subject studied, subject levels, attitude toward school, subject preferences and perceived level of difficulty, decision regarding further schooling, main reasons for leaving school after fourth form, types of career choices, awareness of institutions of higher education and entry requirements, information on apprenticeship (awareness of its nature, attitudes toward), and how the subjects perceived school guidance services.

        "description":"A statewide survey of educators and lay citizens was made to uncover their perceptions as to what are the most crucial concerns, problems, and needs of vocational education in Kentucky. A modified Delphi Survey was considered to be the most appropriate survey technique. A questionnaire (Appendix A) asking for a list of six to eight major concerns, problems, or needs facing vocational education in Kentucky was sent to respondents in five groups representing several sectors of the economy, several levels of the vocational education system, and all geographic areas of the state. The resulting items were developed into a survey instrument in which the respondents were asked to indicate their perceptions of the importance of each of 62 items on a five point scale (Appendix B). All  items on the survey instrument were analyzed to provide mean scores and standard deviations for the total respondents as well as for each of the five respondent groups, which were then rank ordered according to the mean score for the total respondent group (Appendix C). The 62 items were then grouped into 13 clusters based upon their commonalities (Appendix D), and this information, combined with other sources, was used to establish research, exemplary, and dissemination priorities for 1976.

        "description":"Employment in nursing homes is projected to increase from 583,000 in 1973 to 1,036,000 in 1985. Substantially more workers are expected to be employed in nearly all occupations. The projected growth of 78% is faster than that expected in any segment of the health industry. Most nursing home employees are service workers. Two of these occupational classifications, practical nurses and nursing aides, orderlies, and attendants, accounted for over half of total employment in 1973. For many occupations in nursing homes, annual openings resulting from the need to replace workers who leave the labor force are expected to be more significant than those resulting from employment growth. An analysis of employment growth and the supply-demand situation for key occupations in the nursing  home industry indicated that nursing homes should be able to meet their manpower needs provided that wages, benefits, hours, etc., will be competitive in the job market. An appendix describes the methods used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to project manpower requirements in key nursing home occupations based on its program for developing projections for the entire economy's industrial and occupational structure.

The purpose of the evaluation was to describe the types of courses, students, faculty, and instructional procedures involved, determine the effectiveness of the program, and survey the reactions of faculty, students and state-level personnel to the program. Questionnaire survey forms were used to gather information about the nature of the courses, students and instructors. Evaluation reports were used to gather information from students and faculty about their reactions to each lesson. A criterion referenced test was  administered prior to, and at the completion of instruction. Of the 430 students in the 25 schools, 356 completed both pre and post tests. State reports were received from 36 persons. Conclusions demonstrated the value of the program and the feasibility to implement it in a variety of ways and settings.

These courses are one term in length and organized to ease the transition from university studies to professional work, providing a comprehensive picture of the field in question. The survey sample consisted of 1,326 of the 2,625 students who enrolled in the fall term of 1971 and spring term of 1972 in a vocationally-oriented course, completed it, and passed the examination. The mean age of students was 28.l years, 44% of them female, and 25% part-time students. Forty-four percent took the vocationally-oriented course as a part of  full-time general university studies and represented lower middle class (47%) and upper middle class (30%) social status. Adult students tended to be employed to a greater extent than regular students and their employment was more often within the course area. The results were favorable in terms of the types of students utilizing the vocationally-oriented courses and in terms of course effectiveness. There were considerable differences between the courses in other areas, e.g., background variables such as sex, employment situation, and purpose of studies as well as the ratings concerning the effectiveness/usefulness of the course.

        "description":"To examine the hypothesis that occupational licensure is primarily a restrictive device to protect those licensed from competition, analysis focused on the licensure of non-professional occupations in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, covering 36 licenses issued by the three states for 12 occupations (e.g. electricians, barbers, opticians) and 3 sub-classes within those occupations. The study examined the composition of the licensing boards; their policies with respect to prices, advertising, and work constraints; constraints specifically incorporated in legislation; and the examination process. On ten of twelve licensure examinations for which adequate data were available, statistically significant positive correlations were found between failure rates and  unemployment rates, supporting the hypothesis. Other findings were that licensing processes generated work restrictions, jurisdictional disputes among occupations, and restrictions on price competition; that licensure by reciprocity is rare and difficult to achieve; that licensure boards pay little attention to consumer complaints; that boards seldom revoke licenses; and that they are overwhelmingly composed of members of the licensed occupation with a vested interest in protecting those already licensed. The report is presented in four parts: (1) Legislation, the Boards, and Restrictionism; (2) Origins of Licensing Legislation; (3) The &quot;Record&quot; on Complaints; and (4) Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations for effective reform.

Because the theoretical basis of career education is considered to be career development theory, the essay discusses life stages, developmental tasks, and career patterns. The implications of the highly industrialized nature of our society for careers and for career education are then examined, including the continuing need for people even in a largely automated economy. The importance of work to semi-skilled workers, office workers, executives, and professionals, as well as to youth, the elderly, the handicapped, ethnic minorities, and women is considered, along with the competing and complementary roles provided by the family,  leisure, and civic life. That the increasing number of society-maintaining workers may find new life meanings through these aspects of their careers is taken into account, together with their implications for career education. The monograph concludes with a listing of six objectives of career education which are made necessary by the diverse meanings of work in our changing society. (Author/TA)",

This data source, which describes heads of households and structural characteristics of labor markets, is unique in that underemployed heads of households indicate whether their part-time working status is voluntary or involuntary. Among the heads who were employed during 1971, 15% were part-time workers in the sense that they worked, on average, less than 30 hours per week and/or no more than 40 weeks per year. Findings of this study indicate that 54% of these part-time workers were involuntarily underemployed, willing but unable to devote more time to gainful  employment. Furthermore, household heads who were involuntarily underemployed in 197l constituted a clear majority of all non-aged heads who were (1) unemployed (58.0%) and (2) recent labor force dropouts (55.5%) during the spring of l972. These heads of households are, when working, concentrated in low wage jobs. (Author)",

        "description":"In this study, an examination of the determinants and consequences of occupational knowledge is carried out using data collected from the National Longitudinal Survey of 5,159 young women. The study closely parallels a 1975 study by Parnes and Kohen utilizing information collected from about 5,000 young men. The significance of various background factors as potential determinants of a young woman's occupational knowledge score and the effect of this score on subsequent earnings and occupational status are investigated. In addition to contrasting the causal patterns for black and white women, similarities and differences between the results for young men in the Parnes and Kohen study and the results for young women in this study are discussed. The report notes that the extent of  vocational counseling was irrelevant as a determinant of the knowledge of the world of work score. It was found that the relevance of occupational information, as measured by this score, to predict early adult labor market success was not as clear for young women as it has been shown to be for men. It is concluded that a pre-career educational \"funneling process\" effectively restricts career options of many young women to occupational categories which have traditionally fallen within the stereotypical \"women's occupations\" categories.

Perceptions of occupations rest heavily on stereotypes that are often class based and occur in sets, each stereotypic feature connoting others in the set as well. Race, ethnicity, sex, class subculture, level of attractiveness and kind of personality are common components of such sets. Linguistic evocations encourage a focus upon the special procedures of high prestige occupations rather than on the achievement of demonstrable results, which are expected from low  prestige occupations. The various levels of the occupational hierarchy systematically reinforce each other's high or low standing and also systematically legitimize inequalities in the allocation of values in society as a whole.

As a matter of law the nation would be committed to achieving an adult unemployment rate of 3% within four years. If those charged with the development and implementation of fiscal and monetary policy--the President, the House and Senate Budget Committees, and the Federal Reserve Board--did not think the full employment goal feasible or wise, they would have to say so, explain why, and develop ameliorative measures. Recognizing that wishing full employment will not suffice, the Act provides for micro-employment programs and for policies that would hopefully allow the application of greater  monetary and fiscal stimulus with less inflation. All else failing to achieve the 3% unemployment rate target, S-50 provides for public job creation, presumably on a large scale if need be. S-50 does not deal with the issue of why we face the high unemployment dilemma to begin with, nor does it provide a convincing mechanism for dealing with the inflation that could result from its own provisions. In forcing us to debate the issues, particularly the inflation-unemployment trade-off within our conventional economic policy, S-50 provides opportunity for explicit analysis of both the benefits and costs of full employment. Out of such debate, needed changes in the bill can be attended to. (WL)",

The objectives were (1) to identify and compare selected characteristics of farm owners or operators who stayed on a farm in the Appalachian region of Ohio with selected characteristics of their brothers who moved to a metropolitan area (age, age of family members, family size, education, occupation and employment, sibling order, residence and mobility, involvement in social institutions, marital status, satisfaction with life, income, social class, aspirations for employment and business opportunities, and future residence plans), (2) to determine the extent of inter-generational and intra-generational interaction for both  groups, (3) to compare rural and urban brothers with respect to attitudes toward selected American societal values, and (4) to identify factors that weighed heavily on the decision to stay in the Appalachian region of Ohio or migrate to a metropolitan area. Farmers in the 28 counties in the Southern and Eastern Appalachian region of Ohio served as the basic population. The counties were stratified into three groups based upon total population, and three counties were randomly selected from the high, three from the medium, and two from low population groups. After further random sampling 44 rural farmers were interviewed as were their 44 urban brothers. Findings, conclusions, recommendations, and references are included. (WL)",

It began operating in 1972 founded on the premise that the real goal of a worthwhile education should be the preparation of students for a productive and satisfying life in their chosen careers. The UCEC model includes close interaction with and utilization of educational, industrial, business, and other community resources to insure that students gain the proper tools for acquiring marketable career skills. The program is divided into three phases. The major thrust of Phase 1 is orienting students to UCEC, diagnosing student strengths and potential problems in academic and personal areas, and exposing students to a variety of career information.  Phase 2 includes basic classroom instructional activities and career exploratory (&quot;hands-on&quot;) field experiences. Phase 3 deals primarily with advanced or specialized experiences for students in their career interests. From an analysis of student records it was concluded that while most of these students were low achievers at their former schools, they showed a high level of academic and personal growth at UCEC.

It was designed to demonstrate the means by which the following can be compared across cultures: Comparative influence on educational matters that are assigned by community leaders and parents to selected individuals or groups, and comparative extent of responsibility for educational improvement so assigned. The design presents a novel system for realistic field interviewing in a country where there is a language barrier for the researcher. Included in the design are descriptions of how preliminary plans are made for gaining school cooperation, methods of selecting samples of parents, and  determination of the sample of community leaders. Results of the study, which proved the model's viability across cultures, are presented in summary form (tables and narrative). The summary includes information which demonstrates the greater influence in England and Taiwan of district administrators, principals or headmasters, teachers, and of both state (province) and federal officials as perceived by parents and community leaders. It also includes evidence from parents that in Wisconsin the influence of the school boards and parents is greater than in England and Taiwan. (Author/WL)",

The questions of what information should be gathered, where this information is stored, and how it can be retrieved from the community are considered. The model focuses on the assessment of human needs and consists of three basic components: (1) a framework component, which develops a classification schema for human needs, (2) an indicator component, which determines what information should be collected within the constraints of the classification schema, and (3) an information collection component, which elaborates  sources of and retrieval strategies for those indicators selected. Three basic concepts--need, community, and model--which are central to the entire research intent are discussed in detail. An 8-step research procedure, utilizing an extensive and critical review of the literature, which will be used to develop the model is presented. A proposed dissertation outline and a 2-page reference list are included. (WL)",

Needs and interests of students enrolled in adult basic education courses were assessed by questionnaire. Counselor interviews with interested students followed, which focused on job requirements and qualifications, preparations, and training. Guest lecturers--vocational-technical personnel, business leaders, and community action representatives--also participated. A follow-up evaluation instrument was sent to determine student progress in seeking further training or employment. (The follow-up procedure is detailed in the report, and the results of the survey are analyzed.) The results indicated that 59% had taken the first step in pursuing career development, the major goal of the report. Among the  conclusions were the findings that most students had no concept of the occupational and training opportunities available. It was also found that students adopted a more realistic approach to seeking short term goals when knowledge of job qualifications was acquired. Both the initial needs assessment and evaluation questionnaire are included. (WL)",

The primary goal was to build upon the activities of the first year through the use of workshops and inservice programs to assist in the development of specific activities for the students. Project activities included preparing and placing experience carts (which contain career education tools and equipment) in elementary schools, compiling and distributing a community resource guide, and establishing and continuing a community learning center program for high school juniors and seniors which provides observation experiences in the community to aid in career decision-making. Also, the project contributed to greater interest in career  education at the state level. Included in the document is a 67-page third-party evaluation report (by a team from the Bureau of Educational Research and Services, University of Tennessee). Nine different tests were administered as part of the evaluation design, and test findings comprise the major portion of the evaluation report. Success of the project was attributed to positive attitudes of teachers and school personnel and community support. Appendixes (70 pages) include test results, materials on the community learning center program, and results of a teacher survey. (RG)",

Differences in participation between whites and Orientals are examined and the relationship of participation to sociodemographic determinants are investigated. Levels of occupational status reached by Oriental workers in  the U.S. are described and documented and the dynamics of the occupational structure, conditions influencing mobility, and the consequences of these for achievement are examined. Earnings from wages and salaries in 1969 serve as a measure in the differential analysis of income.

Emphasis is placed on their labor force participation, employment, occupational achievement, mobility, weeks worked, and earnings. The summary profiles are designed to facilitate a grasp of essential patterns of similarities and differences within a minority among regions and metropolitan areas. Brief summary tables concentrate on those regions and metropolitan areas in which relatively large numbers of each minority are concentrated. Much greater detail is combined in the tables which follow. Comparisons of ethnic minorities indicate that (1) levels of  employment, occupational achievement, and earnings differ by location, but that the overall rankings of minorities are not modified within areas, (2) levels of participation and achievement tend to be highest in areas where a minority is most numerous, and (3) achievements of minorities in the labor market are more dependent on their minority characteristics and educational attainment than on location.

        "description":"At the request of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBP), the Center for Vocational Education assessed the comparative effectiveness of approaches for delivering occupational education, particularly the use of civil service employees who provide occupational education programs within FBP institutions as opposed to use of community resources through contractual arrangements with schools or other institutions or individuals. Structured personnel interviews focusing on cost effectiveness, student satisfaction, teacher performance, scope and variety of programming, and program flexibility were conducted with institutional administration and occupational education staff and students at six institutions. Major findings indicate that: (1) Contracted programs were not necessarily more cost  effective than civil service programs; (2) programs established under contractual agreement were more adaptive to changes in the labor market and student interest than civil service programs; (3) student satisfaction did not appear to be dependent upon type of delivery system; (4) instructional preparation was satisfactory across all delivery systems; and (5) current FBP programming is limited in scope and variety. Recommendations include these: that the FBP utilize community-based resource systems, that civil service on-the-job training be replaced with cooperative education programs, and that study release time be pursued at every opportunity. Appendixes (80 pages) include the research approach, staff development needs, and survey instruments. (Author/KJ)",

Survey results were based on 142 responses: 87 from students, 28 from staff, and 27 from the Indian community. The three respondent groups were consistent in their agreement on relative priorities and severities of the various areas of concern. Major needs related to staff sensitivity, to student problems, communication systems, the training time period, training in work attitudes, job placement  followup, and present and future manpower requirements. It was recommended that task forces be established to examine these concerns and prepare alternative solutions.

Chapter 1 gives an overview of the report by the committee (formed in 1974), whose two major tasks were to review and assess the research and development activities sponsored by USOE under the Vocational Education Act of 1963 as amended in 1968, and to recommend changes. Chapter 2 presents a brief discussion of vocational education in this country: how it differs from general education, how it has changed over the years,  and what issues it faces today. Chapter 3 summarizes the history of vocational education research and development (R&D) legislation and funding. Chapter 4 gives the results of the committee's assessment of vocational education R&D programs which were obtained by reviewing large-scale evaluations, by searching for examples of successful projects, and by interviewing people involved in the R&D program. Chapter 5 presents the committee's description and assessment of the administration of vocational education R&D program and their recommendations for changes in the program's structure and management that are intended to result in an integrated R&D system.

The report describes developmental events, prevailing conditions relevant to consulting efforts, and outcomes of those efforts, and the question of why one major segment of the plant (quality assurance) seemed better able to sustain the QWL effort than the other major segment (production) is analyzed. Implementation of project  concepts is reported to be limited by the organization's financial problems (those related to adjustment to new ownership, and technical difficulties); nevertheless, positive outcomes are reported in terms of satisfactorily meeting production goals, ego-involvement of the workforce, comparatively low absenteeism, and the plant's survival of the frustrations of start-up delays. Recommendations are made for future efforts to achieve both enriched quality of worklife and improved business effectiveness/efficiency. (TA)",

Career education, in particular, is viewed as being capable of making contributions toward increasing productivity. Two basic assumptions are made: (l) Problems of productivity have a long history of development and will require a long time to cure, and (2) while the changes called for by career education are clearly only part of the needed solutions, each can help to some extent. The major part of the discussion centers on the U. S. Office of Education policy paper, &quot;An Introduction to Career Education,&quot; which contains a listing of 11 current conditions  calling for educational reform. Ways are suggested in which these conditions have contributed to lack of productivity, and changes called for by career education are outlined which would lead toward correction of the conditions and so to an increase in productivity.

The purpose of these papers was to assess, monitor, and report on the condition of career education as a reform movement in the United States, and to recommend to Congress appropriate legislation for the furtherance of career education. Four papers on the efficacy of career education focused on career awareness, academic achievement, career decision-making, and other ways of assessing effectiveness. Eight papers were commissioned to help the Council identify the various Federal and state legislative authorizations for career education related activities. The topics are: &quot;Key Concepts in Career Education: Legislative and Policy Issues,&quot;&quot;Career Education: An Idea Whose Time Has Come,&quot;&quot;Proposals for Career Education Legislation,&quot;&quot;Career Education and the Future,&quot;&quot;An Analysis of Federal Legislation Bearing on Career Education,&quot;&quot;The Implementation and Administration of a Federal Career Education Program,&quot;&quot;An Analysis of State Laws on Career Education and Pending State Legislation,&quot; and &quot;Analysis and Synthesis of Existing Career Education Legislation.&quot; Additional papers are entitled: &quot;Review and Synthesis of Research Concerning Career Education&quot; and &quot;The Emerging History of Career Education.&quot; (TA)",

The member learns in the family to relate with ease to others and to accept himself. Family group consultation is a means of helping families to become effective as the members relate better to each other. Other approaches to family counseling do not meet this criterion because they emphasize division of the family or ignore the importance of actual family interaction. The specific course of family group consultation as it ranges from information gathering to commitment and interaction of group members on suggested changes in behavior patterns is described. The final session of a group is used for summarizing the consultation process after eight or twelve  weeks of meetings. A research test in 1965 on this family counseling method did not show statistically significant changes occurring among the participants. There is other evidence that changes in family functioning do occur and that the method meets a distinct need of many families. Further evaluation of family group consultation is suggested. (NS)",

        "description":"The research questions whether many tests used by employers for employee selection do discriminate inadvertantly. Because sub-groups or minority groups tend to be culturally disadvantaged, standardized tests have many shortcomings. When used as selection devices standardized tests may: (1) not provide reliable differentiation in the range of the minority group's scores; (2) use predictive validity different from that for the standardization and validation groups; and (3) use interpretation that is quite dependent upon the cultural background of the majority. To eliminate cultural bias in testing, tests that are culture-free, culture-fair, culture-equivalent, and measure creativity need to be developed. The concepts of using \"dual test standards\" and \"compensatory training\" may  help create new methods for employee selection. It is concluded that proper testing practices need to be followed by improvement in hiring situations. Recommendations are that: (1) job descriptions be examined and requirements established before tests are used; (2) tests be developed by reputable psychologists; (3) inflexible minimum scores be re-examined; (4) test scores be combined with other data on performance; (5) test scores be validated in the setting used; and (6) re-tests be offered to unsuccessful applicants with culturally disadvantaged backgrounds.

        "description":"This paper investigates particular aspects of the black person as client and therapist. It emphasizes the importance of heterogeneity within the black population in the understanding of the black client, the black therapist and their interaction. There are important differences between blacks due to urban vs. rural background; socioeconomic status; religious affiliation; education; etc. A stereotype of \"The Black\" is thus misleading. Both client and therapist must acknowledge and deal with the effects of the black stereotype in their interactions, as they can make a difference in the therapeutic outcome. It is noted that, although the black professional therapist will typically be a member of the middle or upper class, this is not necessarily true of the client. The therapist  should be aware of different cultural styles among black people, especially those with whom he intends to work. Such awareness will also help the therapist strengthen his own racial identity. In the therapist-client interaction, the twin dangers of over- and under-emphasis on the importance of race are noted. The ways in which racial issues are to be resolved will depend on the particular case. (NG)",

A sample of high school students also ranked the order of importance of these factors. Eighty-two percent of the schools returned the completed ballot (165/202 schools). The results indicated that the most important element in the college admissions decision was the student's achievement in high school, followed by SAT scores. The students' impressions of the importance of the factors were generally  accurate in reflecting the rank order established by the college admissions personnel. The participants feel that the order of priorities of the college admissions personnel is misplaced: counselors' opinions as \"evaluators\" of students are taken as more relevant than the direct evidence of scholarship and motivation that students themselves can present in interviews and in essays on college applications. It is recommended that counselors stop evaluating students and begin to help students to learn to evaluate themselves. (Author)",

However, more recent studies suggest a new trend in attitudes. Women have now assumed a pose of wanting to work, while at the same time they tend to cluster in traditionally female occupations and express uncertainty over the compatibility of the dual role. Baldwin-Wallace College, a liberal arts and pre-professional college of approximately 2,200 enrollment, has undertaken a program of career planning for adult women to assist them in understanding themselves, and their relationship to careers and occupations. Attitudinal and institutional changes cannot be accomplished by women alone. Since males play an  influential role in the career development of women and are generally more credible to and have more impact upon established institutions, it is essential that men also become significantly involved in the facilitation of women's career development. The proposed presentation attempts to provide information about this on-going career program and the use of male and female counselors in the program by discussion and the experiential involvement of the audience.

Although male dyads outperformed female dyads, group performance did not vary by pay allocation treatment, even though subjects in the non-contingent pay treatment indicated the pay system was less motivating than did subjects in the three differential pay allocation treatments. Although no main  effects of treatment were indicated on various satisfaction measures, members of higher performing dyads reported higher satisfaction than members of lower performing dyads on several measures, particularly when higher performance was associated with higher pay.

The primary goal of AC is to identify those factors of interest and motivation which facilitate achievement in any setting where conformance is positive behavior. The purposes of the study were: (1) to examine the correlation of the AC scale with grade point average for 40 randomly selected college male freshmen; and (2) to attempt to improve the reliability and validity of the AC scale by dropping various test items after each computer analysis. It was found that elimination of &quot;bad&quot; test items of the scale enhanced both its validity and reliability. Relationships between AC and various  intellectual variables were found to be in need of much additional empirical investigation. (SJL)",

        "description":"Parents and adolescents were taught to resolve conflicts concerning rules, responsibilities, and values through the use of problem solving and communication skills. Problem-solving included (1) defining the problem, (2) listing alternative solutions, (3) evaluating the solutions, and (4) planning implementation. Communication skills included (1) clear expression and reception of meaning, (2) appropriate emotive-attentive style, and (3) reflective listening. Twenty-four parent-adolescent dyads were assigned to either a treatment or wait-list control group. Each dyad in the treatment group received five sessions of therapy, during which modeling, guided practice, role-playing, feedback, and social reinforcement were utilized to teach problem solving and communication skills.  Treatment produced highly significant increases in problem-solving behavior in structured discussions of hypothetical and real problems. Limited improvement in communication at home was also obtained on self-report measures. It was concluded that the present intervention provides a viable means for treating parentadolescent conflicts. Suggestions for improving generalization and integrating the model into a comprehensive behavioral family therapy were considered. (Author)",

The technique differs from other behavior modification techniques in that it is based upon self-control rather than external control of disruptive behavior. The Turtle Technique first teaches the child how to respond when he feels threatened by uncontrollable emotions or external events which make him feel like lashing out. The learning of the turtle-like withdrawing response is then followed by relaxation training, generalization training and problem solving. Suggestions for maintenance of this system of self-control and other possible applications of it are provided in the concluding section. (SJL)",

Each couple completed three tasks which varied along the dimension of task structure and the order of task presentation. Analysis of the results indicated significant changes in leadership such that high task structure resulted in less dominance for males and lower speech durations for males and females. Medium task structure, which was confounded with high conflict arousal built into the task, resulted in the most relationship oriented type of leadership and the greatest duration of speech for both males and females. There were also significant differences among groups  such that married men exhibited more task oriented leadership and dominance and less relationship oriented leadership than unmarried men. Married women who were parents exhibited less relationship oriented leadership and lower speech durations than women who did not have children. Men in all three groups showed more task oriented leadership than their female partners, but both sexes shared equally in relationship oriented leadership. (Author)",

The empirically-generated data of this study support the logically-generated Piagetian Theory.

Teachers are concerned about open education, behavior modification, humanistic education, informal techniques, accountability and test results. Many teachers are high achievers who set severe goals for themselves and live with a high level of fear of failure. More requirements and criticisms come from the community. One Georgia school system has begun a teacher-support program to encourage personal sharing and support within the system. This was done through the  use of transactional analysis and other personal reinforcing techniques in groups after school one afternoon a week for six to eight weeks. The groups are organized by the principal or school counselor with leadership provided by the Counseling and Psychological Services departments. Teacher response has been highly favorable with requests made to principals for additional service. (Author)",

        "description":"A 120-item questionnaire measuring sex-role behavior and attitudes, educational expectations, self-assessment, grades, etc. was administered to 3000 students in the 7th through 12th grades in three school districts. \"Academic competence\" was defined as the discrepancy between actual and predicted grade averages based on the correlation of scholastic aptitude and grades in the sample. Girls were found to be superior to boys in average academic competence at every grade level. Grade averages declined for both sexes between the 7th and 12th grades. Girls were also higher in average academic competency in each of six social class levels. No sex differences were apparent in the accuracy of self-assessment of schoolwork or in post-high school educational plans, even after an analysis  by age groups. Students exhibited traditional sex-role stereotypes and girls reported engaging in more non-assertive behavior than boys. The study found no support for the conventional wisdom regarding the development of sex differences in the achievement patterns of adolescents. Interesting patterns did arise, however, in the relationship of sex-role related characteristics with these variables of achievement orientation. (Author)",

This report relates to the target population of \"multi-problem\" youth for whom no existing service category seems to fit. Such youth are neither seriously emotionally disturbed nor criminal and, thus, are in need of some type of service or intervention which provides the least amount of restriction. The body of this report is an analysis of four programs which exemplify multi-agency and multiple funding approaches for dealing with the problems of youth. These four programs were selected on the basis of their success in maximizing  available resources in an integrated delivery system. The descriptive analyses of these programs present aspects of the programs that are considered to be primary elements of program and resource development. (SJL)",

Three experimental conditions varied the permissibility of interrupting a task to help an \"ailing\" confederate. A situation by moral judgment interaction was predicted. Stage three and four subjects, defining right action in accordance with conventional expectations or obligations would not help in any of the three conditions. Stage five subjects, defining right action in terms of human rights and contractual obligations would help in the Permission condition. The results support these predictions. It is only within the extended boundaries of Permission condition that Stage five subjects were able to resolve the conflict between their responsibility to the  welfare of the \"victim\" and their contractual agreement with the experimenter. The implication of the study is that neither knowledge of situational variables by itself nor knowledge of moral judgment alone are sufficient to predict moral action. The critical factor seems to be the interaction between situation and moral judgment. (Author)",

Such inconsistency was expected to evoke a configural component of judgment in the form of stimulus discounting. In contrast, 19 subjects who were defined by high differentiation among their personal constructs were not expected to experience inconsistency in the factorial combinations of five personality trait dimensions selected from each subject's REP test. A strict linear model was expected to account for the judgments of these subjects. A 2x2x2x2x2 factorial analysis  of variance was performed on the judgments of each subject and the number of significant main effects (linearity of judgment) and interaction effects (configurality of judgment) between the two experimental groups were compared. Although most of the judgmental variance of both experimental groups was accounted for by a strong linear process, a psychologically meaningful configural process was noted in the judgments of both experimental groups. The configurality was consistent with a weighted averaging model, but was qualitiatively different in form in the two groups of subjects. (Author)",

It describes A Family Drama Workshop, a series of seminars on families and communication, which was developed and presented to high school students in 1975. The seminar used the structure of the classroom and the experience of art and literature to help students: (1) become more aware of how people influence each other in family or other group situations; (2) enhance their ability to listen to and empathize with other people; (3) use this new awareness and enhancement to improve their own emotional expressiveness. It was anticipated that by practicing these  skills and exploring emotionally-charged feelings and attitudes toward families these students would feel more confident and flexible in their interactions, act more constructively, and thereby have a less troublesome time as adolescent family members. By becoming more able to make choices in their family interaction they would find family relationships less imprisoning. While all expectations were not met, this writeup should be of help to others who wish to design similar programs. (Author)",

The procedure is a variation of Prisoner's Dilemma, a game widely used for the study of conflict resolution. The conflict generated by the game is both interpersonal and intrapersonal. The key issue in the dilemma is the agreement between partners to regulate self-centered behavior in the interest of the common good. The sample was drawn from women enrolled in undergraduate, graduate and continuing education classes at the University of Toledo. In the laboratory simulation of a moral dilemma in which two women agreed to cooperate and one partner subsequently ignored that agreement, principled women were found to maintain the contract and  cooperate regardless of their losses, whereas conventional women broke the contract and minimized their losses. This and other results are discussed in relation to such factors as anxiety, level of moral reasoning, situational characteristics and sense of commitment. (SJL)",

Ten children (mean age, eight years) took part in the experiment. Five had previously been classified on the basis of the MFF as impulsive, five as reflective. On the recognition memory task, the two groups did not differ in accuracy but did differ reliably in response bias. The groups also differed in mean latency. Thus, it was found that the MFF can predict differences in latency on other tasks, but such differences may not be associated with perceptual sensitivity so much as with response bias. The results are seen as indicative of lack of reason for the usual preference for the reflective  strategy. (SJL)",

The Florida Key and the school-academic subscore of the Coopersmith Self Esteem Inventory were used to obtain scores on a population of 3,254 students enrolled in four middle schools in North Florida. From this group, 208 students were identified from school records as disruptive on the basis of having been removed from the learning environment two or more times during the first six months of the 1973-74 school year. A four-way analysis of variance revealed significant differences between inferred and professed self concept as learner scores of disruptive and nondisruptive students. No  significant interactions were found between or among race, sex and school on the Florida Key. A significant four-way interaction was found on the Self Esteem Inventory. Those students identified by their behavior as disruptive had significantly lower inferred and professed academic self concepts than did students identified as nondisruptive. The theoretical implication drawn from the study was that negative feelings about oneself as a learner may be a contributing factor in student disruption. (Author)",

By  focusing on a case study of failed, planned change, it seeks to demonstrate why a gap may exist between expert and action, and in so doing, to suggest that it is not due to some unexplained variance but rather, in this case, to such organization variables as time, status differentiation, imported or external leadership, the diffuseness of goals and the characteristics of the authority structure of the organization in question.

That hypothesis suggests that impoverished social interaction in the city is an adaptation to overload of interpersonal contacts. The three studies examine various aspects of the phenomenon using different methodologies. Comparing city and town dweller behaviors, one survey indicates that city respondents have fewer but longer contacts with friends and acquaintances, both by telephone and face-to-face. In terms of feelings of overload, city and town both evince low levels of feeling overloaded with interpersonal contact. Another study, of an experimental nature, indicates that interaction with a stranger is avoided in the city as opposed to encouraged in a suburb or  small town. These studies suggest that Milgram's hypothesis is too general and undifferentiated. (SJL)",

While secondary processes (cognitive thinking) are effectively dealt with and taught in schools, there is little or no relating to the primary processes (affective thinking). This is due in part to teachers' own difficulties in handling the cognitive domain in their interactions. Primary and secondary processes are seen to have seven structural aspects: (1) Weight - secondary process thought is light while primary process thought is heavy; (2) Pathways - unlike secondary processes, primary processes are neither logical, clear, nor obviously related; (3) Time and Space - primary processes have little regard for the laws of nature while secondary processes are  bound largely by them; (4) Operational Dialect - relationships that are acceptable to primary process thinking are impossible in secondary process thinking; (5) Sources of Energy - whereas primary process requires inputs and outlets to keep inner tensions in balance, secondary process seeks linkages; (6) Morality - the 'rightness' of emotional thinking is guided by the pleasure-pain principle as contrasted to the reality principle in intellectual thinking; and (7) Historical Antecedents - primary processes are part of the oldest neurological structures, whereas secondary processes obtain data from the sense organs. This metaphorical discussion should help teachers and parents to understand behavior which exceeds rational understanding. (Author/NG)",

The year the Ph.D. was granted was significantly related to one's first job; less than 33% of those who graduated prior to 1964 began in the fields of college counseling and counselor education, but of those who received their Ph.D.s in 1964-1972, more than 50% began in these fields. Almost 50% of the 1952-1963 graduates began their careers as either professors, student personnel administrators, or  researchers, but these three fields were the start for only 15% of the graduates of the later time span. The number of fields responsible for the graduates' first job increased with the passage of time, showing that these people are entering a more diverse set of positions. (Author)",

The first is concerned with the need for independence of behaviors, subjects and settings. The effectiveness with which the researcher can solve this type of problem depends on the researcher's emphasis on the examination of procedures, and not experimental design. Similarly, the external validity problems involved in reactive experimental arrangements and multiple treatment interference are experimental procedure problems rather than design problems. Confronting those problems in this manner enables the applied researcher to add to the bank of empirical knowledge on human behavior. An extensive appendix which reviews the sources of invalidity proposed by Campbell and Stanley  suggests that many are inappropriate to behavior analysis designs. Seven designs are presented graphically. (NG)",

Drug counseling, special education, teenage alcoholism, and other problems of society surface and simmer in the public schools. In the face of such challenges, a program was undertaken in the early 1970's to upgrade the skills of the educational staff of a suburban St. Louis school system. The training was planned to meet the changing educational needs of the school system by bringing the counselors closer to the \"mainstream\" of educational activity. There was a perceived need to allow faculty members a chance to work together and to become more cooperative. Training was developed which emphasized  interpersonal skills that would be useful between faculty and students as well as between faculty members. The training program was spread out through the school year to maximize faculty contacts and to increase the chance of change. The three papers in this set discuss the rationale for the program, the description of the several phases of program development, and three years of program outcomes. (Author)",

It was hypothesized that reflective children would do well on tasks involving an evaluation component, while impulsive children would do well on typical creativity tasks. Measures of creativity, assessing fluency, flexibility, and originality, as well as measures of problem solving, stressing an evaluation component, were administered to 101 white suburban fifth grade children. Using MFF scores, four groups were identified: reflectives, impulsives, fast-accurates and slow-accurates. Results indicated no significant differences among the conceptual tempo groups on any of the creativity or problem solving tasks. It is suggested that conceptual tempo may be less effective in predicting  differences in some aspects of cognitive functioning at this age.

Spectator behavior at public and sporting events at an intermountain university was examined in order to determine the relationship between the type of athletic event and fan aggression. Violence and fan aggression were found to be directly associated with the type of athletic event; high body contact sports (football) tend to inspire the greatest aggression, while individualized sports (track) inspire the least; other crowd-related variables were also found to  be influential. The characteristics of the &quot;sports subculture,&quot; Short's aleatory factors of delinquency, the frustration-aggression hypothesis, and the concept of catharsis were employed in a functional explanation of the occurrence of spectator aggression. Ten hypotheses were developed and tested in support of the explanation, and recommendations for controlling or modifying spectator aggression are included. The authors suggest that individualized sports should be stressed more (along with the recommendations included for modifying spectator behavior) to counter the trend in sports violence. (Author)",

The sample consisted of 50 female Catholic high school students and their parents, thus the research findings are limited in their generalizability to such populations. The values were measured by the Allport-Vernon-Lindzey study of values test. The findings support the hypothesis that there is a negligible correlation between the value structures of adolescents and their parents in economic, aesthetic and political areas. Further, students rank significantly higher on the dimension of political, aesthetic and  social values than do their parents, while parents rate higher in theoretical values. Generally the findings indicate a negligible relationship between parental and adolescent values, except in the area of religion where a moderate relationship was found. The data are interpreted as resulting from the child's expanding environment, leading to a less parent-centered environment and more independence in value judgments and the creation of value systems.

The dimensions are moral knowledge, socialization, empathy, autonomy and ethical attitudes. Two parent-child dimensions relating to moral development are parental acceptance and parental control. The study hypothesizes that parental acceptance and moderately high control are positively related to character dimensions. The subjects are college students, and the study utilizes self-report and retrospective ratings of parent behavior. Significant correlations were found between the parent-child variables and two dimensions of  moral character--socialization and empathy. Although, in general, the results are consistent with current trends, the findings regarding parental control are somewhat divergent. In the studied sample, the more permissive parental transactions with high acceptance and low control seem the most facilitative of moral character development. This is explained developmentally.

Data is offered which indicates that today's girls will face a reality vastly at variance with the home role for which they are being prepared: (1) over half of women over 18 are in the work force; (2)  married women can expect to work for 25 years; (3) one out of eight families is headed by a woman; and (4) child support by fathers in divided families is almost nonexistent.

The objectives of the study were to investigate the feasibility of reducing the initial non-functioning period in a counselor training program and to explore the effects on the cognitive and behavioral functioning of beginning counselors. Eight beginning graduate students were trained for five days using microcounseling, interpersonal process recall, a communication model, and modeling of counseling interviews. Prior to and immediately after training, interview behavior and knowledge of empathic responses were assessed using a standard videotape-simulation counselee and an objective, multiple-choice test. The simulated client was used for stimulus control and the elimination of client  risk. Results show the interview behavior of the trainees improved significantly; however, no improvement was found in ability to select the most empathic response. Implications for training programs and limitations of the study were discussed. (Author)",

The program trained 26 students in communication skills, interpersonal skills, decision-making and group dynamics. The trained students then received resource materials for referral and informational purposes. The students so trained consider themselves mediators between students and faculty.

It is not unusual to find substantial numbers of children in a first grade classroom who live in broken homes. Divorce is the answer for more young couples than ever before, and as a result the children involved must face growing up with a parent absent. A six or seven year old in such circumstances may come to believe that his situation is abnormal and that he is inferior to his classmates. This may create an emotional attitude which works against the normal learning process. A teacher properly prepared can counter this tendency be reassuring the pupil as to his acceptability and thereby enhance his receptivity to instruction. This annotated bibliography lists materials that  provide an introduction to the problem, and insights into ways the young child may rise above his or her situation. They can be used by the teacher as classroom resources. (Author/NG)",

At one end are those who see supervision primarily as a didactic activity and at the other extreme are those that stress the experiential, \"counseling\" approach to supervisory role. The two approaches demand very different behaviors from the supervisor--the first, lecturing explaining, etc.; the second, listening, understanding, reflecting. Approaches near the middle of the continuum utilize both didactic and experiential skills. There is little research on what comprises ideal supervisory behavior, not on what supervisors themselves view as ideal supervision. Several studies looked at what supervisors actually did, and their results are  inconsistent. Research using behavioral analyses of supervisor activities is reported, and the general conclusion is that not enough is known as yet about supervisor behavior nor about the factors that make for successful supervision.

Alternate forms of Object-Sorting Test determined categorizing ability. Results show reading comprehension relates to two ER measures for female poor readers; intellectual ability to one ER measure for female good and poor readers and to another ER measure for overall good, overall poor, and male poor readers.

These people are considered a subset of the growing numbers who change occupations in midlife, despite continuing success in their chosen career. There is some exploration of the philosophical and practical meaning for society of such practice. The research uses data obtained through interviews with 40 people who had dropped out of their careers. The research attempts to provide a composite picture of the dropout: his motivations for dropping out; his pre-dropout situation and personality; his present concerns and status; and the process of dropping out. The author notes that for these people values appear to have become less extrinsically  centered--for example, money has become less important than autonomy; status less important than self-expression. Contrary to the author's expectations, the dropout is neither an \"impulsive\" nor a relatively high-risk-taking individual. There are two ways of viewing the phenomenon--either as a threat to society or as a benign act; both approaches are examined. (NG)",

        "description":"A year spent in fulltime study of over 3,000 young women and counselors of both sexes in 13 schools shows that both groups have largely discarded the traditional stereotype of womanhood. Attitudes were measured on a continuum from dichotomous (gender-based) to androgynous (no sex referent). Counselors were significantly more androgynous than the girls they counsel. Self-report statements indicate that counselors are relatively more free of sex bias than their counselees. This tells more about what they say than about what they do. Girls miss the more subtle basic implications of feminism. Many think that women should work only if it doesn't interfere with domestic duties. They seem unaware that couples are increasingly sharing both domestic responsibilities and outside work. A  strong positive relationship emerged between high I.Q. scores and androgynous attitudes. Although less strong, a significant relationship was found between attitudes toward sex roles and ethnicity. Anglos held the most androgynous attitudes followed by Asian Americans, Blacks and Chicanas. Affirmative Action has increased the demand for women in \"blue collar\" jobs yet this area is where discrimination is greatest and precisely where women need to develop a strong sense of themselves as women and as workers.

Surprisingly, 10th grade self-esteem correlated better with eventual educational attainment (as of 1974) than did 1974 self-esteem. Longitudinal multivariate analysis led to the conclusion that factors associated with educational success become less central to self-evaluations during high school and the following years.

The nine observed endogenous variables concern cognitive, non-cognitive, and attitudinal factors. The 48 exogenous variables concern demographic, home, peer, teacher, and school effects. Bias resulting from splitting the sample on the basis of the dependent variable is discussed. The results are compared to those for the full sample and the reduced form models to distinguish findings that may arise from this bias. The results suggest that the educational process is similar for the two groups, but that the relationships among some of the endogenous variables and the effects of some exogenous variables  are different. In particular, sense of control over the environment affects the achievement of low achievers but not that of high, while self-esteem affects the achievement of high achievers but not of low. Several school and teacher characteristics affect the achievement of high and low achievers differently, suggesting that school resources could be re-distributed to increase achievement. However, the results also suggest that such policies would have detrimental effects on other outcomes for students. (Author)",

It is shown that while the behavioral scientist has been schooled in an environment where the preference is for cooperation, collaboration and committee work, the advocate is quite comfortable in an adversarial situation where conflicting viewpoints are sought as a basis for decision making. While the psychologist is deductive in his reasoning seeking to gain knowledge and explanations  derived from broad generalizations, the advocate is inductive in his thinking about a particular factual situation. The implications of these conflicts are examined as they influence the roles assumed by the scientist and advocate in court. The legal language and legal procedure of a Title VII case are described and the implications of having case law define the future direction for the practicing industrial/organizational psychologist are briefly discussed.

The writer was the third party evaluation team Director. Major objectives of the project were: (1) broad occupational orientation at the elementary and secondary schools to increase awareness of the world of work; (2) work experience, cooperative education and similar occupational experiences; (3) job entry skill training in vocational programs; (4) intensive occupational guidance and counseling in grade 11, and job and educational placement services for school leavers and graduates; and (5) continuation of programs with  local funding. Process and product evaluation systems were developed which included data gathering from students, teachers, administrators, counselors, community and project staff. Instruments utilized were generated from existing standardized forms, other similar projects, and mostly newly developed ones for the project. A quasi-experimental design was employed within the limits of the established parameters of the project. Limitations influencing the evaluation were due to factors such as pre-determined control schools, weather, postal service, interrupted or changed school schedules, state laws, school policies, administrative organizations, money, project re-direction and human differences.

        "description":"The dependence on sheltered learning environments often accorded the slow learner, combined with his inadequate self-concept and lack of realistic occupational exposure, can contribute to illogical decision-making skills, particularly in the area of employment. This course outline is designed to provide the slow learner with self-assessment tools, decision-making skills, occupational information, on-the-job exposure and final job placement. The use of role models, audiovisual aids and the student's own knowledge in a group setting will enable the slow learner to develop a sense of self-potency that will be the result of his own interest and effort. While this course has not yet been implemented, educators should find value in the course outline of activities and materials, and  can adapt it to meet their particular needs. (Author)",

This study also attempts to investigate the change in a patient's acceptance of his heart condition. To measure the change in general health level, a questionnaire was administered to eight patients who had experienced coronary heart attacks within the past 18 months. The questionnaire was administered prior to group therapy and on the last night of therapy eight weeks later. Supplementary information was obtained from a structured interview with each patient. Results suggest that group treatment is useful in assisting the coronary victim to understand and accept his illness, and that the coronary patient who has been through group  treatment may make a more adequate psychological adjustment to living with a coronary condition.

Topics of concern and interest included present and innovative teaching programs; student, client and community needs; shortcomings of training approaches; goals and proposed methods of their achievement. As an outgrowth of this area meeting, a workshop was conducted at the 1975 CPGA Convention, sponsored by the USC Department of Counselor Education. Various invited counselor educators met with an audience composed of counselors with former and current students from various counselor education departments. The problems discussed at  this open forum included those that had evolved from the initial meeting prior to the convention. Varying viewpoints were shared relative to the issues under discussion. The most controversial topics presented and discussed were the ineffectiveness of training counselors for appropriate community involvement and lack of continuing education for counselors. Criticisms of training in these areas were strongly voiced, mainly by former students who are currently counseling practitioners. (Author)",

To be most successful in acquiring reading skills, pupils need teachers who provide enough time for practice in skills, who can prompt (model, demonstrate) the correct response but gradually phase out prompting, who can elicit responses from pupils, who can diagnose and prescribe instantly when incorrect responses occur, who believe in the students' ability to learn, and who employ consistent behavior-management techniques. In order to achieve excellence, teachers should be aware of these characteristics and be able to apply them.

Most cities evaluated student progress through informal teacher assessment rather than through formal testing of specific skills.

This document is a compilation of the results of the first NAEP reading assessment and the change-in-achievement results for the MAFL in-school assessment of 17 year olds. Background information and results for both tests are discussed, with tables of findings illustrating the text. (JM) Primary type of information provided by report: Results (Change)  (Overview).",

In one test, subjects recorded, analyzed, and scored an inventory; in a second, they analyzed and scored miscues which were already recorded. Subjects had training and experience in using inventories. The subjects were highly accurate in determining a reader's reading level and in distinguishing between miscues that were Spanish features and those that were not. It was concluded that differences between the language of teacher and student may not be a problem when teachers use informal, objective, individualized diagnostic instruments. (Author/AA)",

For nine-year-olds, improvement was recorded in all reading skills, but was most noteworthy in reference skills. Black nine-year-olds improved even more dramatically than did nine-year-olds as a whole, which the panel suggested might be attributed to successful intervention programs in the primary grades. Reading ability at ages 13 and 17 changed little. Both ages improved slightly in literal comprehension  but declined in inferential comprehension. Students of all ages demonstrated little difficulty in comprehending literal, straight-forward written material, but comprehension dropped off quickly as soon as the tasks became more difficult.

Contemporary media are not information channels, but purveyors of sociological propaganda. The propaganda process produces a crystallized and self-justified person, entailing two corollaries: information and propaganda are identical concepts, and public opinion does not result from knowledgeable use of information but is simply a crowd's unpredictable arousal over political fads. In Ellul's analysis, the alternatives--direct participation  through technological improvement, refurbishing viable intermediary groups, and relying on intellectuals--all flounder. The choice that is left is unpleasant: either democracy must utilize propaganda, which is by nature antidemocratic, or it will perish. (Author/AA)",

In all, 377 subjects were tested on the following skills: alphabet recognition, copying ability, reading rate, reading comprehension, &quot;practical&quot; reading ability, essay writing, and spelling. A questionnaire gathered information concerning subjects' general and vocational educations and present occupations, parents' educations and occupations, average amount of reading and writing per day, self-evaluation of reading and writing ability in relation to perceived needs, and a subjective judgment of the importance of such abilities as measured by the  different tests. Data revealed that, although many adults' skill levels improved between the age at which they left school and the age of 35, prolonged schooling during adolescence led to even greater abilities. A substantial minority of adults did not reach the level of ability considered necessary for functional literacy, and more than 30% of all subjects found their abilities insufficient in some manner.

While the students uniformly regarded their own dialects as satisfactory and unchanged by school, when questioned specifically about the content of their English classes, they revealed awareness of the attempt to modify their grammar and linguistic styles. The dichotomy reflected in these responses is mirrored in two commonly used educational materials, a document which consolidates behavioral objectives for language and literature instruction in the Arkansas elementary and secondary schools and a series of elementary language arts textbooks.

These included differences in phonology; intonation contours; use of direct quotations; story-telling register; language play; availability of polite phrases; and opportunity, or necessity, for use of a formal register. These various dialect features are likely to disappear as the children grow older, however, since the children demonstrate an awareness of the forms of standard English and Yakima adults do not have a noticeable dialect. The poor school performance of Yakima children is interpreted as a failure of the schools to adjust to the speech registers available to the Yakima  child, rather than as the result of &quot;a language problem.&quot; (AA)",

In order to avoid arbitrary assessments, news reportage should be subjected to an analysis that will reveal the various logical and technological, mythic and modal structures reflected in the message system. Humanistic inquiry can borrow from structural models appropriate to various disciplines, in interpreting how these structures and processes interrelate. As an example, the evening news is analyzed as a semantic, syntactic, and pragmatic phenomenon. The syntactic pattern and mythic and modal aspects evident in the television format are emphasized.

Conceptually based on the \"Gemeinschaft-Gesellschaft\" paradigm of sociologist Ferdinand Tonnies, discussion traces the concept of alienation as it appears in the philosophies of Hegel, Marx, Kierkegaard, Sartre, and others. Dwight Macdonald's \"A Theory of Mass Culture\" and Clement Greenberg's insights on \"kitsch\" are used to explain the pervasive influence of mass culture in modern society and its debilitating effects on high culture. The analysis concludes that society must cushion the impact of dehumanizing technology and its consequences of alienation by redesigning the educational system and introducing new pedagogics. (KS)",

A plan is proposed to modify current television reporting of political conventions and similar events to restore to American politics a sense of historical context and to emphasize the legitimacy of rhetorical conflict.

In the second phase, the two groups were combined and instructed to work cooperatively on two tasks. Later, subjects were told that their combined effort had either succeeded or failed. Intergroup-attraction scores indicated that, when groups had previously competed, failure of the combined effort resulted in decreased intergroup attraction, while success yielded increased  attraction.

Although not all its adherents are politically and educationally conservative, those who support fundamentalist schools certainly are. These schools emphasize uniform authority-centered education, strict discipline, and respect for the values of the dominant culture, as well as the traditional &quot;Three R's.&quot; These back-to-basics schools are growing in popularity, though many educators are critical of what they consider the regressive tendencies of fundamentalist education. The author summarizes the thinking of theorists, such as Alfred North Whitehead, who suggest that language  and mathematic skills, as traditionally defined, do not constitute the true basics of education. Instead, the cognitive, affective, and developmental skills necessary for mature and effective communication are the proper educational goals. The author concludes that it would be regrettable if the pressing problem of illiteracy becomes rigidly linked with fundamentalist conservatism. (Author)",

The purpose of this executive summary is to provide a brief overview of information collected and analyzed during the study's second phase and to describe a set of needed research projects. The research agenda presented in this report results from study of the present status of year-round schools, examination of extant evaluations and planning studies, and discussions with leading educators and administrators in the YRS movement. To facilitate  access to more detailed information, this volume is cross-referenced to appropriate sections of \"The Importance of Year-Round Schools.\" The appendix contains a summary of demographic and programmatic data on the 24 school districts studied in phase 2, as well as a summary of educational and financial evaluations of YRS programs that were conducted in the study districts.

Two unpublished reports were used in preparing this paper. The first describes Research for Better Schools's relationships with nine different state agencies during 1971-73 and documents what states had done in the way of bringing research and development innovations to the schools. The second report summarizes the results of a questionnaire mailed to 116 state education administrators from 36 states during the latter part of 1973. In order to provide a base on which these emerging patterns can be examined, four types of  findings have been selected: (1) some general characteristics of state departments of education, (2) some specific directions that states seem to be taking, (3) some ways in which states directly support innovation in schools, and (4) some state agency experiences with research and development agencies. Three patterns of interagency relationships are presented in order to describe linkage models that have been built to provide possible features of future relationships. (Author/IRT)",

The individual program priorities were prepared in response to eight overall objectives established by the State Commissioner of Education. For the purposes of analysis, the various divisions were grouped by function, and program-level responses were assigned number weights according to the value of the objective to which they relate. The assigning of values allows for the analysis of resource commitments. This matrix approach is intended to give the commissioner and members of the State Board of Education an overview of each program's priorities and each program manager's responses to those priorities. In  addition to presenting a series of tables that summarize the individual program priorities, the report also includes a narrative that discusses the responses and analyzes the ways in which they cluster.

Data for the study were taken from a report prepared by the district's accounting office on all expenses for each district school and from student enrollment reports submitted by the district to the State Department of Education. Overall, the Eugene district has a yearly budget of approximately $33 million and an average daily pupil membership of about 20,000 pupils. Expenditure data for 110 separate accounts within 13 major budget areas are examined for the elementary, junior high, and senior high school levels, as well  as for different geographical regions. Because the report is intended to be purely descriptive, no value judgements are offered on the different expenditure levels observed. However, the discussion does place considerable emphasis on the difference in expenditures between the district's north and south regions. (JG)",

        "description":"From the narrow point of view, the use of schools is limited almost entirely to the academic learning of young people. School buildings are usually closed after the required work of youngsters and teachers is completed, and adults with educational needs do not have an opportunity to take classes or engage in other activities during the evening. This view assumes that the school's responsibility ends with the intellectual preparation of young people; there is little direct effort to join forces with the home or community. The \"broad view\" or \"community\" school involves people of all ages and circumstances and normally operates 14 to 16 hours each day, 6 days each week, all year long. The community school does not lessen the emphasis on academic learning for children; it simply  operates over an extended period and does much more than provide good academic learning. The community school not only sends its staff into the home and community, but it involves adults from the community in the learning experiences of school children, and in the leadership of optional activities at the school. The reader must decide whether the narrow, traditional school or the broad, community school gives the greater promise. (Author/JG)",

It is important to view conflict in neutral terms, realizing that conflict may be good or bad. Effective administrators can accept conflict and capitalize on it to move the organization forward more rapidly. Many of the more difficult conflicts arise from goal ambiguity; by reducing goal ambiguity we can reduce many of the conflicts that arise over means. The classic outcomes of conflict are avoidance, deadlock, victory/defeat, compromise, and integration. Of these, integration is probably the least common but most effective over the long run.  Organizational climate appears to predispose an organization toward productive conflict or destructive conflict, and the administrator significantly influences this climate by his administrative style and values.

This model is to be implemented by a problem-solving team, which consists of representatives of the parties affected by the problem, individuals with the appropriate expertise in the problem area, and individuals who are objective and skilled in problem-solving. After a preliminary statement of the problem, it is broken down into components that allow the team to define who is involved and when and where the problem occurs. Next, solution criteria (the \"musts\" and\"shoulds\" necessary for a good solution) are defined, along with constraints. A survey of the relevant literature, as well as consultation with experts and field tests, should be conducted. After a solution is selected, it must be field tested.

The space and functional requirements of each teaching area have been documented and analyzed to arrive at a realistic appraisal of need for the school. For each space, floor area equipment needs and environmental characteristics have been established. In addition, for each teaching area, an organizational diagram showing the desirable interrelationship of the spaces and functions has been developed. Other elements treated in the report are the number and allocation of staff, site description, outline of the educational program and objectives, organizational plan, construction  methods and materials, and mechanical and electrical systems. An architectural drawing of the proposed school is included. (Author/MLF)",

The bureaucratic organization has a system of sanctions to penalize those who would infringe upon the territory of superordinates. Humans mark their domains by audio and visual symbols much as many animals do. If we compare our behavior with the observed behavior of the baboon, the congruence could be shocking. Empirical data reported by Ardrey indicate that lower animals have better accomodated the differences between the sexes than have humans; men and women may love one another in the union of matrimony, but they do poorly in the union of professions. There is increasing evidence that fragmentation  within the educational profession explains, in part at least, why education does not get a larger proportion of the gross national product. If we continue behaving like baboons and allow ourselves to be fragmented by our protection of territory, the educational enterprise will limp along without reaching its full potential. (Author/JG)",

PERT chart construction is a catechistic process of plotting events and activities systematically. Events are points in time depicted by a circle. They consume neither time nor resources. Activities, which expend time, money, personnel, and/or other resources, are designated by the line  connecting events. As an example of the application of the PERT technique to education, a discussion of the events in the Waverly PERT chart is presented. (Author/IRT)",

Analysis of the responses showed that superordinates' expectations  for middle school principals varied significantly in different geographic regions and that differences in the previous administrative background of superordinates also affected their perceptions. However, neither the age of superordinates nor the number of years they had been in their present position significantly affected perceptions.

The predominately middle-class white school was merging with a predominately black working-class school. Existing and anticipated problem areas were to be identified in the analysis. The team approached its task by fragmenting and then interviewing personnel who were thought most likely to be able to provide information in each of the team member's area of expertise. These areas included management, leadership, and small-group effectiveness; instructional methodology and contingency management technique applications; cross-cultural and  cross-ethnic values, goals, and aspirations content. The findings consist mainly of what the team found to be the existing perceptions among teachers, students, and administrators regarding their relative roles and how these roles are performed. The section on findings is followed by recommendations for possible changes. (Author/MLF)",

However, as the statistical data from Illinois school districts indicate, declining enrollment and reduction in force are pressing problems. This statistical analysis contains data on population, tax bases, property appraisal, salary, pupil/teacher ratios, teacher/administrator ratios, and community types. These variables were correlated to determine the trends and patterns in enrollment decline in Illinois. Data from Chicago were not included. The authors recommend changes in Title I weighting to relieve urban districts undergoing enrollment decline and changes in student clientele. They assert that reductions in administrative  staff should keep pace with both enrollment decline and teacher reduction. The teacher/administrator ratios discovered in this study could perhaps be used as guidelines for reduction in force. They suggest that the state provide financial assistance to districts hardest hit by declining enrollment and reduction in force. (DS)",

The information in the manual and in the case studies of representative school districts is published together to provide persons interested in overall state policy with examples in enough detail to provide a sense of what is happening in districts differing in population and composition. The nature of the problems arising from declining enrollment suggests that the district level is the appropriate one for decision-making. Enrollment decline has brought about the demise of the expansive, innovative mood in Minnesota schools, as the case studies indicate. Program innovation is not as easily accepted, and school personnel are increasingly worried about job  preservation. In some districts, the number of administrative personnel has been reduced to such a point that the time and energy for effective planning are no longer available. These materials were prepared for use by school superintendents and school boards for local school district planning. (Author)",

ENSIM II, which also generates residential development projections and which, like the original model, uses a basic cohort survival technique as its primary computational procedure, is appropriate for districts with either increasing or decreasing enrollments. Basic inputs into the model include historical enrollment information, census data, and land-use data. ENSIM II produces  enrollment forecasts by age, race/ethnic composition, and geographical area. Separate sections of the booklet present a general description of ENSIM II, discuss data preparation procedures for the system, describe in detail specifications for input data sets, describe specifications for output data sets and a districtwide summary program, and list various subroutines and arrays and their uses.

Through a review of the literature, the staff of the Procedures for Adopting Educational Innovations project identified seven different stages of teacher concern about innovations and then developed a 35-item Stages of Concern Checklist for assessing the concerns of individual innovation users. The checklist was first verified in a reliability study involving 132 professors and classroom teachers and then administered to a stratified sample of 411 teachers involved with the adoption of team teaching. The checklist data were factor analyzed to compare teachers' primary concerns with their years of  experience with team teaching. The analysis verified the utility of the stages of concern model and found that teachers' concerns progress through different stages as they gain more experience with an innovation. (JG)",

The reliability coeffecients exceeded .96 and were significant at the .0001 level in every instance. Content validity was demonstrated in relationship to Rensis Likert's &quot;Profile of Organizational Characteristics.&quot; Data results were subjected to a Principal Components Analysis and the obtained factor matrices were clarified through Varimax orthogonal rotation. These results demonstrated construct validity, that is, the items in the DSLI do  accurately and adequately support Likert's theoretic structure. A practical utility experiment (construct validity) demonstrated that scores for targeted DSLI items change significantly (0.05 level). The DSLI has added to the available theory development and its accompanying technology. The DSLI is a reliable and valid diagnostic survey that can be used for both research and field leadership improvement purposes. Extensive appendixes present the survey instrument and related data.

Lessons using high interest items in social studies content with emphasis on improving cognitive processes were designed for sequential teaching of the independent study skills. The packet of 28 lessons in five units was field tested in the 12 sixth-grade classes of the teacher participants in the program. The project is described in detail, goals are listed, and methods of evaluation and project outcomes are summarized. Tables and graphs illustrate pretest and posttest scores. (Author/MLF)",

Other factors affecting educational administration are (1) conflicts over control of schools, (2) lack of confidence in decision-makers, (3) reduction of the separation between policy-making and day-to-day administration through school board involvement in administering schools, and (4) citizen apathy. In the future, education will be characterized by sensible and humane accountability systems that keep the dignity of students in the forefront. Citizens will decide to become involved in those things that affect their lives. The roles of superintendents and principals will be filled by those able to thrive under rather substantial pressures in a management setting.  Teachers will update their skills in human relations, pupil control, and teaching methodologies. Finally, the trend for education to move away from school buildings will intensify. (MLF)",

Part 1 of the paper outlines the nature of the major tool of analysis, the educational production function (EPF), and the problems associated with its use as a policy tool. Part 2 examines how it can be used despite these problems and summarizes the findings of many studies on the U.S. educational system as a basis for comparison of findings from studies of poor countries. Part 3 critically examines nine studies completed for developing countries, and the conclusion synthesizes their findings. Two other studies using different statistical techniques are examined in the appendix. Inputs identified  in all studies as having a positive impact on performance are employing highly motivated teachers, providing a minimum number of textbooks and access to general reading materials to all students, and promoting the use of homework as a teaching method.

This manual sets forth a method for systematically inspecting building components and for assigning points to them based on comparison with components in a new or satisfactorily remodeled facility. The total point value of all components can be translated into a HEGIS facility condition category. The aggregated results for all facilities at an institution will meet the  requirements of the HEGIS Report while the individual building evaluations will provide a basis for determining priorities for renovation among buildings.

These studies are popular because they start with the lives of students; help define students' self-concepts; focus student attention on areas for effective social action; promote the skills basic to becoming an effective family member, parent, and community member; and provide students with the least expensive and most extensive \"media kit\" available to them for an educational purpose. One approach to family education is to integrate elements into existing courses, the other is to probe more deeply than is possible in an integrated context into the skills, processes, and attitudinal requirements for a  satisfying family life. Two features of community study merit notice: a close, naming-names-type of analysis of the community that leads to student-generated proposals for community betterment and the use of the community as a teaching/learning resource through carefully structured student internships and other community service opportunities.

Studies are cited that demonstrate that it is an attitude of prejudice that is the most significant obstacle to women seeking administrative positions. The author's research on attitudes of members of local school boards toward representation and decision-making revealed that women were more responsive to community needs and communicated with important constituencies outside the educational world more than their male counterparts did. Boards with at least two women members were less likely to conceal the decision-making process from the public, and these boards were more likely to have more internal conflict, believed by  many observers to be inevitable if boards are doing a conscientious job of responding to the diverse opinions of the people they represent.

Data, summarized by state, are presented in tables and charts containing information on the number and dollar value of bond issues voted on and passed, and the number, dollar value, and net interest cost of bonds sold. In 1975 approval of public school bond issues averaged 46.0 percent of the dollar value and 46.3 percent of the number of issues proposed. Although these rates were down from 1974, the $3.6 billion in reported bond sales represented an increase over fiscal year 1974. The 1975 average net interest cost for all bonds was 6.27 percent. A regression analysis showed that the factors significantly affecting net interest  cost were the length of term, timing, bond rating, and type of issuer. (Author/IRT)",

The pace of educational change should maintain a gap between a person's external conditions and the person's assumptions about himself and the world (constancies) that is great enough to be stimulating but not so great as to render actions ineffective and frustrating. Measurement of this gap should be in terms of actions required in the new situations. Maintenance of sustained, gradual change is likely to produce a set of constancies supporting change. To the extent that these constancies are developed, the pace of change can be speeded up. Verbal training is likely to be ineffective; training geared to the actual actions required is the most effective. To the extent that  individuals are involved in the planning of change, the gap between their perceptual constancies and their new conditions will be reduced, thus lowering their resistance to change and increasing their effectiveness in the new situation.

Eight conceptual frameworks are examined--evolutionary, neo-evolutionary, structural-functionist, systems, Marxian, neo-Marxian, cultural revitalization, and anarchistic-utopian. Part 3 concludes the review with an assessment of existing theoretical windows  on reality and their power to explain and predict educational change phenomena.

The 1974 constitution and subsequent statutory law provide an opportunity to correct many of the inequities now existing in property assessment. However, it is unlikely that there will be any semblance of equity unless (1) there is strong and effective supervision exercised by the state tax commission and (2) taxpayers have available a clearly defined and expeditious procedure for appealing inequities in their assessments. Strong penalties for failure to comply with such provisions should be adopted and enforced. Only in this way can Louisiana taxpayers  expect fair and equitable assessment of their property.

These methods of cost analysis were used to compare traditional school schedules with 45-15. One middle school and three elementary schools in Loudoun County functioned under a 45-15 plan for two years until new school construction could alleviate overcrowding. This report contains the results of the financial evaluation of that year-round plan, including an analysis of start-up costs. The analysis of cost-effectiveness revealed that savings are likely to be higher in 45-15 middle schools than at the elementary level. The major cost saving was in imputed rent (the translation of capital costs  into the same framework as operating expenses). The magnitude of capital cost savings is related to the greater utilization of building space in the 45-15 plan. This report also reviews other 45-15 cost studies conducted for other school districts. In general, the findings of relative cost savings under 45-15 in the other studies is consistent with those reported for Loudoun County. (Author/DS)",

The report is divided into two parts: Part I on the general schemes of the field teacher training model and the methods and procedures employed in its development; and Part II which presents supporting concepts and analyses of the field teaching model. Covered in chapter 1 are philosophical and conceptual foundations for the training of field teachers in human differences and social systems, Theoretical foundations of training, and a description of the field training model in terms of its four major components (explanatory statements about relationships among independent and dependent program  variables, directions for planning an individualized learning program, the substance of the program, and relationahips between affective and cognitive domain changes). Reviewed in Chapter 2 are the two types of procedures (administrative arrangements and the construction and testing of field teaching models) which were used to complete the project. The role which special education plays in developing the field teaching model is examined in Chapter 3. Outlined in Chapter 4 is the social science model of handicaps. An analysis of the model's development and the issues, propositions, and hypotheses which make up the field teacher training model are presented in Chapters 5 and 6. Also included are appendixes (with information on such topics as ideal field teacher training program content),  charts, and tables. (SB)",

The overall objective for Phase I (1971 - 72) was the modification and adaptation of the Career Insights and Self Awareness Gaming materials (a series of vocational instructional activities based on occupational classifications utilized in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles) for use with hearing impaired learners. During Phase II (1972 - 73) a second component, the field visit, was introduced as part of the program, and an extensive survey of career opportunities for the deaf was conducted resulting in the identification of 805 job  titles. During Phase III (1973 - 74) three more career education components were introduced: a set of 23 work function slides, a series of career briefs for deaf students, and classroom strategies for the exploration and clarification of work attitudes and values. In 1974, 43 educators from 20 schools for the deaf participated in a 2-week summer workshop at the University of Rochester.

        "description":"Evaluated with 30 trainees (age 12 - adult) was the Stereotoner (a chest-worn, ink print reading aid for the blind) in order to develop specialized instructional materials; coordinate a program of instruction; evaluate candidates, processes, and outcomes of training; and make available the basic course materials developed during the study. The output of the Stereotoner consists of ten separate tones activated according to the shape of the individual letters or numbers being sensed through a small, moving camera or probe. Ss found the auditory code difficult to learn and their ability to read various difficult formats to be limited. Following 54 hours of formal training average reading rates were four words-per-minute (WPM) with an average of 80% accuracy on isolated words; and  with the addition of an 87-hour home study period, average reading rates increased to 7WPM but accuracy decreased to 66%. Results indicated that some blind persons can learn to read ink print materials with the Stereotoner; however, careful screening and selection for auditory discrimination ability and personal motivation is necessary. Products resulting from the project included a taped auditory selection test, a series of pre-training orientation tapes, a basic instructional manual, and a home study manual with tapes. (Results are tabulated and seven case studies are presented in detail. Approximately half of the document consists of such appended items as excerpts from the instructional manual and home study manual, criterion tests, and additional case studies.) (IM)",

Alternative options mentioned are the following: shorten length of stay in institutions, cut down referrals for admissions, develop a phase out plan, and move toward a highly differentiated system of institutions. Commentary is cited on the present knowledge concerning effects of the institutional experience on  children in such areas as dehumanization, treatment effects, effects of institutional structure and placement process, effects of geographic distance, and costs of institutional care. The following service alternatives are considered: foster family care, group home care, community-based services, and strengthening family life. Some possible unintended consequences are discussed. Concluding assessments include the following recommendations: a sound rationale for deinstitutionalization--the rights of children; public airing of any plan for deinstitutionalization and demonstration of a relationship with State services; feasibility of absorption of the population; and gradual implementation of the plan. A bibliography of approximately 325 publications is provided. (IM)",

        "description":"Reported are the findings of a national survey on the present state of public education for the gifted. A foreword, statement of purpose, procedural information, and findings are given for each of the major survey areas--definitions of the gifted child, identification and instruments for gifted children, educational programs for the gifted, and teacher training programs for the education of the gifted, with particular emphasis on programs in New Jersey. The educational programs section, which makes up the bulk of the document, includes general information (such as location, address, and contact person) on gifted programs which were not evaluated and more detailed information (such as sample forms, identification methods, curriculum, and program characteristics) on programs which  were studied and some visited. Listed among conclusion in the final section are that teacher recommendation is the most popular form of identification used and that there is almost a total absence of formal training programs for teachers of the gifted offered by New Jersey State Colleges. Appended are a list of the programs surveyed, a list of program objectives; a preliminary program record survey form; sample letters; a program record and visit form; a list of contributors; and charts showing the objectives for each program, instruments for identifying the gifted, program content areas by grade, and characteristics of New Jersey programs.

The major elements of the statutes affecting inservice staff development are noted to include collective bargaining, inservice categories (the type of inservice activity desired), and inservice subjects (which include agricultural instruction, delinquency and crime prevention, and special education). Statutes for each state appear in the same order, and with the same section numbers as in their respective state code books. In addition, a series of charts are provided which facilitates state by state comparisons of governance structures,  subjects, purposes, and types of inservice training mandated by law. State employee negotiation statutes regarding collective bargaining have also been reported in chart form. Indexes for each state categorize statutes under the following main headings: attendance; calendar; grants; finance; inservice authority; inservice categories; inservice participants; inservice subjects; leaves of absence (sabbaticals); and state and local boards of education, supervisors, and administrators.

A review of literature revealed a controversy as to whether mainstreamed communication handicapped children receive appropriate verbal models and whether mainstreaming helps develop the social skills of the handicapped children. Scan sampling procedures were used to collect data over a 6-week period on potential social/communication interactions, and each child was seen individually for a sociometric investigation of positive and negative choices for playing with and talking to classmates. Results of the study of interactions indicated that teachers were doing the most talking and the handicapped children were  being talked to the least by their peers. No patterns could be established through a comparison of the sociometric choices; however, the three most liked children were models. A focal study of one handicapped S indicated that she was more often talked to in comparison to initiating talking to others, that teachers and then normal children were the most frequent interactors, that the S usually did not respond verbally when talked to, and that the S interacted more with normal than handicapped classmates. Generally, intervention on the part of a teacher appeared necessary in order to develop interactions between mainstreamed handicapped and normal children, and there appeared to be a relationship between severity of the handicap and social acceptance.

In an introductory chapter on the purpose and scope of the study, it is noted that data is presented on local parent groups politically active in seeking to effect changes in educational policy for handicapped children. In a review of the literature (chapter II), sections cover the pros and cons of participatory democracy; typologies, structures, and functions of voluntary organizations; and parents' role in the determination of educational policy. Summarized in chapter III are the nature of special education, abuses of special  education programs, professional organizations' responses to such problems, and the status of Oregon legislation regarding handicapped children. In chapter IV, the background of the parent groups is examined, and some general characteristics shared by all groups (such as spontaneous expression of feelings) are discussed. Presented in the chapter on data collection (chapter V) is information on methodology (a case study approach) and a synopsis of data from interviews with 36 group leaders and active members. Examined in chapters VI and VII are recurring organizational and strategical themes (in such areas as membership, leadership, and professionals' roles) and sustaining attitudinal themes (which include the areas of accomplishments, legitimacy, and idiosyncratic needs). In a final  chapter, it is concluded that the groups studied seemed to work; that their political activities resulted in changes. Among appendixes are an interview outline, information on five national parent organizations, and a list of groups interviewed. (SBH)",

The document contains six units which deal with the following aspects of child abuse and neglect: reasons for past and present maltreatment in the society; acts of physical and psychological neglect and abuse, physical and psychological manifestations of maltreatment, and child maltreatment as compared to acceptable child-rearing practices; the typically abusive or neglectful caretaker, characteristics of the vulnerable child, and ability to cope with stress as the key factor in the episode of child  maltreatment; the psychodynamic dimension of child maltreatment in relation to both the child's and caretaker's conscious and unconscious reactions to stress; dysfunctions within society, the family, and the individual which could result in circumstantial, incidental, or intentional child maltreatment; and the variety of help available to both the caretaker and the maltreated child. It is noted that units may be taught separately in 5 to 10 days according to the needs and interests of students, or that all six units may be taught sequentially as a complete course of study. Each unit includes appropriate literature and supplementary instructional materials.

A study sought to examine the effect of the variation of the information content of the article on its comprehension by the aphasic. The appropriate and the significant nature of the function words \"the\" and \"a\" were varied with relation to the extralinguistic context to see whether these distinctions would be noted by the aphasic. Eighteen aphasics were studied: 4 Broca, 5 Wernicke, 5 mixed anterior, and 5 anomic. Three members of the laboratory staff served as a control. Drawings containing 3 figures, 2 sharing a color and 2 sharing a shape, were shown. A tape gave instructions, with 8 possibilities, to: \"Press the/a/white/black/round/square one.\" The  following conditions resulted: (1) inappropriate article plus definite adjective, (2) appropriate article plus non-definite adjective, (3) inappropriate article plus definite adjective, and (4) inappropriate article plus non-definite adjective. It is concluded that articles are not normally informative in English, and therefore do not lend themselves to this type of analysis.

        "description":"This is a summary of the Swedish national report on the 1970 and 1971 international investigations on French as a foreign language as taught in eight countries: England (including Wales), Chile, Scotland, the U.S.A., New Zealand, the Netherlands, Rumania, and Sweden. In the full report, data from the international analysis are used to highlight problems of specific interest to Sweden. The first part of the full report describes some of the findings of the international analyses, thereby giving the background to and the reasons for the work done on the French data in the Swedish analysis. The planning of the survey and the collecting of data are described, as well as the administration of the project at the national and international level. Results are given of some international  analyses. For example, time spent studying French proved an important factor in explaining variance in achievement tests; geographic proximity to a French-speaking country did not. Factors considered in reference to Sweden include: conditions of instruction (organization, methods, atmosphere); social and sex-related factors; and length of time spent in studying French. From such a national analysis, valuable information can be had regarding differences between countries, and areas for possible study of French language teaching in other countries. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This volume contains the reports of the working committees of the 1976 Northeast Conference on the Teaching of Foreign Languages. The introduction traces the patterns of immigration in North America from the colonial period to the twentieth century. Sections entitled Origins, Cultural Pluralism, and Contributions deal with the settlement patterns of the French-, Spanish-, and German-speaking; the struggle between the forces of assimilation and the desire for ethnic preservation; and the cultural contributions of these groups. A special section discusses the impact of classical culture in American culture and education. &quot;Horizons&quot; discusses directions for the future in multi-lingual and multi-cultural education. Finally, suggestions for classroom implementation provide a means of  incorporating community ethnicity, popular culture, social studies, the press, cultural field trips, and ethnic literature in the classroom. Two papers read at the 1975 conference are included: &quot;Retrospect and Prospect,&quot; by N. Brooks, and &quot;Changing Goals for Foreign Language Education,&quot; by T. T. Grenda. The Conference Award Article for 1975 is &quot;The Imaginative Use of Projected Visuals,&quot; by T. P. Carter. Contents of the Conference Reports from 1954-1975 are appended, as well as a list of Conference Officers and Directors for 1954-1976. (AM)",

        "description":"The Pacific area is generally acknowledged to manifest great linguistic diversity. Such diversity is generally assumed to be dysfunctional, an obstacle to efficient functioning of society. Such diversity must, however, have its functions at least in the circumstances in which it arose. It is also generally assumed that such diversity is the result of a communication density too slight to permit uniformity to be maintained. However, in numerous actual cases, feeble communication density seemingly cannot be the explanation for persistent diversity. Therefore two assumptions can be made: (1) an ongoing process of diversification led gradually to the present level of diversity, and (2) this diversification cannot reasonably be attributed to isolation. It can therefore be assumed that  diversity itself may in some circumstances offer selective advantages. Only some very inconclusive suggestions concerning such advantages can be made at present. However, it also seems that different kinds of diversity should be distinguished, and that some may not be as onerous as has been assumed. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"One of the main tenets of the audio-lingual theory which has dominated most of our thinking in foreign language teaching methodology for the last fifteen years is that students should never be put in the situation of having to say something for which they have not already learned the patterns. Is the language laboratory really useful, however, in developing communicative competence? A research project was carried out at the University of Illinois involving three beginning French classes. The control group had one hour a week in the language laboratory in addition to four classroom hours. The two experimental groups, E1 and E2, substituted other activities for the laboratory. E2 had free discussion in English of various aspects of French culture, while E1 had unstructured oral  communication in French. At the end of the semester the students were given tests especially designed to evaluate their communicative competence. These tests were graded by native speakers of French who did not speak any English. The results of E1 were significantly better. The results on standardized tests which measure reading and listening skills were approximately the same for all groups. Some examples of ways to implement the communicative skills program are play-acting, role-playing, and games. (CFM)",

Suggested solutions included: (Problem 1) advertisement, a foreign language requirement, relevance in the classroom; (Problem 2) more oral work, individualization, and courses geared towards nurses, police, and social workers; (Problem 3) individualization and re-examination of goals and objectives; and (Problem 5) stimulating interest through &quot;Language Days,&quot; fairs, tutoring, awards, and scholarships. Problem 4 was found to be not really a problem. In addition to this discussion, a materials exchange produced  books, cassettes, TV tapes, film, slides, and transparencies. A preview was also given of foreign language radio spot announcements. Finally, the following were discussed: university programs, the Florida Foreign Language Task Force, several trips, and a Language Day Fair at the Florida Technological University campus at Orlando.

Registrars at 2,614 institutions replied to the questionnaire; 2,419 reported registrations in one or more foreign languages. The fall 1972 survey shows a decline of 9.2% in total foreign language registrations between 1970, the year of the last previous investigation conducted by the MLA, and 1972. Registrations declined in French, German, Italian, Latin and Spanish, but increased slightly in Russian and significantly in Ancient Greek and a number of the so-called &quot;other&quot; or less commonly taught languages. Spanish continues to be the leading language in U.S. colleges, having displaced French from this  position in 1970. The totals for summer 1973 show an estimated decline of 11.6% from the overall total of foreign language registrations recorded in the summer of 1971. The report consists of an introduction, 24 tables, and an institutional directory. The tables present summary data, by region and state, for the seven most commonly taught languages and for the aggregate of &quot;other&quot; languages, as well as detailed comparative figures from surveys undertaken in 1960, 1968 and 1970.

        "description":"This report, prepared for the September 1975 UNESCO Meeting of Experts on the Diversification of Methods and Techniques for Teaching a Second Language, examines major achievements and recent trends of second language teaching in the United States. English is learned as a second language for several purposes - as a cultural acquisition, for specific functional purposes, for interpersonal purposes, or in bilingual education. Teaching methods must consider the particular needs of the learner. The major recent developments in ESL have been in bilingual education. Research on ESL in adult education is increasing. Some major academic contributions to the teaching of Standard English as a Second Dialect to American Blacks are noted. Several trends are discussed: (1) Linguistics and  language teaching: transformational generative grammar as an influence has been superseded by sociolinguistics. (2) Psychology and language teaching: the emphasis is on the reasons for learning and the meaningful use of language. (3) Language teaching pedagogy: cognitive code, with its emphasis on meaningful learning and careful analysis of linguistic structures, is recognized as the new trend. (4) Teacher training: certification in bilingual education/ESL is moving from linguistics departments to departments of education. (CHK)",

The model provides an explanation of journal market structure and the dynamics of market behavior, as well as a description of journal market development. Three types of periodicals are discussed: (1) primary, archival journals serving a current awareness function; (2) secondary journals abstracting and indexing primary literature; and (3) tertiary journals reviewing literature to evaluate the current state of knowledge. The organization of the primary journal market and the relationships of the participants are discussed. The cumulative nature of scientific research increases demand for scientific journals, as research builds on previous findings. Journals need financial subsidies  from volunteer services and foundation and government grants. The criteria used to judge journals' performance are consumer satisfaction, allocative efficiency and innovative efficiency. A journal's functions are outlined: recording information, disseminating information, and adding to the prestige and recognition of scientists. Demand for journals derives from the suppliers of manuscripts, individuals, libraries and bibliographic services. The supply of journals depends on production costs, which are analyzed in detail. Factors specific to language science journals are discussed. The LINCS program and the &quot;Linguistic Bibliography&quot; are noted as factors in information dissemination. Institutional cooperation in publishing would yield great scientific and economic benefits. (CHK)",

        "description":"The relationship between the disciplines of linguistics and information science has not yet been studied in depth. We must assess the state of our knowledge of natural language and determine how this knowledge is applicable within the context of an information system. The concept of a natural language information system can be specified in terms of the four components of acquisition, content analysis and representation, data management and information utilization. Morphology provides information science with its safest entree into the exploration of natural language. Systems have also been set up for syntactic and semantic analysis and for combining the two. The most solid achievements in computational linguistics involve syntax. The construction of a natural language information  system clearly is not a trivial undertaking, for we are attempting to build a device for &quot;understanding&quot; natural language text before we fully understand natural language. It must be a joint attack made by linguists and information scientists. The common interest of both linguists and automated language processing specialists in natural language could offset their divergent analytical approaches and make them aware of the necessity of mutual cooperation in language processing projects. It appears that information science has gone about as far as it can go without linguistics, and vice versa. (CFM)",

In their kindergarten year, 63 French immersion pupils and 68 pupils in the English program with French as a second language were rated by their teachers on nine personality characteristics. These scores were correlated with the children's French language achievement scores in kindergarten, grade one and grade two. The results indicate that two personality characteristics dominated the significant correlations for the French immersion group. The English program data showed a  similar pattern but with fewer significant correlations. A t-test indicated that the immersion children were rated significantly higher than the other group on three personality characteristics. Only one of these, however, correlated highly with French achievement and another appeared to have some negative effects. (Author)",

        "description":"The properties of one of the structures of politeness in the romance languages, the deference system connected with the use of conditional tenses, are analyzed in this paper. Although only Spanish examples are given, the conclusions also apply to French, Italian and Roumanian. The first part of the paper analyzes politeness in relation to its applicability to different illocutionary acts together with the types of sentences that may express them; the second part relates the conclusions of the first part to linguistic theory. Politeness is possible only in those speech acts in which greater control is assigned to the hearer than the speaker, and where the hearer must do something. Therefore, assertions, commands or acts of granting permission cannot be uttered in the polite form,  whereas making suggestions or giving advice can be. Sentences with performative verbs or intonation contours and conditional markers fit easily into a linguistic formal theory of semantics. The case of conveyed illocutionary forces is more problematic. This form of politeness is contextual or pragmatic. This separation into two areas, however, seems artificial, since the rules that have been considered seem to function in a similar way and under similar conditions whether &quot;semantic&quot; or &quot;pragmatic.&quot; (CFM)",

The committee prepared instructions for teachers and a suggested rating scale. A covering letter was sent to the Principals of all secondary schools. The Composition Test was written by a ten percent, randomly selected sample of the students in Grade 11. The papers were marked by a team of five English teachers recruited from the ranks of substitutes and retired teachers. Various techniques were employed to test the  reliability of marking including the marking of papers, selected at intervals, by all markers on the team. Blind duplicates of 28 papers were added at random and the marks of the originals and their copies were compared. The correlation was moderately high. (MV)",

To determine the availability of certification tests, NWREL staff contacted over 1,000 potential information sources by telephone, first-class mail or personal interview. University and municipal libraries provided available written references,  while three computer searches supplied abstracts of significant educational and vocational articles. Overall, the information solicitation phase was judged successful.

        "description":"A recurring problem in educational research has been the adjustment of data to account for initial differences among observed groups of individuals on attributes uncontrollable by the researcher. The procedure called &quot;balancing&quot; is introduced in the National Assessment of Educational Progress report as an adjustment method for this purpose. Since it is apparent that balancing is being used extensively both in the NAEP work and in the analysis of data from state assessments, this research aims at the development of a better understanding of the method and an evaluation of its strengths and weaknesses. The investigation of the nature of balancing required a detailed investigation of the nonorthogonal analysis of variance, the fundamental concepts of marginal means and marginal  populations, as well as the investigation of balancing-like data analytic techniques such as &quot;smear and sweep,&quot; analysis of covariance, and standardization. It was concluded that the general framework of nonorthogonal analysis of variance encompasses the most useful of the adjustment procedures when used in conjunction with the estimation of weighted marginal means.

        "description":"In addition to data on teacher performance and student learning, the Beginning Teacher Evaluation Study, Phase II collected data on the aptitudes, attitudes, knowledge, and personal characteristics of 95 second and fifth grade teachers and their students. This permitted the investigation of the relation of cognitive style to a number of variables relevant to how teachers teach and students learn. Results indicated that for teachers cognitive style was significantly related to aptitude, satisfaction, and certain performances for specific subject matters and grade levels. It was not consistently related to those teaching performances which predicted student learning. For students, cognitive style was differentially related to student learning for different subject matters and at  different grade levels. Except for decoding, cognitive style contributed more to learning in both reading and mathematics at the second grade level than it did at the fifth grade level. In addition, while the contribution of cognitive style to learning decreased between second and fifth grade, the contribution of aptitude increased. The findings consistently supported the hypothesis that cognitive style, acting as a mediating or process variable, had more impact when a child was first learning these particular reading and mathematics skills.

Results were of a generally positive nature, although there were some identifiable areas where improvement in the programs should be considered. School administration, faculty, the guidance personnel, and students all considered that the programs were meeting definite needs at their respective levels, and that they were doing this in a generally satisfactory manner. Positive findings also  occurred with respect to the potentials of counseling upon remediation of disruptive behavior and/or academic problems. Negative aspects included the following: (1) too little group counseling was being done in the secondary schools; (2) too little individual counseling was being done in the elementary schools; (3) parent and teacher conferences were insufficient in number; (4) too little clerical support was being used in individual course selection matters; (5) some discontent was expressed by elementary level counselors over the failure to receive the salary supplement provided to secondary counselors; and (6) too much time was not accounted for by the counselors in their activity logs. Since the elementary and secondary guidance programs appeared to have utility in meeting the  district's objective of modifying disruptive behavior, it was seen as necessary to improve upon the negative findings. Recommendations were made. (RC)",

        "description":"Two Emergency School Aid Act (ESSA)-funded compensatory education reading programs served 1900 Minneapolis students in desegregated schools during 1974-75. Both programs generally met their objectives for comprehension gain among disabled readers. Students in the ESAA Intermediate Reading Program achieved a median rate of about 3 grade-score months of comprehension gain for every month enrolled in the program. Students in the Junior High Reading Program made slightly less than 2 months gain per month enrolled if such students entered the program with pretest grade scores of 3.9 or less. For Junior High Program students entering with grade scores of 4.0-6.0, the median monthly gain rate was about 3. Differences among schools in gain rates are discussed in this report. Reading  gains were measured using Gates-MacGinitie Primary C or Survey D comprehension tests. Both programs emphasized the use of audiovisual teaching machines, and commercial and Minneapolis-Schools-produced lessons usable with these machines. The frequency of use of various materials is reported. An evaluation of these programs was conducted by the Minneapolis Schools' Research and Evaluation Department. In the event that programs like these are funded in the future, the evaluator recommends (a) changes in pre-post testing procedure, including alternate forms and diagnostic-type tests; (b) use of a control-group evaluation design; (c) careful consideration of information needs among staff and funding agencies before beginning evaluation; (d) greater efforts to recruit both Native Americans and  teachers with reading certification for staff positions.

Aides attempted to resolve student-student and student-teacher conflicts, to improve interracial attitudes, and to act as liaisons between schools and the neighborhoods from which students were bussed. The $507,625 in federal ESAA funds awarded Minneapolis for operation of this program were used to employ Aides; to hire three coordinators of Aides; to conduct pre- and in-service training; and to collect questionnaire data on program activities from school administrators, students, and Aides themselves. This report describes the operation of the Program and provides some information concerning Program impact. The  decision not to measure the Program's stated objectives of reduced interpersonal conflict and improved interracial attitudes was based on consideration of the evaluation budget and other factors. Five questions were addressed in this report: (1) How did the program operate during 1974-75; (2) What contribution did Aides make to conflict resolution; (3) What were some of the characteristics of Aides' best work; (4) How great is the need for such a program; and (5) What recommendations should be made.

Results of the December, 1975 Quarterly Profile Exam (QPE) administered to 400 examinees at a university were the source of data. The 400 item QPE is a five alternative multiple choice test of information a &quot;safe&quot; physician should know. Content of the exam covers the broad areas of Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Obstetrics/Gynecology, Surgery, and Basic Science, as well as additional sub-topics. For purposes of this study, two 75 item tests were constructed by pulling from the 400 item QPE by two different strategies. The domain referenced approach was used to construct a 75 item test by a random sample of the 400 items. Selection of the 75 items with the  highest point biserial item-total correlations represented the traditional psychometric approach to test construction. The exams were then rescored to obtain scores and item analysis data on the random and psychometric tests. Then, the two tests were compared with respect to distribution of p values (the proportion answering an item correctly), point biserial item-total correlations, student scores across medical school year level and reliability. The results were discussed with regard to their consistency with expectations of the domain referenced and psychometric approaches. (Author/RC)",

The group studied were blacks, Cubans, American Indians, migrant Chicanos, and white Protestants. Mothers, aged 35-45, with one or two children (small family) or five children (large family) were compared. Attitudes measured included those toward pregnancy, family, abortion, sex, birth control, and parents. Findings indicated that large family mothers were generally more negative toward birth control, sex, and family. Cultures differed significantly on all six attitudes, with attitudes toward abortion and pregnancy being the best discriminators. Significant interactions between culture and size were found on attitudes toward birth control and pregnancy. In  general, large families wanted fewer children than they had, and their negative attitudes toward birth control might be related to their ineffective experiences; however, the trend was reversed in the migrant group where small family mothers were more negative toward birth control. Since small family mothers among migrant Chicanos were difficult to find and their estimates of ideal family size were large, it is likely that their negative attitudes toward birth control reflected an aversion to its use.

        "description":"The first section of this report provides the pupil count, expenditures, and staff figures for the 1973-74 school year Connecticut compensatory education programs. Section two provides the major types of programs for public and nonpublic schools and the frequency of their occurrence in 1973-1974. The programs include preschool, reading and math, and summer programs. The third section addresses achievement test results, which are given in terms of a grade equivalent analysis, and a standard score analysis. The rest of this section provides a discussion of the test analyses presented. It is suggested that the use of grade equivalent test score analysis at the school district, the State, and the Federal levels be discontinued in favor of a more accurate way of reporting the  achievement of compensatory children to the public. Although various features that improve the method of reporting achievement are incorporated in the additional way Connecticut has analyzed compensatory pupil test information for the past two years, two considerations are seen to need further attention. First, some of the Connecticut analyses are shown not to be consistent with that of the much larger MAT Gains sample; second, this report does not deal with the issue of how the MAT Gains approach can be used effectively at the school district, the State, and the Federal levels of participation to determine whether pupils are performing any better than they would have, had compensatory help not been provided to the selected pupils.

A national sample of 1,427 Americans was given Rockeach's (1969) value survey. The scale was then translated into Vietnamese and given to a randomly selected group of 349 Vietnamese living in South Vietnam shortly before the fall of Saigon. Three comparisons of value systems were made: (1) overall differences between Americans and Vietnamese; (2) differences between males and females in the two countries; and (3) differences between individuals with comparable amounts of education in the two countries. Among the results reported are: (1) Vietnamese are more concerned about their security and less concerned about their individual freedom than are Americans; (2) the  value systems of males in the two countries tend to be more similar than the value systems of women; (3) college educated Vietnamese respondents are more like their American counterparts than are less educated Vietnamese; and (4) in many respects, the values of college educated Vietnamese are more similar to Americans' values than to those of other Vietnamese. Two conclusions are made: What primarily differentiates the respondents in the two countries is not their goals in life, but the means by which these are reached. (2) These value differences seem to be due to the Confucian influence in Vietnam and may be less modifiable by experiential factors than terminal values. (Author/AM)",

Workshop participants agreed on a number of recommendations, the ultimate end of which were to bring  university training in line with service needs in the schools of large urban districts. Five recommendations were made: (1) review and improve criteria for selecting individuals for acceptance into school psychology training programs and provide them with opportunities for personal development experiences; (2) encourage careful selection of students; (3) encourage trainers to expose students to experiences designed to maximize their sensitivities to other countries; (4) encourage trainers to give careful consideration to standardization of diagnostic skills training programs; and (5) encourage continuing education for school psychologists on the job.

        "description":"Spontaneous speech performance of ethnically diverse children was investigated by linguistic measures and teacher evaluations. Interview data was collected from 144 elementary school children, comprising equal white, Chicano, and black subsamples evenly divided among lower and higher grades. Speech evaluators were 60 white teachers. Analyses focused on whether minority children were, or were perceived as, linguistically deficient compared with white age mates. Measures indicate that minority speech performance equalled or excelled white performance, but teachers heard it as significantly inferior. Two points are noted: (1) teachers did not hear Chicano-black speech differences which appeared in the objective measures, suggesting that their inability to discriminate properties of  unfamiliar speech styles partially accounts for differences between objective and subjective outcomes. (2) The very regular patterning of minority evaluation and the reversal of age trends from objective to subjective measures, suggest that ethnic stereotyping was also at work in the results. The extent to which teacher unresponsiveness to minority ability in the younger grades is related to absence of objective performance gains in the older grades is not assessed here. However, it is held that there are many links between speech performance style and school success. (Author/AM)",

The second area discussed reviews various nontesting techniques, such as training and orientation-immersion programs. The third section looks at affirmative action programs and their impact on compliance. Finally, based on present trends, an extrapolation is made of future means of compliance available to organizations. One factor which is apparent with respect to existing manpower management systems and which is reflected in the alternative means of compliance discussed in this paper is the need for the\"intake\" functions of organizations to become more sensitive to the idiosyncratic strengths and weaknesses of the (new) employees. It is emphasized that educators need to demonstrate a strong advocacy to the ideology behind the existing legislation--that of insuring equal opportunity to all individuals based solely on job performance capabilities.

        "description":"The factors involved in assuming the role of members from different social groups were studied in six- and eight-year-old white Anglo-American children. The role taking task involved rating various ethnic members in terms of their desirability as uncles or nephews for the role person. A cognitive-developmental factor was manipulated by choosing two age groups of subjects around the decentration stage of cognitive development. Social factors were introduced by having the children take the roles of persons who varied along three social dimensions--ethnicity, age, and language. The ethnicity variables was the major focus for the role taking, and accurate role taking was operationalized as showing a preference for kin from the same ethnic groups as the role person. Results indicate  that both six- and eight-year-olds were accurate in taking the role of their own and a liked ethnic group, but inaccurate when taking the role of a disliked group. Age differences in various roles taken did not disrupt this accuracy, but language differences did, especially when the white role person spoke a non-English language. Difficulties in role taking are discussed in terms of two disruptive processes: egocentric tendencies and lack of perceptual differentiation. (Author)",

The critical variables used to assess the achievement of program objectives were: attendance, scores in reading and mathematics, disruptive  behavior incidents, attitudes towards school, and grades in regular school subjects.

This marginalization is partly due to the educational system's discriminatory practices which deprive the vast majority of Puerto Rican children of equal educational opportunities. The educational problems of Puerto Ricans stem both from substandard educational facilities in low income areas and from the neglect of special language problems in the group. The problems involved in education and language are not simple, and the picture that emerges from a discussion on equal educational opportunities for Puerto Ricans is that both bilingual education and teacher training programs are needed to break the vicious circle of illiteracy, poverty, and unemployment which  is associated with this ethnic group. Topics discussed are: (1) educational opportunity for Puerto Ricans in New York City, Chicago, Newark, and Boston; (2) policy implications in educational programs for the ethnic group; (3) Puerto Ricans and internal colonialism; (4) the island colony; (5) ethnic, geographic, and demographic dimensions; (6) patterns, processes, and indicators of marginality; (7) mechanisms of colonialism; and, (8) adaptive responses in Puerto Ricans.

        "description":"The educational careers of 148 students who were first, third, or fifth graders at the de facto segregated McKinley School during its last year of operation are reported. Another group of 156 students attending the first, third, or fifth grades at another school that remained de facto segregated are used as a control group of relatively more segregated students. The duration of the follow-up is the nine-year period from the 1966-1967 school year through 1974-1975. This study is said to provide answers to several questions, including: (1) how the school persistence (enrollment and attendance) for these two groups of students compared, and (2) how the school performance (grades and achievement test scores) for the two groups of students compared. The study provides little evidence  that the McKinley students made either a better or a poorer school adjustment than the controls. The former McKinley students showed the same reasonbly good adjustment, i.e. 90% overall attendance, similar transfer rates, average grade point averages, and somewhat below average test scores and class ranks, than the control group students. In reading and math test scores, both groups maintained their relative positions among national norms groups of their same age peers. It is concluded that rapid integration has little effect on school persistence or performance. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This report, an update of an earlier report from the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, presents a review of urban America and its governmental capabilities. Chapters focus on: (1) urban America today (major aspects of the urban problem, changes in urban problems, changes in the perception of urban problem solving, and programs for meeting urban needs); (2) overcoming the urban fiscal problem (the plight of central cities, Federal action, State action, and the development of an effective and equitable state and local revenue system); (3) improving services in urban America; (4) restructuring local governments (the Federal role, and others); (5) solving the problem of metropolitan areas (urban development, urbanization, building requirements, urban development  planning and land use regulation, and urban development policy framework); and (6) intergovernmental problems and strategies for the future. The report concludes that urban society is worth saving. The connection between the high standard of living in America and the urban setting of most American activity today is not coincidental. What is called for is a series of actions which will produce, at the end, a revitalized American urban scene. The Federal system already has begun to change. yet the need for urban statemanship at all levels remains great. (Author)",

(2) What is the nature of college experience for disadvantaged young people, and what this experience prescribes as useful support programs? (3) What is the impact of Upward Bound (UB), Educational Talent Search (ETS), and other similar programs? Chapter 2 presents a definition and general description of the disadvantaged  population. Chapter 3 presents a review of the literature related to the nature of the college experience of the disadvantaged student. Chapter 4 presents a review of the literature related to the impact of ETS, UB, and other similar programs. Chapter 5 presents a review of existing literature related to cost benefit analyses of education and training. (Author/AM)",

Effectiveness is here defined by measures of student achievement and race relations. The aim was to find school conditions that were susceptible to change and that showed promise as components of a program to improve the progress of integration. Most schools in the study had substantial numbers of both black and white students. In order to provide a range of racial composition, some schools with up to ninety percent of one race were included. The major findings of the study fall into two categories: (1) relationships involving student socioeconomic status, and (2) relationships between school characteristics and  student outcomes independent of student background. The findings lend support to the following conclusions: (1) there are school conditions that are systematically related to favorable outcomes of integrated schooling over a wide range of socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic conditions; (2) some of the conditions associated with successful integration are under the control of school personnel; and, (3) while school conditions have varying effects on different student outcomes, the findings are not plagued by the contraditions and incongruencies said to be often found when many outcomes must be considered simultaneously.

Extra attention and, if necessary, extra money will be given to the schools where these children are in the majority. An interdepartmental Educational Development Steering Group is responsible for organizing activities and insuring that policy is carried out. A start was made in 1974 on implementing the policy and building on on-going activities. The result of this in the school year 1976-1977 will be that 1400 to 1500 primary schools from a total of 8500 primary schools, and 400 nursery schools from a total of 7300 nursery schools will have extra full-time or part-time teachers. More than half of  these schools with extra teachers (priority schools) are supported by the school support centers. The 18 support centers involved in this work were allocated 32 extra members of staff--mainly to set up, work out, and implement the development packages. Five regions, the town of Groningen, the eastern mining region in the province of Limburg, southeast Drenthe, Helmond, and the Hague, have already been designated as development project areas.

The Y-CCP developed a local data base to facilitate the coordinated planning process. A social Area Analysis identified three kinds of census tracts in the city after analysis of 33 social indicators from 1970 census data. A Youth Needs Assessment was administered to 1,109 youth from grades seven to twelve in Tacoma Public Schools. A Community Resources Questionnaire was distributed to youth serving agencies. A followup survey was distributed to  42 of those agencies to obtain a comparison of their perception of youth needs that could be compared to the youth perspective, and gaps in services identified. A Systems Development survey was conducted with administration of key statutory agencies in the city. In addition, the Y-CCP stimulated coordination activities using the data as an organizing tool. The Youth Concerns Committee was identified as the most realistic starting place for planning efforts. Membership was increased, and 25 appropriate representatives of various service clusters were selected. (Author/JM)",

The students were given intensive, half-day ESL instruction at a center and attended classes with their American peers at their home school for the remainder of the day. The students' families were from every extreme of Vietnamese and Cambodian society. The students were 5-17 years old. With extreme differences in educational backgrounds and needs, and with the wide age span, every possible ESL approach was used. Specific adjustments and emphases to help the students understand, participate in, and enjoy their strange new cultural and educational environment were  made. In four months' time, the students had all progressed from being non-English speaking to understanding nearly everything said to them and to being able to make themselves understood in most situations. The survival English level was as measured by the Bilingual Syntax Measure. Their social adjustment at the center, and in their home schools, with the school district and with their peers, was found to be positive and generally happy. The ESL program, center concept, and individualization proved as successful as had been anticipated. (Author/JM)",

At the elementary and secondary levels, the refugee students are enrolled in about 150 of 750 school districts, with few districts having more than an average of five children scattered through the K-12 grades. Outside New York City, the largest concentrations are in Rochester, Syracuse, Jamestown, and Binghamton--except for one small rural district in the north that enrolled 19 children. At the onset, based on visits to several schools, numerous phone calls, and other reports, it was found that the experience in the vast majority of schools has been excellent. In fact, many of the other 600 school districts would have benefited from facing up to and  coping with the problems posed by children from an Asian culture who did not speak English. Teachers in the many school districts that have not needed previously to provide English as a Second Language programs or to try to understand and cope with such cultural differences have developed new skills and appreciations that will make them better teachers for all children. A wide variety of accommodations have been made in different school districts to cope with the entrance of refugee children. (Author)",

        "description":"The intent of this brief paper is two-fold: (1) to review selected past studies and discuss what is believed to be misdirections in their focus and inadequate methodology and (2) to report a series of studies that attempt to counter these shortcomings. It is held that, by focusing on discrete components, such as curriculum, and using limiting measures, such as questionnaires, previous work has failed to provide adequate insight into the process of political socialization in the school. For this reason, looking at informal peer interaction by means of observation was chosen in this study. The primary methodology of the Schwartz and Lopate studies described in this paper was participant observation in the schools, observations being supplemented by interviews with staff, parents,  and children. A playground study used a more systematic observation methodology. The observed students were in middle childhood, between nine and eleven years of age. The paper concludes that it is clearly in interaction in the peer group that children are able to learn and practice political skills, whereas (1) the textbook as a learning resource makes children docile and believe in the symbolic idealized picture of politics and (2) pupil time in the classroom is largely reacting against teachers and the school and hardly in political socialization.

        "description":"The Response to Educational Needs Project (RENP) encompasses a staff of approximately 85 people, operates in 15 schools, functions within the educational and political context of the District of Columbia Public Schools in general and specifically within Region I, works with multiple constituencies, and is directed by several layers of management. It is considered to be important to understand how broad, educational policies are generated for the project and further, how these policies are implemented. There are several potential contributors to the policies which govern RENP, foremost of which is the Anacostia Community School Board. Three policies generated by the RENP committee and approved by the board, served as foci for this study. Those policies are: (1) the Local School  Board shall have a direct involvement in their schools' dealings with concerns of importance to their local community; (2) the Anacostia Community School Board shall have a direct involvement in the schools of Region I, dealing with concerns brought to them by the local school boards as being untreatable at the local level; and (3) the Unit Task Forces at each school shall include in their composition at least three parents and one student, to provide direct input from the community to RENP.

        "author":["Morland, J. Kenneth"],
        "description":"Beginning with the 1971-72 school term, the public schools of Lynchburg, Virginia, were racially balanced. In the elementary and junior high schools, this was achieved by busing; in the high schools it was achieved by having all ninth and tenth grade students attend the same school, and by having all eleventh and twelfth graders attend the same school. The two races involved were blacks and whites, making up approximately one-third and two-thirds of the school population, respectively. Early in 1972, a study of racial attitudes of Lynchburg school children was made in order to provide a base-line measurement at the time racial balance was instituted. In the spring of 1976, the 1972 study was replicated in order to find out what was happening to racial attitudes under racial  balance. It was found that racial attitudes between the races were more favorable, that social distance between the races had decreased slightly, and that there was greater racial self-acceptance and a more favorable own race evaluation by both races in 1976. These findings gave limited support to the &quot;structural normative theory&quot; or prejudice and to the &quot;equal status contact&quot; theory. They also suggested that racial attitudes were more likely to become more favorable in racially balanced schools under certain conditions. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"In this study, individual-oriented and system-oriented models of systemic rejection among white and black adolescents are investigated. Systemic rejection is defined as attitudes of political alienation and political violence justification. Twelve hypotheses were generated and tested using survey data collected in May 1976 from a random sample of 480 New Haven, Connecticut adolescents. It was found that among both white and black adolescents, attitudes of political alienation and political violence justification were, when factor analyzed, statistically independent political orientations. In comparing white and black adolescents' responses on the five indicators employed in the model of systematic rejection antecedents, major response differences did not occur, although the black  adolescents did evince greater political alienation and more critical-threatening perceptions of the sociopolitical system's functioning. Whereas the model predicted feelings of political alienation among both racial groups equally well, it served as a better predictor of political violence justification among the white adolescents. These findings are considered to be within the context of extant political socialization theory and contemporary democratic theory. (Author/JM)",

A group of 20 black and 20 white college students viewed videotapes of eight first grade boys who represented four dialect groups: black standard, black nonstandard, white standard, and white nonstandard. Analysis of three 2 x 2 x 2 ANOVAS revealed significant interactions between race and dialect of child relative to (1) a listener's ability to report in writing a child's verbatim responses without producing a change in the WISC scoring of the responses, and (2) a listener's ability to restate in writing a child's responses without producing a change  in the scoring of the responses. Further, both dialect and race of child were found to be significantly related to another factor (3) , the total number of errors the listener makes in writing the child's responses. The race of the listener as a main effect was not found to be significantly related to (1), (2), or (3). However, significant interaction did occur between race of listener and race of child; and race of listener, race of child, and dialect of child relative to (3). (Author/JM)",

Bilingual education is envisioned in terms of affecting a dramatic and progressive trend in the cognitive growth of children. The principal developmental gains found in many Spanish/English bilingual education programs are said to be seen in the progress made by Mexican American children in Spanish language development and in certain affective variables. However, it is held that cognitive development in a multiplicity of variables through the medium of Spanish cannot always be ascertained; also, curricula, incorporating multidimensional cognitive variables at more advanced grade levels, have not yet been  completely conceptualized or implemented. The theme of this paper reflects these concerns, among others, coupled with prospective alternatives for giving greater emphasis or extending curricula and instructional changes in bilingual education. It is stressed that the bilingual educator must be a facilitating agent in cognitive development. (Author/AM)",

The first speaker focuses on the problems involved in court ordered desegregation, which often includes busing. Among the causes for some of the racial tension surrounding desegregation are the increased enrollment of minorities in public schools and social class variables. Another issue discussed is the social relations that teachers and students engage in. Here, interactions are referred to as \"games,\" the regularly recurring patterns of relationships in classrooms. The impact of disruptive students in school is the next topic discussed. The next speaker notes that minority students are often caught in a downward spiral of futility, which begins with an awareness  of rejection. In order for this spiral to be reversed, high school personnel need to be aware of the roots of the problem, as well as to know something about cultural differences. The next speaker comments on the American class system, noting that is is social class, not just racism, that is a major factor in the failure of desegregation. The last two speakers are high school students in Buffalo, New York, who discuss how integration works in their schools. (Author/AM)",

The main question that is asked is whether an improvement in the quality of health care delivered to the disadvantaged will contribute to equalizing their health status. A review of the literature points to the following four conclusions: (1) differentials in health status persist between the disadvantaged and those not disadvantaged, often to a large degree; (2) differentials in the overall amount of care received are less striking at the present time than before, but standardization by level of need demonstrates measurable discrepancies in health services provided to the disadvantaged compared with the nondisadvantaged; (3) the technical quality of health care for the  disadvantaged is not strikingly poorer than care for the nondisadvantaged but, in view of demonstrable shortcomings in the quality of health care in general, this is not viewed as a positive statement; and (4) attempts to improve quality of care for the disadvantaged have not had the hoped for impact. In addition to continued evaluation of current innovative approaches for improving the quality of health care for the disadvantaged, four new avenues for further research are suggested; increased patient responsibility, increased consumer knowledge, financial accountability, and quality assurance activities.

The complaint, filed on March 28, 1968, claimed that the defendants have acted to create and maintain unlawful racial segregation in the Milwaukee public school system. The complaint named 41 minor plaintiffs who brought the action by their parents and next friends on behalf of themselves and two classes. Named as defendants were the Board of School Directors of the City of Milwaukee and 16 individuals sued in their official capacities as members or servants and agents of the defendant Board. The District Court found that segregation exists in the Milwaukee  public schools and that this segregation was intentionally created and maintained by the defendants; and that such segregation is violative of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed to all Americans by the Fourteenth Amendment and cannot lawfully be allowed to continue. The Milwaukee school system was ordered to be integrated; the defendants were ordered forthwith to begin the formulation of plans to effectively achieve that goal; and a master was to be appointed to make recommendations to the court with respect to the question of an appropriate remedy.

Basic features of the programs in each country are discussed, including population, financing, and aspects of the programs that can be applied in helping America improve employment programs in workshops. Key points raised are these: (1) The role, functions, and responsibilities of the workshop as an employer of the disabled are different from those of the workshop as a provider of services to the disabled, and (2) once sheltered workshops assume the role of employers of the disabled, they assume a number of responsibilities for the workers they employ, which are the same as those of employers in the competitive labor  market and include such things as payment of adequate wages, provision of adequate machinery and technology for performing work, meeting occupational safety and health standards, providing for worker satisfaction and morale, and providing workers with a voice in management. A comment on the paper (by Dennis J. Dunn) is appended which includes a discussion of employment and rehabilitation services in Poland. (TA)",

Part 1 covers employer recruitment and job search, focusing on the role of the ES. Part 2 covers the experiences, attitudes, and perceptions about the ES of user and non-user employers. A brief glossary of terms and expressions used in the report is included, as well as a 37-page precis of all principal findings. Findings presented include these: That the ES places high among formal methods used by job seekers; that it generally satisfies the needs of those who use it; and that among non-users, the reasons  have more to do with the ease with which they find workers or jobs than with negative opinions. It is suggested that with an improved method to match those job seekers and employers who traditionally use the ES, a significant improvement in ES placements could be obtained without a corresponding increase in listings or applicants. Some tables are included in the text; the majority, along with the study design and methods, are in Volume 2, (the appendixes of this report). (TA)",

        "description":"This study sought to determine if there was a difference in teaching effectiveness of entry-level 1-year vocationally certified teachers of vocational agriculture and entry-level 4-year provisionally certified teachers of vocational agriculture. Correlations were computed using performance on the teaching test, teacher educator ratings, students' evaluation, and Observational System for Instructional Analysis (OSIA) ratios. All of the data were classified as interval data except for the teaching performance test data, which were classified as nominal according to whether or not there was a significant difference between the pretest and posttest scores. Four conclusions resulted: (1) Generally the entry-level 4-year provisionally certified teachers are more effective teachers than  the 1-year vocationally certified teachers, (2) indirective teachers are more effective than directive teachers, (3) 4-year provisionally certified teachers are more indirective than 1-year vocationally certified teachers, and (4) students recognize the technical agriculture expertise of the 1-year vocationally certified teachers. The major implication is that due to the great variance in teaching ability of the 1-year vocationally certified teachers it appears that better methods of screening prospective teachers should be developed. Examples of the lesson plan and the teaching performance test are appended. (TA)",

Specifically, the significance of the TI was assessed for reliability and validity, job analysis and evaluation, occupational restructuring and career ladder development, and manpower planning. Particular attention is placed on the Comprehensive Occupational Data Analysis Programs (CODAP) originally developed by the Air Force as it is applied in the Navy civilian Models for Organization Design and Staffing (MODS) system. The TI/CODAP was found to produce accurate, reliable, and comprehensive job data. Personnel assignment modelling was discussed as a special adaptation of the TI. The creation of a  comprehensive and exhaustive person/position data file was combined with low cost, accuracy of assignment, and computerized speed. In sum, the relevance, utility, and comprehensiveness of the TI/CODAP seems to offer a significant step forward over other forms of occupational analysis. (TA)",

(The Fisher-Clark tri-partite division of labor involves a primary sector--agriculture, mining, fishing, forestry; secondary sector--manufacturing, construction, and utilities; and tertiary sector--transportation, commerce, and services.) A new six-sector industry classification scheme is presented to increase the meaningfulness of the tertiary sector, which previously has been a residual category. The six sectors are extractive, transformative, distributive services, producer services, social services, and personal services.  Attention is centered on these issues: (1) Identifying the industry structure and tracing its transformation, (2) who is employed in what sectors and industries, and (3) important consequences of sectoral transformation. The first issue is addressed in the chapters on long-term trends (1870-1970) of the sectoral transformation (II), work scheduling and stability of employment (III), age structure and industry change (IV) and the interrelation of industry and occupation (V). The second issue takes up the industry position of females (VI), and the position of Blacks and Mexican Americans in comparison with Anglos in industry and occupational structure (VII). The third issue is covered in the discussion of earnings inequality and the relative merits of the sector model and the human capital  model (VIII). The final chapter (IX) addresses a number of sociological implications of the movement to the service economy. Some policy implications of this research are included. (NTIS/TA)",

The battery of tests administered included form E of the Rokeach's dogmatism scale, the Cattell Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire, and six other tests which measure skill competencies. Validity coefficients between these predictors and objective and subjective criteria of success were computed and the &quot;good&quot; and &quot;poor&quot; foremen were compared using Cattell's profile analysis technique. Major findings, using Rokeach's dogmatism scale, significantly differentiated &quot;good&quot; and &quot;poor&quot; foremen as defined by the objective criterion of union grievances. The &quot;good&quot; foremen had a lower frequency of  first-step grievances initiated by their subordinates than did the &quot;poor&quot; foremen. This differentiation was supported by Cattell's 16 PF (personality factor) ratings, in which the &quot;good&quot; (low dogmatic) foremen were shown to be significantly more tough-minded, more self-confident, and more trusting than their less effective counterparts. These findings suggest that Rokeach's dogmatism scale may be used effectively in applied settings. (TA)",

        "description":"Observations by trained observers using the Descriptive Observation Record of Individualized Instruction were compiled on 335 teachers, who also completed a self-report of the Individualization of Instruction Inventory. Both inventory results were then examined with the purpose of determining the relationship between self-reports of the teachers and reports made by the trained observers, with this relationship having implications for inservice programs. The teachers' group was composed of 200 academic, 86 vocational, and 49 special education teachers from 20 school districts located near Austin, Texas. Major findings showed that (1) teachers' self-reports yielded higher scores than observer recorded scores; (2) discrepancies between scores derived from teachers' self-reports and  observer-reported scores increased as the degree of individualization of instruction, reflected from observations, decreased; (3) scores derived from teachers' self-reports varied in a systematic way from observer-reported scores, which permitted the conversion of teacher self-reports into scores that were reasonable predictors of observer reported scores; (4) teachers who were observed to be individualizing instruction more tended to have more realistic perceptions than did teachers who were observed to be individualizing instruction less, and (5) teachers who were from districts which had offered inservice education in individualization in instruction seemed more enthusiastic as evidenced by invitations to view materials and student work.

It should be concerned with changes brought about by accelerating technological advances, increasing social problems, and the reappraisal of many personal values. Three important areas of thrust for industrial arts are (1) the study of industry, (2) career education, and (3) technological responsibility. The first thrust recognizes that industrial arts can provide a context in which to understand modern society, since industry is the vehicle through which technology is made available to all and is a dominant contributor to a high material standard of living. Industrial arts can play a part in career education (thrust two) because it can deal with many careers rather directly since the  source of industrial arts content is the industrial world. The technological responsibility (thrust three) of industrial arts can be seen as providing the major educational element to focus extensive and intensive attention on technological/social problems and their solutions. Although industrial arts is a relatively recent addition to the curriculum, it has moved to a point of being capable of making significant contributions essential to survival. (TA)",

Participants included state legislators, licensing administrators, attorneys general staff members, governors' aides, and consumer officials. Major problems and concerns emerging from the discussions covered eight broad topics: Proliferation of Licensure, Regulatory Boards, Accountability, Qualifications for Licensure, Testing for Competence, Continued Competence, Enforcement, and Protecting the Consumer. The major recommendation made from the insights gained during the conferences was that regulator improvement in  the states would be substantially enhanced by the development of a handbook that would provide state officials with practical organizational and procedural guidance in both legislative and operational matters. A preliminary outline for the proposed handbook is included and illustrates administrative and legislative questions that the handbook might try to answer and problems for which solutions might be sought.

Ninety-eight percent of the questionnaires were returned. Thirteen components existed in over 90% of the programs and are considered to be necessary for a viable Community School Program. The results of the study indicate that the necessary components for all Community Programs are (1) the Board supports community education by opening the school building, (2) the program attracts most segments of the community, (3) program activities are started as soon as possible after needs have been identified, (4) an advisory committee is formed which helps to determine needs, establish goals, and identify community resource, (5) the director  regularly attends inservice, (6) the program establishes cooperative efforts with governmental agencies, volunteer and civic service organizations, and other educational institutions, (7) the program has activities in the summer, and (8) evaluation of the program is based to some extent on the data collected on participants. In addition, components which differentiate successful from unsuccessful programs were identified for programs located in rural areas, in urban areas, in existence for three to six years, and in existance for over six years. These components are listed in the report along with recommendations for further research in community education, recommendations for community education programs, and recommendations for the State Department of Education. Appended to the report  are (1) prediction models for all programs, for those grouped urban-rural, and for those grouped on length of program and (2) the questionnaire used to gather data.

One way to help reduce the number of injuries and illnesses in the workplace is by training workers to be more aware of the job safety and health hazards and to teach them the methods of reducing and/or eliminating those hazards. To assist employers in carrying out this function, OSHA has developed several training programs that may be presented at the worksite. OSHA has prepared this guide to aid those non-professional instructors who may be charged with the responsibility of training employees. This booklet offers information on the nature of the occupational safety and health problems, on what is presently known and  accepted about the technology of causing learning to take place, and on methods recommended to prepare for a teaching session, as well as on tools and methods for conducting the teaching. Detailed instructions showing how to put the principles to work and get the results expected of the professional teacher are given. (HD)",

Part III considers the application of Darcy's law to some simple field problems. The concept of ground-water storage is introduced in Part IV. A text-formal discussion at the beginning of Part V deals with partial derivatives and their use in groundwater equations; the basic partial differential equation for unidirectional  nonequilibrium flow is developed in the programmed material of Part V. In Part VI, the partial differential equation for radial confined flow is derived and the \"slug-test\" solution, describing the effects of an instantaneous injection of fluid into a well, is presented and verified. Part VII introduces the general concepts of finite-difference analysis. Part VIII is concerned with electric-analog techniques. (HD)",

Selected tests from the Comprehensive Performance Test (CPT) battery were administered to 200 soldiers during their last week of Basic Combat Training (BCT) and were readministered to them six weeks later during their Advanced Individual Training. A single grade of pass or fail was given for each test. The soldiers comprised Mental Categories II-IV, therefore permitting between-group comparisons. The overall results of the study were that depending upon the measure of retention used, there was an average drop of approximately 18% or  26% in performance on the CPT when it was readministered six weeks after the end of BCT. For individual subtests of the CPT, the average decrement in performance ranged between 5% and 44%. Studies employing a longer retention interval and examining the effort necessary for the reinstatement of skills lost or diminished are needed. (HD)",

Young persons are &quot;dually-enrolled&quot; by meeting both the requirements for indenture as an apprentice and matriculation as an Associate Degree candidate. Apprentices may receive college credit for apprenticeship-related training classes and for supervised work experience, amounting to one-half to three-fourths of the credits needed for an Associate Degree. An Advisory Committee was established to assess and guide the activities of the Program. Model curriculums for dually-enrolled apprentices were formulated, and two successful types of dual enrollment programs (local and regional) were initiated, serving over 2,300 apprentice operating engineers. Data on current programs and  apprentices were collected to provide an ongoing assessment of progress. Linkages between Associate Degree programs and 4-year degree programs were initiated and are being further developed. The Program will be continued under the sponsorship of the International Union of Operating Engineers. The body of the report includes (1) description of objectives and methodology of the project, (2) descriptions of program development, curriculums, and problems in the various local programs and in a regional program established in cooperation with Dickinson State College, North Dakota, (3) discussion of results in terms of enrollees and assessment by unions, contractors, and colleges, and (4) recommendations for the future of the program. Appendixes (half of the report) include samples of  supplementary evaluation reports on individual projects; lists of work processes (tasks) for universal equipment operator, paving equipment operator, plant equipment operator, and heavy duty repairman; several degree program schedule outlines for dual enrollment programs; and a directory of universities and colleges offering programs in labor studies and in construction.

Items analyzed included sample survey data on the importance of 12 reasons for enlisting, the service first contacted while considering military service, the service in which the individual eventually enlisted, and selected demographic data. The  results showed that for these Army enlistees the most frequently endorsed reasons for enlistment were the acquisition of a trade or skill that would be valuable in civilian life and the opportunity for advanced education and training.

        "description":"Intended to assist extension administrators, program leaders, and specialists, this publication presents a framework, guidelines, strategy, and methods for evaluating Extension education programs. Emphasis is placed on maximizing the usefulness of program evaluations in decisionmaking on program priorities and modifications. Extension programs are viewed in terms of seven levels of objectives and evaluative evidence: (1) Inputs, (2) activities, (3) people involvement, (4) reactions, (5) change of knowledge, attitudes, skills, and/or aspirations (KASA), (6) practice change, and (7) end results. Levels 1 and 2 characterize Extensions; efforts; Level 3 includes the people involved by Extension and the nature of their involvement; Level 4 through 7 cover the responses by these people  and others. Responses range from the immediate and direct to the long-term and indirect consequences of Extension's actions. The foregoing levels vary in the extent to which they can provide evidence of Extension's impact, and the amount or resources required for obtaining evidence. Some of the ideas in this document are yet to be verified, but are presented to guide thinking about Extension program evaluation and to lead to tested principles of evaluation. ((Author/WL)",

Steps in the organization's development are traced from: (1) Beginnings in 1970 under the country's Ministry of Education and Culture as a flexible, decentralized national system with coordinators in the country's 22 states, through (2) some consolidation of structure in the central office to better manage the widespread activities, to (3) successful working operation at the end of the third year with five million students enrolled in classes in all of Brazil's 3,953 municipalities. Conclusions are drawn regarding the relative  advantages and disadvantages of closed and open organizational systems with respect to the flexibility built into the MOBRAL structure. Brief comments are also included on MOBRAL as a model of organization and management for other institutions. Various charts depict the MOBRAL structure at national, state, and municipal levels.

The predominant ideology in Sweden consists of firm and active commitment to lifelong learning, achieving the 'learned society', socioeconomic and political democracy, full employment, individual growth and dignity, and overall egalitarianism. Welfare, which includes the provision of lifelong education for all, is the ideological foundation of the Swedish sociocultural system. The relatively small, homogeneous, affluent, and value-consistent Swedish society makes the realization of such social principles a reality. About 18% of the national budget is allocated to education; 10% of that is earmarked for adult education. More than half of Swedish adults are engaged in some form of adult  education program. These programs may be (1) Study Circles offered by voluntary educational associations, (2) municipal and state-run schools for adults, (3) Folk High Schools (or people's colleges, imparting general civic knowledge), (4) labor market training, (5) on-the-job training offered by national and local governments and private companies in collaboration with their employees, (6) training programs of the trade union confederations, and (7) courses offered on radio, television, and through correspondence schools.

Particular emphasis was placed on meeting the needs of the small communities and rural areas. Career education concepts of self-awareness, career awareness, career exploration, career decisionmaking, and career preparation were incorporated into the project in that they were used as criteria in determining the needs of the individual and as guides to curriculum development. Services were provided by the project to adult populations  including the unemployed, underemployed, employed, high school dropouts, women, American Indians, and rural disadvantaged. Vietnamese and Russian populations were of sufficient number to warrant the formation of adult basic education classes and classes in English as a second language. Activities during the project's 3-year duration were evaluated as successful. Recommendations were made based on the evaluation data.

Specific procedures were (1) selection of an advisory committee representative of producer and user groups, (2) identification of the model components, (3) development of teacher education goals (functions), (4) validation of objectives by the advisory committee, (5) development of process and product criteria, (6) validation of criteria by the advisory committee,  (7) development of the preliminary instruments for a single goal, (8) collection of preliminary data, (9) dissemination of the model through a statewide conference, and (10) production of a final report. The major product of the project is a model along with its conceptual basis for evaluating vocational teacher education and a suggested implementation plan. Included in the model are missions, goals, objectives, and criteria which are inclusive of vocational teacher education.

        "description":"Payroll and progressive income taxes play an enormous role in the American fiscal system. The purpose of this study is to present some econometric evidence on the effects of taxes on married women, a group of growing importance in the American labor force. A testable model of labor supply is developed which permits statistical estimation of a &quot;coefficient of tax perception.&quot; Unlike previous models of labor supply, it allows for the possibility that the wage may depend on number of hours worked. Contrary to much of the literature, the results of this paper strongly suggest that marginal tax rates do have an important impact on labor force behavior. Section 1 reviews briefly the past thought on this problem. Section 2 develops a model to explain work decisions when an individual  faces a whole set of wage-hour combinations, rather than a given wage independent of the number of hours he works. In Section 3 a model is modified to permit an explicit test of whether or not taxes affect individuals' labor supply decisions. Estimation problems are discussed at length, and the empirical results are presented. A concluding section contains a summary and suggestions for future research. (Author)",

        "description":"The president of the National Manpower Institute discusses the possibility of establishing a new set of institutions--for the development and implementation of education-work and vocational education policy--not in the \"world of education\" but in broader community. He suggests that there be community education work councils, designed to serve as go betweens for matching student need with those of employers. The council would be composed of representatives of the schools, employers, labor unions, service organizations, the media, and the public at large (including its younger contingent). Although the author views such a change as having difficulties, he suggests that something of this nature is commended by three increasing imperatives: (1) to meet what will be a constantly  worsening youth unemployment problem unless we can develop an \"economics as if people mattered;\" (2) to channel constructively the emergent force of increased citizen involvement in community affairs; and (3) to exploit the possibilities that lie in making the human experience a continuing opportunity for both learning and working. According to the author, a larger pluralism in the structure of education-work or vocational education policy seems to be the key to developing and using the limitless human resource which alone affords the prospect of economic and societal growth upon which the future depends. Audience questions and the author's answers to them follow the lecture script. (WL)",

A home-based system of education could provide for widely expanded choices of courses and curricula through a variety of instructional media designed to: (1) Reach young children who are developing concepts of work, leisure, occupational possibilities, (2) provide for training and  retraining for occupational competency on the part of students, employed persons, homemakers and others, (3) help the older worker find new career direction, (4) develop competencies needed by both men and women for their roles as homemakers and family members, and (5) promote the personal development and sense of worth of persons of all ages.

After a brief introduction, the role of each public educational institution, in relation to current adult education, is described. These institutions include school boards, community colleges, vocational schools, British Columbia Institute of Technology, and public universities. Current concerns related to adult education practices are also described and include low priority, inadequate funding, limited co-ordination, lack of assessment, unequal access, inadequate program development, and inadequate counseling. The  paper concludes with six basic issues which may be of special interest to educators and citizens in general. (SH)",

Methodology described for this phase of the study consisted of a series of interviews by 20 resident field research associates selected to follow the implementation and operation of CETA for three years in a sample of 28 units of government that encompass all  types of prime sponsors (six cities, nine counties, nine consortia, and four states) and represent variations in population and degree of unemployment. Focus is on six substantive concerns in Title I (Comprehensive Manpower Services): (1) distribution of resources, (2) planning process, (3) administrative process, (4) arrangements for delivering services to program clients, (5) mix of manpower programs, and (6) type of people served. One chapter is devoted to each concern, each with a 2-page summary, and one chapter provides an overview of CETA in the context of decategorization and decentralization. A list of manpower acronymns, statistical tables, and a bibliography is appended. (WL)",

The program described consists of Primary, Intermediate, and Secondary Learning Units (resource curriculum materials) which are non-sexist, ungraded, skill-building, student-centered, sequentially organized, and experiential. The stated purpose of the project is both to present students with meaningful and realistic exploration of the world of work and to remove myths and stereotypes from career choice. Curriculum materials were field tested over 3 years in 13 New Jersey school districts with approximately 3,000 students using the program. The project was validated in 1975 by a U.S. Office of Education Team as a program which has achieved statistically and  educationally significant results in the attainment of its goals, proved cost effective, and is exportable. Conclusions reported were that Project HEAR had a significant effect in (1) changing stereotypical attitudes toward occupations, (2) increasing preferences for sex-asynchronic occupations for participating elementary school students, (3) increasing knowledge of the world of work for participating middle school students, and (4) increasing the consistency of occupational preference with interests for participating secondary school students. The three multimedia packaged learning units for each level and inservice training programs are described. (TA)",

The principal thrust of the project was to offer practical courses in methodology of instruction appropriate to the needs of adults with limited English-speaking ability and to those who are economically and/or socially disadvantaged. Chapter 1 describes the model for the program evaluation. Chapter 2 describes the overall plan for the project, including a brief assessment of its accomplishments as of the date of presentation of the interim  evaluation report, January 15, 1976. Chapter 3 describes the program in action. Descriptions of core courses are given in detail along with analyses of the relationship of topics and other course components to the potential accomplishment of course objectives. Specific recommendations are made in this chapter. Chapter 4 focuses on presentation and analysis of statistical data to discern the outcomes of the project based on 26 competencies which were designated as the specific goals of the project. Conclusions indicate that based on assessments of competencies at the beginning and the end, 22 of the 23 students who completed the program successfully attained the criterion level of performance. The appendix contains an illustrative course evaluation questionnaire, competency self-assessment  scale, attitude scale, and instructor and course evaluation forms. (WL)",

The procedures in Phase 1 involved four major task areas: (1) The identification of 400 specific occupations considered relevant for providing a basis for curriculum development, (2) a review of the state-of-the-art of curriculum development in these occupational areas, (3) the development and formative evaluation of 10 curriculum guides, and (4) the initial dissemination of the guides to the 50 states. Field testing of  the guides (Phase 2) included three components: (1) Monitoring of teacher reactions to the guides' usefulness (2) monitoring dissemination policies and procedures for curriculum guides, and (3) assessing student achievement as a result of using the guides.

During the 1974-75 academic year, the CMIS that was constructed and tested the previous year at the University of Wisconsin-Stout was developed and refined. Visits with personnel in two vocational technical and adult education districts, and other contacts, revealed that considerable differences in computer software and stages of development of computer usage would restrict the implementation of the model. Efforts to promote the management of instruction based on learning styles should proceed according to the unique constraints  at each computing environment and should include an initial emphasis on information storage and retrieval.

A total of 32 students, 16 experimental and 16 control, from four Texas Community Colleges participated in the study. Four occupations, for which the National Occupational Competency Testing Institute (NOCTI) had prepared examinations, were selected. Competencies were identified for each occupation and the work experience was structured, based primarily on the identified competencies. All students were administered the appropriate NOCTI test as a pretest and assigned to training stations, where control students  participated in a traditional unstructured work experience and experimental students participated in a work experience structured around the occupational competencies. At the end of four months all students were administered the NOCTI examination as a posttest. The conclusion showed that a more structured approach is more effective in teaching occupational competencies since students receive occupational knowledge at a higher, more consistent level. Lists of preliminary competencies are appended for air conditioning and refrigeration, printing trades, drafting, and auto mechanics. (Author/NJ)",

From 1974 through 1976, 21 students in four urban high schools were matched with role models on the job. Sixteen of these students retained their jobs. The matches included many different combinations of people of different ages, races, and sexes (a description of the strategies, benefits, and problems encountered during the matching process is included in the report). The students expressed increased self-confidence and satisfaction with supervision, and employers saw gains in students' suitability for the job, acceptance of supervision, and attitudes toward the public. All employers planned to continue the matching  process after the research ended. The problems incurred included a scarcity of jobs, employer reluctance to hire disadvantaged students, unavailability of students for work at hours when needed, need to keep racial balance in businesses, and lack of transportation. Case studies of participating students, project evaluations from teacher-coordinators, employers, and role models, and tabular data summaries provide additional information. (Author/AB)",

In addition, a search was made of RIE and CIJE to determine the most recent evaluation research studies conducted in each state. Through responses to inquiries and the literature search, the type of evaluation and research studies conducted in each state was determined. The various methods of evaluation used were grouped into the eight categories of self-study, visiting team, follow-up, employer-based, cost-benefit, behavioral objective, nonbehavioral objective, and job placement relatedness. Results are presented as discussions in which the literature on each of the eight identified evaluation methods is summarized. A  discussion of process versus product evaluation is also included. Tables indicate the type of evaluation used as reported by the states and also the number of reported research studies conducted in or for the states according to type of evaluation method.

Through the cooperation of the business community, the job placement service acted as an employment agency and also provided students the opportunity to prepare themselves for the world of work through programs focused on employer expectations. Of the 884 graduates using the service during the 3-year period, 613 requested job assistance. Of these, 109 full-time and 208 part-time placements were found. Over 900  other students requested assistance in part-time and summer placements. Students most difficult to place were school dropouts with behavior problems. The cooperation from business leaders, counselors, teachers, administrators, and community resource people contributed to the success of the project. Recommendations are offered for the establishment of similar services. Project forms are appended. (RG)",

Many of today's generation are no longer motivated by extrinsic rewards alone, consequently educators must harness a higher level of needs in order to work constructively with today's youth. There must be more maximizing of human potential, which is possible through career guidance and development. In a society that is in a constant state of flux (due to such factors as technological advances and changing social roles), career guidance must (1) fulfill the need that youth and adults have for reliable and valid information about educational and vocational possibilities, (2) help parents and teachers understand information about students' various characteristics, including assets and weaknesses, and (3) direct  use of new research and practices in guidance and counseling. Career guidance can take place in all settings; however the school environment is of particular importance. Career education can easily be infused into the curriculum, with career guidance taking place through use of the printed word, audio and audio-visual media, and through experience. Also guidance personnel, including both professional workers and support personnel should be responsible for providing the human aspect of the occupational decisionmaking process and should consider personal, interpersonal, and systemic factors influencing a counselee's use of guidance information. Counselors are accountable for the successful integration of students into the adult world of work. With the help of career guidance activities the  increased working marriage of industry and the schools bodes well for the future. (SH)",

Twenty Head Start teachers from the U.S. Virgin Islands, most of them Black, English-speaking high school graduates, were observed during 50 minutes of free play, 20 minutes of group activity and 20 minutes of routines (washing, toileting, meals). The Control Non-Control Scale of the Flanders Interaction Analysis was used in modified form to code verbal and non-verbal teacher controlling  behaviors. The hypothesis was confirmed. Teachers in classrooms with inadequate space are more controlling than teachers with adequate space. Provision of space is a basic tool in helping teachers become more effective. (KS)",

In the middle are schools whose supervisory staff share research findings which have been published. Toward the end are the schools that bring in experts to talk to the teachers and administrators. At any point along this continuum, a breakdown can occur which interferes with the dissemination process. The person directing the research may leave the school, the manner and form in which research is shared may not be conducive to  implementation, or an administrator may invite an expert who does not do a good job of bridging the gap between research and practice.

Performance on the screening test, which consisted of comprehension questions drawn from students' textbooks, correlated highly with the later success or failure of nursing-education students in their particular vocational program. Five replications of this study revealed similar correlations. In addition, over the six years of its  implementation, the failure rate in the nursing program decreased from 45% to 15%. (KS)",

After pilot work and revisions, the battery (PDQ) was administered to 916 entering kindergarten pupils by their teachers, in individual sessions. After testing, follow-up workshops were held with kindergarten teachers to provide suggestions for individualization based on the test results. The effect of the program was evaluated by comparing reading test scores at the end of first grade with those from a comparable population of first graders in the previous year who had not had the kindergarten testing program. Results indicated a significant difference  in mean reading achievement in favor of the experimental group. (AA)",

Although comparisons of pre- and posttest scores revealed that the program was not successful according to established criteria, as a result of the project, the tutoring program in the Dallas Independent School District is being revised to  meet demonstrated needs.

In addition, boys constitute the greatest percentage of those students who are underachieving and failing. This paper discusses the problems of misbehavior, underachievement, and related conditions; explores the two major factors contributing to boys' school-related problems--the home and the school (buildings and facilities, curriculum, materials, methodology, and teachers); and considers what can be done to rectify the problems, including specific ways in which schools and teachers can adjust to the learning styles, behavior patterns, and interests of boys.

To represent intonation patterns, words were printed in three sizes corresponding to stress-pitch levels, and spacing between phrase boundaries was extended to reflect pause points. Reading intoned text was contrasted with reading standard print and with print where word sizes and spaces were varied randomly. Story reading, cloze, sentence recall, and rereading tasks yielded multiple measures of reading behavior in samples of second graders, third graders, and below-grade-level fourth graders. Results indicated that children trained to read intoned print did not outperform the standard  print or random print groups, suggesting that printed intonation cues are useless to beginning readers.

In both studies, sequences of six or eight letters were presented to 80 third-grade and 80 eighth-grade pupils, at the rate of one item every other second or four items per second. In the first study, where recall was either immediate or delayed by five seconds, results for third graders showed no difference in number of items recalled as a function of presentation rate. Immediate recall was, however, slightly favored. For eighth graders, delayed recall was markedly better (perhaps as a result of rehearsal). The second study examined the effect of spoken recall on retention. For both age groups, no overall differences in order or item recall were apparent as a  function of recall modality. At a slow presentation rate, however, eighth graders' spoken recall was poorer than their written recall. Conversely, spoken recall was superior to written recall at the fast presentation rate. Results suggest the presence of an auditory-specific, short-term memory store that holds information according to order of presentation, is subject to decay, and, apparently, is resistant to interference effects.

        "description":"This study examined the effect of reading ability and frequency of object association on picture-verification latency in a group of 40 fifth graders. Subjects received sets of two slides each, the first of which was a sentence in which the subject and object were in either frequent or infrequent association. When the children had read and had understood the slide, they pressed a button which stopped a clock. The second slide, a picture of the objects described either in the relation suggested by the sentence or in a different relation, was then presented. Subjects responded with &quot;same&quot; or &quot;different,&quot; according to the match between sentence and picture. In addition, sentences used to provide the informational context were stated in propositional form (&quot;The horse 'can' jump the  fence&quot;) or indicative form (&quot;The horse 'is' jumping the fence&quot;). According to an assessment of the time it took subjects to respond to the pictures, reading ability and degree of subject/object relationship, as well as interaction of verb form and response type, were significant. Results indicate that pictures consistent with relational presuppositions can be more quickly verified than those in which relational presuppositions cannot be made. (Author/KS)",

        "description":"In the landmark &quot;Gertz&quot; decision, the United States Supreme Court held that, in the interest of protecting libel plaintiffs, the states under certain conditions could define for themselves the appropriate standard of liability for a publisher or broadcaster of defamatory falsehoods. This paper explores several applications of the &quot;Gertz&quot; decision, by various states, in the two years since the opinion was handed down (23 states have cited &quot;Gertz&quot;). The paper concludes that the full impact of &quot;Gertz&quot; will not be known until state courts have had more opportunity to fully interpret the &quot;Gertz&quot; standards in light of the traditional common-law principles of defamation.
